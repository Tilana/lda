•  Total production in the first half of 2016 was 14.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), the 
second  highest  half-year  in  the  Company’s  history.  The  PNG  LNG  Project  produced  at  an 
annualised  rate  of  7.7  MTPA  during  the  half,  significantly  above  the  nameplate  capacity  of  6.9 
MTPA, while the Oil Search-operated  PNG oil  and gas fields contributed 3.52 mmboe net to Oil 
Search, compared to 3.38 mmboe in the previous corresponding period.
•  While sales volumes rose 5% to 15.2  mmboe,  a record for Oil Search, total revenue fell  33% to 
US$580.8 million, driven by materially lower realised commodity prices. Average realised oil and 
condensate  prices  fell  27%  while  LNG  and  gas  prices  were  40%  lower  than  in  the  previous 
corresponding  period.  As  a  result,  despite  an  8%  reduction  in  unit  production  costs  to  a  very 
competitive US$8.21 per boe, reflecting the successful implementation of a range of major cost 
reduction initiatives, net profit after tax for the first half of 2016 fell to US$25.6 million.
•  The Company continued to generate positive operating cash flows during the half. Net operating
cash flow was US$239.2 million, while the EBITDAX margin remained strong, at 65%.
•  At the end of June 2016, the Company had cash of US$780 million and debt of US$4,084 million. 
Including US$748 million of undrawn corporate credit facilities, total liquidity was US$1.53 billion.    
•  A 2016 interim unfranked dividend of one US cent per share was announced, compared to six US 
cents per share in the first half of 2015. The payout ratio of 60% is above our stated policy to pay 
out 35 – 50% of core profit by way of dividends due to rounding.

In May, Oil Search announced an agreed takeover offer for InterOil Corporation (InterOil). A back-
to-back Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Total SA (Total) was also signed, whereby Oil
Oil Search Limited 
Incorporated in Papua New Guinea 
ARBN 055 079 868
Search would sell down part of the InterOil licence interests acquired to Total.  In July, InterOil 
notified  Oil  Search  that  it  intended  to  change  its  recommendation  in  respect  of  the  Oil  Search 
proposal and enter into an Arrangement Agreement with Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil). 
Oil Search decided not to submit a revised bid for InterOil, in light of the terms offered and our 
view  that  the  entry  of  ExxonMobil  into  the  PRL  15  joint  venture  will  increase  the  likelihood  of 
downstream  integration  of  the  Papua  LNG  Project  and  potential  PNG  LNG  Project  expansion. 
Consequently,  the  bid  for  InterOil  and  the  associated  Total  MOU  were  terminated.    In  July,  Oil 
Search received a break fee from ExxonMobil, which more than covers the costs associated with 
the Oil Search offer for InterOil.
•  The  certification  of  the  Elk-Antelope  fields  was  completed  by  two world-class  certifiers  in  July.  
We  believe  that  the  resource  volume  within  these  fields,  together  with  that  identified  in  the 
P’nyang field, is sufficient to underpin at least two new LNG trains.
•  A  Strategy  Refresh  has  recently  commenced.  This  study  is  focused  on  reviewing  the  potential 
options and the value that can be delivered by cooperation between the PNG LNG and Papua LNG 
projects, following confirmation of the InterOil-ExxonMobil transaction, and determining the key 
activities required to underpin the next phase of LNG growth in PNG.
Commenting  on  the  2016  first  half  results,  Oil  Search  Managing  Director,  Peter 
Botten, said:
Excellent performance from operations
“The PNG LNG Project continued to perform well during the first half, producing LNG at an annualised rate 
of approximately 7.7 MTPA, 12% above the nameplate capacity of 6.9 MTPA.  This was achieved despite a 
planned production rate reduction for routine compressor maintenance in April and an unplanned shut-down 
relating  to  the  electrical  generation  control  system  in  May,  the  first  time  the  Project  had  been  completely 
shut-in since production started in mid-2014. Pleasingly, the operator brought the plant back online quickly 
and safely, with production reaching a new monthly high of 8.2 MTPA in June.
During the first half of 2016, 53 LNG cargoes were sold, comprising 45 sold under long-term contracts and 
eight sold on the spot market. Six of the eight spot cargoes were sold to customers in Japan, reflecting the 
desirability of PNG LNG’s high heating value gas to Japanese consumers. 16 cargoes of Kutubu Blend and 
five  naphtha  cargoes  were  also  sold  during  the  half.  As  at  the  end  of  June,  205  LNG  cargoes  had  been 
delivered from the Project since commencing sales, with very high levels of reliability achieved.
Despite the maturity of our oil fields, total operated production was 4% higher than in the first half of 2015. 
This very pleasing performance reflected the ramp up of third party gas exports from SE Gobe to the PNG 
LNG  Project,  successful  reservoir  management  initiatives,  particularly  at  Kutubu  and  Moran,  facilities 
optimisation and other productivity and efficiency initiatives implemented in late 2015 and early 2016, which 
continue to reap rewards.”
Unit production costs reduced to US$8.21/boe
“The cost reduction and performance improvement initiatives implemented during the second half of 2015 
and  the  first  half  of  2016,  have  been  successful  in  driving  costs  down  and  delivering  greater  efficiencies 
across the business.  Unit  rate savings of 15-30% have  been achieved through the renegotiation  of major 
supply  and  services  contracts.  These  initiatives,  together  with  a  restructuring  of  our  support  services
Oil Search 2016 First Half Results – 23 August 2016

2
locations and optimisation of our work force to align with prioritised work programmes, which were completed 
in the first half of 2016, are expected to deliver sustainable savings into the future. During the first half of 
2016, overall unit production costs fell 8% to a very competitive US$8.21 per boe, with an 11% reduction 
achieved for the Company’s operated assets. The Company is continuing to manage costs closely, to ensure 
its competitiveness in a lower oil price environment.”
Profitability impacted by lower commodity prices
“Despite the success of the cost reduction programme, profitability was impacted by the continued slump in 
global oil and gas prices. The average realised oil and condensate price fell 27% while the average realised 
LNG and gas price was 40% lower than in the first half of 2015. LNG prices hit a low point in the second 
quarter  of  2016,  due  to  the  approximate  three  month  lag  between  oil  and  LNG  pricing.  In  addition,  the 
effective tax rate was materially higher, up from 28% in the first half of 2015 to 47%, due to a number of one-
off non-deductible costs, including those related to the InterOil bid. Subject to realised oil prices, the tax rate 
is expected to be below 40% for the 2016 full year.
Shortly after the end of the half year, we received US$60 million from ExxonMobil, representing the agreed 
break fee following a change in support by the InterOil Board from our bid to ExxonMobil’s competing bid. 
While  part  of  the  costs  of  the  proposed  transaction  were  expensed  in  the  first  half,  the  break  fee,  net  of 
US$12  million  to  be  paid  to  Total  under  the  terms  of  the  MOU,  and  the  balance  of  the  costs  will  be 
recognised in the second half of 2016.”
Increasingly likelihood of downstream integration of LNG expansion opportunities in PNG
“A major focus for Oil Search during the first half of 2016 was our bid for InterOil, which, at the time, was 
unanimously  approved  by  both  boards,  and  the  MOU  we  signed  with  Total  for  the  on-sale  of  part  of  the 
InterOil interests.  One of the key drivers for entering into these transactions was the belief that restructuring 
the  PRL  15  joint  venture  would  provide  a  pathway  to  achieving  downstream  integration  between  the 
proposed  Papua  LNG  development  and  the  potential  expansion  of  the  PNG  LNG  Project.  Our  MOU  with 
Total  set  out  the  principles  by  which  Oil  Search  and  Total  would  seek  to  maximise  the  value  for  all 
stakeholders by pursuing these opportunities with the PNG LNG Project and highlighted that equity would be 
available for buyers and potential new participants, such as ExxonMobil, the PNG LNG Project operator.
In July, Oil Search was notified by InterOil that it had received a superior proposal from ExxonMobil. After 
careful  consideration,  we  decided  not  to  submit  a  revised  offer  for  InterOil.  The  consideration  offered  by 
ExxonMobil underscores the potential value that would be created by cooperation between PNG’s two world 
class LNG projects, which we believe is materially enhanced by ExxonMobil’s entry into the Papua LNG joint 
venture.  Statements  subsequently  made  by  ExxonMobil  and  Total  confirm  that  both  majors  are  willing  to 
pursue  opportunities  to  develop  the  projects  in  a  cooperative  and  coordinated  manner.  Based  on  our 
evaluation, superior value accretion for Oil Search shareholders can be achieved by realising the benefits of 
project  integration  through  our  existing  interests  in  PNG  LNG  and  Papua  LNG,  without  dilution  and 
acquisition risk, rather than by bidding a higher value for InterOil.
Oil  Search  believes  that  there  is  sufficient  gas  resource  in  existing  discovered  gas  fields  to  underpin  the 
proven  extra  capacity  of  the  two  existing  PNG  LNG  trains,  as  well  as  at  least  two,  and  possibly  three, 
additional LNG trains if planned appraisal and exploration drilling are successful. This confidence is based 
on our view that there is upside potential in the PNG LNG Foundation fields, which will be verified by the 
recertification  process  of  the  Hides,  Angore  and  Associated  Gas  fields  presently  underway,  as  well  as 
approximately 10 tcf of combined proven and probable contingent (2C) undeveloped gas resource in the Elk-
Antelope and P’nyang fields. The total 2C resource in Elk-Antelope and P’nyang exceeds the 2C resource 
that  underpinned  the  original  PNG  LNG  Project  development  when  that  project  was  sanctioned  in  2009.
Oil Search 2016 First Half Results – 23 August 2016 
www.oilsearch.com

Importantly, proven contingent 1C resources within Elk-Antelope and P’nyang are presently estimated to be 
more than 6 tcf, sufficient to underpin LNG marketing and project financing for two extra trains.
There is gas upside potential from the Antelope 7 appraisal well, due to spud in early October, the Muruk 
exploration well, which is scheduled to commence drilling in the fourth quarter of 2016, and in and around 
P’nyang,  with  P’nyang  South  2  now  scheduled  to  be  drilled  in  2017  following  Muruk.    If  these  wells  are 
successful, there could be sufficient gas to underpin a possible third expansion train.
There  are  a  number  of  commercial models  that  could  be  used  to  deliver  project  integration.  Studying  the 
various options and their relative values is a core component of Oil Search’s Strategy Refresh, a strategic 
review which has recently commenced in light of changes in the global oil and LNG markets as well as the 
bid for InterOil by ExxonMobil and its implications. The conclusions of the Strategy Refresh, expected to be 
completed  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016,  will  form  the  basis  for  Oil  Search  to  commence  a  constructive 
dialogue with our partners on the way forward.
A  cooperative  development  will  drive  capital  and  operating  efficiency  and  potentially  accelerate  the 
development timetable, generating superior returns for Oil Search shareholders, as well as for many other 
stakeholders, including the PNG Government and local landowners.  Assuming ExxonMobil is successful in 
acquiring InterOil, we look forward to commencing discussions regarding a cooperative development agenda 
with both Total and ExxonMobil later this year.”
Interim dividend payment largely consistent with pay-out ratio guidance range
“The Board has approved the payment of an interim unfranked dividend of one US cent per share, compared 
to  the  2015  interim  dividend  of  six  US  cents  per  share.  This  represents  a  dividend  payout  ratio  of  60%, 
higher than the Board’s dividend policy of distributing between 35% and 50% of core profit, due to rounding.
Oil Search shares will trade ex-dividend from 6 September 2016. The record date for the interim dividend 
payment is 7 September 2016 and the payment date is 27 September 2016.
See  Appendix  3A.1  –  Notification  of  Dividend/Distribution  for  more  information  on  the  dividend 
payment.
Safety improvement plan introduced
“During the first half of 2016, Oil Search recorded a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 2.32 per million 
hours worked. This compares to our 2015 TRIR of 1.91 per million hours worked.
Analysis of the incidents experienced during the first half of 2016 has revealed that they were largely limited 
to  a  small  number  of  “hot  spot”  areas.  A  safety  improvement  plan,  aimed  at  delivering  a  substantial 
improvement  in  performance  during  the  second  half  of  2016  and  beyond,  has  been  developed  and 
implementation is underway. The plan, which is already realising results, with the TRIR to the end of July 
falling to 2.04, includes developing an increased focus on situational awareness and will address particularly 
the safety challenges in our civil construction and marine terminal operations.”
Maintaining operating stability in PNG
“After  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  a  number  of  landowners  groups  in  the  Hides  area  commenced  a 
peaceful  protest,  seeking  a  dialogue  with  Government  regarding  progressing  land  title  and  benefits 
distribution issues.
As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of those gathered near one of the producing wellpads, the 
operator curtailed production from the two Hides wells on that pad, which had a temporary minor impact on

daily  production.  Following  constructive  dialogue  between  the  landowner  leaders  and  government 
representatives,  an  agreement  was  signed  which  allowed  some  benefits  to  be  paid  and  a  way  forward 
agreed to address remaining benefits and land ownership issues.  The wells have now been fully restored 
and our production for the full year remains within the recently upgraded guidance range of 28 – 30 mmboe.
We believe that our sustainable development programmes, delivered both directly by Oil Search and through 
the  Oil  Search  Foundation,  are  key  to  helping  maintain  a  stable  operating  environment,  while  improving 
development outcomes for the people of PNG. Oil Search has formed strong relationships with government, 
communities and a range of other public and private organisations in PNG through these programmes, which 
are essential for successful oil and gas operations.
In 2015, a new five-year strategy was developed for the Oil Search Foundation, which has been operating as 
a not-for-profit organisation, supported by Oil Search and other donor agencies, since 2011. Its mandate was 
expanded,  with  two  new  development  streams  -  Leadership  and  Education  and Women’s  Protection  and 
Empowerment – added to run alongside the Foundation’s health programmes.  Recently, we announced that 
the Oil Search Board has approved a grant to the Foundation of US$56 million (K185 million) over five years, 
starting in 2016. Our continued financial commitment highlights both the importance of the Foundation’s work 
to local communities in PNG and our view that conducting business in a socially responsible manner is a 
strategic and moral imperative.”
Looking forward to the second half of 2016 and beyond, Mr Botten said:
“As already highlighted, we have recently commenced a Strategy Refresh.  The key focus of this study will 
be to  further analyse the options for cooperation between the PNG LNG and  Papua LNG  projects and  to 
determine which is the most value accretive for all stakeholders.  In addition, the review will evaluate what 
activities are required to best deliver gas to drive long term growth in PNG. The results of this study will help 
inform our discussions with partners commencing later this  year. In  addition,  a number of key  exploration 
and  appraisal  wells  will  be  drilled  in  the  second  half  of  2016  and  into  2017,  which  will  have  a  significant 
influence on determining whether we are in a two or three train expansion environment.
Over  the  past  year,  we  have  been  systematically  replenishing  our  exploration  portfolio  in  PNG  and  have 
identified  a  number  of  highly  prospective  areas  with material  upside  potential.  In  recent  months,  we  have 
been  offered  and  accepted  one  new  Petroleum  Prospecting  Licence  (PPLs)  and  have  14  other  PPL 
applications at various stages of the regulator’s review process, many of which are in partnership with our 
strategic  partners. Subject  to  an  ongoing  recovery  in  oil  prices,  we  are  planning  to  commence  a  more 
aggressive exploration programme in late 2017, designed to drive long term growth in PNG.
While oil prices appear to have bottomed, we are maintaining our focus on careful capital management and 
driving out costs, to ensure our current commitments and LNG growth opportunities can be funded without 
having  to  access  additional  equity  capital.  Oil  Search  is  fortunate  to  be  financially  well  placed,  having 
production assets that generate solid cash flows at these oil and gas price levels and a strong balance sheet 
and liquidity.”
Guidance for the 2016 full year
“As indicated in our second quarter results, 2016 full year production guidance has been upgraded to 28 – 
30 mmboe, while capital costs are expected to be in the range of US$270 - 315 million, US$45 - 85 million 
lower than prior guidance. This reflects lower spend on PNG power projects, due to delays in moving into 
Front  End Engineering and Design, as  well  as lower than expected capital expenditure on the  PNG LNG 
Project.    Exploration  expenditure  for  the  2016  full  year  is  expected  to  be  between  US$190  million  and 
US$210 million. Activities will continue to be focused on the high returning opportunities available to us in

PNG.  Guidance  for  other  operating  costs  remains  unchanged  at  US$135  –  155  million  (excluding  costs 
associated with the InterOil bid, which will be more than covered by the net break fee of US$48 million, after 
a payment to Total). Guidance is subject to no major operational interruptions being experienced over the 
balance of the year.”

Production and Revenue 
Total production in the first half of 2016 was 14.89 mmboe, or 4% higher than in the corresponding period in 2015 (14.32 mmboe).  
Total revenue of US$580.8 million was 33% lower than the prior period. LNG and gas delivered volumes for the first half of 2016 were 
58,536  billion  Btu,  5%  higher  than  in  the  prior  period,  and  included  the  delivery  of  53  cargoes  of  LNG  (2015:  52  cargoes).    The 
significant decrease in sales revenue during the first half of 2016 was due to lower average realised LNG and gas prices, partially offset 
by higher sales volumes. 
Oil and condensate delivered volumes for the first half of 2016 totalled 4.45 million barrels (mmbbl), 3% higher than the 4.33 mmbbl for 
the corresponding period in 2015, due to higher sales volumes for PNG LNG condensate and PNG oil.
1   mmboe = million barrels of oil equivalent. Gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent using an Oil Search specific conversion factor of 
5,100 scf = 1 boe, which represents a weighted average, based on Oil Search’s reserves portfolio, using the actual calorific value of each gas volume at  
its point of sale.  Note that prior year figures have not been restated.
2  bbl = barrel of oil. 
3  mmBtu = million (106) British thermal units. 
4  N.M = not meaningful.
5  EBITDAX (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, impairment and exploration) is a non-IFRS measure that is presented to provide a more meaningful 
understanding  of  Oil  Search’s  financial  performance.  This  non-IFRS  financial  information  is  derived  from  the  financial  statements,  which  have  been 
subject to review by the Group’s auditor.

Directors’ report (continued)
Production and Revenue (continued) 
Other  revenue,  which  consists  mainly  of  rig  revenue,  electricity,  refinery  and  naphtha  sales  and  infrastructure  tariffs,  decreased  to 
US$29.1 million in the first half of 2016 from US$35.6 million over the corresponding period in 2015. This was predominantly due to 
lower rig income and lower average realised prices for naphtha and refinery sales, partially offset by higher infrastructure tariffs and 
electricity sales from the PNG LNG Project. 
The  average  oil  and  condensate  price  realised  during  the  half-year  was  US$41.61  per  barrel,  27%  lower  than  in  the  prior  period, 
reflecting the lower spot oil prices during the first half of 2016 in comparison to the corresponding period in 2015. The average price 
realised for LNG and gas sales declined 40% to US$6.09 per mmBtu, with the larger decrease compared to oil prices due to the lag 
between LNG contract pricing terms and spot oil prices, which increased during the latter part of the first half of 2016 due to a tightening 
in global oil supply. The company did not establish any oil hedges during the period and remains unhedged to oil price movements.
Production and other operating costs 
Production costs decreased from US$127.5 million in the first half of 2015 to US$122.2 million in the first half of 2016 reflecting the 
successful implementation of the major cost reduction initiatives defined in the second half of 2015. Production costs on a per barrel of 
oil equivalent (boe) basis declined from US$8.90 per boe in the first half of 2015 to US$8.21 per boe.

PNG LNG production unit costs on a per boe basis were US$6.34, 6% lower than the prior period, which reflected the PNG LNG Project 
producing well above nameplate capacity. PNG oil and gas unit production costs per boe for the first half of 2016 were US$14.25, 11% 
lower than in the prior period primarily due to cost reduction initiatives. 
Other operating costs decreased from US$87.8 million in the first half of 2015 to US$83.3 million in the first half of 2016 primarily due to 
lower selling and distribution, corporate, and gas purchase costs and a decrease in royalties and levies mainly due to lower realised 
prices,  partially  offset  by  costs  related  to  PNG  power  projects,  transaction  costs  related  to  the  proposed  InterOil  acquisition  and 
inventory movements.
Depreciation 
Depreciation expense increased from US$200.1 million in the first half of 2015 to $214.2 million in the first half of 2016. 
Depreciation related to the producing assets increased by US$13.2 million to US$203.6 million in the first half of 2016 due to higher 
overall production from the PNG LNG Project and operated oil and gas assets, and slightly higher depreciation rates in the first half of 
2016. On a cost per boe produced basis, the average depreciation rate for the producing assets in the first half of 2016 was US$13.68 
per boe, compared to the first half of 2015 rate of US$13.31 per boe.
Depreciation on other plant and equipment increased by US$0.9 million to US$10.6 million in the first half year of 2016, mainly driven by 
the  introduction  of  a  new  LNG  tanker  in  May  2016  and  a  full  half  year  of  service  for  the  existing  LNG  tanker,  both  of  which  are 
accounted for as finance leases.
Exploration costs expensed 
In  line  with  Oil  Search’s  successful  efforts  accounting  policy,  all  costs  associated  with  unsuccessful  drilling,  seismic  work  and  other 
support costs related to exploration activity were expensed during the half-year and resulted in a pre-tax charge of US$18.9 million. This 
included US$3.4 million attributable to the Strickland 2 well. 
The remaining exploration costs expensed consisted of seismic, geological, geophysical and general and administration expenses.
Net finance costs 
Net finance costs of US$96.3 million in the first half of 2016 were US$4.3 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to a slight 
increase in interest expense for the PNG LNG Project financing and the new finance lease for the PNG LNG marine vessel.
Taxation 
Tax expense on statutory profit in the first half of 2016 was US$22.4 million, compared to US$90.0 million in the corresponding period in 
2015. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 46.8%, significantly higher than in the prior period, primarily due to one-off non-deductible 
costs, including InterOil acquisition-related expenses, business development costs and adjustments to restoration provisions.

Directors’ report (continued)
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
InterOil bid and MOU with Total SA  
In May 2016, Oil Search Limited announced a proposal to acquire 100% of InterOil Corporation (“InterOil”) in a transaction that was 
unanimously approved by the Boards of Oil Search and InterOil. Oil Search also announced the execution of an MOU with Total SA, 
whereby Oil Search would sell down 60% of the interest acquired from InterOil in PRL 15 and 62% of InterOil’s exploration assets to 
Total, subject to closing the InterOil acquisition.
On  18  July  2016,  Oil  Search  was  notified  by  InterOil  that  it  had  received  a  ‘Superior  Proposal’  from  Exxon  Mobil  Corporation  and 
consequently InterOil intended to make a change in its recommendation and enter into an Arrangement Agreement with ExxonMobil. On 
21 July 2016, Oil Search announced that it did not intend to revise its bid. Oil Search has received a US$60 million break fee (of which 
Total  SA  is  entitled  to  20%).    Costs  related  to  this  transaction  have  been  recognised  as  ‘Other  expenses’  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income for the half-year ended 30 June 2016.
Dividends 
On 22 August 2016, the directors approved the payment of an interim unfranked dividend of US 1 cent per ordinary share (2015: US 6 
cents interim dividend) to ordinary shareholders in respect of the half-year ended 30 June 2016. The due date for payment is 27 
September 2016 to all holders of ordinary shares on the Register of Members on 7 September 2016. The Company’s dividend 
reinvestment plan will remain suspended for the interim dividend. Dividends paid and declared during the year are recorded in note 9 to

2  Segment reporting 
(a) Information about reportable segments 
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive management team 
(the chief operating decision makers) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. During the period, the Group 
revised  its  reportable  segments  to  align  with  the  Group’s  organisational  structure,  to  reflect  the  interdependencies  between  the  PNG  LNG 
Project and the producing oil fields as well as to recognise the reduced materiality of activity in the Middle East and North Africa region. The 
comparative balances have been restated to reflect the current period presentation. The new reportable segments are:
PNG Business Unit (“PNG BU”) 
Development  and  production  including  sale  of  liquefied  natural  gas,  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  condensate,  naphtha  and  other  refined 
products from the Group's interest in its operated assets for PNG crude oil and Hides gas-to-electricity operations and from the Group’s 
interest in the PNG LNG Project. 
Exploration 
Exploration and evaluation of crude oil and gas through the Group's licence interests in Papua New Guinea, Republic of Yemen, Republic 
of Iraq and Tunisian Republic. 
Other 
This segment includes the Group's ownership of drilling rigs, activity related to the Group’s contribution to power solutions in PNG and 
corporate overheads. Net finance costs (excluding the PNG LNG project financing) and income taxes are managed at a Group level.
(b) Segment information provided to the executive management team 
The  Group's  executive  management  team  evaluates  the  financial  performance  of  the  Group  and  its  segments  principally  with  reference  to 
earnings  before  interest  and  tax,  and  capital  expenditure  on  exploration  and  evaluation  assets,  oil  and  gas  assets,  and  property,  plant  and 
equipment.

InterOil bid and MOU with Total SA  
In May 2016, Oil Search Limited announced a proposal to acquire 100% of InterOil Corporation (“InterOil”) in a transaction that was 
unanimously approved by the Boards of Oil Search and InterOil. Oil Search also announced the execution of an MOU with Total SA, 
whereby Oil Search would sell down 60% of the interest acquired from InterOil in PRL 15 and 62% of InterOil’s exploration assets to 
Total, subject to closing the InterOil acquisition.
On  18  July  2016,  Oil  Search  was  notified  by  InterOil  that  it  had  received  a  ‘Superior  Proposal’  from  Exxon  Mobil  Corporation  and 
consequently InterOil intended to make a change in its recommendation and enter into an Arrangement Agreement with ExxonMobil. On 
21 July 2016, Oil Search announced that it did not intend to revise its bid. Oil Search has received a US$60 million break fee (of which 
Total  SA  is  entitled  to  20%).    Costs  related  to  this  transaction  have  been  recognised  as  ‘Other  expenses’  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income for the half-year ended 30 June 2016.
Dividends 
On 22 August 2016, the directors approved the payment of an interim unfranked dividend of US 1 cent per ordinary share (2015: US 6 
cents  interim  dividend)  to  ordinary  shareholders  in  respect  of  the  half-year  ended  30  June  2016.  The  due  date  for  payment  is  27 
September  2016  to  all  holders  of  ordinary  shares  on  the  Register  of  Members  on  7  September  2016.  The  Company’s  dividend 
reinvestment plan will remain suspended for the interim dividend. Dividends paid and declared during the half-year are recorded in note 
9 to the financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report 
to the members of Oil Search Limited
We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  half-year  financial  report  of  Oil  Search  Limited,  which 
comprises the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, and the 
condensed  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive  income,  condensed  consolidated  statement 
of cash flows, condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the half-year ended on 
that  date,  selected  explanatory  notes  and  the  directors’  declaration  of  the  consolidated  entity 
comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the end of the half-year or from time to 
time during the half-year as set out on pages  9 to 19.
Director’s Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the half-
year financial report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (including the 
interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee) and the Papua New Guinea Companies Act 
1997.  This  responsibility  includes  establishing  and  maintaining  internal  control  relevant  to  the 
preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  half-year  financial  report  that  is  free  from  material 
misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error;  selecting  and  applying  appropriate  accounting 
policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 
2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, 
in order to state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any 
matter  that  makes  us  believe  that  the  half-year  financial  report  is  not  in  accordance  with  the 
Papua New Guinea Companies Act 1997 including: giving a true and fair view of the consolidated 
entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-year ended on that 
date;  and  complying  with  International  Accounting  Standard  IAS  34  Interim  Financial  Reporting 
and the Papua New Guinea Companies Act 1997. As the auditor of Oil Search Limited, ISRE 2410 
requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial 
report.
A  review  of  a  half-year  financial  report  consists  of  making  enquiries,  primarily  of  persons 
responsible  for  financial  and  accounting  matters,  and  applying  analytical  and  other  review 
procedures.  A  review  is  substantially  less  in  scope  than  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with 
International Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes 
us  believe  that  the  half-year  financial  report  of  Oil Search  Limited  is  not  in  accordance  with  the 
Papua New Guinea Companies Act 1997, including:
(a)  giving  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the consolidated entity’s  financial  position as  at  30  June  2016
and of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
20
(b)  complying with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the
Papua New Guinea Companies Act 1997.
Other Information
We  have  no  interest  in  the  company  or  any  relationship  other  than  that  of  the  auditor  of  the 
company.
