Our Company
We are one of the world’s largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for over 30 years have been
a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by oilfield service and exploration and
production (“E&P”) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. Fairmount Santrol offers
the broadest range of proppants available in the market today, including high quality sand and a spectrum of
resin coated products, all of which exceed American Petroleum Institute (“API”) specifications. Additionally,
for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies have provided high quality sand-based products,
strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to end users in the foundry, glass, building products,
and sports and recreation markets (collectively the Industrial and Recreational, or the “I&R” markets). We
believe our two primary market segments are complementary. Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers
across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the economic recovery of our reserve base.
As one of the nation’s longest continuously operating mining organizations, we have developed a strong
commitment to environmental stewardship and to the three pillars of Sustainable Development: People,
Planet and Prosperity. Our strong commitment to safety is reflected in the health and safety of our employees
and is illustrated by having achieved a lost-time incident rate that is less than half the industry average. From
2011 through June 30, 2014, our employees have demonstrated our commitment to our communities by
donating approximately 36,000 hours of company-paid volunteer time, as well as significant personal
volunteer time, into the communities in which we live and operate. We are focused on environmental
stewardship, and ten of our facilities now generate zero waste to landfills. Additionally, we have successfully
executed annual initiatives to reduce our carbon emissions and have planted over 225,000 trees since 2011 in
order to offset our Tier I and Tier II carbon emissions. We believe adhering to sustainable development
principles is not only the right thing to do, but also results in a higher level of engagement and commitment
from our employees, better relationships with our communities and, as a result, a stronger base from which
to pursue profitable growth over the long-term. Abiding by these guiding principles, our corporate motto is
“Do Good. Do Well.”
We began investing in large scale proppant production capacity in the early 1980s, leveraging our early
industry relationships with Halliburton and a predecessor company to Baker Hughes. Since then, our
business, and particularly our Proppant Solutions segment, has grown significantly. Today we have vertically
integrated operations that combine mining, sand processing, and resin manufacturing and coating operations
with a broad logistics network and state-of-the-art research and development capabilities. Our ability to
leverage our integrated asset base to provide comprehensive proppant solutions has allowed us to become a
long-term, trusted partner to our customers.

Our primary attributes include:
•
•
•
Sand Reserves and Processing Assets. We have one of the largest sand reserves and processing asset bases
in the industry, including, as of December 31, 2013, 798.2 million tons of proven mineral reserves, 11 active sand
processing facilities with 12.3 million tons of annual sand processing capacity, a resin manufacturing facility and
11 coating facilities with 2.4 million tons of annual coating capacity. From 2009 to 2013, we expanded our annual
raw frac sand and coating capacities by approximately 6.0 million and 1.5 million tons, respectively, through a
combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our coating facilities include operations in Mexico, Denmark and
China, through which we serve international oil and gas markets.
Product Delivery. We are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America’s major oil and gas
producing basins and we also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge and trucks to reach our customers
in certain basins. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 46 proppant distribution terminals with
significant associated storage, 32 of which exclusively handle our products. Since 2011, we have developed or
acquired 24 distribution terminals, providing significant additional annual transloading capacity. We also service
I&R end markets through seven additional terminals. As of August 15, 2014, we had a fleet of over 8,500 railcars
and expect this fleet to grow to over 13,000 through 2016. By the end of the third quarter of 2014, we also expect
to have expanded our unit train capabilities to three production facilities and three in-basin terminals, which we
expect to reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet.
Customers. We currently have approximately 80 proppant customers, including the largest U.S. pressure
pumping companies, and a total of nearly 850 customers across all end markets. Our goal is to create long-term,
partnering relationships with our customers. We sell product on a purchase order basis and through supply
agreements. The majority of our proppant supply agreements have market-based pricing and volumetric
provisions based on our customer’s requirements, which we believe has strengthened our customer relationships
over multiple market cycles.
Innovation. We have an established history of proppant innovation and we continue to make substantial
•
Innovation. We have an established history of proppant innovation and we continue to make substantial
investments in engineering, research and development and technical marketing. We pioneered the manufacturing
and use of resin coated proppant and continue to introduce new and innovative products. For example
PowerProp, our coated product with the greatest crush resistance, has characteristics competitive with
lightweight ceramics. We are currently field testing a brand new technology, Propel SSP. This proppant transport
technology is a new proppant category in which a polymer, wrapped around sand or ceramic, swells upon contact
with water. The shear-stable polymer suspends the proppant in water, transporting each grain farther and higher
into fractures. Polymer breaking occurs with conventional chemistry. This better transport expands the
hydrocarbon drainage radius with a maximized propped fracture area to increase ultimate recovery.
We are experiencing high demand for our products and our business is currently experiencing significant
growth. Our revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% and 25% since
2004 and 2009, respectively. Since 2011, our revenues have grown at a rate of 4% as the market for resin-
coated products softened. We have seen considerable strengthening in both the raw and resin-coated markets
in 2014, and our revenues for the first six months of this year are up by 40% compared to the same period last
year (please see “Results of Operations” beginning on page 47 for further discussion of factors impacting our
revenue growth).
For the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold over 7.5 million tons, generated $988 million in revenues,
$293 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $105 million of net income. We cannot provide any assurance that we
will achieve these growth rates or margins in the future. For a definition of “Adjusted EBITDA” and a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), please read “—Summary
Historical Consolidated Financial and Operating Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 10.

Our Competitive Strengths
2
We believe that we are well positioned to execute our strategy based on the following competitive strengths:
A Leading Proppant Producer; Broadest Product Suite. We have a broad suite of products that address more
than 90% of the proppant market. According to PacWest Consulting Partners, we were the second largest
supplier of raw frac sand and the largest supplier of resin coated sand in 2013, based on our production
capacity and coating capacity, respectively. Our raw sand product suite includes all mesh sizes of high
performing API-spec Northern White frac sand and our branded API-spec Texas Gold brown frac sand, which
enjoys a delivered cost advantage to certain basins, including the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin. Our
portfolio of resin coated products provides a range of strength, flowback and conductivity characteristics. Our
product breadth allows us to offer a comprehensive proppant solution across a broad range of well
characteristics and our scale provides us with the flexibility to fill large individual orders, often on short
notice. As proppant consumption per well has increased, and completion solutions are increasingly tailored,
we believe that our scale and product breadth provide us with a competitive advantage.
Industry’s Largest Captive Terminal Footprint and Broadest Logistics Capabilities. In recent years, oilfield
service companies have increasingly sought proppant suppliers with logistics capabilities to deliver product
in-basin. We sell our proppants directly to customers in all of North America’s major oil and gas producing
basins through our 46 proppant distribution terminals, the largest logistics network in the industry. In 2013,
approximately 80% of our proppant volume was sold in-basin at one of our distribution terminals, compared
to approximately 65% in 2012. We ship our products via North America’s Class I railroads in our fleet of more
than 8,500 railcars as of August 15, 2014, which includes approximately 790 railcars made available to us by
our customers. By the third quarter of 2014, we expect to have expanded our unit train capabilities to three of
our processing facilities and three of our in-basin terminals. We expect these unit train capabilities will reduce
our freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet. We also have the flexibility to ship our product
via barge and truck to multiple basins. Importantly, over 70% of our terminal capacity exclusively handles our
products. Taken together, we believe the significant scale our distribution network, its geographic scope, and
our captive terminal strategy provide us with a competitive advantage.
Focus on Innovation and New Product Development. We have a history of collaborating with our customers to
develop innovative solutions to enhance the effectiveness of well completions, from conventional wells to the
most complex, multi-stage, horizontal wells. Our vertically integrated model allows us to participate in each
phase of proppant development, manufacturing and delivery and provides us a unique perspective into the
current and future needs of our customers. Our technical sales team works closely with market participants to
demonstrate the value proposition of our performance proppants in order to stimulate market demand. In
1976, our predecessor pioneered the development of resin coated proppants and we have been issued
numerous related patents. Our product developments include OptiProp, SLC, THS, PowerProp and CoolSet,
each with uniquely tailored down-hole performance characteristics. After acquiring the technology that
underlies Propel SSP in May 2013, our team worked to further refine the product’s technology and
manufacturing technique. We have successfully produced and shipped Propel SSP in commercial quantities
to several key customers who are currently testing the product in field trials.
Trusted Partner to Our Customers. We are a trusted partner and have significant long-term relationships with
each of the four largest U.S. pressure pumping companies, who together represent approximately 65% of the
market, as well as many small and mid-sized oilfield service companies. These customer relationships are
driven by our ability to enhance our customers’ operations and profitability by delivering a full suite of high-
quality proppant products, where, when and as-needed. These benefits also extend to the E&P companies
serviced by our service company customers, who directly benefit from the enhanced well productivity that our
products offer. We believe our customers value the ability of our substantial scale, product diversity and
extensive logistics network to meet their evolving proppant needs.

Efficient Operations and Economies of Scale Support Strong Cash Flow Generation. Our vertically integrated
operations, low production costs and low maintenance capital expenditures have enabled us to be profitable
and generate positive cash flows over an extended period. We own a substantial majority of our reserves, and
our processing plants are located on or in close proximity to rail access, reducing the need for on-road
transportation and minimizing product movement costs. Our integrated logistics management expertise and
geographically advantaged facility network enables us to reliably ship products by the most cost-effective
method available. We believe our significant and growing cash flow will enable us to continue to invest in
additional sand production, processing, coating and terminal facilities as well as research and development
for new products.
Experienced Management Team Aligned with Stockholders. We have an experienced leadership team with
extensive industry knowledge and a proven track record of profitable growth. Our executive management team
has developed new product offerings and process technologies, and has grown our business through
greenfield mine development, capacity expansions, acquisitions and investments in logistics infrastructure.
Most of our executive management team has been at Fairmount Santrol for 20 years or more, and as of
December 31, 2013 our revenue had grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 14% and 25%
since 1994 and 2009, respectively. Our founders remain active advisors to our management and are members
of our board of directors. Pro forma for this offering, our management, employees and founders will own
approximately     % of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, our executive management team and our
employees are aligned with our investors and highly incentivized to pursue long-term, profitable growth and a
high return on capital deployed.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to create long-term and sustainable value for our stakeholders. We intend to pursue this
objective through the execution of the following strategies:
Increase Reserves and Processing Capacity. We have historically grown our reserves and mining and
processing capacities by developing greenfield sites, expanding existing facilities and acquiring operating
assets and reserves. From 2009 to 2013, we expanded our annual raw frac sand capacity by approximately
6.0 million tons and our annual coating capacity by 1.5 million tons. Currently, we believe our customers’
demand for our products exceeds our production capacity. Accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in
production capacity and new reserves. In 2013, we acquired an idled 1.0 million ton per year frac sand
processing facility in Brewer, Missouri from FTS International Services, LLC (“FTSI”) and expect to resume
operations at this facility within the next six months. We also expect to increase annual frac sand production
capacity at a current facility by 1.5 million tons by the end of the first quarter of 2016. In addition to these
expansions, we control, or have an option to control, additional reserves on four properties (three with
Northern White reserves, one with Texas Gold) and expect to develop one or two frac sand facilities on these
greenfield sites by mid-2016. In order to ensure that we have adequate capacities and reserves to meet future
demand, we have an active pipeline of expansion opportunities in varying stages of development. We
currently have 2.4 million tons of annual coating capacity and are in the process of expanding these
capacities by an additional 0.8 million tons per year by the fourth quarter of 2015. We will continue to evaluate
the opportunity to expand coating capacity based on market demand for coated products.
Expand Logistics Capabilities. Since 2011, we have developed or acquired 24 distribution terminals,
providing 13.1 million tons of additional annual transloading capacity. We will continue to invest in terminals,
storage and rail infrastructure as our customers continue to demand more product delivered closer to
producing basins. We will also continue to enhance our unit train capabilities to reduce freight costs and
improve cycle times for our railcar fleet. Since 2009, we have increased our railcar fleet by approximately
140% and expect to increase the size of our railcar fleet by over 35% through the second half of 2015 to
accommodate our growing customer demands.

Increase Market Penetration of Our Resin Coated Proppants. We believe that resin coated proppants offer
compelling performance advantages relative to other proppants. Our field data indicates that high quality
resin coated proppants enhance oil and gas reservoir conductivity compared to raw sand and are a cost-
effective alternative to lightweight ceramic proppants. Field data also indicate that resin coated proppants
reduce proppant flowback. Our resin coating capacity is the largest in the industry, providing our customers
enhanced assurance of supply. Due to superior performance and value added formulation and manufacturing
processes, sales of our resin coated products generate a higher per ton profit as compared to our raw frac
sand. We will continue to work with market participants by hosting technical sales meetings, obtaining field
data, and producing scientific papers which highlight the value proposition of resin coated proppant.
Through these efforts, we will seek to increase overall market penetration of our resin coated proppant.
Develop and Commercialize High Performance Proprietary Proppants. We pioneered the manufacturing and
use of resin coated proppants and have a history of developing innovative technologies that increase the
effectiveness of downhole completions, from conventional wells to the most complex, multi-stage horizontal
wells. In 2012, we made a significant investment in a new state-of-the-art research and development facility
and strengthened our team of scientists, material engineers and process engineers focused on developing
innovative and proprietary proppants. As a result of our commitment, our new product development record is
strong. For example, we successfully developed and commercialized PowerProp, a patented resin coated
sand proppant with characteristics competitive with lightweight ceramic proppants, and CoolSet, a resin
coated sand proppant that works at low temperatures with no chemical activators. Additionally, we are
currently conducting field trials for Propel SSP after developing a commercialized processing capability and
expect full commercial launch by early 2015. We are in constant dialogue with our customers regarding
evolving product needs and have a number of new products in various stages of development.
Execute all of our Corporate Initiatives with a Commitment to Customers, Employees and Communities. Our
corporate culture emphasizes People, Planet and Prosperity, and our sustainability strategy defines our
approach to operations and community engagement. We work to minimize our environmental impact and
continue to find ways to reduce waste while also reducing operating costs. We are honored to receive
recognition from our communities for our focus on sustainable mining practices, reclamation and community
investment. We believe that positive community engagement is both a privilege and a responsibility, and that
it enhances our ability to recruit and retain employees, obtain mining and other operating permits and
strengthen relationships with our customers. Our corporate motto is “Do Good. Do Well” and we intend to
continue to execute our growth strategy with a focus on sustainable development.
Industry Trends
Over the past decade, E&P companies have increasingly focused on exploiting the vast hydrocarbon reserves
contained in North America’s oil and gas reservoirs. Using advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling
and hydraulic fracturing, North American production of oil and gas has grown rapidly as the development of
horizontal drilling technologies has evolved. More recently, E&P companies are increasing their focus on
optimizing the use of proppant as a critical component of these efforts to improve well productivity and
maximize their returns on invested capital.
This focus on efficiency and profitability has led to new development techniques, such as increased use of
pad drilling which results in a greater number of wells drilled per rig, and incorporating longer lateral lengths
and shorter intervals between frac stages, which results in more fracturing stages per well. In addition, the
amount of proppant used per stage has increased dramatically, compounding the increase in total demand for
proppant. In recent months, individual wells have been completed with more than 6,000 tons of proppant,
which is the equivalent of 60 railcars or 240 truckloads. This represents a several fold increase in large scale
completions from just a few years ago.

Both E&P companies as well as oilfield service providers with whom they contract, are more precisely
selecting the type and volume of proppants employed to optimize conductivity and improve well productivity.
Specifications for proppant type and quantity can be made by the E&P companies, the oilfield service
providers or collaboratively. These specifications are resulting in not only the use of increasing amounts of
proppant per well, they are also incorporating a broader selection of proppant types, a wider range of mesh
sizes, and a selection of high performance proppants to tailor the proppant solution to the specific geologic
characteristics of the well. Furthermore, both E&P companies and oilfield service providers are investing in
value-added proppants when the improvement in well production and efficiencies justifies the increased
proppant investment. These recent trends are resulting in increased demand for resin coated proppants,
which provides enhanced performance characteristics relative to raw sand but at a lower cost than ceramic
proppants.
As a result of these trends, according to The Freedonia Group, an international business research company,
U.S. demand for all proppants has increased rapidly, growing at an average annual rate of 26% from 2008 to
2013, when proppant sales reached more than 31 million tons. The Freedonia Group estimates that total
annual proppant sales will exceed 49 million tons in 2018 and 74 million tons by 2023. They also estimate that
resin coated sands and other value added products will comprise a growing share of the overall proppant
market. The market for resin coated sand is expected to grow 10.5% annually through 2018 as compared to
9.3% for raw frac sand and 9.0% for ceramic proppants according to the Freedonia Group’s estimates.
As demand for sand-based proppants has increased dramatically in recent years, the supply of quality API-
spec raw frac sand has struggled to keep pace, resulting, at times, in a supply-demand disparity. While a
number of existing and new proppant vendors have announced supply expansions and greenfield projects,
we do not expect the magnitude of these supply expansions to fully meet the expected growth in demand.
There are numerous key constraints to increasing raw frac sand production on an industry-wide basis,
including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the difficulty of finding frac sand deposits that meet API specifications;
the difficulty of securing contiguous frac sand reserves large enough to justify the capital investment required to
develop a processing facility;
the challenges of identifying reserves with the above characteristics that are either located in close proximity to
oil and gas reservoirs or have rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins;
the hurdles of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits
from the proper authorities;
local opposition to the development of mining facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road
transportation, including moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in multiple counties in Wisconsin and Minnesota
which hold potential sand reserves; and
proximity to logistics infrastructure and the ability to develop comprehensive logistics capabilities.
E&P companies’ and oilfield service providers’ preferences and expectations have also been evolving in
recent years. A proppant vendor’s logistics capabilities have become an important differentiating factor when
competing for business, on both a spot and contract basis. Proppant consumers have an increasing
preference for convenient in-basin proppant delivery capability. We believe that, over time, the largest
proppant customers will prefer to consolidate their purchases across a smaller group of suppliers with robust
logistics capabilities and a broad offering of high performance proppants.
Risk Factors
Investing in our common stock involves risks that include the demand for sand-based proppants and other
risks. For a discussion of these risks and other considerations that could negatively affect us, including risks
related to this offering and our common stock, see “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

We have a long history of employee ownership as well as ownership by financial sponsors. Our current
ownership is comprised of employees, including members of our management team and our employee stock
bonus plan, our founders, other non-employee stockholders and ASP FML Holdings, LLC (“ASP FML”), an
affiliate of American Securities LLC (“American Securities”). American Securities is a leading U.S. middle-
market private equity firm that invests in market-leading North American companies. American Securities
currently has over $10 billion of assets under management and is investing from its sixth fund. American
Securities focuses its core investments in the industrial sector including general industrial, aerospace and
defense, agriculture, environmental, recycling paper and packaging, power and energy, and specialty
chemicals. American Securities has a proven track record of successfully working with management teams to
develop and implement strategies for sustained profitability.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or “JOBS
Act.” For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike other public companies, we will not be
required to:
•
•
•
•
•
provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of
internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB,
requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be
required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer;
comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the Securities and Exchange
Commission determines otherwise;
provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or
obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We will cease to be an “emerging growth company” upon the earliest of:
•
•
•
•
when we have $1.0 billion or more in annual revenues;
when we have at least $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates;
when we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or
the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or
revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are
choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period and, as a result, will comply with new or revised
accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-
emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
Stock Split
On                     , 2014, we amended and restated our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to effect a          for          stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. For

(1) Basic and diluted earnings per share are not disclosed for 2009 and 2010 since they are not considered meaningful
for the periods prior to the AS Group Acquisition.
(2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income, see “—Non GAAP Financial Measures” below.
(3) Segment contribution margin is not available for the year ended December 31, 2009.
(4) The reduction in equity in 2010 resulted from our purchase of treasury stock in connection with the AS Group
Acquisition.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion, and
amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation,
management fees and reimbursement of expenses to sponsor, transaction expenses, impairment of assets,
loss on extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other non-cash income or expenses.
Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more
effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to
period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure.
Disclosure in this prospectus of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are “non-GAAP financial measures,” as
defined under the rules of the SEC, are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not
required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered
as alternatives to net income, cash flow provided by operating activities or any other performance measure
derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed
to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are included in this prospectus because they are key metrics used by management to assess our
operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our lenders to evaluate our compliance with
covenants. Additionally, performance targets associated with our annual incentive plans and stock-based
compensation vesting targets are tied to our Adjusted EBITDA.
We believe these measures are meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial
performance. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily measures of our ability to fund our
cash needs, we understand that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties as measures of financial performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to
the similarly titled measure reported by other companies.

RISK FACTORS
This offering and an investment in our common stock involve a high degree of risk. You should carefully
consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this
prospectus, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually
occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially
and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose
all or part of your investment in our common stock.
Risks Related to Our Business
Our business and financial performance depend on the level of activity in the oil and gas industries.
Approximately 87% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were derived from sales to
companies in the oil and gas industry. As a result, our operations are materially dependent on the levels of
activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production. More specifically, the demand for the
proppants we produce is closely related to the number of oil and gas wells completed in geological
formations where sand-based proppants are used in fracturing activities. These activity levels are affected by
both short- and long-term trends in oil and gas prices, among other factors.
In recent years, oil and gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development and production
activity, have experienced significant fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political and military events,
including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price and volume
volatility. Furthermore, the availability of key resources that impact drilling activity have experienced
significant fluctuations and could impact product demand.
A prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and gas exploration,
development, production and well completion activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand
for the proppants we produce. Such a decline would likely have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently
available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, including the repeal of the percentage
depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation. Any
future decreases in the rate at which oil and gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to the
passage of legislation, increased governmental regulation leading to limitations or prohibitions on
exploration and drilling activity, including hydraulic fracturing, or other factors, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, even in a stronger oil natural gas price environment.
Increasing logistics costs, a lack of dependability or availability of transportation services or infrastructure
and geographic shifts in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Transportation and handling costs are a significant component of the total delivered cost of our products. In
many instances, transportation costs can represent 70 to 80% of the delivered cost of frac sand. The high
relative cost of transportation could favor suppliers located in close proximity to the customer. In addition, as
we continue to expand our sand-based proppant production, we will need increased investment in
transportation infrastructure, including terminals and railcars. We contract with truck, rail, ship and barge
services to move sand-based proppants from our production facilities to distribution terminals. Labor
disputes, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events, an increasingly tight railcar
leasing market, increased railcar congestion and other changes to rail freight systems could interrupt or limit
available transportation services or result in a significant increase in transportation service rates. Increased
costs resulting from these types of events that we are not able to pass on to our customers could impair our
ability to deliver our products economically to our customers or to expand our markets. Accordingly, because
we are so dependent on rail
Table of Contents
13
infrastructure, if there are disruptions of the rail transportation services utilized by us or our customers, and
we or our customers are unable to find alternative transportation providers to transport our products, our
business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
A significant portion of our distribution infrastructure is located in or near oil and gas producing areas. A
shift in demand away from areas where we have significant distribution infrastructure or relocation of our
customers’ businesses to areas farther from our plants or distribution infrastructure could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations are dependent on timely securing and maintaining various permits and approvals from
governmental authorities and other third parties.
We hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals
authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to
deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing
permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected
facility. Furthermore, state and local governments could impose a moratorium on mining operations in
certain areas. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary
environmental or other permits, including air permits for our resin coated manufacturing, and water rights or
approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our facilities are located near
existing and proposed third-party industrial operations that could affect our ability to fully extract, or the
manner in which we extract, the mineral reserves to which we have mining rights.
We may be adversely affected by decreased or shifted demand for sand-based proppants or the development
of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.
Frac sand and resin coated sand are proppants used in the completion and re-completion of oil and gas wells
through the process of hydraulic fracturing. A significant shift in demand from sand-based proppants to other
proppants, or a shift in demand from higher-margin sand-based proppants to lower-margin sand-based
proppants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. The development and use of new technology for effective alternative proppants, or the
development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in
demand for the sand-based proppants we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Our proppant sales are subject to fluctuations in market pricing.
Substantially all of our supply agreements involving the sale of sand-based proppants have market-based
pricing mechanisms. Accordingly, in periods with decreasing prices, our results of operations may be lower
than if our agreements had fixed prices. In periods with increasing prices, our agreements permit us to
increase prices; however, our customers may elect to cease purchasing our sand-based proppants if they do
not agree with our price increases or are able to find alternative, cheaper sources of supply. Furthermore,
certain of our supply agreements contain most favored nation clauses that may prevent us from capturing
current market prices in an increasing price environment. These pricing provisions may result in significant
variability in our results of operations and cash flows from period to period.
Changes in supply and demand dynamics could also impact market pricing for proppants. A number of
existing frac sand providers and new market entrants have recently announced reserve acquisitions,
processing capacity expansions and greenfield projects. In periods where sources of supply of raw frac sand
exceed market demand, market prices for frac sand may decline and our results of operations and cash flows
may decline or be volatile or otherwise be adversely affected.

We may not be able to complete greenfield development or expansion projects or, if we do, we may not
realize the expected benefits.
Any greenfield development or expansion project requires us to raise substantial capital and obtain numerous
state and local permits. A decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial
delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project. In
addition, if the demand for our products declines during the period we experience delays in raising capital or
completing the permitting process, we may not realize the expected benefits from our greenfield facility or
expansion project. Furthermore, our new or modified facilities may not operate at designed capacity or may
cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to complete greenfield development or expansion projects
or to complete them on a timely basis and in turn grow our business could adversely affect our business and
results of operations.
We rely upon trade secrets, contractual restrictions and patents to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to
protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and protecting our rights or
defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.
Our commercial success depends on our proprietary information and technologies, know-how and other
intellectual property. Because of the technical nature of our business, we rely on patents, trade secrets,
trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights, particularly with respect to
our resin coated products. The measures we take to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property
rights may be insufficient. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our existing intellectual property
rights could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. It is possible that our
competitors or others could independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain
access to our unpatented technologies. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from
competing with us. As a result, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, third parties
or our employees may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property
rights, which could also harm our business and results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of
intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.
In addition, third parties may claim that our products infringe or otherwise violate their patents or other
proprietary rights and seek corresponding damages or injunctive relief. Defending ourselves against such
claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. An adverse outcome in
any such litigation could subject us to significant liability to third parties (potentially including treble
damages) or temporary or permanent injunctions prohibiting the manufacture or sale of our products, the use
of our technologies or the conduct of our business. Any adverse outcome could also require us to seek
licenses from third parties (which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all) or to make substantial
one-time or ongoing royalty payments. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential
customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. In
addition, we may not have insurance coverage in connection with such litigation and may have to bear all
costs arising from any such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. Any of
these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
The development and marketing of Propel SSP may prove to be unsuccessful.
In April 2013, we acquired intellectual property rights to self-suspending proppant technology which led to the
development of Propel SSP. We are currently conducting field trials on Propel SSP and are attempting to
secure a patent for this technology. The technology supporting Propel SSP is still unproven. Although the
results of initial field trials have been encouraging, additional testing ultimately may demonstrate that the
product is ineffective or not commercially viable. A failure to successfully develop Propel SSP for commercial
application would result in a significant unrecouped investment and the failure to realize certain anticipated
benefits from this product launch, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. For more information on Propel SSP, please read
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”

Our future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to
appropriately react to potential fluctuations in demand for and supply of sand-based proppants.
We operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by several large, national producers and a
larger number of small, regional or local producers. Competition in the industry is based on price,
consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of
supply, breadth of product offering and technical support. In the proppant business, we compete with
producers such as Badger Mining Corporation, CARBO Ceramics Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP, Hi-Crush
Partners, LP, Momentive Performance Materials Inc., Preferred Sands LLC, Unimin Corporation and U.S.
Silica Holdings, Inc. Certain of our large competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we
do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production facilities that are located closer to key
customers than ours.
We also compete with smaller, regional or local producers. In recent years there has been an increase in the
number of small producers servicing the sand-based proppants market which could result in increased
competition and pricing pressure in certain market conditions. In addition, oil and gas exploration and
production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could acquire their own sand
reserves, expand their existing sand-based proppant production capacity or otherwise fulfill their own
proppant requirements and existing or new sand-based proppant producers could add to or expand their
sand-based proppants production capacity, which could increase competition in the proppant industry. We
may not be able to compete successfully against either our larger or smaller competitors in the future, and
competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
A large portion of our sales is generated by a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant
reduction in purchases by, our largest customers could adversely affect our operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2013 and the six months ended June 30, 2014, our top two proppant
customers, Halliburton and FTSI, collectively accounted for approximately 30% and 36% of our sales,
respectively. These customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of our sand-based proppants in
the future due to a variety of reasons. Over the course of our relationships, we have sold proppant to
Halliburton and FTSI on a purchase order basis and pursuant to supply agreements. We currently have supply
agreements with both customers that contain customary termination provisions for bankruptcy related events
and uncured breaches of the applicable agreement. The Halliburton supply agreement may also be terminated
for unresolved pricing disputes. If any of our major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases
purchasing our sand-based proppants and we are not able to generate replacement sales of sand-based
proppants into the market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected for a short-term period until such time as we generate replacement sales in the market.
We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our
customers could adversely affect our financial results.
We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of
whose operations are concentrated in a single industry, the global oilfield services industry. Our credit
procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately
assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their
creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-
market or otherwise use the production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The demand for industrial and recreational sand fluctuates, which could adversely affect our results of
operations.
A portion of our sales are to customers in industries that have historically been cyclical, such as
glassmaking, building products and foundry. During periods of economic slowdown, our customers often
reduce their production rates and also reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. Such
developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties.

Demand in many of the end markets for industrial and recreational sand is driven by the construction and
automotive industries. For example, the flat glass market depends on the automotive and commercial and
residential construction and remodeling markets. The market for industrial and recreational sand used to
manufacture building products is driven primarily by demand in the construction markets. The demand for
foundry silica substantially depends on the rate of automobile, light truck and heavy equipment production.
Other factors influencing the demand for industrial and recreational sand include (i) the substitution of plastic
or other materials for glass, (ii) competition from offshore producers of glass products, (iii) changes in
demand for our products due to technological innovations and (iv) prices, availability and other factors
relating to our products.
We cannot predict or control the factors that affect demand for our products. Negative developments in the
above factors, among others, could cause the demand for industrial and recreational sand to decline, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Our operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect
production levels and costs, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.
Our mining, processing and production facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the proppant
and industrial and recreational sand industries. These risks include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
changes in the price and availability of transportation;
changes in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity;
unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;
cave-ins, pit wall failures or rock falls, particularly in underground mines;
unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;
extreme seasonal weather conditions;
hazardous or catastrophic weather conditions or events, including flooding, tornadoes and hurricanes, and the
physical impacts of climate change;
environmental hazards;
industrial accidents;
changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) or increased public scrutiny related to the mining
and the drilling and well completion industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;
inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;
restrictions on blasting and mining operations, including potential moratoriums on mining as result of local
activism or complaints;
•
•
•
•
•
•
inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;
reduction in the amount of water available for processing;
labor disputes;
late delivery of supplies;
fires, explosions or other accidents; and
facility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions.
Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, our mining properties or production facilities,
personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Any
prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining properties or production facilities could have a material
adverse effect on us.
Table of Contents

Not all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and our insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles,
exclusions and endorsements. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet our needs in the event of
loss and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on us.
A significant portion of our sales is generated at our Wedron Silica facility. Any adverse developments at this
plant could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 49% of our total volumes were produced at our Wedron
Silica Facility and this percentage may increase in the future. Considering capacities acquired in 2013 on a
full-year basis, this facility accounts for approximately 35% of our annual sand processing capacity and
approximately 24% of our annual coating capacity. A casualty event or other adverse event affecting the
production at this plant, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events or weather (including
floods), adverse government regulatory impacts, private actions by residents of Wedron or surrounding
communities, decreased demand for the products this plant produces, adverse developments affecting this
plant’s customers or transportation-related constraints, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The manufacture of resin coated proppants is an important process for us and is dependent on the availability
of raw materials.
If we are unable to secure adequate, cost effective supply commitments for the raw materials associated with
resin coated proppants our ability to sell this product to the marketplace at profitable margins may be
adversely impacted. Decreased sales of resin coated proppants or the inability to control the costs associated
with manufacturing and distribution of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results from operations.
Diminished access to water may adversely affect our operations or the operations of our customers.
Our operations require the use of significant quantities of water. The mining and processing activities in
which we engage at a number of our facilities require significant amounts of water, and some of our facilities
are located in areas that are water-constrained. Additionally, the development of oil and gas properties
through fracture stimulation likewise requires significant water use. We have obtained water rights that we
currently use to service the activities on our various properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights
to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we and
our customers are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate
regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate. Such regulatory authorities
may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or
eliminate our current water rights, and we and our customers may be unable to retain all or a portion of such
water rights. These new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial
operations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs and effectiveness if implemented.
Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights
may alter the environment in which we and our customers do business, which may negatively affect our
financial condition and results of operations.
Title to our mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to our production of sand may be
disputed.
Title to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to our production of sand,
may be disputed. A successful claim that we lack appropriate mineral and water rights on one or more of our
properties could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop and operate mines on that property. Any
decrease or disruption in our mineral rights may adversely affect our operations. In some instances, we have
received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would
exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and
any such action could be materially adverse to our results of operations or financial condition.

If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited
and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
Our business strategy includes supplementing internal growth by pursuing acquisitions. Any acquisition may
involve potential risks, including, among other things:
•
•
•
•
the validity of our assumptions about mineral reserves and future production, sales, capital expenditures,
operating expenses and costs, including synergies;
an inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;
the use of a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions and the
subsequent decrease in our liquidity;
a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance
a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance
acquisitions;
the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity
is inadequate;
the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;
an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel both to manage and to operate our growing business and
assets;
the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset
devaluation or restructuring charges;
unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas;
customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses; and
the accuracy of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological
analyses and other information used when deciding to acquire a property, the results of which are often
inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.

If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited
and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
We will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, develop and increase our asset
base. The inability to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have a material
adverse effect on our growth and profitability.
Although we currently use a significant amount of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations
to fund the maintenance and development of our existing mineral reserves and our acquisitions of new
mineral reserves, we may depend on the availability of credit to fund future capital expenditures. Our ability to
obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by
our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, the covenants contained in our existing
credit facility, term loans or future debt agreements, adverse market conditions or other contingencies and
uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds necessary to maintain, develop and
increase our asset base could adversely impact our growth and profitability.
Even if we are able to obtain financing or access the capital markets, incurring additional debt may
significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict
our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities. In addition, the issuance of additional
common stock in an equity offering may result in significant stockholder dilution.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.
Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to
pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. As of June 30, 2014, we had approximately $1.26 billion of
outstanding long-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt). Our substantial indebtedness
could have other important consequences to you and significant effects on our business. For example, it
could:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and
other general corporate purposes;
limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;
make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;
place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.
Our revolving credit facility and term loans contain substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may
restrict our business and financing activities.
Our revolving credit facility and term loans contain, and any future financing agreements that we may enter
into will likely contain, operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict our ability to
finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities.
Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of
cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic
conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the
restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our debt agreements, a significant portion of our indebtedness may
become immediately due and payable and our lenders’ commitment to make further loans to us may
terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In
addition, our obligations under our debt agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we
are unable to repay our indebtedness under these agreements, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our
assets.
We may incur substantial debt in the future to enable us to maintain or increase our production levels and to
otherwise pursue our business plan. This debt may impair our ability to operate our business.
Our business plan requires a significant amount of capital expenditures to maintain and grow our production
levels. If prices for the products we produce were to decline for an extended period of time, if the costs of our
acquisition and development operations were to increase substantially or if other events were to occur which
reduced our sales or increased our costs, we may be required to borrow in the future to enable us to finance
the expenditures necessary to replace the reserves we produce. The cost of the borrowings and our
obligations to repay the borrowings could have important consequences to us, including:
•
•
our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or
other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all;
covenants contained in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests
that may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business, including possible
acquisition opportunities;
20
Table of Contents
•
•
we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness,
reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and
our debt level will make us more vulnerable than our less leveraged competitors to competitive pressures or a
downturn in our business or the economy generally.
Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on, among other things, our future financial and operating
performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory
and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service
our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business
activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures; selling assets; restructuring or refinancing
our indebtedness; or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect
any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.
Inaccuracies in our estimates of mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than
expected costs.
We base our mineral reserve estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and
analyzed by our engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms. However, sand reserve
estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available
drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities
and qualities of mineral reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our
control. Estimates of economically recoverable mineral reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors
and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:
•
geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data
or that may differ from experience;
•
•
assumptions concerning future prices of sand-based products, operating costs, mining technology improvements,
development costs and reclamation costs; and
assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by
governmental agencies.
Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and
higher than expected costs.
Mine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our
results of operations may be adversely affected.
We base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies that we perform from time to
time, but our studies and assumptions do not always prove to be accurate. If we close any of our mines
sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to increase production at any of our other mines,
which may not be possible. The closure of an open pit mine also involves significant fixed closure costs,
including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other
environmental costs and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including energy contracts and
equipment leases. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads and other
mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. If we were to reduce the estimated life of
any of our mines, the fixed mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which
would increase production costs per ton produced and could materially and adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.
Applicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in
accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as
Table of Contents
21
removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, re-
vegetation and post-mining land use. We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial
assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of
the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates
and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for
expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible were
later determined to be insufficient, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be
adversely affected.
A shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the mining industry may further increase
operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Efficient mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with several
years of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks, including processing of mined minerals. If the
shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens or if we are unable to train the necessary number of
skilled laborers, there could be an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to
expand production.
As a result of current market conditions and the high demand for skilled labor in certain regions in which we
operate, we are experiencing a record level of labor costs, and we expect the cost of labor to increase in the
future. The continued increase in labor costs could adversely affect our profitability.
Our production process consumes large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a
significant interruption in the supply of these or any other significant raw material costs could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Natural gas is the primary fuel source used for drying in the sand production process and, as such, our
profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. The price
and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political
and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and
demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, regional production
patterns and environmental concerns. Furthermore, utility companies could enforce natural gas curtailments
which affect our operations. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes
could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. In the
past, the price of natural gas has been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. For
example, during the year ended December 31, 2013, the monthly closing price of natural gas on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ranged from a high of $4.15 per million British Thermal Units (“BTUs”) to a low of $3.23
per million BTUs.
Phenol is the primary component of the resins we buy, and our resin supply agreements contain market
based pricing provisions based on the cost of phenol. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices
for phenol.
We have not historically hedged natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments, such
as forwards, swaps and futures. Furthermore, a significant increase in the price of phenol or of energy that is
not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or an extended interruption in the supply of
natural gas or electricity to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Our business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.
We depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel.
Members of our senior management and other key employees have extensive experience and expertise in
evaluating and analyzing industrial mineral properties, maximizing production from such properties,
marketing
Table of Contents
22
industrial mineral production and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies. Competition
for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. Further, we
have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. The loss of any of
these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect
on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. In addition, due
to the broad base of shares and options owned by our current employee base, a significant amount of wealth
and liquidity could be generated as a result of this offering. If any of our executives or other key employees
were to retire as a result of this wealth creation, join a competitor or form a competing company, we could
lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with
respect to any of our employees. Our success is dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and
retain highly skilled personnel.
Our profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.
As of December 31, 2013, various labor unions represented 14% of our domestic employees. If we are unable
to renegotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with these labor unions in the future, we could
experience, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by our workers and increased
operating costs as a result of higher wages, health care costs or benefits paid to our employees. An inability
to maintain good relations with our workforce could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Silica-related health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or
results of operations.
The inhalation of respirable crystalline silica can lead to the lung disease silicosis. There is disputed
evidence of an association between respirable silica exposure and lung cancer as well as a possible
association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks
have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the silica industry. Concerns over silicosis
and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of
silica, may have the effect of discouraging our customers’ use of our silica products. The actual or perceived
health risks of mining, processing and handling silica could materially and adversely affect silica producers,
including us, through reduced use of silica products, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits,
increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced
financing sources available to the silica industry.
We and/or our predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous
products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of our customers alleging
damages caused by silica exposure. As of June 30, 2014, we were subject to approximately 46 active silica
exposure claims. Almost all of the claims pending against us arise out of the alleged use of our silica
products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Mississippi,
Kentucky and Illinois, although cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. In
accordance with our insurance obligations, these claims are being defended by our subsidiaries’ insurance
carriers, subject to our payment of approximately 7% of the defense costs. If our insurance coverage or
indemnities prove to be insufficient or unavailable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operation.
Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our mining, processing and production facilities could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.
The performance, quality and safety of our products are critical to the success of our business. These factors
depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number
of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to
ensure that our employees adhere to the quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or
deterioration

23
of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and reputation.
Seasonal impacts may impact our ability to process sand and our customers’ demand for our products.
Because raw sand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, frac sand is typically washed
only eight months out of the year at our surface mines in Wisconsin and our Minnesota and Ohio operations.
Our inability to mine and process frac sand year round in our surface mines in Wisconsin and our Minnesota
and Ohio operations results in a seasonal build-up of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a
stockpile that will feed our drying facilities during the winter months. Unexpected winter weather conditions
may result in our having an insufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our drying plants for the winter
months and result in our being unable to satisfy customer requirements during these periods. As a result of
these seasonal supply impacts, the cash flows of our North American operations can fluctuate if plant
operations must remain shut down due to harsh winter weather conditions.
In addition to supply considerations, severe weather conditions may curtail our customers’ drilling activities
and impair rail shipment and transportation services and, as a result, our sales volumes to customers may
similarly be adversely affected. Unexpected winter weather conditions may compound these seasonal
impacts, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operation.
We may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.
We rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business,
including process control technology. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods,
power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. The failure of any of our information technology
systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.
Our international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business abroad.
We conduct business in many parts of the world, including Argentina, Mexico, China, northern Europe and
the Middle East. Our ability to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) is dependent on the
success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and
business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions
and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of the
FCPA by us or any of our employees.
In addition, our international operations are subject to the various laws and regulations of those respective
countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
global economic conditions;
political actions and requirements of national governments including trade restrictions, embargoes, seizure,
detention, nationalization and expropriations of assets;
interpretation of tax statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide, routine examination by taxing
authorities and assessment of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest;
civil unrest;
acts of terrorism;
fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates;
the impact of inflation; and
difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of the local currency requirements.

Significant impairment losses related to goodwill and intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operation.
We recorded approximately $161 million of goodwill and intangibles in connection with our acquisition
activity in 2013. We assess the impairment of goodwill and intangibles at least annually and also whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any significant impairment of the
goodwill or intangibles from these acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.
Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States could adversely
affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We
could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies
and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants or refineries are direct targets or indirect
casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas, which, in
turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of
potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of
operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain
business strategies.
Risks Related to Environmental, Mining and Other Regulation
Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential
for related litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our
customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for our sand-based proppants and negatively impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We supply proppants to oilfield service companies. Hydraulic fracturing is a widely used industry production
technique that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock
formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals, under pressure, into the
formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The hydraulic fracturing process is
typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing
has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing increased scrutiny. Several federal agencies,
regulatory authorities, and legislative entities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of
hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) has asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has indicated it
may seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has
proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil and gas leases.
Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of
hydraulic fracturing. In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are
considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting
requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on
hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. For example, many states
—including the major oil and gas producing states of North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas,
and West Virginia—have imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators.
Some local governments have adopted and others may seek to adopt ordinances prohibiting or regulating the
time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities within their
jurisdictions.
Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state,
local or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic
fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and gas wells, increase our customers’ costs
of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they
perform, which could negatively impact demand for our sand-based proppants. In addition, heightened
political, regulatory
Table of Contents
25
and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices, including nuisance lawsuits, could expose us or our
customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly or result in
substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation
involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate.
Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our sand-based proppants,
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety regulations that impose,
and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent
enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect
our results of operations.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulatory environmental requirements affecting the
mining and mineral processing industry, including among others, those relating to employee health and
safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air and water emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, water
pollution, waste management, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and
restoration of properties, hazardous materials and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose
substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), impose strict, retroactive and joint and several
liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA, or similar state and
local laws, may be imposed as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of,
or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or
dispose of hazardous materials or otherwise conduct our operations in compliance with environmental laws
could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and civil or criminal liability associated
with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other
damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, future environmental
laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our mineral reserves or could
require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business.
These laws, regulations and permits have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business.
We may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and
regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our
operations or equipment or shut down some or all of our facilities. Additionally, our customers may not be
able to comply with any new laws and regulations, which could cause our customers to curtail or cease
operations. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate our costs of compliance or the timing of any costs
associated with any new laws and regulations, or any material adverse effect that any new standards will have
on our customers and, consequently, on our operations.
We are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety
standards on numerous aspects of our operations.
Our operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine
Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety
standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of
personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. Our failure to comply with such
standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation or otherwise impose significant
restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.
Table of Contents
26
We and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, plant and wildlife
protection and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and
liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could
increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition to the regulatory matters described above, we and our customers are subject to extensive
governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife
protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed.
Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity of our mineral reserves and our ability to
extract these reserves profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently
do.
In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, we may be required to prepare and present
data to governmental authorities pertaining to the impact that any proposed exploration or production
activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain approval procedures may
require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the
environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory
requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or
renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition, including
nuisance lawsuits, and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or
the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our
ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the
environment, could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our
ability to extract mineral reserves), our cost structure or our customers’ ability to use our sand-based
proppants. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we
may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.
Our inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of
mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We are generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved
reclamation plan after it has been mined. We are required under federal, state and local laws to maintain
financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The inability to acquire, maintain or
renew such assurances, as required by federal, state and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as
well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:
•
•
•
the lack of availability, higher expense or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;
the ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and
the exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance
instruments.
Our inability to acquire, maintain or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and
restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Common Stock
The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the requirements of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to
comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.
As a public company, we will need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate
governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, related regulations of the SEC and the
Table of Contents
27
requirements of the NYSE, with which we are not required to comply as a private company. Complying with
these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of
directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We will need to:
•
•
•
•
•
institute a more comprehensive compliance function;
comply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;
continue to prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal
securities laws;
establish new internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading; and
involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.
Furthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 for our
second annual report on Form 10-K, which will be for our year ending December 31, 2015, we will not be
required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal
controls until the later of our second annual report on Form 10-K or our first annual report subsequent to our
ceasing to be an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act.
Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the
effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is
adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated
or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract
management; and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.
In addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more
difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to
accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar
coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our
board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or
estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.
There is no existing market for our common stock, and we do not know if one will develop to provide you
with adequate liquidity to sell our common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price you paid in this
offering.
Prior to this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the extent
to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market on the
stock exchange on which we list our common stock or otherwise or how liquid that market might become. If
an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock that you
buy.
The concentration of our capital stock ownership among our largest stockholders and their affiliates will limit
your ability to influence corporate matters.
Upon completion of this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares), the AS Group will indirectly own approximately         % of our outstanding common stock.
Consequently, the AS Group will continue to have significant influence over all matters that require approval
by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
This concentration of ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions
may be taken that you may not view as beneficial.
Furthermore, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and American
Securities and its affiliates, including its portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other
things,
Table of Contents
28
potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. American Securities is a private equity
firm in the business of making investments in entities in a variety of industries. As a result, American
Securities’ existing and future portfolio companies which it controls may compete with us for investment or
business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor.
We have also renounced our interest in certain business opportunities. See “— Our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate
opportunities, which could adversely affect our business or prospects.”
The initial public offering price of our common stock may not be indicative of the market price of our
common stock after this offering. In addition, an active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common
stock may not develop or be maintained, and our stock price may be volatile.
Prior to this offering, our common stock was not traded on any market. An active, liquid and orderly trading
market for our common stock may not develop or be maintained after this offering. Active, liquid and orderly
trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors’ purchase
and sale orders. The market price of our common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of
factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our common
stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our common stock. The initial public
offering price was determined by negotiations between us, the selling stockholder and representatives of the
underwriters, based on numerous factors which we discuss in “Underwriting,” and may not be indicative of
the market price of our common stock after this offering. Consequently, you may not be able to sell shares of
our common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price paid by you in this offering.
The following factors could affect our stock price:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
our operating and financial performance;
quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and
revenues;
the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;
strategic actions by our competitors;
our failure to meet revenue or earnings estimates by research analysts or other investors;
changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage,
by equity research analysts;
speculation in the press or investment community;
the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;
sales of our common stock by us, the selling stockholders or other stockholders, or the perception that such
sales may occur;
changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;
additions or departures of key management personnel;
actions by our stockholders;
general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices, sand-based proppants or industrial and
general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices, sand-based proppants or industrial and
recreational sand-based products;
domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and
the realization of any risks describes under this “Risk Factors” section.

The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the
operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against
companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s
securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our
management’s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and
expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate
opportunities between us and American Securities. Under these provisions, neither American Securities, its
affiliates and subsidiaries, nor any of their officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members or partners will
have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar
business activities or lines of business in which we operate, other than opportunities related to hydraulic
fracturing proppants. For instance, a director of our company who also serves as a director, officer or
employee of American Securities or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisitions or
other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition or other
opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if attractive corporate opportunities are
allocated by American Securities to itself or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of to us. The terms of our
certificate of incorporation are more fully described in “Description of Capital Stock.”
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware
law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely
affect the market price of our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred
stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more
difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire
control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:
•
•
a classified board of directors;
limitations on the removal of directors;
•
•
•
•
limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;
advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be
acted upon at meetings of stockholders;
providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and
establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of
directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
Investors in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution of $         per share.
Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $         per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth
on the cover of this prospectus), purchasers of our common stock in this offering will experience an
immediate and substantial dilution of $         per share in the net tangible book value per share of common
stock from the initial public offering price, and our as adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30, 2014
would be $         per share. This dilution is due in large part to earlier investors having paid substantially less
than the initial public offering price when they purchased their shares. Please see “Dilution.”

We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and our debt agreements place certain restrictions
on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the
price of our common stock appreciates.
We do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally,
our existing revolving credit facility and our term loan both place certain restrictions on our ability to pay
cash dividends. Consequently, unless we revise our dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a
return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price greater than you paid for it.
There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the
price that you pay in this offering.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional
capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.
We may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. We may also issue additional
shares of common stock or convertible securities. After the completion of this offering, we will have
outstanding              shares of common stock. This number includes              shares that the selling
stockholders are selling in this offering and              shares that the selling stockholders may sell in this
offering if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is fully exercised, which may be resold
immediately in the public market. Following the completion of this offering, assuming no exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, the AS Group will indirectly own              shares of our
common stock, or approximately     % of our total outstanding shares, all of which are restricted from
immediate resale under the federal securities laws and are subject to the lock-up agreements with the
underwriters described in “Underwriting,” but may be sold into the market in the future. The Stockholders’
Agreement of the Company will be amended to provide for certain revised registration rights which will
require us to effect the registration of shares in certain circumstances. Please see “Shares Eligible for Future
Sale” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Stockholders’ Agreement.”
In connection with this offering, we intend to file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing
for the registration of          shares of our common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our equity
incentive plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of lock-up agreements and the
requirements of Rule 144, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 will be available for
resale immediately in the public market without restriction.
We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common
stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the
market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares
issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect
prevailing market prices of our common stock.
The underwriters of this offering may waive or release parties to the lock-up agreements entered into in
connection with this offering, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
We, ASP FML, all of our directors and executive officers and certain of our principal stockholders and the
selling stockholders will enter into lock-up agreements with respect to their common stock, pursuant to which
they are subject to certain resale restrictions for a period of 180 days following the effectiveness date of the
registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. At least two of the representatives of the
underwriters, consisting of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital Inc.,
may, at any time and without notice, release all or any portion of the common stock subject to the foregoing
lock-up agreements. If the restrictions under the lock-up agreements are waived, then common stock will be
available for sale into the public markets, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline
and impair our ability to raise capital.

For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting
requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive
compensation, that apply to other public companies.
We are classified as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging
growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be
required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of
the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit
firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide
additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (3) provide certain disclosure
regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (4) hold nonbinding advisory votes
on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we
will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700
million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-
convertible debt over a three-year period.
We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common
stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our
stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences,
limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and
distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of
preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we
might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the
happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or
redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the
residual value of the common stock.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely
change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their
expectations, our stock price could decline.
The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or
securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our
company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in
turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who
cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations,
our stock price could decline.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will designate the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by
our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes
with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that unless we consent in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our
directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by
the internal affairs

doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the
indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring
any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of
forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for
disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against
us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types
of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other
jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based
on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is
very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that
could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this
prospectus. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our
behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as other cautionary
statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should
evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this prospectus in the context of these risks and
uncertainties.
We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are
important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect

USE OF PROCEEDS
The common stock being offered by this prospectus, including the common stock offered if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, is solely for the account of the selling stockholders.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders. We will pay all
expenses related to this offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to the shares
sold by the selling stockholders.
The selling stockholders have granted to the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to
                     additional shares of common stock. The exercise of this underwriters’ over-allotment option will
not affect the total number of shares outstanding.

STOCK SPLIT
On             , 2014, we amended and restated our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to
effect a stock split on a          for          basis to be effected prior to the effective date of the registration
statement of which this prospectus forms a part. The stock split will be effected simultaneously for all our
then-existing common stock and common stock options and the exchange ratio will be the same for all of our
shares of issued and outstanding common stock. The stock split will affect all of our stockholders uniformly
and will not affect any stockholder’s percentage ownership interests in us. Unless otherwise indicated,
information presented in this prospectus is adjusted to reflect the          for          stock split.
DIVIDEND POLICY
We do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the
foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth of our business.
Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon then-
existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, investment
opportunities, statutory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and other factors our board of directors
may deem relevant. In addition, our revolving credit facility and term loans place restrictions on our ability to
pay cash dividends.

DILUTION
Dilution is the amount by which the offering price paid by the purchasers of shares of common stock sold in
this offering will exceed the net tangible book value per share of common stock after the offering. Assuming
an initial public offering price of $         per share (which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus), on a pro forma basis as of June 30, 2014, our net tangible book value would
have been approximately $         million, or $         per share of common stock. This remains unchanged when
adjusted for the sale by the selling stockholders of shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed
initial public offering price of $         per share of common stock. Purchasers of shares of our common stock
in this offering will experience substantial and immediate dilution in net tangible book value per share of
common stock for financial accounting purposes, as illustrated in the following table.
Assumed Initial public offering price per share
Pro forma net tangible book value per share before and after the offering
Immediate dilution in net tangible book value per share to purchasers in the offering (1)

   $
(1) Because the total number of shares outstanding following this offering will not be impacted by any exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock from the selling stockholders and we will not
receive any net proceeds from such exercise, there will be no change to the dilution in net tangible book value
per share of common stock to purchasers in the offering due to any such exercise of the option.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating
results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented
below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-
looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and
information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those
discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those
discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
Overview
We are one of the world’s largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for over 30 years have been
a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by oilfield service and E&P companies to
enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. Fairmount Santrol offers the broadest range of proppants
available in the market today, including high quality sand and a spectrum of resin coated products, all of
which exceed API specifications. Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies
have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to
end users in the I&R markets. We believe our two primary market segments are complementary. Our ability to
sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the economic recovery
of our reserve base.
We have one of the largest sand reserves and processing asset bases in the industry, including, as of
December 31, 2013, 798.2 million tons of proven mineral reserves, 11 active sand processing facilities with
12.3 million tons of annual sand processing capacity, a resin manufacturing facility and 11 coating facilities
with 2.4 million tons of annual coating capacity. From 2009 to 2013, we expanded our annual raw frac sand
and coating capacities by approximately 6.0 million and 1.5 million tons, respectively, through a combination
of organic growth and acquisitions. Our coating facilities include operations in Mexico, Denmark and China,
through which we serve international oil and gas markets.
We are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America’s major oil and gas producing basins
and we also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge and trucks to reach our customers in certain
basins. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 46 proppant distribution terminals with
significant associated storage, 32 of which exclusively handle our products. Since 2011, we have developed
or acquired 24 distribution terminals, providing significant additional annual transloading capacity. We also
service I&R end markets through seven additional terminals. As of August 15, 2014, we had a fleet of over
8,500 railcars and expect this fleet to grow to over 13,000 through 2016. By the end of the third quarter of 2014,
we also expect to have expanded our unit train capabilities to three production facilities and three in-basin
terminals, which we expect to significantly reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet.
As one of the nation’s longest continuously operating mining organizations, we have developed a strong
commitment to environmental stewardship and to the three pillars of Sustainable Development: People,
Planet and Prosperity. Our strong commitment to safety is reflected in the health and safety of our employees
and is illustrated by achieving a lost-time incident rate that is less than half the industry average. From 2011
through June 30, 2014, our employees have demonstrated our commitment to our communities by donating
approximately 36,000 hours of company-paid volunteer time, as well as significant personal volunteer time,
into the communities in which we live and operate. We are focused on environmental stewardship, and ten of
our facilities now generate zero waste to landfills. Additionally, we have successfully executed annual
initiatives to reduce our carbon emissions and have planted over 225,000 trees since 2011 in order to offset
our Tier I and Tier II carbon emissions. We believe adhering to sustainable development principles is not only
the right thing to do, but also results in a higher level of engagement and commitment from our employees,
better relationships

with our communities and, as a result, a stronger base from which to pursue profitable growth over the long-
term. Abiding by these guiding principles, our corporate motto is “Do Good. Do Well.”
Our period-to-period results will be materially impacted by, among other market factors, the volumes of
products we sell, the relative segment mix comprising our revenues, the mix of products we sell within each
segment, prevailing market prices for the products we offer, transportation costs, operational cost factors, and
the resulting margins we earn on products sold. The relatively higher per unit margins generated within our
Proppant Solutions segment largely reflect the demand for their specific product performance characteristics
and qualities, the higher investments required to develop and distribute these products, and the more
constricted and geographically limited product supply available to these markets. Our average I&R selling
prices trend below those generated within our Proppant Solutions segment, reflecting local or regional
supply and demand dynamics and the relative economics of the I&R end markets.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold over 7.5 million tons, generating approximately $988 million
of revenues, $293 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $105 million of net income (see our discussion of the use
of non-GAAP measures of profitability on page 10 of this prospectus).
Recent Trends and Outlook
Recent trends driving demand for our proppants and commercial silica include:
•
•
•
Increasing activity in the oil and gas market. The growth in the use of horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic
fracturing as a means to extract hydrocarbons from shale formations has resulted in increases in the number of
new wells drilled and completed in North America. This increased completion activity has contributed to the
growth in the demand for proppants, and we expect this trend to continue.
Evolving completion techniques that favor increased proppant use. E&P companies, in partnership with oilfield
service companies, continue to refine their well design and hydraulic fracturing techniques to maximize
hydrocarbon recovery from each well. These techniques vary based on formation and well geology, but some of
the more pervasive recent trends include longer lateral drilling lengths coupled with an increased number of
hydraulic fracturing stages per well. E&P and oilfield service companies have also been increasing the amount of
proppant used per frac stage and, together, these techniques have greatly increased the volume of proppant used
in the completion of each well, which we expect will continue to drive growth in our volumes sold.
Shift in drilling activity and demand mix. Following declines in the price of natural gas in late 2011 and early 2012,
E&P companies generally moved their primary operating activity away from dry gas-focused regions like the
Haynesville and Barnett Shales towards liquids-rich plays like the Eagle Ford Shale and the Williston and
Permian Basins. Rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S. declined from 64% of the total rig count in the beginning
of 2010 to 21% by the end of 2013. This shift away from natural gas production negatively impacted the demand
for certain types of proppant products. During this period, sales of our resin coated proppants used in deep, high
pressure wells in the Haynesville Shale declined significantly. However, also during this period, E&P companies
increased their drilling activity directed towards oil and natural gas liquids rich acreage. In addition, many E&P
companies found improved well production results as a result of using greater quantities of proppant per well. As
a consequence of these trends, we experienced a significant increase in demand for raw frac sand, which
generally carries a lower margin per ton and a lower margin as a percentage of selling price than our resin coated
products. Accordingly, a shift in sales mix toward raw frac sand will reduce our overall margin and results of
operations.
Increased demand for in-basin delivery of proppant. From 2010 to 2012, when demand for proppant significantly
outstripped available supply and distribution infrastructure across the industry was largely underdeveloped, a
larger portion of our volumes was provided to customers at our processing site (i.e., our customers would arrange
for the transportation and storage logistics of our products). Increasingly,
•
42
Table of Contents
•
customers seek to outsource proppant logistics and obtain in-basin product delivery. In 2013, approximately 80%
of our proppant volume was sold in-basin at one of our distribution terminals, compared to approximately 65% in
2012. While the resulting profit per ton is roughly in-line across the industry for minegate or delivered proppant,
we believe this shift will favor the larger, integrated providers and have a favorable impact on our demand.
Continued stable demand in industrial end markets. Sales in our I&R Products segment are driven by
macroeconomic factors such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity and industrial
production. To the extent these demand drivers continue on their current trends, we expect to experience
relatively stable demand for commercial silica.
We expect many of the recent trends in the oil and gas industry to continue to drive increased proppant
demand into the future. In its 2014 report, The Freedonia Group’s research indicates that total proppant
volumes in the U.S. increased at an annual rate of approximately 26% since 2008. Looking forward, The
Freedonia Group projects that raw frac sand sales will increase at an annual growth rate of approximately 9%
between 2013 and 2018, and that resin coated sand volumes will increase at a nearly 11% rate over the same
period.
Acquisitions
Our 2013 results may not be comparable to past or future results because of the impact of these acquisitions.
We completed three acquisitions in 2013, each of which is described below.
In April 2013, we acquired Self-Suspending Proppant LLC (“SSP LLC”) for $55 million. Under the term of the
acquisition agreement, we are required to make contingent payments based on our sales of Propel SSP or
products incorporating similar proprietary technology during a five-year period commencing on October 1,
2015. Pursuant to the contingent payment provisions, we are generally required to pay the former owner of
SSP LLC 50% of the cumulative product margin we earn from such sales during the pay-out period, less
certain adjustments. The contingent obligation will be recorded as an increase in acquired assets and a
corresponding contingent liability, and the payments are required to be made on an annual basis, within 60
days of each anniversary of the commencement of the pay-out period. During the pay-out period, our net cash
flows realized from sales of Propel SSP and related products will be reduced as a result of these contingent
payments. In the event that the contingent payments for the first and second annual pay-out periods do not
exceed $45 million (less certain adjustments) and we do not make up any shortfall in such minimum payment
amount, the former owner of SSP LLC will have the right to reacquire a 51% interest in SSP LLC. In the event
that the aggregate amount of all contingent payments does not exceed $195 million (less certain adjustments)
and we do not make up any shortfall in such minimum payment amount, the former owner of SSP LLC will
have the right to reacquire an 80% interest in SSP LLC. As the owner of SSP LLC, we own intellectual
property related to providing proppants with enhanced performance attributes through proprietary coating
technology.
In June 2013, we acquired Great Plains Sands, LLC (“Great Plains”) located in Minnesota for total
consideration of $74 million including $10 million of contingent consideration. This transaction provided us
with approximately 15.3 million tons of API-spec Northern White frac sand reserves and 700,000 tons of
annual production capacity.
In September 2013, we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from FTSI and its affiliates.
We acquired 353 million tons of sand reserves; 2.7 million tons per year of frac sand production capacity;
0.6 million tons per year of resin coating capacity; and logistics assets consisting of 13 terminals and 2,798
railcars. We recorded the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value on the date of the acquisition,
including $95.5 million of sand reserves, $127.7 million of property, plant and equipment, $26.0 million of
inventory, $50.1 million of goodwill and other intangibles, and $2.3 million of assumed liabilities. We also
have an option to purchase 33 million tons of API-spec Northern White sand reserves and an additional
1.0 million tons per year of frac sand production capacity. In connection with this acquisition, we also entered
into a ten-year supply agreement with FTSI (“FTSI Supply Agreement”). The fair value of the FTSI Supply
Agreement was
Table of Contents
43
determined to be $50.7 million. The total consideration for the FTSI transaction of $350 million, including $2.3
million of assumed liabilities, was financed with long-term debt.
After completing the FTSI transaction, we integrated the acquired production facilities, terminals and railcars
into our existing network, such that we do not distinguish assets and operations acquired from FTSI from our
legacy assets and operations when optimizing the efficiency of product delivery to our customers. The
operations acquired from FTSI are being operated and managed similar to our legacy operations. Volumes
sold to FTSI under the FTSI Supply Agreement are being supplied from both legacy and acquired assets as
the capacity that we acquired from FTSI was not adequate to satisfy FTSI’s proppant demand. Additionally,
volumes sold to other customers are being supplied from both legacy assets and assets acquired from FTSI.
How We Generate Our Sales
We derive our sales by mining, processing and transporting sand-based proppants and silica sand products
that our customers purchase for use in a wide variety of applications. We maintain long-term relationships
with many of the largest North American hydraulic fracturing service providers, and currently have
approximately 80 customers for our proppant products. Our collaborative approach to product development
and innovation, reputation for high-quality products and expansive logistics network have solidified us as a
critical component within our customers’ supply chains. Certain of our top customer relationships date back
over 30 years.
Our customers are not the ultimate end users of our products. Overall market demand is driven by the activity
of E&P companies who ultimately drive and are increasingly dictating the specific type and volume of our
proppants that are consumed in their wells. Our technical sales team works closely with oilfield services
companies and E&P companies to demonstrate the value proposition of our performance proppants in order
to stimulate market demand from the ultimate beneficiaries of our products.
Demand for sand-based proppants is closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of
oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns in a particular basin are influenced
by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing
activity levels, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further,
these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, selling price and availability of sand-
based proppants and other types of proppants such as ceramic proppant. Selling prices for sand-based
proppants vary by basin and are determined based on supply and demand dynamics within each basin.
In our Proppant Solutions business, we sell over 80% of our volume through our network of terminals at
selling prices that are set by local market dynamics. The remaining volume in the Proppant Solutions
business is sold to customers directly from our production facilities. The average selling prices for products
sold through our terminals is higher than the average selling prices for comparable product sold from our
production facilities due to costs incurred to handle and transport the products from the production facilities
to the terminals. Generally, logistics costs can comprise 70-80% of the delivered cost of Northern White frac
sand, depending on the basin into which the product is delivered. Due to the closer proximity of distribution
terminals to our production facility, the amount of logistics costs included in the total delivered cost of our
Texas Gold brown sand generally will be lower than that for our Northern White frac sand.
Our Proppant Solutions segment represented 87% of our revenues in 2013. During 2012 and 2013, our top ten
proppant customers represented 65% and 64% of our revenues, respectively. Our I&R Products segment has
approximately 770 customers and represented 13% of our revenues in 2013.
Throughout our history we have sold proppants both on a purchase order basis and pursuant to supply
agreements. The duration, volume provisions and other terms of our proppant supply agreements vary by
customer. Our proppant supply agreements generally have initial terms between two and ten years, and
typically require our customers to purchase a fixed minimum volume or a specified percentage of their
product
Table of Contents
44
requirements. Those with fixed volumes typically include penalty provisions which apply where our customer
fails to purchase the required minimum volume. Our proppant supply agreements typically include market
pricing mechanisms. Under many of our proppant sales agreements we are able to propose price increases to
our customers, with such price increases to take effect after a notice period of 30 to 45 days. If the customer
does not accept the proposed increase, we have the option to maintain the agreement under its existing terms
or to terminate it. In addition, many of our proppant supply agreements also include pricing protection
provisions for the benefit of our customers where, after providing us with notice, they are able to obtain
product from another source at a price that is materially less than the price at which we are willing to provide
the product. Our supply agreements contain customary termination provisions for matters such as bankruptcy
related events, uncured breaches of the applicable agreement and unresolved pricing disputes.
In September 2013, in connection with the purchase of FTSI assets, we entered into a ten-year supply
agreement with FTSI. During the period ending December 31, 2018, FTSI is required to purchase stated
minimum amounts of product from us at fixed prices (subject to adjustment for transportation charges). A
make-whole payment applies if FTSI does not purchase the minimum amounts required by the agreement.
During the remainder of the term of the agreement FTSI is required to purchase a percentage of its proppant
requirements based on market pricing. Neither party can terminate the agreement except in connection with a
breach by the other party.
The Costs of Conducting Our Business
The principal costs involved in operating our business are logistics costs associated with transporting
products from our production facilities to our terminals; payroll costs for personnel at our production,
terminal and administrative facilities; resin and other raw materials used in the production of our products;
and maintenance and supply costs at our production facilities. We own, or pay modest royalties on, the
majority of our sand reserves, which we believe helps us maintain a competitive cost position.
Logistics costs, including freight, railcar leases, demurrage and handling, were our largest expense category
in 2013, representing 31% of our revenues over the same period. Freight costs primarily represent charges to
transport our product by rail, but we also ship product by truck and barge. In order to move product by rail,
we lease a substantial number of railcars under operating leases with durations ranging from three to seven
years. As of August 15, 2014, we had 7,720 railcars under lease and 787 railcars made available to us from our
customers giving us a total fleet of over 8,500 railcars. Demurrage costs are charged by the railroads based on
the time a railcar spends on the rail in excess of the allotted time. These costs can vary significantly from
period to period driven by high levels of rail activity at a terminal and changes in the timing of fulfilling
customer orders. Handling costs are incurred at our distribution and terminal facilities to move product from
one mode of transportation to another (e.g., truck to railcar) and to move product into storage facilities.
Labor costs, including wages and benefits, represented 9% of revenues in 2013. Approximately 14% of our
domestic workforce was party to collective bargaining contracts as of December 31, 2013.
We use a significant amount of resins and additives in the production of our coated products in both our
Proppant Solutions and I&R businesses. We purchase these resins and additives under supply agreements
that contain annual pricing adjustments based on the cost of phenol, the primary component of the resins we
buy. We also supply a portion of our resin requirements from our resin manufacturing facility located in
Michigan. The cost of resins and additives represented 9% of revenues in 2013.
Our selling, general and administrative costs were 8% of our revenues in 2013 and include the wages and
benefits costs noted above. These costs are related to our corporate operations, including costs for the sales
and marketing; research and development; finance; legal; and environmental, health and safety functions of
our organization. We anticipate that as a public company we will incur additional legal, accounting, insurance
and
Table of Contents
45
other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public
company reporting requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as
well as other rules implemented by the SEC, and applicable stock exchange rules. We expect these rules and
regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make certain financial
reporting and other activities more time-consuming and costly.
We capitalize the costs of our mining and processing equipment and depreciate it over its expected useful
life. We also capitalize the pre-production costs to remove overburden on our sand reserves and amortize
them based on the actual tons mined. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs represented 3.8% of our
revenues for 2013. Repair and maintenance costs that do not involve the replacement of major components of
our equipment and facilities are expensed as incurred. These repair and maintenance costs can be significant
due to the abrasive nature of our products and represented 2% of our revenues in 2013.
How We Evaluate Our Business
Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance across our
Proppant Solutions and I&R Products segments. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we
serve, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the chief operating
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance
of these segments based on their volumes sold, average selling price and segment contribution margin. We
do not evaluate the performance of the segments on a margin percentage basis, as that is a function of the
manner in which a given product is sold (for example in-basin sales generate higher selling price but
comparable per ton margin, resulting in a reduced margin percentage) and product mix. Additionally, we
consider a number of factors in evaluating the performance of the business as a whole, including total
volumes sold and Adjusted EBITDA. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability
and review these measurements frequently to analyze trends and make decisions.
Segment Contribution Margin
Segment contribution margin is a key metric that management uses to evaluate our operating performance
and to determine resource allocation between segments. We define segment contribution margin as segment
revenues less cost of goods sold less selling, general and administrative expenses directly attributable to that
segment. These selling, general and administrative expenses exclude costs related to corporate functional
areas such as administration, accounting, information technology, human resources, research and
development, business development and sustainable development.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management
and external users of our financial statements, such as lenders and rating agencies.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and
amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation,
management fees and reimbursement of expenses to sponsor, transaction expenses, impairment of assets,
loss on extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other non-cash income or expenses.
Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow us to more effectively
evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without
regard to our financing methods, capital structure or non-recurring or non-operating expenses. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more
meaningful than, net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP
or as indicators of
Table of Contents
46
our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are
significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a
company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which
are components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance and may also be used by investors to
measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.
For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and
presented in accordance with GAAP, please read “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and
Operating Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 10.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2013
Revenues
Revenues increased $181.0 million, or 40%, from $448.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to
$629.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to increased sales volumes in our
Proppant Solutions segment.
Revenues in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $188.9 million, or 50%, from $378.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2013 to $567.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Total volumes
increased 57% from 2.1 million tons in the six months ended June 30, 2013 to 3.4 million tons in the six
months ended June 30, 2014. Raw sand volumes increased by 63% from 1.6 million tons in the first half of
2013 to 2.7 million tons in the first half of 2014. Volumes sold under the FTSI Supply Agreement accounted
for 86% of the increase in raw sand volumes. Additional volume growth for raw sand was limited by adverse
weather conditions and logistical constraints (primarily rail) in the first half of 2014. The average selling price
for raw sand increased 8% from the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014, which was primarily the result of
an increase in the proportion of raw sand sold through our terminal network and an increase in the market
price of certain grades of sand, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold towards finer grades of raw sand and
the volume of Texas Gold brown sand sold under the FTSI Supply Agreement in the six months ended June
30, 2014. Resin coated proppant volumes increased 37% from 501,000 tons in the six months ended June 30,
2013 to 687,000 tons in the six months ended June 30, 2014. Volumes sold under the FTSI Supply Agreement
accounted for 21% of the increase in resin coated proppant volumes. The average selling price for resin
coated proppant decreased 5% from the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014, which was primarily the
result of a decline in the market price of resin coated proppant products.
Revenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $7.9 million, or 11%, from $69.9 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2013 to $62.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Volumes decreased 67,000 tons,
or 5%, from 1.3 million tons in the first half of 2013 to 1.2 million tons in the first half of 2014, primarily due to
a decrease in volume sold into the specialty and foundry end markets. The average selling price decreased
6%, from $55 per ton in the first half of 2013 to $52 per ton in the first half of 2014 which was primarily due to
us no longer paying and billing for freight for a customer in our glass end market.
Segment Contribution Margin
Contribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $42.7 million, or 28%, from $150.3 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $193.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase
was primarily due to additional raw sand and resin coated volumes, most notably those associated with the
FTSI Supply Agreement, partially offset by reduced selling prices on resin coated products and a shift to
lower-margin coated products for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2013.
Contribution margin in the I&R Products segment decreased $0.2 million, or 1%, from $17.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2013 to $16.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to
decreased volumes and a mix shift to lower-margin glass products, partially offset by increases in the prices
of foundry products.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.9 million, or 36%, from $36.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2013 to $49.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase was
primarily due to increased sale and marketing costs for our Proppant Solutions segment (included in
Segment Contribution Margin noted above) and increased corporate costs to support the growth of the
business.

Table of Contents
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $12.0 million, or 77%, from $15.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2013 to $27.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to the increase in
fixed and intangible assets arising from the FTSI transaction and capital expenditures primarily due to
increased production and logistics capacities.
Income from Operations
Income from operations increased $20.6 million, or 16%, from $125.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2013 to $146.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $8.0 million, or 30%, from $26.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to
$34.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to additional borrowings to fund the FTSI
transaction.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes increased $2.7 million, or 9%, from $29.7 million for the six months ended June
30, 2013 to $32.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Our effective tax rate was 30.1% for the six
months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the 29.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2014.
Net Income
Net income increased $9.9 million, or 14%, from $68.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $78.8
million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase was due to the factors noted above.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased from $146.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $180.0 million for
the same period in 2014, due primarily to an increase in segment contribution margin.
Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012
Revenues
Revenues increased $103.2 million, or 12%, from $885.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to
$988.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased sand volumes in our
Proppant Solutions segment.
Revenues in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $98.3 million, or 13%, from $757.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012 to $856.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Total volumes increased
36% from 3.8 million tons in 2012 to 5.1 million tons in 2013. Raw sand volumes increased 1.4 million tons, or
52%, from 2.7 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 4.1 million tons in the year ended
December 31, 2013, 49% of which resulted from the FTSI transaction. The average selling price for raw sand
increased 2% from 2012 to 2013. The proportion of raw sand sold through our terminal network increased
from 57% in 2012 to 78% in 2013, which offset a decline in the market price of raw sand from 2012 to 2013, a
mix shift toward finer grades of raw sand and sales of Texas Gold brown sand. Resin coated proppant
volumes decreased 4% from 1.1 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 1.0 million tons in the
year ended December 31, 2013. Resin coated proppants sold as a result of the FTSI transaction accounted for
4% of the total resin coated proppant volumes in the year ended December 31, 2013. The average selling price
for resin coated sand decreased 4% from 2012 to 2013, which was primarily due to declines in market prices.
Table of Contents

Revenues in the I&R Products segment increased $4.9 million, or 4%, from $127.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Volume increased 87,000 tons or
4% from 2.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 2.5 million tons in the year ended
December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in volumes sold into our glass end market. The average
selling price remained relatively constant, increasing from $53 per ton in 2012 to $54 per ton in 2013.
Segment Contribution Margin
Contribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $20.0 million, or 6%, from $316.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $296.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease
was driven by the decline in volume and selling prices for resin coated proppants, the shift in sales mix for
raw sand toward finer grade sands which carry a lower margin profile and a non-recurring charge associated
with the disposition of obsolete ceramic product. Incremental margin resulting from additional raw sand
volume was partially offset by increased logistical and integration expenses to service volumes under the
FTSI Supply Agreement.
Contribution margin in the I&R Products segment decreased $3.0 million, or 8%, from $37.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2012 to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a
decline in volumes and profitability in our resin coated foundry business.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.5 million, or 25%, from $65.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012 to $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily
due to non-recurring diligence, transaction and integration costs associated with our acquisition activity in
2013, increased sales and marketing costs for our Proppant Solutions segment and increased corporate costs
to support the growth of our business.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $10.1 million, or 36%, from $27.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012 to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Approximately $4.4 million
of the increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization was associated with assets acquired in the FTSI
transaction. The remaining increase was the result of capital expenditures, primarily to increase production
and logistics capacities.
Income from Operations
Income from operations decreased $50.4 million, or 18%, from $278.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2012 to $228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of decreased gross margins
and increased selling, general and administrative expenses described above.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $5.2 million, or 9%, from $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to
$61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to additional borrowings

Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes decreased $25.1 million, or 36%, from $70.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 to $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income before provision for income

taxes decreased $69.9 million or 32%, from $219.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $149.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 was
30% compared to 32% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in the effective tax rate was
primarily due to larger depletion allowances in 2013 due to increased production.
Net Income
Net income decreased $44.8 million, or 30%, from $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to
$104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the factors noted above.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $26.1 million, or 8% from $318.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to
$292.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to a decrease in segment contribution

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal liquidity requirements historically have been to service our debt, to meet our working capital
and capital expenditure needs, to finance acquisitions and to occasionally pay dividends to our stockholders.
We have met our liquidity and capital investment needs with funds generated through operations and through
incremental borrowings.
We believe that cash generated through operations and our financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet
working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments for at least the
next 12 months. As of June 30, 2014 we had $52.2 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. See
“—Credit Facilities” for more information regarding our revolving credit facility.
Working Capital
Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our
ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $170.9 million at December 31, 2013
and $232.3 million at June 30, 2014. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of
December 31, 2012 and 2013 and June 30, 2014:

Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable increased $23.5 million from $123.4 million at December 31, 2012 to $146.9 million at
December 31, 2013, primarily due to sales under the FTSI Supply Agreement. Accounts receivable increased
$62.9 million from $146.9 million at December 31, 2013 to $209.8 million at June 30, 2014. December sales and
accounts receivable are typically lower than at other points in the year due to seasonal weather conditions.
However, weather conditions during December 2013 were unusually severe, causing significant logistics
challenges that limited our ability to fulfill customer orders. Further, revenues increased each month during
the first half of 2014, also contributing to the increase in accounts receivable since December 31, 2013.
Inventory
Inventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. The cost of finished goods includes
processing costs and transportation costs to terminals. The increase in inventory from December 31, 2012 to
December 31, 2013 was primarily driven by a $25.5 million increase in finished goods, primarily due to
inventory held at terminals acquired in the FTSI transaction. The increase in inventory from $118.1 million at
December 31, 2013 to $127.4 million at June 30, 2014 was primarily due to a general increase in sales volume
and an increase in the number of distribution terminals to support customer needs.
Accounts Payable
The increase in accounts payable from $43.5 million at December 31, 2012 to $90.0 million at December 31,
2013 was primarily due to increased operating expenses related to the FTSI transaction and increased
production volumes from 2012 to 2013. There was no significant change in accounts payable from
December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2014.
Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses stayed relatively constant from $28.3 million at December 31, 2012 to $28.7 million at
December 31, 2013 to $29.2 million at June 30, 2014.

Net cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items,
including depreciation, depletion and amortization and the effect of working capital changes.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $50.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared
to $93.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013. This $43.7 million decrease was primarily the result of
accounts receivable increasing $62.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to an increase
of $13.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013.
Table of Contents

Net cash provided by operating activities was $174.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to $186.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. The $11.8 million decrease in cash provided by
operating activities was due primarily to a $44.8 million decrease in net income, partially offset by a decrease
in working capital for 2013 compared to 2012.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth and maintenance, and in certain
periods, investments to acquire strategic assets or businesses. Growth capital expenditures generally are for
expansions of production or terminal capacities or new greenfield development. Maintenance capital
expenditures generally are for asset replacement and health, safety and quality improvements.
Net cash used in investing activities was $60.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014, compared to
$161.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013. In the six months ended June 30, 2013, $120.3 million
was used for the Great Plains acquisition and the purchase of SSP LLC. The increase in capital expenditures
of $20.6 million from the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 was primarily due to investments in
production capacity for Propel SSP and distribution terminals.
Net cash used in investing activities was $579.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Investing
activities in the year ended December 31, 2013 included $347.7 million for the acquisition of the FTSI assets,
which significantly expanded our sand reserves and production capacity, $64.0 million for the Great Plains
acquisition and $56.3 million (including capitalized transaction costs of $1.3 million) for the acquisition of
SSP LLC. Capital expenditures for 2012 and 2013 were relatively unchanged at $109.0 million and $111.5
million, respectively. Maintenance capital spending was $12.3 million in 2012 and $17.5 million in 2013.
Capital investments in 2012 focused on expansion of our sand processing capacity and expansion of our
terminal network. Spending in 2013 focused on accelerating the expansion of our terminal infrastructure and
enhancing our unit train capabilities.
We anticipate that our capital expenditures in 2014 will be approximately $150 million, which is primarily
associated with the continued development of self-suspending proppant production facilities, construction of
distribution terminals, continued expansion of rail logistics, acquisition of mineral reserves and various
maintenance projects. The increase in capital expenditures from 2013 to 2014 resulted primarily from
increased spending on sand processing capacity, production capacity for Propel SSP and unit train
capabilities. The anticipated capital expenditures for the year may increase as we continue to evaluate
opportunities to expand our production capacities. We believe that cash flows from operations will be
sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures, but additional borrowings may be required to fund
larger expansion opportunities.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and repayments under our term loans and revolving
credit facility.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to
$70.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities in the six
months ended June 30, 2013 primarily relate to borrowings used to acquire Great Plains and purchase SSP
LLC. In order to improve liquidity, we borrowed $41.0 million under our term loans in February 2014 to repay
a similar amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also made payments of approximately
$2.3 million against capital lease obligations.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $410.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. This
primarily relates to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions of Great Plains and
the FTSI assets. The cash provided by financing activities is net of $14.2 million of financing costs.

Net cash used in financing activities was $119.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily related
to prepayments of long term debt.
Credit Facilities
On September 5, 2013, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (our “Credit
Agreement”) with Barclays Bank plc, as administrative agent. Our Credit Agreement contains a revolving
credit facility with a commitment amount of $75 million (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and two tranches of term
loans, pursuant to which we have borrowed $325 million in aggregate principal amount under the term B-1
facility (such loans, “Term B-1 Loans”) and $885 million in aggregate principal amount under a term B-2
facility (such loans, “Term B-2 Loans”). The proceeds of the borrowings under our Credit Agreement were
used to repay amounts outstanding under the previous credit facility and to fund the acquisition of the
proppant assets of FTSI.
The Term B-1 Loans mature on March 15, 2017 and requires quarterly principal repayments of $0.8 million (1%
annually) with the balance due at maturity. The Term B-2 Loans mature on September 5, 2019 and requires
quarterly principal repayments of $2.2 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. Borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on September 5, 2018. Until they were repriced in March 2014, the
Term B-1 Loans, the Term B-2 Loans and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest, at our
discretion, at either the base rate (the greater of prime rate, federal funds rate (subject to a 1.0% flow) plus
0.5%, 2%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus 3.0% or the adjusted Eurodollar Rate (subject to a 1.0% floor)
plus 4.0%. With respect to borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans and Revolving Credit Facility, the 2%
minimum for Base Rate borrowings and 1% for Eurodollar Rate borrowings did not apply. The applicable
margin on the loans could be reduced by 0.25% if our leverage ratio fell below 2.75.
The terms of our Credit Agreement provide for customary representations and warranties and affirmative
covenants. The credit facility also contains customary negative covenants setting forth limitations on further
indebtedness, liens, investments, disposition of assets, acquisitions, junior payments and restrictions on
subsidiary distributions. We must maintain a pro forma leverage ratio as of the end of each quarter of no
more than 4.75 if the aggregate revolver borrowing is equal to or greater than 25% of the total revolver
commitment. As of June 30, 2014, our pro forma leverage ratio was 3.7.
In February 2014 we executed a joinder agreement to borrow $41 million in aggregate principal amount of
additional Term B-2 Loans. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay then outstanding amounts
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The additional borrowings mature on the same date as the then existing
Term B-2 Loans (September 5, 2019) and the required quarterly principal repayments for the Term B-2 Loans
were increased by one-quarter of 1% of the amount borrowed with the balance due at maturity. There were no
other changes in the terms, interest rates or covenants of our Credit Agreement. In August 2014 we executed a
joinder agreement to increase the revolving commitment amount by $46.6 million. There were no other
changes in the terms, interest rates or covenants of our Credit Agreement.
In March 2014 we further amended our Credit Agreement to reduce the applicable margin for Term B-1 and B-2
Base Rate loans to 2.50% and for Term B-1 and B-2 Eurodollar Rate loans to 3.50%. As of June 30, 2014, Term
B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans and the borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 3.75%, 4.5%
and 4.25%, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources.

Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things,
hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the
protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future,
expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future
expenditures. We may also from time to time incur fines and penalties associated with noncompliance with
such laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2013, we had $2.7 million accrued for future reclamation costs.
We discuss certain environmental matters relating to our various production and other facilities, certain
regulatory requirements relating to human exposure to crystalline silica and our mining activity and how such
matters may affect our business in the future under “Business—Regulation and Legislation.”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and
assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may
materially differ from these estimates.
Listed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree
of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the
understanding of our operations.
Inventory Valuation
Certain subsidiaries value sand inventory at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method. All
other sand inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. Costs applied
Table of Contents
55
to inventory include direct excavation costs, processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and
depletion. Stockpile tonnages are calculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the
stockpile. Tonnages are verified periodically by an independent surveyor. Costs are calculated on a per ton
basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number of tons in the stockpile.
Depletion
We amortize the cost to acquire land and mineral rights using a units of production method, based on the
total estimated reserves and tonnage extracted each period.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related
facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements. We record the initial estimated
present value of reclamation costs as an asset retirement obligation and increase the carrying amount of the
related asset by a corresponding amount. We allocate reclamation costs to expense over the life of the related
assets and adjust the related liability for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either
the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for
more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our
property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate future undiscounted net cash flows using
estimates of proven sand reserves, estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices,
price trends and related factors) and operating costs and anticipated capital expenditures. If the undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Our estimates of prices, recoverable proven reserves and operating and capital costs are subject to certain
risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our long lived assets. Although we have made
our best estimate of these factors based on current conditions, it is reasonably possible that changes could
occur, which could adversely affect our estimate of the net cash flows expected to be generated from our
operating property. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012,
or the six-month period ended June 30, 2014.
Employee Benefit Plans
We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions. We record
annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting
principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of returns,
compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial assumptions
on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is
deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of the modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future
periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the plans, which are
presented in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus,
are reasonable based on advice from our actuaries and information as to assumptions used by other
employers.
Equity-Based Awards
Equity-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the award at grant date. Such
costs are recognized as expense over the corresponding requisite service period. The fair value of the awards
Table of Contents
56
granted was calculated based on a Black-Scholes valuation model. The application of this valuation model
involves inputs and assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of incentive
awards, which affects compensation expense related to these awards. These inputs and assumptions include
the value of a share of Fairmount Holdings, Inc. Class B common stock, the expected life of the option,
volatility and risk free rate over a period of time corresponding to the expected life of the option.
Value of underlying share—We use a combination of the guideline company approach and a discounted cash
flow analysis to determine the fair value of our stock. The key assumptions in this estimate include our
projections of future cash flows, company-specific cost of capital used as a discount rate, lack of
marketability discount, and qualitative factors to compare the company to comparable guideline companies.
During 2013, factors that contributed to changes in the underlying value of our stock included the continued
recovery of the oil and gas fracking market, changes to future cash flows projected from the recent
acquisitions, increases in operating leverage due to increased debt, product mix including mix of raw versus
resin coated proppant, and other factors. As our operations are highly dependent on sales to the oil and gas
industry, the market conditions for this industry have a high degree of impact on the company’s value.
Expected volatility—This is a measure of the amount by which the price of various comparable companies’
common stock has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate, as the company’s common stock is not publicly
traded. The comparable companies were selected by analyzing public companies in the industry based on
various factors including, but not limited to, company size, financial data availability, active trading volume,
and capital structure.
Risk free interest rate—This is an interpolated rate from the U.S. constant maturity treasury rate for a term
corresponding to the time to the expected option life, as described below.
Expected option life—This is the period of time over which the options are expected to remain outstanding
before being exercised. Because we did not have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis to
estimate the expected life of the options, we used the simplified method, which assumes the expected life is
the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term.
Dividend yield—we have no current plans to declare a dividend that would require a dividend yield
assumption other than zero.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected
lives related to our equity-based compensation on a prospective basis and incorporating these factors into
our pricing model. However, once our shares are publicly traded, we will use the actual market price as an
input in the Black Scholes model, and will no longer estimate the value of the shares underlying the options.
The following is a summary of the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options
granted in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the aggregate intrinsic value of vested and unvested stock
options was $259.2 million and $136.1 million, respectively. The amount of unearned stock-based
compensation related to unvested stock options at December 31, 2013 and June 30, 2014 was $16.0 million
and $14.7 million, respectively. As of each of December 31, 2013 and June 30, 2014, the weighted-average
period over which the unearned stock based compensation expense related to stock options is expected to be
recognized was 2.4 years.
Table of Contents
Taxes
57
Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible
temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are
recognized for taxable temporary differences. This approach requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based upon
the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the expenses are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based
on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.
We recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as
the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted
periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and
new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are
identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management.
We evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation
allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the
likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that
could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income
might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect our ability to achieve
sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, a decline in sales or margins, increased
competition or loss of market share. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are
subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an
extended time to resolve. We believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.
The largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction
allowed for U.S. statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in
note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New accounting guidance that has been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, is included in note 1 to our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Swaps
Due to our variable-rate indebtedness, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We use interest rate
swaps to manage this exposure. These derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair
values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or in other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship
and, if it is, depending on the type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which we are hedging the
variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are
impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is
recognized in current period earnings.

Table of Contents
We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all such
instruments involve risk, including the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to
perform according to the terms of a contract (credit risk) or the possibility that future changes in market price
may make a financial instrument less valuable or more onerous (market risk). As is customary for these types
of instruments, we do not require collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments. In
management’s opinion, there is no significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance of the
counterparties to these financial instruments.

these agreements will have a notional value of $275 million increasing to $420 million between 2017 and 2019.
A hypothetical increase in interest rates by 1.0% would have increased our interest expense by $2.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2013.
Market Risk
We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk related to interest
rates is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not believe that inflation has a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations during periods covered by the financial
statements included in this prospectus.
Credit Risk
We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. For the year
ended December 31, 2013, our top two proppant customers, Halliburton and FTSI, accounted for
approximately 30% of our sales. Approximately 39% and 38% of our accounts receivable balance at December
31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was outstanding from just three customers. We examine the creditworthiness
of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit
analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may
request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees, although collateral is generally not required.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
If we fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, it could result in a material misstatement of our
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors
to lose confidence in our financial information or cause our stock price to decline.

INDUSTRY
The silica sand industry consists of businesses that are involved in the mining, processing and sale of silica
sand and silica sand-based products. Monocrystalline silica, also referred to as “silica,” “industrial sand and
gravel,” “silica sand” and “quartz sand,” is a term applied to sands and gravels containing a high percentage
of silica (also known as silicon dioxide or SiO2) in the form of quartz. Monocrystalline silica deposits with
widely varying physical characteristics occur throughout the United States, but mines and processing
facilities are typically located near developed rail infrastructure, which facilitates access to markets. Other
factors affecting the feasibility of monocrystalline silica production include deposit composition, product
quality specifications, land-use, environmental regulation, permitting requirements, access to electricity, gas
and water and a producer’s expertise and know-how.
The low relative cost and special properties of monocrystalline silica—chemistry, purity, grain size, color,
inertness, hardness and resistance to high temperatures—make it critical to a variety of industries and end-
use markets, the production of molds and cores for metal castings, glass production and the manufacturing
of building products. In particular, monocrystalline silica is a key input in the hydraulic fracturing techniques
used in the development of oil and gas resource basins.
Oil and Gas Proppant End Market Dynamics
Advances in oil and gas extraction techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have
allowed for significantly greater extraction of oil and gas trapped within shale formations. The hydraulic
fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a well at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the
targeted hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation in order to increase the flow rate of hydrocarbons from the well.
A granular material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture,
“propping” it open once high-pressure pumping stops. The proppant-filled fracture creates a conductive
channel through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then
to the surface. Proppants therefore perform the vital function of promoting the flow, or conductivity, of
hydrocarbons over a well’s productive life. In fracturing a well, operators select a proppant that is
transportable into the fracture, is compatible with frac and wellbore fluids, permits acceptable cleanup of frac
fluids and can resist proppant flowback. In addition, the proppant must be resistant to crushing under the
earth’s closure stress and reservoir temperature.

There are three primary types of proppant that are utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand,
resin coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads. Current in-basin delivered prices for proppant range
between $80 to $120 per ton for raw frac sand, $350 to $550 per ton for resin coated sand and $500 to $900 per
ton for ceramics. Customers choose among these proppant types based on the geology of the reservoir,
expected well pressures, proppant flowback concerns and product cost. Given these price differences and
well specific considerations, E&P companies are continually evaluating the optimal mix of lower cost, lower
conductivity frac sand and higher cost, higher conductivity resin coated sand and ceramics in order to best
address the geology of the well and to maximize well productivity and economic returns. The following chart
illustrates the composition of the U.S. market for proppant by type:

Proppant Characteristics
API specification proppants must meet stringent technical specifications set forth by the API including,
among others, coarseness, crush resistance, sphericity, roundness, acid solubility, purity and turbidity.
These characteristics are of particular importance because they have a significant impact on hydrocarbon
conductivity, and ultimately the production rate and profitability of a well. Conductivity is a function of the
permeability of the proppant and the width of the fracture, which dictates the proppant’s ability to prop open a
fracture and allow hydrocarbons to flow. Some of the key characteristics impacting conductivity are:
Coarseness. Proppant grain size is critical to hydraulic fracturing operations in order to satisfy down-hole
conditions and well completion design. Mesh size is used to describe proppant grain size and is determined
by sieving the proppant through screens with uniform openings corresponding to the desired grain size. The
vast majority of products range from 12 to 100 mesh (representing the number of openings per linear inch on
a sizing screen) and include standard sizes, such as 12/20, 16/30, 20/40, 30/50 and 40/70. To receive a
standard size designation, 90% of a particular batch of product must fall within the designated sieve sizes.
For example, for a proppant to be designated as 12/20 mesh, 90% of that proppant must pass through a 12
mesh sieve and be retained by a 20 mesh sieve. Larger, coarser proppants (such as 16/30, 20/40 and 30/50
mesh) are typically used in hydraulic fracturing processes targeting oil and liquids-rich natural gas recovery,
while smaller, finer proppants (such as 40/70 and higher mesh) are used primarily in dry gas drilling
applications. In general, notwithstanding strength characteristics, a larger and more uniformly distributed
proppant size will result in higher permeability and conductivity.
Crush Resistance. Crush resistance is an important factor in fracturing applications where downhole
pressures intensify. Proppant crush results in finer particles, or “fines,” which reduce permeability in the
Table of Contents

proppant pack and narrow the fracture width, all leading to reduced conductivity. Technical research suggests
that the crushing of just five percent of the frac sand in a fracture can reduce hydrocarbon flow conductivity
by 60%. Generally, the more pure the grain and the smaller its size, the better the proppant’s crush resistance.
Ideally, raw frac sand proppants should be nearly pure quartz, spherical, round and have a resistance to
crush sufficient to withstand the closure stress of lower to intermediate-pressure wells. Resin coated sand
proppants have a higher resistance to crush and are suitable for intermediate to high closure stress of up to
10,000 psi (12,000 psi in the case of PowerProp), and high strength ceramics have the greatest resistance to
crush and are suitable for intermediate to the highest closure stresses of up to 15,000 psi.
Proppant Shape and Uniformity. Proppant shape influences proppant pack space, permeability and
conductivity. For optimal long-term conductivity, the proppant particles should have an optimized spherical
shape and roundness (roundness is a measure of the relative sharpness of corners and curvatures), as well as
uniform size and shape distribution.
Low Acid Solubility. Proppant acid solubility is an indication of the amount of soluble materials (i.e.,
carbonates, feldspars, iron oxides and clays) present in the proppant which can potentially react with acid.
There are various frac related applications wherein the proppant may come into contact with acid. Therefore,
proppant stability in acidic environments can be an important attribute.
Purity. Purity is a measure of the content of monocrystalline silica within each grain of silica sand. The
greater the monocrystalline silica composition in a grain of silica sand, the stronger the grain and the lower
instances of chemical reactions.
Turbidity. Turbidity is a measure of the level of particles or fines in the proppant, such as silt and clay. High
turbidity can be an indication of poor proppant manufacturing, transportation or handling practices, or
inherent geological characteristics of the ultimate sand reserves. High-turbidity proppants can interfere with
fractures, negatively impacting conductivity.

Raw Frac Sand
Of the three primary types of proppant, raw frac sand represents the lowest cost and largest volume of
proppant supplied to oilfield service providers and E&P companies. Raw frac sand is ideally suited for wells
with relatively lower levels of closure pressure. Generally, raw frac sand is produced and sold in whole grain
(unground) form. There are two broad types of API spec raw frac sand: Northern White and brown, both of
which are produced by Fairmount Santrol.
Northern White frac sand is considered to be the highest quality raw frac sand available and is known for its
high crush resistance, roundness and sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure. Northern White frac
sand exists predominantly in the upper Midwest region of the United States (including Wisconsin, Illinois and
Minnesota). Fairmount Santrol’s Northern White sand is a spherical monocrystalline that is 99.8%+ pure-
quartz and has superior conductivity and crush resistance compared to other types of raw frac sand.
Brown sand is less monocrystalline in nature and more angular than Northern White sand. Brown sand
consists of both API and non API-spec material. API-spec brown sand, such as Fairmount Santrol’s Texas
Gold sand, is mined from the Hickory Formation near Brady, Texas. Brown sand typically has lower crush
resistance than Northern White, but is often sufficient for lower pressure wells. Due to its proximity to the
well, Fairmount’s Texas Gold has a meaningful delivered cost advantage into key basins in South and West
Texas, including the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin.
Resin Coated Sand
Resin coated frac sand consists of raw frac sand that is coated with a resin that increases the sand’s crush
resistance and reduces the likelihood of crushed sand dispersing throughout the fracture. Resin coated sand
withstands significant reservoir pressures and results in higher conductivity than raw frac sand.
Consequently, resin coated sand is ideally suited for wells with intermediate to high levels of closure stress,
or for wells where reducing proppant flowback is a key consideration. By reducing proppant flowback, resin
coated sand reduces the potential downtime and cost of a well as well as increasing long term productivity of
the well.
The strength and shape of resin coated product is largely influenced by the material science underlying the
resin coating and the process technology in how the resins are applied. Tempered (or precured) resin coated
sand primarily enhances crush resistance, thermal stability and chemical resistance, allowing the sand to
perform under harsh downhole conditions, including withstanding medium to high closure pressures of up to
10,000 psi (12,000 psi in the case of PowerProp) and encapsulating fines which are inherently created
downhole. In addition to the value-added characteristics of tempered resin coated proppant, curable (or
bonding) resin coated frac sand uses a resin that is designed to bond together under closure stress and high
temperatures, preventing proppant flowback and reducing imbedment.
Manufactured Ceramic Proppant
Manufactured ceramic proppant is a product of comparatively consistent size and spherical shape that
typically offers the highest crush resistance relative to other types of proppants. As a result, ceramic proppant
is most often used in the medium to highest pressure (up to 15,000 psi in the case of high strength ceramics)
and temperature drilling environments. Ceramic proppant derives its product strength from the molecular
structure of its underlying raw material and is designed to withstand extreme heat, depth and pressure
environments. The deepest, highest temperature and highest pressure wells typically require heavy weight
ceramics with high alumina/bauxite content and coarser mesh sizes. The lower crush resistant ceramic
proppants are lighter weight and derived from kaolin clay, with densities closer to raw frac sand.

Proppant Selection
The selection of proppant to maximize hydrocarbon productivity in a well involves a multi-variant
optimization decision, driven by drilling factors and challenges, which include hydrocarbon type, geologic
attributes, well depth and lateral lengths, heat, and pressure, among others. As fracture lengths and pressures
increase, fracturing challenges multiply. Well engineers today are rapidly accelerating their ability to utilize
mixes of proppant in order to address the challenges, while also balancing the tradeoff of cost.
Challenges
Ability to Resist Pressure
Optimizing Size and Shape
Minimizing Flowback
Minimizing Proppant Fines
Maintaining Width of Fracture
Proppant Selection Considerations
•        Stronger, proppants such as resin coated sand and ceramics are less
likely to crush under higher pressures in each case, providing better
conductivity
•        Larger proppant grains typically offer greater conductivity, as does
sphericity, roundness and uniformity of size
•        Smaller, lighter grains typically can be carried deeper into the
formation, enhancing the overall surface area of the fracture
•        Resin coating provides a seal to the proppant pack, reducing flowback
•        Proppant fines, and their resulting migration in the fractures,
contribute to reduced permeability and well performance
•        Resin coated proppants, and particularly curable resin coated
proppants, generate more uniform stress distribution throughout the pack
and are less likely to create fines
•        Resin coating also encapsulates fines that are generated under
pressure
•        Under closure stress, proppant grains and particularly ceramic
proppant grains embed into the surrounding rock, especially in soft shale
formations
•        This embedment reduces the width of the fracture and the overall
surface area of the fracture, as well as reduces the permeability of the
proppant pack
•        Resin coating reduces proppant embedment by providing a broader
point of contact between the proppant and the reservoir as well as proppant
to proppant contact
Minimizing Chemical Reactions
•        Proppant diagenesis occurs as the proppant, under heat and pressure,
reacts with the fracturing fluids and/or formation face to degrade the
Reduced Proppant Scaling
proppant
•        Improved coating technologies and sand with a high monocrystalline
silica composition experience lower diagenesis
•        Minerals from the water and the formation can attach to the surface of
the proppant grains, forming deposits (“scaling”) and reducing proppant pack
permeability
•        Resin coating improves resistance to scaling

Proppant Industry-Demand Trends
The following trends have favorably influenced proppant demand growth.
Increasing drilling activity and wells per rig
Over the past decade, E&P companies have increasingly focused on exploiting the vast hydrocarbon reserves
contained in North America’s oil and gas reservoirs. While the well counts have remained relatively stable,
drilling activity and the number of wells per rig has increased dramatically through the increased use of pad
drilling. With the establishment of advanced techniques such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing,
E&P companies initially focused on establishing and delineating their large acreage positions. Using these
advanced techniques, their development plans were largely driven by a desire to grow production quickly, but
were not yet optimized for maximum efficiency and economic returns.
Increasing proppant intensity
In recent years, with their acreage positions largely established, E&P companies have evolved their capital
plans to focus on full-scale, long term development, with the underlying goals of increased efficiencies and
optimizing their returns on invested capital. This has led to new development techniques, such as longer
lateral lengths and shorter intervals between frac stages, which results in more fracturing stages per well. In
addition, the amount of proppant used per stage has increased dramatically, compounding the increase in
total demand for proppant.
In recent months, individual wells have been completed with more than 6,000 tons of proppant, which is the
equivalent of 60 railcars or 240 truckloads. This represents a several fold increase in large scale completions
from just a few years ago. Given all of the factors above, we believe that demand for proppant will continue to
grow.
Opportunity for more resin coated proppant use to improve well economics
In addition to evolving well construction techniques, E&P companies are increasingly focused on proppant
selection as a means to improve recovery rates and return on investment. Optimized proppant selection can
enable them to increase fracture surface areas and contact with the reservoir, while improving the
permeability and porosity of the proppant pack, both of which provide improved well recoveries.
Specifications for proppant type and quantity can be made by E&P companies, oilfield service companies, or
collaboratively. These specifications often call for increasing amounts of proppant per well, but also the
incorporation of a broader selection of proppant types, a wider range of mesh sizes, and a selection of high
performance proppants to tailor the proppant solution to specific geologic characteristics of the well.
Furthermore, both E&P companies and oilfield service companies are investing in value-added proppants
when the improvement in well production and efficiencies justifies the increased proppant investment. These
recent trends are resulting in increased demand for resin coated proppants which provide enhanced
performance characteristics relative to raw sand but at a lower cost than ceramic proppants.
As a result of the trends described above, the global proppant market has increased rapidly over the past 10
years, with the U.S. being the single largest consumer of proppants. The Freedonia Group estimates that in
2013 the U.S. sand proppant market was approximately 31.4 million tons with annual sales of $3.3 billion.
This represented an average annual volume growth rate of 27% from 2008 to 2013. The Freedonia Group also
estimates that total annual proppant sales will exceed 49 million tons in 2018 and 74 million tons by 2023,
representing average annual growth rates of 9.4% and 9.0% over 2013 volumes, respectively. Raw frac sand
and resin coated sand are expected to drive a growth in overall proppant demand with annual growth rates
from 2013 to 2018 of 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively.

Proppant Industry – Supply Trends
As demand for proppants has increased dramatically in recent years, the supply of quality API-spec raw frac
sand has struggled to keep pace, resulting, at times, in a market with limited, if any, excess capacity. While a
number of existing and new proppant vendors have announced supply expansions and greenfield projects,
we do not expect the magnitude of these supply expansions to fully meet the expected growth in demand.
There are numerous key constraints to increasing raw frac sand production on an industry-wide basis,
including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the difficulty of finding frac sand deposits that meet API specifications;
the difficulty of securing contiguous frac sand reserves large enough to justify the capital investment required to
develop a processing facility;
the challenges of identifying reserves with the above characteristics that are either located in close proximity to
oil and gas reservoirs or have rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins;
the hurdles of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits
from the proper authorities;
local opposition to the development of mining facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road
transportation, including moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in multiple counties in Wisconsin and Minnesota
which hold potential sand reserves; and
proximity to logistics infrastructure and the ability to develop comprehensive logistics capabilities.
Proppant Industry – Logistics Trends
E&P companies’ and oilfield service providers’ preferences and expectations have been evolving in recent
years. A proppant vendor’s logistics capabilities have become an important differentiating factor when
competing for business, on both a spot and contract basis. Many of our customers increasingly seek
convenient in-basin proppant delivery capability from their proppant supplier. We believe that, over time,
proppant customers will prefer to consolidate their purchases across a smaller group of suppliers with robust
logistics capabilities and a broad offering of high performance proppants.
I&R Industry Trends
Demand in the I&R end markets is relatively stable and is primarily influenced by key macroeconomic drivers
such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity and industrial production. The
economic downturn beginning in 2008 decreased demand in the foundry, building products and glassmaking
end markets, however, the recent economic recovery has significantly increased demand in these same end
markets. The primary end markets served by our I&R Products segment are foundry, building products,
sports and recreation, glassmaking and filtration.

BUSINESS
We are one of the world’s largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for over 30 years have been
a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by oilfield service and E&P companies to
enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. Fairmount Santrol offers the broadest range of proppants
available in the market today, including high quality sand and a spectrum of resin coated products, all of
which exceed API specifications. Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies
have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to
end users in the I&R markets. We believe our two primary market segments are complementary. Our ability to
sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the economic recovery
of our reserve base.
As one of the nation’s longest continuously operating mining organizations, we have developed a strong
commitment to environmental stewardship and to the three pillars of Sustainable Development: People,
Planet and Prosperity. Our strong commitment to safety is reflected in the health and safety of our employees
and is illustrated by having achieved a lost-time incident rate that is less than half the industry average. From
2011 through June 30, 2004, our employees have demonstrated our commitment to our communities by
donating approximately 36,000 hours of company-paid volunteer time, as well as significant personal
volunteer time, into the communities in which we live and operate. We are focused on environmental
stewardship, and ten of our facilities now generate zero waste to landfills. Additionally, we have successfully
executed annual initiatives to reduce our carbon emissions and have planted over 225,000 trees since 2011 in
order to offset our Tier I and Tier II carbon emissions. We believe adhering to sustainable development
principles is not only the right thing to do, but also results in a higher level of engagement and commitment
from our employees, better relationships with our communities and, as a result, a stronger base from which
to pursue profitable growth over the long-term. Abiding by these guiding principles, our corporate motto is
“Do Good. Do Well.”
We began investing in large scale proppant production capacity in the early 1980s, leveraging our early
industry relationships with Halliburton and a predecessor company to Baker Hughes. Since then, our
business, and particularly our Proppant Solutions segment, has grown significantly. Today we have vertically
integrated operations that combine mining, sand processing, and resin manufacturing and coating operations
with a broad logistics network and state-of-the-art research and development capabilities. Our ability to
leverage our integrated asset base to provide comprehensive proppant solutions has allowed us to become a
long-term, trusted partner to our customers.
Our primary attributes include:
•
•
Sand Reserves and Processing Assets. We have one of the largest sand reserves and processing asset bases
in the industry, including, as of December 31, 2013, 798.2 million tons of proven mineral reserves, 11 active sand
processing facilities with 12.3 million tons of annual sand processing capacity, a resin manufacturing facility and
11 coating facilities with 2.4 million tons of annual coating capacity. From 2009 to 2013, we expanded our annual
raw frac sand and coating capacities by approximately 6.0 million and 1.5 million tons, respectively, through a
combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our coating facilities include operations in Mexico, Denmark and
China, through which we serve international oil and gas markets.
Product Delivery. We are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America’s major oil and gas
producing basins and we also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge and trucks to reach our customers
in certain basins. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 46 proppant distribution terminals with
significant associated storage, 32 of which exclusively handle our products. Since 2011, we have developed or
acquired 24 distribution terminals, providing significant additional annual transloading capacity. We also service
I&R end markets through seven additional terminals. As of August 15, 2014, we currently have a private fleet of
over 8,500 railcars and expect this fleet to grow to
68

•
over 13,000 through 2016. By the end of the third quarter of 2014, we also expect to have expanded our unit train
capabilities to three production facilities and three in-basin terminals, which we expect to reduce freight costs and
improve cycle times for our railcar fleet.
Customers. We currently have approximately 80 proppant customers, including the largest U.S. pressure
pumping companies, and a total of nearly 850 customers across all end markets. Our goal is to create long-term,
partnering relationships with our customers. We sell product on a purchase order basis and through supply
agreements. The majority of our proppant supply agreements have market-based pricing and volumetric
provisions based on our customer’s requirements, which we believe has strengthened our customer relationships
over multiple market cycles.
Innovation. We have an established history of proppant innovation and we continue to make substantial
investments in engineering, research and development and technical marketing. We pioneered the manufacturing
and use of resin coated proppant and continue to introduce new and innovative products. For example,
PowerProp, our coated product with the greatest crush resistance has characteristics competitive with lightweight
ceramics. We are currently field testing a brand new technology, Propel SSP. This proppant transport technology
is a new proppant category in which a polymer, wrapped around sand or ceramic, swells upon contact with water.
The shear-stable polymer suspends the proppant in water, transporting each grain farther and higher into
fractures. Polymer breaking occurs with conventional chemistry. This better transport expands the hydrocarbon
drainage radius with a maximized propped fracture area to increase ultimate recovery.
We are experiencing high demand for our products and our business is currently experiencing significant
growth. Our revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% and 25% since
2004 and 2009, respectively. Since 2011, our revenues have grown at a rate of 4% as the market for resin-
coated products softened. We have seen considerable strengthening in both the raw and resin-coated markets
in 2014, and our revenues for the first six months of this year are up by 40% compared to the same period last
year (please see “Results of Operations” beginning on page 47 for further discussion of factors impacting our
revenue growth).
For the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold over 7.5 million tons, generated $988 million in revenues,
$293 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $105 million of net income. We cannot provide any assurance that we
will achieve these growth rates or margins in the future. For a definition of “Adjusted EBITDA” and a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), please read “—Prospectus
Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Operating Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
beginning on page 10.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well positioned to execute our strategy based on the following competitive strengths:
A Leading Proppant Producer; Broadest Product Suite. We have a broad suite of products that address more
than 90% of the proppant market. We are one of the largest producers of API spec raw frac sand and
according to PacWest Consulting Partners, we were the second largest supplier of raw frac sand, and the
largest supplier of resin coated sand in 2013 based on our production capacity and coating capacity,
respectively. Our raw sand product suite includes all mesh sizes of high performing API-spec Northern White
frac sand and our branded API-spec Texas Gold brown frac sand, which enjoys a delivered cost advantage to
certain basins, including the Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. Our portfolio of resin coated products
provides a range of strength, flowback and conductivity characteristics. Our product breadth allows us to offer
a comprehensive proppant solution across a broad range of well characteristics and our scale provides us
with the flexibility to fill large individual orders, often on short notice. As proppant consumption per well has
increased, and completion solutions are increasingly tailored, we believe that our scale and product breadth
provide us with a competitive advantage.
Industry’s Largest Captive Terminal Footprint and Broadest Logistics Capabilities. In recent years, oilfield
service companies have increasingly sought proppant suppliers with logistics capabilities to deliver

product in-basin. We sell our proppants directly to customers in North America’s major oil and gas producing
basins through our 46 proppant distribution terminals, the largest logistics network in the industry. In 2013,
approximately 80% of our proppant volume was sold in-basin at one of our distribution terminals, compared
to approximately 65% in 2012. We ship our products via all of North America’s Class I railroads in our fleet of
more than 8,500 railcars as of August 15, 2014, which includes approximately 790 railcars made available to
us by our customers. By the third quarter of 2014, we expect to have expanded our unit train capabilities to
three of our processing facilities and three of our in-basin terminals. We expect these unit train capabilities
will reduce our freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet. We also have the flexibility to ship
our product via barge and truck to multiple basins. Importantly, over 70% of our terminal capacity exclusively
handles our products. Taken together, we believe the significant scale our distribution network, its
geographic scope, and our captive terminal strategy provide us with a competitive advantage.
Focus on Innovation and New Product Development. We have a history of collaborating with our customers to
develop innovative solutions to enhance the effectiveness of well completions, from conventional wells to the
most complex, multi-stage, horizontal wells. Our vertically integrated model allows us to participate in each
phase of proppant development, manufacturing and delivery and provides us a unique perspective into the
current and future needs of our customers. Our technical sales team works closely with market participants to
demonstrate the value proposition of our performance proppants in order to stimulate market demand. In
1976, our predecessor pioneered the development of resin coated proppants and we have been issued
numerous related patents. Our product developments include OptiProp, SLC, THS, PowerProp and CoolSet,
each with uniquely tailored down-hole performance characteristics. After acquiring the technology that
underlies Propel SSP in May 2013, our team worked to further refine the product’s technology and
manufacturing techniques. We have successfully produced and shipped Propel SSP product in commercial
quantities to several key customers who are currently testing the product in field trials.
Trusted Partner to Our Customers. We are a trusted partner and have significant long-term relationships with
each of the four largest U.S. pressure pumping companies, who together represent approximately 65% of the
market, as well as many small and mid-sized oilfield service companies. These customer relationships are
driven by our ability to enhance our customers’ operations and profitability by delivering a full suite of high-
quality proppant products, where, when and as-needed. These benefits also extend to the E&P companies
serviced by our service company customers, who directly benefit from the enhanced well productivity that our
products offer. We believe our customers value the ability of our substantial scale, product diversity and
extensive logistics network to meet their evolving proppant needs.
Efficient Operations and Economies of Scale Support Strong Cash Flow Generation. Our vertically integrated
operations, low production costs and low maintenance capital expenditures have enabled us to be profitable
and generate positive cash flows over an extended period. We own a substantial majority of our reserves, and
our processing plants are located on or in close proximity to rail access, reducing the need for on-road
transportation and minimizing product movement costs. Our integrated logistics management expertise and
geographically advantaged facility network enables us to reliably ship products by the most cost-effective
method available. We believe our significant and growing cash flow will enable us to continue to invest in
additional sand production, processing, coating and terminal facilities as well as research and development
for new products.
Experienced Management Team Aligned with Stockholders. We have an experienced leadership team with
extensive industry knowledge and a proven track record of profitable growth. Our executive management team
has developed new product offerings and process technologies, and has grown our business through
greenfield mine development, capacity expansions, acquisitions and investments in logistics infrastructure.
Most of our executive management team has been at Fairmount Santrol for 20 years or more, and as of
December 31, 2013 our revenue had grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 14% and 25%
since 1994 and 2009, respectively. Our founders remain active advisors to our management and are members
of our board of directors.

70
Pro forma for this offering, our management, employees and founders will own approximately     % of our
outstanding common stock. Accordingly, our executive management team and our employees are aligned
with our investors and highly incentivized to pursue long-term, profitable growth and a high return on capital
deployed.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to create long-term and sustainable value for our stakeholders. We intend to pursue this
objective through the execution of the following strategies:
Increase Reserves and Processing Capacity. We have historically grown our reserves and mining and
processing capacities by developing greenfield sites, expanding existing facilities and acquiring operating
assets and reserves. From 2009 to 2013, we expanded our annual raw frac sand capacity by approximately
6.0 million tons and our annual coating capacity by 1.3 million tons. Currently, we believe our customers’
demand for our products exceeds our production capacity. Accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in
production capacity and new reserves. In 2013, we acquired an idled 1.0 million ton per year frac sand
processing facility in Brewer, Missouri from FTSI and expect to resume operations at this facility within the
next six months. We also expect to increase annual frac sand production capacity at a current facility by
1.5 million tons by the end of the first quarter of 2016. In addition to these expansions, we control, or have an
option to control, additional reserves on four properties (three with Northern White reserves, one with Texas
Gold) and expect to develop one or two frac sand facilities or these greenfield sites by mid-2016. In order to
ensure that we have adequate capacities and reserves to meet future demand, we have an active pipeline of
expansion opportunities in varying stages of development. We currently have 2.4 million tons of annual
coating capacity and are in the process of expanding these capacities by an additional 0.8 million tons per
year by the fourth quarter of 2015. We will continue to evaluate the opportunity to expand coating capacity
based on market demand for coated products.
Expand Logistics Capabilities. Since 2011, we have developed or acquired 24 distribution terminals,
providing 13.1 million tons of additional annual transloading capacity. We will continue to invest in terminals,
storage and rail infrastructure as our customers continue to demand more product delivered closer to
producing basins. We will also continue to enhance our unit train capabilities to reduce freight costs and
improve cycle times for our railcar fleet. Since 2009, we have increased our railcar fleet by approximately
140% and we expect to increase the size of our railcar fleet by over 35% through the second half of 2015 to
accommodate our growing asset base and evolving customer demands.
Increase Market Penetration of Our Resin Coated Proppants. We believe that resin coated proppants offer
compelling performance advantages relative to other proppants. Our field data indicates that high quality
resin coated proppants enhance oil and gas reservoir conductivity compared to raw sand and are a cost-
effective alternative to lightweight ceramic proppants. Field data also indicate that resin coated proppants
reduce proppant flowback. Our resin coating capacity is the largest in the industry, providing our customers
enhanced assurance of supply. Due to superior performance and value added formulation and manufacturing
processes, sales of our resin coated products generate a higher per ton profit as compared to our raw frac
sand. We will continue to work with market participants by hosting technical sales meetings, obtaining field
data, and producing scientific papers which highlight the value proposition of resin coated proppant.
Through these efforts, we will seek to increase overall market penetration of our resin coated proppant.
Develop and Commercialize High Performance Proprietary Proppants. We pioneered the manufacturing and
use of resin coated proppants and have a history of developing innovative technologies that increase the
effectiveness of downhole completions, from conventional wells to the most complex, multi-stage horizontal
wells. In 2012, we made a significant investment in a new state-of-the-art research and development facility
and strengthened our team of scientists, material engineers and process engineers focused on developing
innovative and proprietary proppants. As a result of our commitment, our new product development record is
strong. For example, we successfully developed and commercialized PowerProp, a patented resin coated
sand proppant with characteristics competitive with lightweight ceramic proppants, and CoolSet, a resin
coated sand proppant that
Table of Contents
71
works at low temperatures with no chemical activators. Additionally, we are currently conducting field trials
for Propel SSP after developing a commercialized processing capability and we expect full commercial
launch by early 2015. We are in constant dialogue with our customers regarding evolving product needs and
have a number of new products in various stages of development.
Execute All of Our Corporate Initiatives with a Commitment to Customers, Employees and Communities. Our
corporate culture emphasizes People, Planet and Prosperity, and our sustainability strategy defines our
approach to operations and community engagement. We work to minimize our environmental impact and
continue to find ways to reduce waste while also reducing operating costs. We are honored to receive
recognition from our communities for our focus on sustainable mining practices, reclamation and community
investment. We believe that positive community engagement is both a privilege and a responsibility, and that
it enhances our ability to recruit and retain employees, obtain mining and other operating permits and
strengthen relationships with our customers. Our corporate motto is “Do Good. Do Well.” and we intend to
continue to execute our growth strategy with a focus on sustainable development.
Our Products
We provide a wide range of high quality silica sands to various industries, including oil and gas and I&R end
markets. We believe our two primary business segments are complementary. Our ability to sell to a wide
range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base
within our mining operations and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.
Proppant Solutions Segment
We offer proppant products in each of the most common API specified proppant categories, which we believe
address more than 90% of the proppant market. In 2013, The Freedonia Group estimated that raw frac sand
comprised approximately 81% of the proppant market, resin coated sand comprised approximately 11% of the
market and ceramic comprise approximately 7% of the market. We offer a resin coated ceramic product that
competes in this segment of the ceramic market. The following chart demonstrates the proppant markets
segments that our sand-based proppants address:

API-Spec Northern White Frac Sand. Our Northern White frac sand is mined from deposits located in our
Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota facilities. These reserves are generally characterized by high purity,
significant roundness and sphericity and low turbidity. These reserves are referred to as “Northern White”
sands and are produced in all standard mesh sizes, including 12/20, 16/30, 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh.
All of our Northern White raw sand proppant products meet the standards set by the API.
API-Spec Brown Frac Sand. Our API-spec brown sand reserves are located in Texas and are sourced from the
Hickory Formation. We market this sand under the name “Texas Gold” and sell it in standard mesh sizes
consistent with our Northern White frac sand. Our Texas Gold frac sand has lower crush resistance than our
Northern White frac sand, but it is an effective solution for low pressure wells. These reserves are in close
proximity to major oil and gas producing basins in Texas, including the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian
Basin, which provides them with a significant transportation cost advantage relative to API spec frac sand
sourced from more distant locations.
Resin Coated Proppant. We coat a portion of our API-spec sand with resin to enhance its performance as a
proppant using proprietary resin formulations and coating technologies. Our resin coated proppants are
generally used in higher temperature and higher pressure well environments and are marketed to end users
who require increased conductivity in higher pressure wells, high crush resistance and/or enhanced flowback
control in order to enhance the productivity of their wells. Independent technical research has quantified the
conductivity advantage from resin coated sand and our resin coated proppant, PowerProp versus raw sand as
depicted in the chart below.
Relative Conductivity Over a Range of Closure Pressures
Source: Company data
Our resin coated sand products are sold as both tempered (or precured) and curable (or bonding) products.
Curable proppants help to prevent flowback by distributing stress in the fracture and by reducing crushing
and the generation of crushed sand grains, commonly known as “fines.” For certain resin products, the
resin’s chemical properties are triggered by the introduction of an activator into the frac fluid. Tempered
products do not
Table of Contents
73
require activation as their chemical properties are already active. We formulate, manufacture and sell
activators which work with the specific chemistry of our resins.
We manufacture proprietary coatings designed to address the evolving needs of our customers, and have
recently invested significantly in our research and development and technical marketing capabilities to
maximize the sales of our coated products. We also coat ceramic proppant purchased from third-party
suppliers. This product is marketed as HyperProp and has the strength characteristics of ceramic and the
flowback performance characteristics of resin coated sand.
Recent Proprietary Performance Products
PowerProp. Our PowerProp product was introduced in late 2010 as a unique resin coated sand product with
higher crush resistance and conductivity than any other sand-based proppant available on the market.
PowerProp utilizes our existing resin coating facilities and proprietarily developed resin chemistry to create
substantially increased product performance.
During in-house testing, PowerProp exhibited performance characteristics similar to or better than lightweight
ceramics which allows us to compete in that market segment. Based on further in-house testing, in an API dry
crush comparison, our PowerProp product exhibited less than 3% crush at 10,000 psi as compared to greater
than 10% crush for a competing lightweight ceramic product. PowerProp also performed more favorably than
lightweight ceramics at other pressures between 6,000 psi and 12,000 psi. Similarly, in alternative testing
designed to better simulate downhole pressure, temperature and chemical conditions, PowerProp exhibited
approximately 2% crush at 10,000 psi as compared to approximately 10% crush for a competing lightweight
ceramic product.
Propel SSP. Our Propel SSP product utilizes a polymer coating applied to a proppant substrate. Upon contact
with water, the coating hydrates and swells rapidly to create a hydrogel around the proppant substrate. The
hydrogel layer, which is primarily water, is attached to the proppant particle and provides a nearly threefold
increase in the hydrostatic radius of the proppant. Initial test results indicate that the lower specific gravity
allows greater volumes of proppant and/or coarser mesh sizes coated with Propel SSP to be carried deep into
the fracture, which in turn allow more hydrocarbons to escape into the wellbore. This technology reduces or
eliminates the need for certain frac fluid additives, including guar, which are used to enhance the transport of
proppants into the geologic formation.

The graphic below illustrates, as a guideline, up to what closure pressures different raw sand and resin
coated proppant products perform efficiently. A proppant’s actual performance (crush rate, flow back control,
etc.) is subject to a range of factors beyond closure pressure, including temperature, pressure, well depth and
other geological and engineering characteristics.

I&R Products
We provide high quality sand and coated products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to
the following primary end markets served by our I&R Products segment: foundry, building products, sports
and recreation, glassmaking and filtration.
Foundry. We currently supply the foundry industry with multiple grades of high purity, round, angular and
sub-angular sands for molding and core making applications, with products sold primarily in the U.S.,
Canada, Mexico, Japan and China. Foundry sands are characterized by high purity, round and sub-angular
sands precisely screened to perform under a variety of metal casting conditions. These factors dictate the
refractory level and physical characteristics of the mold and core, which have a significant effect on the
quality of the castings produced in the foundry. Our resin binders provide the necessary bonding of molds
and cores in casting applications and are designed to improve overall productivity and environment
conditions in the workplace.
Our extensive production experience and technical knowledge of the foundry industry have driven several
industry advances. For example, we have developed our Signature Series of low smoke, low odor resin
coated sands that provide lower overall emissions while providing a safer and more favorable work
environment. Our expertise with resin coated sands enables us to provide coated sand for molds and cores
where exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface finish are required.
75
Table of Contents
We believe we were the first sand operator to blend sands, which has proven a successful product for use in
specialty iron and aluminum applications. As foundries continue to utilize higher cost binders to improve the
quality of their castings and minimize the use of binders (which also reduces overall environmental impact),
the industry continues to demand higher quality sands to realize the value of these binders. Our chemists and
technicians support these applications with customized products that minimize binder usage, resulting in
lower costs to foundries and higher prices for our products.
Glass. We provide a wide variety of high purity, low iron silica sands to the glass market.
Building Products. Various grades and types of our sands are used for roofing shingles, asphalt, industrial
flooring ballast sand, bridge decking, pipe lining and tank underlayment. We also work with our customers to
blend minerals and chemicals to create colored flooring aggregates, concrete countertops, grout and plaster.
Sports and Recreation. We are a leading supplier of various turf and landscape infill products to contractors,
municipalities, nurseries and mass merchandisers. Our turf products are used in multiple major sporting
venues, including Cleveland Browns Stadium, PNC Park, Notre Dame Stadium and Progressive Field. In
addition, we are a significant supplier of bunker sand, top dressing sands and all-purpose sands to golf clubs
and landscape contractors throughout North America. The sub angular shape of our sands provides for
excellent drainage and resistance to crushing and allows the grains to hold well to bunker sides and slopes.
Our sands are also supplied to horse tracks and training facilities. We also provide colored and private
labeled sand directly to a variety of major retailers for use as play sand and arts and crafts.
Filtration. We provide high-quality industrial sands and gravels in a wide variety of water and wastewater
filtration applications. Over the past several years, we increased our focus on the filtration market. Our full
range of products are monitored with an active statistical process control program to ensure compliance with
all government and customer specifications, including the American Water Works and National Sanitation
Foundation standards. Due to our efforts, we have emerged as a leader in sand and gravel products for
private, public and institutional water filtration systems.
Our Customers
Since our inception, we have remained focused on developing and sustaining a loyal, diversified customer
base. Currently, we maintain long-term relationships with many of the largest North American oilfield service
companies. We believe the strength of our customer base is driven by our collaborative approach to product
innovation and development, reputation for high-quality products and extensive logistics network. Certain of
our top customer relationships date back over 30 years. We have approximately 80 customers for our oil and
gas proppants and nearly 850 customers across all our end markets. For the year ended December 31, 2013
and the six-month period ending June 30, 2014, our top two proppant customers, Halliburton and FTSI,
accounted for approximately 30% and 36% of our sales, respectively. For a description of our agreements,
please read “—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
How We Generate Our Sales”.
Our Reserves
We control one of the largest bases of silica sand reserves in the United States. From our reserves, we are
able to produce a large selection of high-purity silica sand, lake sand, resin-coated sand, silica gravel and
other specialty sands. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Industry Guide 7,
reserves are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or
produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves are categorized into proven (measured) reserves
and probable (indicated) reserves which are defined as follows:
•
Proven (measured) reserves. Reserves for which (1) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops,
trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed
76
Table of Contents
•
sampling and (2) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic
character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.
Probable (indicated) reserves. Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from
information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and
measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower
than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Our reserves meet the definition of proven reserves in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. We estimate
that the company has approximately 798.2 million tons of proven recoverable mineral reserves as of
December 31, 2013. Mineral reserve estimated quantities and characteristics at our properties were developed
by an independent third party consulting company, GZA GeoEnvironmental Inc. Our reserve estimates are
based on in-place material. Our recovery rates are estimated internally. Prospective properties are surveyed,
drilled, and analyzed to determine the quality and quantity of the reserve. Reserve estimates were generally
determined based on a full reserve evaluation rather than an audit of previous work. Process and methods
were deterministic with methods ranging from simple calculations of area times thickness to obtain cubic
feet, multiplied times a sand density in pounds per cubic feet to obtain tons; to more complex methods
utilizing three dimensional modelling.
The following map identifies the location of our reserves and the associated mining or processing facilities:

We have developed a customized approach to both our mining activities and our reclamation philosophy. Our
Wedron, Illinois facility utilizes hydraulic mining techniques, which provide access to sands that can be
blended from different parts of the quarry. In Wisconsin, we utilize underground mining at our Bay City and
Maiden Rock facilities, and plan to do the same at our Diamond Bluff facility, thereby minimizing surface
disruption. In addition, we maintain certification with the Wildlife Habitat Counsel for our reclamation
methodology and have won numerous awards for our approach to restoring mined properties. For example,
we recently completed reclamation activities at a former mine in Michigan. At that site, which was donated
back to the state of Michigan, we worked with environmental consultants to harvest region-specific plants and
berries which were raised in a nursery and planted back on-site to ensure biological continuity with an
adjacent state park. We develop reclamation plans for each quarry for implementation concurrently with the
depletion of the mineral reserves.
Descriptions of Sand Facilities
The following is a detailed description of our nine active sand mining and processing operations facilities,
our currently undeveloped mines in Katemcy, Texas, Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin and Arcadia, Wisconsin and
our inactive Brewer, Missouri mine. We also have an inactive mine at Grand Haven, Michigan and two sand
processing facilities located in Readfield, Wisconsin and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada that do not have any sand
reserves but together have an annual processing capacity of approximately 625,000 tons per year.
The mineral rights and access to mineral reserves for the majority of our facilities are secured through land
that is owned in fee. There are no underlying agreements and/or royalties associated with these properties.
Where there are agreements and/or royalties associated with our properties, we have provided more
information in the facility descriptions below. We are required to pay production royalties on a per ton basis
pursuant to our mineral reserve leases. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid $2.1 million in royalty
payments representing approximately 0.2% of our total revenues. We generally perform comprehensive title
and survey due diligence prior to entering into leases.
API White
Wedron, Illinois. Our Wedron, IL facility is located in Wedron, LaSalle County, IL and consists of owned real
property. The facility, which is approximately 6 miles northeast of Ottawa, Illinois, is accessible via County
Highway 21 off of State Highway 71 and State Highway 23. The site utilizes natural gas and electricity to
process sand. Mining methods include mechanical removal of glacial overburden followed by drilling,
blasting and hydraulic mining. Hydraulically mined sand is pumped to the wash plant to be hydraulically
sized, and sent to the dry plant where it is dried and screened.
Our Wedron facility was originally opened in 1890 by the Garden City Sand Co and was sold in 1894 to the
Wedron White Sand Co. which became Wedron Silica Co. in 1916. Martin Marietta acquired the company in
1979. In 1984 Best Sand and the Wedron management group purchased the operation. Our company was
formed from the merger of Wedron Silica and Best Sand in 1986. The washing and drying operations at our
Wedron facility were upgraded in 2012 and 2013 in conjunction with significant capacity and reserve base
increases. Processed sand is shipped from the facility via truck or rail on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
(“BNSF”) and CSX Railroads via the Illinois Railnet. Our Wedron facility utilizes approximately 15,000 linear
feet of rail, enlarged in 2013, to accommodate unit trains. A portion of the sand is transferred by conveyor or
trucked from Wedron facility and is resin-coated at the Technisand Wedron, Troy Grove and/or Cutler, Illinois
resin coating facilities. Future plans for this facility include increasing mining capacity, adding an additional
wash plant and dry plant and bringing a new SSP facility online in 2015. The total net book value of the
Wedron facility’s real property and fixed assets as of June 30, 2014 was $64.5 million.
The sand reserve mined from the open-pit mine at the Wedron facility is the St. Peter Sandstone formation.
The Wedron facility produces high purity, round grain silica sand that meets the API requirements for

Coating, Resin Manufacturing, Specialty Blending and Research and Development Facilities
We have 11 strategically located coating facilities in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Oklahoma and Texas, as
well as Mexico, Denmark and China, with a combined annual production capacity of 2.4 million tons. In over
30 years of coating experience, we have developed significant know-how and proprietary processes to apply
resin to sand and, in some instances, ceramic substrates destined for both the proppant and I&R end markets.
Our customers require uniform products with their desired characteristics, and we use our know-how to meet
these required customer specifications.
We also have a phenolic resin manufacturing facility located in Michigan that we acquired from Alpha Resins
in 2011. This operation collaborates with our research and development group and our strategic marketing
group to develop and manufacture our own proprietary resins. We expanded our own resin manufacturing
capabilities in order to ensure the reliability of resin supply to our coating operations and to protect the
confidentiality of our resin formulations.
To complement our sand processing capabilities, we have three specialty blending facilities, located in Ohio,
Illinois and Texas. These operations make custom blends of aggregates for use in industrial and commercial
flooring, polymer cements, grouts and performance mortars. An additional specialty facility, Mineral Visions,

We have established an oil and gas logistics network that we believe is highly responsive to our customers’
needs. Among the most important purchasing criteria of our proppant customer relates to our ability to
deliver the products our customers demand at their desired time and location. Our oil and gas logistics
network includes 46 terminals and approximately over 8,500 railcars, including approximately 790 railcars
provided by customers. The following map reflects the location of our destination terminals:
We believe we have the largest private fleet in the industry, enabling us to maximize efficiency and reduce
demurrage costs. We are one of the few proppant producers capable of Class I railroad deliveries in each of
North America’s major oil and gas producing basins. We generally ship sand to either a terminal location,
where it is stored until utilized by a customer, or to one of our processing facilities for value-added
processing. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 81% of our North American oil and gas
proppant volumes were transported through our terminal network. The direct rail access of our processing
and distribution facilities significantly reduces handling costs and lead-times while enhancing production
throughput, resulting in improved responsiveness to our customers.

As industry dynamics evolve to multi-well pads and the proppant market matures, customers and railroads
are increasingly requesting proppant to be shipped via unit trains. Currently, we have one outbound site
which is unit train capable and has shipped 32 unit trains in the first five months of 2014. We expect to add an
additional three outbound and three inbound unit train sites within the next twelve months and believe this
enhanced infrastructure should provide us with a competitive advantage. We also ship our product via barge
to basins where this is an option. 32 of our 46 proppant terminals are captive to our needs, providing long-
term, secure access.
Research and Development and Technical Innovation
We have a history of partnering with our customers to develop innovative solutions to enhance the
effectiveness of well completions, from conventional shallow wells to the most complex, multi-stage,
horizontal wells. The nature of our vertically integrated model allows us to participate in each phase of
proppant manufacturing and delivery and provides us a unique perspective into the current and future needs
of our customers. Our technical sales team works closely with market participants to demonstrate the value
proposition our proppants offer and stimulate market demand using data indicating enhanced hydrocarbon

Our research and development team consists of 24 professionals (scientists, engineers, technicians), with
eight of them holding Ph.Ds, located at three locations in Sugar Land, TX, Ottawa, IL and Detroit, MI. After
acquiring Propel SSP in May 2013, our team has worked to further refine the technology and manufacturing
techniques of our Propel SSP product in order to successfully launch the product in commercial quantities.
Propel SSP is currently undergoing field trials with several key customers. Propel SSP relies on a polymer
coating applied to a proppant substrate. Upon contact with water, the coating hydrates and swells rapidly to
create a hydrogel around the proppant substrate. The hydrogel layer, which is primarily water, is attached to
the proppant particle and provides a nearly threefold increase in the hydrostatic radius of the proppant. This
reduces the effective specific gravity to about 1.3, compared to 2.6 for a typical uncoated sand grain. Initial
test results indicate that the lower specific gravity allows greater volumes of proppant and/or coarser mesh
sizes coated with Propel SSP to be carried deep into the fracture, which in turn allow more hydrocarbons to
escape into the wellbore. This technology reduces or eliminates the need for certain frac fluid additives,
including guar, which are used to enhance the transport of proppants into the geologic formation. Lab testing
shows that original proppant substrate crush resistance and conductivity are not affected by the coating
process, which suggests that a broad range of proppant types, including resin coated sand and ceramics,
could benefit from this transport technology. Propel SSP is stable over a wide range of temperatures.

Throughout our history, we have made and successfully integrated strategic acquisitions in order to
strengthen our market leadership position. For example, in 2013 we acquired FTSI, SSP LLC and Great Plains
and have completed over 20 acquisitions over the past 20 years.
Competition
There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with whom
we compete. Our main competitors in the raw frac sand market include Badger Mining Corporation, Ceramics
Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP, Hi-Crush Partners, LP, Preferred Sands LLC, Unimin Corporation and U.S.
Silica Holdings, Inc. Many new entrants to the raw frac sand market primarily compete on an FOB-plant basis
and lack comparable transportation infrastructure to meet customer demands in-basin. Our main competitors
in the coated products market include Momentive Performance Materials Inc., Unimin Corporation, Atlas
Resin Proppants LLC, Preferred Sands LLC and CARBO Ceramics Inc. The most important factors on which
we compete in both markets are product quality, performance and sand and proppant characteristics,
transportation capabilities, proximity of supply to well site, reliability of supply and price. Our only
substantial competitors across both markets are Unimin Corporation and Badger Mining Corporation (which
owns Atlas Resin Proppants LLC). We believe we are uniquely positioned to utilize our scale of raw sand
production to supply high-quality substrate for coated products and leverage our transportation infrastructure
for reliable delivery in-basin.
Due to increased demand for sand based proppants in recent years, there has been an increase in the number
of frac sand producers. Moreover, as a result of this increased demand, existing frac sand producers have
added to or expanded their frac sand production capacity, thereby increasing competition. Demand for sand-
based proppants is closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas
wells in North America. These consumption patterns in a particular basin are influenced by numerous factors,
including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity levels, including
the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption
patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, selling price and availability of sand-based proppants
and other types of proppants such as ceramic proppant. Selling prices for sand-based proppants vary by
basin and are determined based on supply and demand dynamics within each basin.
Competitors in the I&R markets include some of our larger proppant competitors such as Unimin Corporation
and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. but also typically include smaller, local or regional producers of sand and
gravel.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property primarily consists of patents, trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, including our
name “Fairmount Santrol”, and products such as “PowerProp”, “Propel SSP” (patent pending), “HyperProp”
and “CoolSet.” The Company holds numerous U.S. and foreign granted patents that are still in force as well
as many U.S. and foreign patent applications that are still pending. We own patents on each of our major,
differentiated proppant product lines, except CoolSet. We have not granted any third-party rights with respect
to our patents. The majority of our patents have an expiration date after 2025. We have not yet filed a patent for
CoolSet and our patents for HyperProp have recently expired. With respect to trade secrets and know how, our
extensive experience with a variety of different products enables us to offer our customers a wide range of
proppants for their particular application.

As of June 30, 2014, approximately 136 of our 1,018 domestic employees are parties to collective bargaining
contracts. We believe we have strong relationships with and maintain an active dialogue with union
representatives. We have historically been able to successfully extend and renegotiate collective bargaining
agreements as they expire.
Seasonality
Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact our production levels
and our customers’ business needs. For example, our proppant sales levels are lower in the first and fourth
quarters due to lower market demand as adverse weather tends to slow oil and gas operations to varying
degrees depending on the severity of the weather. Our inability to mine and process frac sand year round in
our surface mines in Wisconsin and our Minnesota and Ohio operations results in a seasonal build-up of
inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile that will feed our drying facilities during the winter
months. Additionally, in the second and third quarters, we sell more sand to our customers in the I&R end
markets due to the seasonal rise in demand driven by more favorable weather conditions.
Legal Proceedings
We and/or our predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous
products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of our customers alleging
damages caused by silica exposure. As of June 30, 2014, we were the subject to approximately 46 active silica
exposure claims. Almost all of the claims pending against us arise out of the alleged use of our silica
products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Mississippi,
Kentucky and Illinois, although some cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. In
accordance with our insurance obligations, these claims are being defended by our subsidiaries’ insurance
carriers, subject to our payment of approximately 7% of the defense costs. We believe that our level of
existing and available insurance coverage combined with various open indemnities is sufficient to cover any
exposure to silicosis-related expenses. Should our insurance coverage or indemnities prove to be insufficient
or unavailable, it could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows
and prospects.
Regulation and Legislation
Mining and Workplace Safety
Federal Regulation
The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory organization governing
the commercial silica industry. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines
and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is
to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with
mandatory safety and health standards. MSHA works closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade
association, in pursuing this mission. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two
unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility. To date these inspections have not
resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards.

90
We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and
comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the
OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials
used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local
government authorities and the public. OSHA regulates users of commercial silica and provides detailed
regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of
permissible exposure limits.
Internal Controls
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling exposure to silica dust, which
includes dust sampling, a respiratory protection program, medical surveillance, training and other
components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with the standards of our Occupational
Health and Safety Manual and MSHA regulations. For both health and safety issues, extensive training is
provided to employees. We have safety committees at our plants made up of salaried and hourly employees.
We perform annual internal health and safety audits and conduct semi-annual crisis management drills to test
our plants’ abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our
corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety
Coordinators.
Environmental Matters
We and the proppant industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation on, among other things,
matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air
and water emissions and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of federal, state, and local
agencies implement and enforce these regulations.
Federal Regulation
At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States,
including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain
permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the EPA (or the relevant state environmental agency in
states where the permit program has been delegated to the state) for discharges of pollutants into waters of
the United States, including discharges of wastewater or storm water runoff associated with construction
activities. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to
administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air
emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements, such as monitoring and reporting
requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement
equipment, modify our operational practices and obtain permits for our existing operations, and before
commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to obtain
pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities extended to produce or
significantly increase air emissions. In addition, air permits are required for our processing and terminal
operations, and our frac sand mining operations that result in the emission of regulated air contaminants.
Obtaining air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development or continued performance of our
operations. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs because of these
regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for
noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws
and regulations.
Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas,
are examples of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to
Table of Contents
91
reduce emissions of GHGs. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be
passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory
initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues.
Independent of Congress, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing
authority under the CAA. In 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide,
methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions
of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other
climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and
implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA.
For example, in 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from
specified large GHG emission sources. In 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG
emissions reporting rule for certain petroleum and natural gas facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more
of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The rule requires reporting of GHG emissions by such regulated
facilities to the EPA annually. The EPA also requires certain large stationary sources that are already subject
to permitting requirements under the CAA to obtain permits for GHG emissions as well.
Although it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future GHG legislation or regulation by
Congress, the EPA, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of
GHG emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased
compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel,
lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use,
transportation and disposal of these substances, including Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure
planning requirements. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur
substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for
damage or injury to property and persons. Additionally, some of our operations are located on properties that
historically have been used in ways that resulted in the release of contaminants, including hazardous
substances, into the environment, and we could be held liable for the remediation of such historical
contamination. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA,”
also known as the Superfund law) and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard
to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of
hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where
the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance
released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the
hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In
addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal
injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
In the course of our operations, we generate industrial solid wastes that may be regulated as hazardous
wastes. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the
generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.
The EPA and the individual states to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local
implementation, administer the RCRA program.
In September 2013, the EPA issued RCRA consent orders to several companies, including us, in connection
with historic contamination of residential drinking water wells near the Wedron, Illinois facility. The EPA
identified benzene and other volatile organic compounds in some drinking water wells, some (including
benzene) in excess of established standards. The consent orders required the companies to analyze soil
conditions at their sites to determine whether operations at their sites are potential sources of groundwater
contamination. We completed the
Table of Contents
92
study for our site, and our consultant submitted a site conditions report to the EPA in August 2014, which
report concluded that our current operations at the site are not a source of groundwater impacts in the
Wedron community. The report recommended that no further work should be required under the consent
order. We have also submitted a work plan to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to perform
additional investigation of potential releases of petroleum at the Wedron facility south of the residential areas
of the community. If the government agencies do require us to conduct any additional work or remediation
that could increase our costs, and depending on the scope of any such additional work (if any), could be
material.
Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, we supply sand-based proppants to
hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of
water, sand and chemicals, under pressure, into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate
production. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities.
However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing
increased scrutiny. Several federal agencies and regulatory authorities are investigating the potential
environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing
and has indicated it may seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land
Management has proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil
and gas leases. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal
regulation of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have
implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional
permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans
on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. Numerous states have
imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators. Some local
governments have adopted and others may seek to adopt ordinances prohibiting or regulating the time, place
and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions.
The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign levels imposing reporting
obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult
to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and
otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact
demand for our sand-based proppants.
Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy
Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal
actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a
major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that
requires review under NEPA. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part
of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among
other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species),
historical and archeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the
consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full
environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review
process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a
project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a
proposed project. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not
mandate a result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit, or impose certain conditions on its
approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party may challenge the adequacy of a
NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and
threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are
Table of Contents
93
subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the
harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Some of our operations are conducted in
areas where protected species or their habitats are known to exist. In these areas, we may be obligated to
develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and
we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain times, such as
breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. Federal
agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archeological resources under the National
Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archeological surveys of project sites and to
avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
State and Local Regulation
Because our operations are located in numerous states, we are also subject to a variety of different state and
local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states in which our projects are located or are
being developed have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of new sites or the expansion of
existing sites may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA.
In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations
may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a
range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on
wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic
areas. Some states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining
operations, and states may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal
agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local
environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation
requirements.
As demand for sand-based proppants in the oil and natural gas industry has driven a significant increase in
current and expected future production of silica sand, some local communities have expressed concern
regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica
sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have
developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust
from getting airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for
mining activities, require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in
some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material
impact to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of
concerns. We are not aware of any proposals for significant increased scrutiny on the part of state or local
regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or community concerns with respect to our operations that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations going forward.
Planned expansion of our mining and production capacity or construction and operation of related facilities
in new communities could be more significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Difficulty or delays
in obtaining or inability to obtain new mining permits or increased costs of compliance with future state and
local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an
effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and
maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
Costs of Compliance
We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements
applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the
assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site
restoration costs and liens, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of
injunctions to limit or cease
Table of Contents
94
operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development,
construction and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a
given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and
other impacts of our activities. In addition, the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more
restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in, or more stringent
enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control
equipment, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material
adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state and local permits for
our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the
permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or
whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project
or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent
our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the
public or other third parties, as well as any delay in the environmental review and permitting process, could
impair or delay our ability to develop or expand a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent
environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Lawrence N. Schultz. Mr. Schultz has been a member of the Board since 2010 and currently serves as
chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board. Until June of 1978, Mr. Schultz served as an officer of Central
National Bank of Cleveland, now a part of KeyBank N.A., while attending the M.B.A. and J.D. programs at
Cleveland State University. He joined Calfee, Halter & Griswold L.P. in 1978 after receiving his J.D. degree
from Cleveland State University. Mr. Schultz served on Calfee’s Executive Committee (from 1995) and its
Management Committee (from 2005), in each case through his retirement. He served as principal outside
counsel and Secretary to Agilysys, Inc., a NASDAQ listed company, from 1999 until his retirement in 2010 and
serves on the Advisory Boards of L.D. Kichler Company and Austin Powder Holding Co., Inc. Mr. Schultz
received his B.A. degree from Ohio Northern University in 1970. At the time of his retirement, Mr. Schultz
served on the Boards and Executive Committees of University Circle Inc. and The Deaconess Foundation,
including as chair of their Audit Committees, and was chairman of the Board of The Gordon Square Arts
District. We believe that Mr. Schultz’s legal background and boardroom experience qualify him to serve on
our board of directors.
Board of Directors
Our board of directors currently consists of seven members, Ms. Deckard and Messrs. Conway, Fowler, Kelly,
LeBaron, Sand and Schultz. We anticipate that our board will determine that each of Messrs.                     ,
Conway, Kelly, LeBaron and Sand are independent under the independence standards of the NYSE.
In evaluating director candidates, we will assess whether a candidate possesses the integrity, judgment,
knowledge, experience, skills and expertise that are likely to enhance the board’s ability to manage and direct
our affairs and business, including, when applicable, to enhance the ability of the committees of the board to
fulfill their duties. We currently are in the process of identifying individuals who meet these standards and the
relevant independence requirements. Our directors hold office until the earlier of their death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.
In connection with the completion of this offering, our directors will be divided into three classes serving
staggered three-year terms. Class I, Class II and Class III directors will serve until our annual meetings of
stockholders in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We anticipate that Ms. Deckard and Mr. Kelly will be
assigned to Class I, Messrs. Conway and Sand will be assigned to Class II and Messrs. LeBaron, Fowler and
Schultz will be assigned to Class III. At each annual meeting of stockholders held after the initial
classification, directors will be elected to succeed the class of directors whose terms have expired. This
classification of our board of directors could have the effect of increasing the length of time necessary to
change the composition of a majority of the board of directors. In general, at least two annual meetings of
stockholders will be necessary for stockholders to effect a change in a majority of the members of the board
of directors.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Upon the completion of this offering, we intend to have an audit committee, a compensation committee and a
nominating and governance committee of our board of directors, and may have such other committees as the
board of directors shall determine from time to time. We anticipate that each of the standing committees of
the board of directors will have the composition and responsibilities described below.
Audit Committee
Our audit committee currently consists of Messrs. Schultz, Kelly and Sand. Messrs. Schultz and Kelly are
independent under the rules of the SEC. As required by the rules of the SEC and listing standards of the
NYSE, we expect to appoint an additional director meeting applicable audit committee independence
standards within one year of the effective date of this registration statement. SEC rules also require that a
public company disclose whether or not its audit committee has an “audit committee financial expert” as a
member. An “audit committee financial expert” is defined as a person who, based on his or her experience,
possesses the attributes outlined in such rules. At least one of our independent directors satisfies the
definition of “audit committee financial expert.”
Table of Contents
98
This committee will oversee, review, act on and report on various auditing and accounting matters to our
board of directors, including: the selection of our independent accountants, the scope of our annual audits,
fees to be paid to the independent accountants, the performance of our independent accountants and our
accounting practices. In addition, the audit committee will oversee our compliance programs relating to legal
and regulatory requirements. We expect to adopt an audit committee charter defining the committee’s primary
duties in a manner consistent with the rules of the SEC and applicable stock exchange or market standards.
Compensation Committee
Our compensation committee currently consists of Messrs. Conway, Kelly and LeBaron all of whom are
“independent” under the rules of the SEC. This committee will establish salaries, incentives and other forms
of compensation for officers and other employees. Our compensation committee will also administer our
incentive compensation and benefit plans. We expect to adopt a compensation committee charter defining the
committee’s primary duties in a manner consistent with the rules of the SEC and applicable stock exchange
or market standards.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Our nominating and corporate governance committee currently consists of Messrs. Conway, Kelly and Sand.

Base Salary
Each Named Executive Officer’s base salary is a fixed component of compensation each year for performing
specific job duties and functions. Historically, our compensation committee established the annual base
salary rate for our Chief Executive Officer. As for the other Named Executive Officers, the compensation
committee of our board of directors has established the annual base salary rate at a level necessary to retain
the individual’s services, and reviews base salaries on an annual basis in consultation with the Chief
Executive Officer, as well as at the time of any promotion or significant change in job responsibility. The
compensation committee has historically made adjustments to the base salary rates of the Named Executive
Officers upon consideration of any factors that it deems relevant, including but not limited to: (a) any increase
or decrease in the executive’s responsibilities, (b) the executive’s job performance, and (c) the level of
compensation paid to executives of other companies with which we compete for executive talent, as estimated
based on publicly available information and the experience of members of our board of directors and our
Chief Executive Officer. The base salary paid to each Named Executive Officer in the 2013 fiscal year is
reported in the Summary Compensation Table above.
Annual Bonus
The goal of our annual bonus program is to incentivize our employees and executives to achieve certain
performance objectives. Our compensation committee works with our Chief Executive Officer to establish a
target bonus for each of our Named Executive Officers. Our compensation committee establishes the target
bonus level for our Chief Executive Officer. For 2013 the target bonus for each of our Named Executive
Officers was 60% of base salary. The amount of that target bonus actually paid to each Named Executive
Officer in any given year is dependent upon the extent to which we achieve the performance objectives
established under the annual bonus program for that year.
In an effort to create a set of clear, concise, effective and measurable performance indicators which are most
directly correlated to value creation and sustainable corporate growth, we carefully selected two performance
metric categories to make up the annual cash bonus program for 2013: (i) sustainable development, and
(ii) EBITDA. The relative weighting of these performance metrics is established by the compensation
committee after reviewing recommendations from the management team. In 2013, each was weighted equally.
Sustainable development objectives are set at the beginning of the year by each of our thirteen sustainable
development teams and approved by the Sustainable Development Advisory Committee. Following the end of
the year, each of those teams calculates the percentage of their sustainable development objective that was
achieved during the year and submits that analysis to our Sustainable Development Advisory Committee,
which reviews and analyzes the performance of each sustainable development team. Once the performance
percentages have been reviewed and approved, all thirteen team performance percentages are averaged to
calculate the total sustainable development performance percentage. Each of the thirteen sustainable
development performance percentages are capped at 125% of objective, with a floor of 0% of each objective,
as is the overall sustainable development performance percentage. The overall sustainable development
performance percentage is then presented to and approved by the compensation committee. Examples of
sustainable development objectives established by our sustainable development teams and used during the
2013 Fiscal Year include the development
Table of Contents
101
of a five year water management and reduction plan and the reduction of year-end solid waste volume by 50%
compared to the 2012 fiscal year.
Before the beginning of each year, the board of directors works with our management team to establish a
budget for our company for the next year. Once the budget has been approved, our compensation committee
approves the threshold level of EBITDA that will result in any payment with respect to the EBITDA
performance metric as well as the performance percentage applicable to varying levels of EBITDA
performance above and below that threshold level for the upcoming year. At the end of each year the
compensation committee works with management to approve their recommendation as to the performance
percentage achieved based on our actual EBITDA performance as compared to budget. The chart below
outlines the levels of achievement of budgeted EBITDA and correlating performance percentages established
by the compensation committee for years after 2013. Performance between the levels outlined below will be
calculated using straight line interpolation.

In order to calculate the amount of the annual bonus payable to each of our Named Executive Officers under
the annual bonus plan, the average of the performance percentage for sustainable development is multiplied
by one-half of the Named Executive Officer’s target bonus amount, and the performance percentage for
EBITDA is multiplied by one-half of each Named Executive Officer’s target bonus amount. The sum of these
two amounts is equivalent to the actual bonus earned. Notwithstanding the above, the compensation
committee retains the authority to increase or decrease the amount of the actual bonuses paid under the
annual bonus program. The Named Executive Officers must generally be employed on the date the awards are
actually paid in order to receive payment.
In 2013, the board of directors adopted a pro forma budget as a result of certain acquisitions, and the
compensation committee used its discretion to apply the performance percentages and EBITDA achievement
levels established earlier in the year to the EBITDA level used in the pro forma budget rather than the original
budgeted EBITDA levels. The final EBITDA performance percentage was 67% of the pro forma EBITDA target
and the overall sustainable development performance percentage was approximately 92%, resulting in a total
payout of 80% of target bonus. As a result, each Named Executive Officer was eligible for approximately 80%
(the average of the EBITDA and sustainable development performance percentages) of his or her target bonus
subject to the discretion of the compensation committee.
Table of Contents
Safety Bonus
102
Additionally, our Named Executive Officers are eligible for a safety bonus payment of up to $1,800 per year.
Such bonus payments are payable in equal monthly installments and calculated based on three equally
weighted categories: 1) individual safety, 2) facility safety, and 3) overall safety record of the company. Each
monthly installment is decreased if an incident/accident occurs. The amount of the decrease is dependent on
how many of the aforementioned categories are applicable to the accident, with each category reducing the
payment by one-third.
The total amount paid under the annual bonus program and the safety bonus program to each of our Named
Executive Officers is enumerated in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary
Compensation Table, above.
Option Awards
On December 7, 2010, in order to incentivize our management, employees, and directors to continue to grow
and develop our business, the board of directors adopted our current LTIP, the FML Holdings, Inc. Stock
Option Plan (the “2010 Plan”), for the officers, employees, and consultants of our company and its
subsidiaries who perform services for us. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the 2010 Plan will continue for
a period of ten years after adoption. There are 350,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance
under the 2010 Plan. As of June 30, 2014, 21,550 shares remain available for issuance under the plan and
328,450 shares are subject to outstanding stock options. The 2010 Plan allows for the issuance of either
nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options; however, all options granted under the 2010 Plan as of
December 31, 2013 have been nonqualified stock options.
In December 2013, our Chief Executive Officer evaluated the performance of each Named Executive Officer
(other than herself) in order to make recommendations to the compensation committee regarding the number
of stock options to be granted to each of the Named Executive Officers under the 2010 Plan for the 2013 fiscal
year. When determining the size and terms of the stock option awards granted to our Named Executive
Officers in December 2013, our compensation committee considered our Chief Executive Officer’s
recommendations along with other factors that include, but are not limited to, overall company performance,
each executive’s level and scope of responsibility, and the compensation paid to similarly situated executives
of companies with which we compete for executive talent (to the extent such information is publically
available).
The option awards granted to our Named Executive Officers under the 2010 Plan during 2013 will be fully
vested and exercisable on the seventh anniversary of the grant date, provided that the Named Executive
Officers continue to provide services to us through that date. However, if EBITDA for a year prior to the
seventh anniversary equals or exceeds the annual or cumulative target enumerated in the option agreement,
all or a portion of the option may become vested and exercisable prior to the seven year anniversary. All stock
options granted under the 2010 Plan expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. For additional
information regarding the terms of the 2010 Plan and award agreements issued to our Named Executive
Officers thereunder please see the section below entitled “—Additional Narrative Disclosure—Stock Options.
Other Compensation Elements
We offer participation in broad-based retirement, health and welfare plans to all of our employees. We
currently maintain a retirement plan intended to provide benefits under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code (the “Code”) where employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are allowed to contribute
portions of their base compensation and bonus payments to a tax-qualified retirement account. We also
maintain a defined contribution profit sharing plan for the benefit of all of our employees as well as a separate
supplemental executive retirement plan. See “Additional Narrative Disclosure—Retirement Benefits” for more
information. In addition, minimal perquisites have historically been provided to our Named Executive
Officers, including a car

allowance and club dues. Details regarding these perquisites and the value of all such benefits provided
during 2013 are available in the notes to the column of the Summary Compensation Table entitled “All Other
Compensation”.

(1) These stock option awards were granted to our Named Executive Officers under the 2006 Plan. All options
granted under the 2006 Plan were granted with respect to Class A Common Stock. All other stock options
enumerated above were granted under the 2010 Plan with respect to Class B Non-Voting Common Stock.
(2) The option awards in this column were granted to our Named Executive Officers under the 2010 Plan and will be
fully vested and exercisable on the seventh anniversary of the grant date, provided that the Named Executive
Officers continue to provide services to us through that date. However, if EBITDA for the year equals or exceeds
the annual or cumulative target enumerated in the option agreement, all or a portion of the option may become
exercisable prior to the seven year anniversary.
Stock Options
2006 Plan. On April 20, 2006, our company adopted a new stock option plan (the “2006 Plan”) and reserved
2,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. Only 930,716 stock options were actually issued
under the 2006 Plan before it was frozen on October 29, 2009. No stock options have been granted under the
2006 Plan since October 29, 2010 and no stock options will be granted thereunder in the future. 730,732 shares
have been purchased pursuant to the exercise of awards granted under the 2006 Plan and, as of June 30, 2014,
199,984 shares are subject to outstanding stock options.
To the extent not already vested, all option awards granted under the 2006 Plan fully vested upon the AS
Group Acquisition, which was considered a “change in control” under our 2006 Plan. Named Executive
Officers are able to exercise such options at any time, or from time to time, prior to expiration, provided they
continue to provide services to us.
Additionally, pursuant to the applicable award agreement, all options granted under the 2006 Plan, if not
previously exercised, generally expire on (i) the ten year anniversary of the option grant date, (ii) the one year
Table of Contents
104
anniversary of the Named Executive Officer’s death, (iii) the expiration of thirty days from the Named
Executive Officer’s separation of services within one year of change of control or (iv) immediately on the date
the Named Executive Officer ceases to be an employee, officer, or member of the board of directors, unless by
reason of death or separation of services within one year of change in control.
2010 Plan. Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Plan, in the event a corporate event occurs that affects the
common stock in such a way that an adjustment is required in order to preserve the benefits intended to be
made available under the 2010 Plan, the board of directors will adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind of
common stock subject to outstanding stock options and (ii) the exercise price with respect to any outstanding
stock option or, if deemed appropriate, make a cash payment to an option holder.
The 2010 Plan also provides that in the event of a transaction (as defined in the 2010 Plan), we may, in our
sole discretion and without the consent of the participants, provide for (i) the assumption of the 2010 Plan by
the surviving company, (ii) substitute new options at the surviving company with substantially the same terms
for options in us, (iii) require the exercise of outstanding options and terminate all unexercised or
unexercisable options, or (iv) settle outstanding vested stock options in cash or equity and cancel all such
stock options. The following events typically constitute a “transaction” under the 2010 Plan: (a) the sale of all
or substantially all of our consolidated assets in any single transaction or series of related transactions,
(b) the acquisition by a person or group (other than by us, our subsidiaries or our benefit plans) in one or
more transactions of our voting securities representing the majority of the outstanding voting power to elect
our directors, (c) any merger or consolidation of us with or into another company unless the holders of our
voting securities own voting securities of the surviving company representing a majority of the voting power
to elect directors in the same proportions that they held their shares prior to the merger.
Unless otherwise provided in the option agreement or another agreement between the individual and us, the
2010 Plan provides that in the event a payment or right accruing to the recipient would constitute a “parachute
payment” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder) such payment or
right will be reduced to the largest amount or greatest right that will result in no portion of the amount
payable or right accruing under the 2010 Plan to be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or
being disallowed as a deduction under Section 280G of the Code.
Pursuant to the applicable award agreement, and except as provided below, the Named Executive Officers will
forfeit any stock option that is not vested and exercisable as of the date they cease performing services for us,
for any reason. If the executive’s employment is terminated for cause (as defined in the 2010 Plan) then the
Named Executive Officer will forfeit any outstanding stock options, whether vested or unvested, as of the date
of his or her termination of employment. The Named Executive Officer or his or her estate, as applicable, will
generally be able to exercise all outstanding and vested stock options until the earlier of (i) the expiration of
the option term and (ii) (a) the 12 month anniversary of the executive’s termination of employment due to
death or disability (as defined in the 2010 Plan) or (b) the three month anniversary of the date of termination
for any reason other than cause, death, or disability.
The award agreements used to grant stock options to the Named Executive Officers under the 2010 Plan
further provide that if a Named Executive Officer ceases to provide services to us due to his or her death or
disability, and we achieve a level of EBITDA performance for the year of his or her termination of employment
that would have caused some or all of his or her stock option award to vest, then the Named Executive Officer
or the officer’s estate, as applicable, shall vest in that portion of the stock option award that would have
vested had his employment not terminated due to death or disability for that year.
The award agreements also provide that all unvested stock options will vest in the event of a transaction (as
defined under the 2010 Plan and summarized above) provided that the Named Executive Officer has
continuously provided services to us through the date of the transaction. The award agreements do not
provide for any accelerated vesting in connection with any other events or termination of employment.

Retirement Plans Generally
105
We currently maintain two defined benefit pension plans, but Named Executive Officers are not eligible to
participate in such plans. Additionally, we maintain a retirement plan intended to provide benefits under
Section 401(k) of the Code which allows employees, including our Named Executive Officers, to contribute
portions of their base compensation and bonus payments to a tax-qualified retirement account. We provide
matching contributions equal to 50% of the first 5% of employees’ eligible compensation contributed to the
plan. Amounts deposited in our 401(k) plan, including matching amounts, are fully vested upon deposit.
Because of their higher compensation levels, our Named Executive Officers are generally prevented from
receiving what would otherwise be their full employer match under the 401(k) plan. Once the maximum
employer match allowable under the 401(k) plan has been made, the remainder of the match is contributed on
behalf of the executive to the supplemental executive retirement plan (if the executive elected to participate in
that plan).
We may also make contributions under a defined contribution stock bonus plan on behalf of all eligible
employees, including the Named Executive Officers. Our compensation committee has full control and
discretion over the annual contribution rate which is consistent for every eligible participant, and such
amounts are subject to the limits established in the Code. Named Executive Officers’ accounts fully vest after
three years of service.
Additionally, under our supplemental executive retirement plan, certain employees, including our Named
Executive Officers, may elect to defer up to 15% of their base compensation and bonus compensation. The
deferral amount under such plan is equal to the base compensation and bonus deferral elected by the
employee minus salary and bonus deferrals credited to their 401(k) plan. We provide contributions under this
plan, as well, equal to the excess, if any, of the full intended stock bonus contribution, without regard to
limitations under the Code, and the actual stock bonus contribution credited to the Named Executive Officer’s
stock bonus plan account. Any amount that would have been contributed under the 401(k) plan but could not
be contributed due to limitations under the Code, and is instead contributed to the supplemental executive
retirement plan on the Named Executive Officers behalf, is fully vested on deposit. Amounts that would have
been contributed under the stock bonus plan but could not be contributed due to limitations under the Code,
vest in full after three years of service.
Retirement Plans Upon Retirement, Termination or Change in Control
Amounts in a Named Executive Officer’s 401(k) plan account are fully vested upon deposit and, therefore, no
acceleration of vesting occurs on termination of employment, retirement, or change of control.
A Named Executive Officer’s account under the stock bonus plan will become 100% vested (i) upon the
Named Executive Officer’s termination of employment due to death or “disability,” or (ii) upon the Named
Executive Officer’s involuntary termination of employment following the occurrence of a restructuring. Any
amount that would have been contributed under the stock bonus plan but could not be contributed due to
limitations under the Code, and was contributed to the supplemental executive retirement plan on the Named
Executive Officers behalf, shall vest in the event in the change of control so long as the Named Executive
Officer is employed by us on the date of such event. Amounts distributed to the Named Executive Officers
under the stock bonus plan are paid in one lump sum payment and may generally be paid upon death,
disability, normal retirement, late retirement, or, at the employee’s election, upon any other termination of
employment. Amounts under the supplemental executive retirement plan are distributed as soon as possible
on or after January 1 coincident with or immediately following the Named Executive Officer’s termination of
employment, retirement, death or disability.
Actions Taken After 2013 Fiscal Year
Base Salary
Our board of directors is currently in the process of reevaluating our executive compensation program in light
of the additional responsibilities and duties our Named Executive Officers will have as the executives of a
Table of Contents
106
publicly traded company. As part of that review, our board of directors has determined that it is appropriate to
increase Ms. Deckard and Messrs. Nagel and Fodo’s base salary from $374,900 to $450,000; $327,800 to
$360,000; and from $290,000 to $310,000, respectively, effective September 2014.
Annual Bonus
The target annual bonuses established by our compensation committee for our Named Executive Officers with
respect to 2014 performance for Ms. Deckard and Messrs. Nagel and Fodo are 100%, 75%, and 75%,
respectively. Additionally, our compensation committee established the target annual bonuses for our Named
Executive Officers with respect to 2015 performance as 100%, 100% and 75% for Ms. Deckard and Messrs.
Nagel and Fodo, respectively. The amount of the target bonus that will actually be paid to each of our Named
Executive Officers for 2014 and 2015 performance will be dependent on the extent to which we achieve the
performance objectives established under the annual bonus program for that year. We currently expect that
the performance metric categories for our annual bonus program in 2014 and 2015 will continue to be
sustainable development and EBITDA, although the specific sustainable development goals and EBITDA
targets are subject to change from year to year.
Stock Option and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
As part of our board of director’s reevaluation of our executive compensation program, our board of directors
has determined that an award of non-qualified stock options and stock settled restricted stock units will be
granted to our named executive officers in connection with the closing of this offering. We expect that Ms.
Deckard and Mr. Fodo will each receive a grant of approximately 1,050 stock options and 129 restricted stock
units and that Mr. Nagel will receive a grant of approximately 1,750 stock options and 214 restricted stock
units, in each case subject to change at the discretion of our board of directors. Each award will be subject to
the terms and vesting conditions set forth in the applicable grant documents.
2014 Long Term Incentive Plan
On September 11, 2014, subject to approval by our stockholders, our board of directors adopted a Long-Term
Incentive Plan, or LTIP, to attract and retain employees, directors, and other service providers to become
effective on the date immediately prior to the effective date of this offering. The description of the LTIP set
forth below is a summary of the material features of the LTIP. This summary, however, does not purport to be
a complete description of all of the provisions of the LTIP and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
LTIP, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this registration statement. The LTIP provides for the grant of
cash and equity-based awards, including options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, bonus stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-
based awards, performance awards and annual incentive awards.
Share Limits. Subject to adjustment in accordance with the LTIP,              shares of our common stock will
initially be reserved for issuance pursuant to awards under the LTIP, and more specifically, that total amount
will be available for issuance of incentive stock options. Shares subject to an award under the LTIP that are
canceled, forfeited, exchanged, settled in cash or otherwise terminated, including withheld to satisfy exercise
prices or tax withholding obligations, will be available for delivery pursuant to other awards. The shares of
our common stock to be delivered under the LTIP will be made available from authorized but unissued
shares, shares held in treasury, or previously issued shares reacquired by us, including by purchase on the
open market.
In each calendar year, during any part of which the LTIP is in effect, an employee who is a “Covered
Employee” as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) may
not be granted (a) awards (other than awards designated to be paid only in cash or the settlement of which is
not based on a number of shares) relating to more than              shares of our common stock, subject to
adjustment as provided in the LTIP and (b) awards designated to be paid only in cash, or the settlement of
which is not based on a number of shares of our common stock, having a value determined on the date of
grant in excess of $30,000,000.

Administration. The LTIP will be administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors,
which is referred to herein as the “committee,” except in the event our full board of directors chooses to
administer the LTIP. Unless otherwise determined by our board of directors, the committee will be comprised
of two or more individuals, each of whom qualifies as an “outside director” as defined in Section 162(m) of
the Code and a “nonemployee director” as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the LTIP and applicable law, the committee has broad discretion to administer the
LTIP, including the power to determine the employees, directors and other service providers to whom awards
will be granted, to determine the type of awards to be granted and the number of shares of our common stock
to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, to determine and interpret the terms and
provisions of each award agreement, to accelerate the vesting or exercise of any award and to make all other
determinations and to take all other actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the LTIP.
Eligibility. Officers, directors, employees, and other individuals who provide services to us may be eligible to
receive awards under the LTIP. However, the committee has the sole discretion to determine which eligible
individuals receive awards under the LTIP.
Stock Options. The committee may grant incentive stock options and options that do not qualify as incentive
stock options, except that incentive stock options may only be granted to persons who are our employees or
employees of one of our subsidiaries, in accordance with Section 422 of the Code. Except with respect to
substitute awards granted in connection with a transaction, the exercise price of a stock option cannot be less
than the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date on which the option is granted and the
option must not be exercisable more than ten years from the date of grant. In the case of an incentive stock
option granted to an individual who owns (or is deemed to own) at least 10% of the total combined voting
power of all classes of our capital stock, the exercise price of the stock option must be at least 110% of the
fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant and the option must not be exercisable
more than five years from the date of grant.
Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights, or SARs, may be granted in connection with, or
independent of, a stock option. A SAR is the right to receive an amount equal to the excess of the fair market
value of one share of our common stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR. SARs will be
exercisable on such terms as the committee determines. The term of a SAR will be for a period determined by
the committee but will not exceed ten years. SARs may be paid in cash, common stock or a combination of
cash and common stock, as determined by the committee in the relevant award agreement.
Restricted Stock. Restricted stock is a grant of shares of our common stock subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture, restrictions on transferability and any other restrictions determined by the committee. Common
stock distributed in connection with a stock split or stock dividend, and other property distributed as a
dividend, may be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the restricted stock with respect to
which the distribution was made.
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units are rights to receive cash, common stock or a combination of
cash and common stock at the end of a specified period. Restricted stock units may be subject to restrictions,
including a risk of forfeiture, as determined by the committee. The committee may, in its sole discretion,
grant dividend equivalents with respect to restricted stock units.
Other Awards. Subject to limitations under applicable law and the terms of the LTIP, the committee may grant
other awards including, without limitation, common stock awarded as a bonus, dividend equivalents,
convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into common stock,
purchase rights for common stock, awards with value and payment contingent upon our performance or any
other factors designated by the committee, and awards valued by reference to the book value of our common
stock or the value of securities of the securities or the performance of specified subsidiaries. The committee
will determine the terms and conditions of all such awards. Cash awards may granted as an element of, or a
Table of Contents
108
supplement to, any awards permitted under the LTIP. Awards may also be granted in lieu of obligations to
pay cash or deliver other property under the LTIP or under other plans or compensatory arrangements,
subject to the terms of the LTIP and applicable law.
Performance and Annual Incentive Awards. The LTIP will also permit the committee to designate certain
awards as performance awards or annual incentive awards. Performance and annual incentive awards
represent awards with respect to which a participant’s right to receive cash, shares of our common stock, or a
combination of both, is contingent upon the attainment of one or more specified performance measures
within a specified period. The committee will determine the applicable performance period, the performance
goals and such other conditions that apply to each performance and annual incentive award. If an award is
intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” for purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, and
will be granted to a participant who is designated by the committee as likely to be a covered employee (as
defined in section 162(m) of the Code), then the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such award will be
contingent upon achievement of one or more of the following business criteria: (1) earnings per share; (2)
revenues; (3) cash flow; (4) cash flow from operations; (5) cash flow return; (6) return on net assets; (7) return
on assets; (8) return on investment; (9) return on capital; (10) return on invested capital; (11) return on equity;
(12) economic value added; (13) operating margin; (14) contribution margin; (15) net income; (16) net income
per share; (17) pretax earnings; (18) pretax earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization; (19) pretax
operating earnings after interest expense and before incentives, service fees, and extraordinary or special
items; (20) total stockholder return; (21) debt reduction; (22) market share; (23) change in the Fair Market Value
of the Stock; (24) operating income; and (25) any of the above goals determined on an absolute or relative
basis or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the committee
including, but not limited to, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index or a group of comparable companies.
Termination of Employment and Non-Competition Agreements. The treatment of an award under the LTIP
upon a termination of employment or service to us will be specified in the agreement controlling such award.
Additionally, each participant to whom an award is granted under the LTIP may be required to agree in writing
as a condition of the granting of such award not to engage in conduct in competition with us or our affiliates
after the termination of such participant’s employment or service with us.
Change in Control. Subject to the terms of the applicable award agreement, upon a “change in control” (as
defined in the LTIP), the committee may, in its discretion, (i) accelerate the time of exercisability of an award,
(ii) require awards to be surrendered in exchange for a cash payment (or no payment if awards are unvested
or the price paid in the change of control is equal to or less than the exercise price), (iii) provide for the
assumption or substitution or continuation of awards by the successor company or a parent or subsidiary of
the successor, or (iv) make other adjustments to awards as the committee deems appropriate to reflect the
applicable transaction or event.
Amendment and Termination. The LTIP will automatically expire on the tenth anniversary of its effective date.
Our board of directors may amend or terminate the LTIP at any time, subject to any requirement of
stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation. The committee may generally amend the
terms of any outstanding award under the LTIP at any time. However, no action may be taken by our board of
directors or the committee under the LTIP that would materially and adversely affect the rights of a participant
under a previously granted award without the participant’s consent.

American Securities and Ms. Deckard was employed by us. As such, neither Ms. Deckard nor Messrs.
LeBaron and Sand received compensation from us for their service on our board of directors.
Mr. Fowler served as our acting Chief Executive Officer in years prior to 2013. Through May 24, 2013,
Mr. Fowler provided transitional advisory services to Ms. Deckard, as his successor to the office of Chief
Executive. During this period, Mr. Fowler received payments of base salary, was eligible to receive a monthly
safety bonus, and received other benefits available to similarly situated executives, including the provision of
supplemental life insurance and supplemental disability insurance, as well as our match of amounts
contributed by him to his 401(k) account. On May 24, 2013, Mr. Fowler, retired from employment with us but
continued to serve as a member of our board of directors.
Messrs. Conway, Fowler, Kelly, and Schultz were compensated for the 2013 fiscal year as outlined below.

(2) For the period of time during which Mr. Fowler was an employee, he received a safety bonus payment in the
amount of $685.
(3) Mr. Fowler received payments in the amount of $164,011 as compensation for the provision of transitional
advisory services. Additionally, we paid supplement life and supplemental disability insurance premiums on his
behalf in the amounts of $14,090 and $1,193, respectively, and matched his 401(k) contributions in the amount of
$6,375.
As of December 31, 2013, Messrs. William Kelly and Lawrence Schultz each held 700 unvested stock options
and 1,050 vested stock options. These options will be fully vested and exercisable on the seventh anniversary
of the grant date, which is December 7, 2017, provided that the directors continue to provide services to us
through that date. However, if EBITDA for the year equals or exceeds the annual or cumulative target
enumerated in the option agreement, all or a portion of the option may become exercisable prior to the seven
year anniversary. As of December 31, 2013, Messrs. Fowler and Conway held no outstanding stock options.
Following the closing of this initial public offering, we plan to implement a new director compensation
program to reflect the increased time and responsibility that being the director of a publicly traded company
entails. We anticipate that directors who are not our employees will receive a combination of cash and
restricted stock unit grants as compensation for attending meetings of our board of directors and committees
thereof. We expect that such compensation will consist of an annual retainer of approximately $62,500 for
each non-employee board member. We expect that each non-employee director will also receive an annual
grant of the number of restricted stock units having a grant date fair value of approximately $62,500, subject to
the terms and vesting schedules set forth in the applicable grant documents. Further, we expect that non-
employee directors serving as a chairman of the compensation committee and executive committee of our
board of directors will receive an additional annual retainer of $10,000. The chair of our audit committee is
expected to receive an additional annual retainer of $15,000 and the chair of our board of directors is expected
to receive an additional annual retainer of $25,000.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Procedures for Approval of Related Party Transactions
Prior to the closing of this offering, we have not maintained a policy for approval of Related Party
Transactions. A “Related Party Transaction” is a transaction, arrangement or relationship in which we or any
of our subsidiaries was, is or will be a participant, the amount of which involved exceeds $120,000, and in
which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A “Related Person”
means:
•
•
•
•
any person who is, or at any time during the applicable period was, one of our executive officers or one of our
directors;
any person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock;
any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which means any child, stepchild, parent,
stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law
of a director, executive officer or a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock, and any person (other
than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director, executive officer or beneficial owner of more
than 5% of our common stock; and
any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is a partner or principal or in a similar
position or in which such person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest.
We anticipate that our board of directors will adopt a written related party transactions policy prior to the
completion of this offering. Pursuant to this policy, we expect that our audit committee will review all material
facts of all Related Party Transactions.
American Securities
American Securities is a leading U.S. middle-market private equity firm that currently has over $10 billion of
assets under management. In August 2010, affiliated funds managed by American Securities acquired control
over ASP FML, which owns 53.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Upon completion of
this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), affiliated funds managed by
American Securities will own approximately     % of our outstanding common stock.
We paid American Securities $1 million annually for management and consulting fees provided pursuant to a
management consulting agreement, in addition to approximately $0.1 million, $0.3 million and $1.9 million in
separate transaction fees for mergers and acquisitions by the Company and out of pocket expenses for the
years ended 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In connection with the completion of this offering, the
management consulting agreement, and any obligation to pay transaction fees, will be terminated.
Stockholders’ Agreement
In connection with the investment in our common stock by ASP FML, certain of our stockholders, including
ASP FML entered into an amended and restated stockholders’ agreement on April 28, 2009 between certain
stockholders and previous equity sponsors. The stockholders’ agreement provides, among other things, that
ASP FML is currently entitled to elect (or cause to be elected) three of our directors. The stockholders’
agreement will be amended and restated (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement”)
contingent upon, and effective at the time of, consummation of this offering to, among certain other things,
remove ASP FML’s right to elect (or cause to be elected) three of our directors and to revise certain
registration rights.
Registration Rights
Pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement , we will be obligated to register the
sale of shares of our common stock under certain circumstances.
Table of Contents
116
Demand Rights. At any time after the closing of this offering, subject to the limitations set forth below, certain
major stockholders (or their permitted transferees), including ASP FML, will have the right to require us by
written notice to prepare and file a registration statement registering the offer and sale of a number of their
shares of common stock. Generally, we will be required to provide notice of a request by such a major
stockholder within one business day following the receipt of such demand request to all other such major
stockholders, who may, in certain circumstances, participate in the registration.
We will also not be obligated to effect any demand registration in which a notice is received within 90 days
after the closing of an underwritten offering, during a Company blackout period, or in which the anticipated
aggregate offering price included in such offering is less than $50 million. Once we are eligible to effect a
registration on Form S-3, any such demand registration may be for a shelf registration statement. Any
demand for an underwritten offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement shall constitute a
demand request subject to the limitations set forth above. We will be required to maintain the effectiveness of
any such registration statement until the consummation of the distribution by the participating holders.
Piggy-back Rights. If, at any time, subject to certain customary limitations we propose to register an offering
of common stock (subject to certain exceptions) for our own account or for the account of any third party
(including a demand registration), then we must give written notice to all holders who own registrable
securities, the gross offering price of which is anticipated to be at least $5 million to allow them to include a
specified number of their shares in that registration statement.
Conditions and Limitations; Expenses. These registration rights are subject to certain conditions and
limitations, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of shares to be included in a
registration and our right to delay or withdraw a registration statement under certain circumstances. We will
generally pay all registration expenses in connection with our obligations under the registration rights
agreement, regardless of whether a registration statement is filed or becomes effective.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Upon completion of this offering, the authorized capital stock of FMSA Holdings Inc., will consist of             
shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which             shares will be issued and outstanding,
and              shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which no shares will be issued and
outstanding.
The following summary of the capital stock and amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws of FMSA Holdings Inc., does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the provisions of applicable law and to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of
which this prospectus is a part.
Common Stock
Except as provided by law or in a preferred stock designation, holders of common stock are entitled to one
vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, will have the
exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and do not have cumulative voting rights. Except as
otherwise required by law, holders of common stock, are not entitled to vote on any amendment to the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series of preferred stock) that relates solely to the terms of any outstanding series of preferred stock if the
holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other
such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including any
certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred stock) or pursuant to the DGCL. Subject to prior
rights and preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares or series of preferred stock, holders
of common stock are entitled to receive ratably in proportion to the shares of common stock held by them
such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), if any, as may be declared from time to time by our
board of directors out of funds legally available for dividend payments. All outstanding shares of common
stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The holders of common stock have no preferences or rights of
conversion, exchange, pre-emption or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to the common stock. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in our
assets in proportion to the shares of common stock held by them that are remaining after payment or
provision for payment of all of our debts and obligations and after distribution in full of preferential amounts
to be distributed to holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock, if any.
Preferred Stock
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, subject to any
limitations prescribed by law, without further stockholder approval, to establish and to issue from time to
time one or more series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Each such series of preferred stock will
cover the number of shares and will have the powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and
restrictions determined by the board of directors, which may include, among others, dividend rights,
liquidation preferences, voting rights, conversion rights, preemptive rights and redemption rights. Except as
provided by law or in a preferred stock designation, the holders of preferred stock will not be entitled to vote
at or receive notice of any meeting of stockholders.
Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended
and Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law
Some provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended
and restated bylaws will contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult:
acquisitions of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our directors. These
Table of Contents
118
provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these
provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may
otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result
in a premium over the market price for our shares.
These provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These
provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us.
We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of
an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging
these proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement
of their terms.
Delaware Law
Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation, including those whose securities are listed for
trading on the NYSE, from engaging in any business combination (as defined in Section 203) with any
interested stockholder (as defined in Section 203) for a period of three years following the date that the
stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:
•
•
•
the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder
is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status;
upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the
interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
transaction commenced; or
on or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting
of stockholders by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested
stockholder.
A corporation may elect not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. We have elected to not be subject to the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL.
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws
Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which
will become effective upon the closing of this offering, may delay or discourage transactions involving an
actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which
stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might
otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our
common stock.
Among other things, upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will:
establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates
for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures
provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the
meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal
executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual
meeting for the preceding year. Our amended and restated bylaws specify the requirements as to form and
content of all stockholders’ notices. These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before
the stockholders at an annual or special meeting;

•
provide our board of directors the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock. This ability makes it possible
for our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or
preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. These and other provisions
may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of our company;
provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;
provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, shall, except as otherwise required by law or, if
applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, be filled exclusively by the affirmative vote of a
majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;
at any time after the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day following the date at
which American Securities and its affiliates no longer collectively beneficially own more than 35% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock, and (ii) the close of business on the business day following public
disclosure that American Securities elected that the following shall occur,
•
•
•
provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly
called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of
a meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with
respect to such series (prior to such time, such actions may be taken without a meeting by written consent
of holders of common stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize such action at a meeting);
provide that our bylaws may be amended by the stockholders only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds of our then outstanding common stock (prior to such time, our bylaws may be amended by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our then outstanding common stock); and
provide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the board of directors, (prior to such
time, a special meeting may also be called at the request of stockholders holding a majority of the
outstanding shares of our common stock);
•
•
•
•
•
provide that certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least 75% of our then outstanding common stock (prior to such time, our certificate of
incorporation may amended by the affirmative vote of the majority of our then outstanding common stock);
provide that, subject to the rights of the preferred stockholders, if any, any director may be removed only for
cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our then outstanding common stock
(prior to such time, subject to the rights of the preferred stockholders, if any, any director may be removed,
with or without cause, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common
stock);
provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in
number as possible, serving staggered three year terms, other than directors which may be elected by holders of
preferred stock, if any. This system of electing and removing directors may tend to discourage a third party from
making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, because it generally makes it more difficult
for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors;
provide that we renounce any interest in certain business opportunities presented to American Securities or any
of its officers, directors, agents, members, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than business opportunities
presented to such person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the company) and that to the fullest
extent permitted by law they have no obligation to offer us those opportunities, other than opportunities relating to
hydraulic fracturing proppants; and
provide that our bylaws can be amended or repealed by the board of directors.

Forum Selection
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that unless we consent in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:
•
•
any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or
agents to us or our stockholders;
any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated
•
•
any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or
any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case
subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as
defendants therein.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that any person or entity purchasing
or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have
consented to this forum selection provision. However, it is possible that a court could find our forum
selection provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable.
Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors for monetary
damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors, except for liability:
•
•
•
•
for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;
for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
for unlawful payment of dividend or unlawful stock repurchase or redemption, as provided under Section 174 of
the DGCL; or
for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
Any amendment, repeal or modification of these provisions will be prospective only and would not affect any
limitation on liability of a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to any such amendment, repeal or
modification.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that we
will indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
law. Under Delaware law we may purchase insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other
agent for any liability arising out of that person’s actions as our officer, director, employee or agent,
regardless of whether Delaware law would permit indemnification. We intend to enter into indemnification
agreements with each of our current and future directors and officers. These agreements will require us to
indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liability that may arise
by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them
as to which they could be indemnified. We believe that the limitation of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the
indemnification agreements will facilitate our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals to
serve as directors and officers.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. Future sales of our common
stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale in the public market, could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. As described below, only a limited
number of shares will be available for sale shortly after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions
on resale. Nevertheless, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
after such restrictions lapse, or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the
prevailing market price of our common stock at such time and our ability to raise equity-related capital at a
time and price we deem appropriate.
Sales of Restricted Shares
Upon completion of this offering, we will have outstanding an aggregate of             shares of common stock,
after giving effect to the          for          stock split of our common stock to be effected prior to the effective
date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Of these shares, all of the
            shares of common stock to be sold in this offering (or              shares assuming the underwriters
exercise the option to purchase additional shares in full) will be freely tradable without restriction or further
registration under the Securities Act, unless the shares are held by any of our “affiliates” as such term is
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All remaining shares of common stock will be deemed
“restricted securities” as such term is defined under Rule 144. The restricted securities were, or will be,
issued and sold by us in private transactions and are eligible for public sale only if registered under the
Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the
Securities Act, which rules are summarized below.
As a result of the lock-up agreements described below and the provisions of Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the
Securities Act, all of the shares of our common stock (excluding the shares to be sold in this offering) will be
available for sale in the public market upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements, beginning 180 days after
the date of this prospectus (subject to extension) and when permitted under Rule 144 or Rule 701.
Lock-up Agreements
We, ASP FML, all of our directors and executive officers and certain of our principal stockholders and the
selling stockholders will agree not to sell any common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of common stock for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, subject to certain
exceptions. Please see “Underwriting” for a description of these lock-up provisions.
Rule 144
In general, under Rule 144 under the Securities Act as currently in effect, a person (or persons whose shares
are aggregated) who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of ours at any time during the three months
preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for a
least six months (including any period of consecutive ownership of preceding non-affiliated holders) would
be entitled to sell those shares, subject only to the availability of current public information about us. A non-
affiliated person who has beneficially owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for at least
one year would be entitled to sell those shares without regard to the provisions of Rule 144.
A person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who is deemed to be an affiliate of ours and who has
beneficially owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for at least six months would be

percent of the then outstanding shares of our common stock or the average weekly trading volume of our
common stock reported through the NYSE during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of notice of the
sale. Such sales are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability
of current public information about us.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS
The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder (as defined below), that holds our
common stock as a “capital asset” (generally property held for investment). This summary is based on the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations and
administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not sought any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(the “IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and
there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with such statements and conclusions.
This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to non-U.S.
holders in light of their personal circumstances. In addition, this summary does not address the Medicare
contribution tax on certain investment income, any U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, any state, local or
foreign tax laws or any tax treaties. This summary also does not address tax considerations applicable to
investors that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as (without
limitation):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;
tax-exempt or governmental organizations;
dealers in securities or foreign currencies;
traders in securities that use the mark-to-market method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or holders of interests therein;
persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
persons that acquired our common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; and
persons that hold our common stock as part of a straddle, appreciated financial position, synthetic security,
hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment or risk reduction transaction.
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO
THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATION, AS
WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR
COMMON STOCK ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS
OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX
TREATY.
Non-U.S. Holder Defined
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of our common stock that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes is neither a partnership nor any of the following:
•
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized
in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
125
Table of Contents
•
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
a trust (i) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more
United States persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) which has
made a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our
common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, we urge partners in partnerships (including
entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) considering the purchase of our
common stock to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock by such partnership.
Distributions
As described in the section entitled “Dividend Policy,” we do not plan to make any distributions on our
common stock for the foreseeable future. However, if we do make distributions of cash or property on our
common stock, those payments will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent
paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax
principles. To the extent those distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the
distributions will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder’s tax basis in
our common stock and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock. See “—
Gain on Disposition of Common Stock.” Subject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA
withholding, distribution made to a non-U.S. holder on our common stock generally will be subject to U.S.
withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides for a lower rate. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must provide the
withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other appropriate form) certifying qualification
for the reduced rate. A non-U.S. holder that does not timely furnish the applicable withholding agent with the
required certification, but that qualifies for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts
withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.
Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the
non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are treated as
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) generally
will be taxed on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to United States
persons (as defined under the Code). Such effectively connected dividends will not be subject to U.S.
withholding tax if the non-U.S. holder satisfies certain certification requirements by providing the withholding
agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI certifying eligibility for exemption. If the non-U.S. holder is a
foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax (at a 30% rate or such lower rate as
specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits (as adjusted for
certain items).
Gain on Disposition of Common Stock
Subject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA withholding, a non-U.S. holder generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our
common stock unless:
•
•
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183
days or more during the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs and certain other conditions are
met;
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-
U.S. holder in the United States); or
126
Table of Contents
•
our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest by reason of our status as a United States real
property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate
of 30% (or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount of such gain, which
generally may be offset by U.S. source capital losses.
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is described in the second bullet point above generally will be taxed on a net
income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to United States persons (as defined under
the Code) unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If the non-U.S. holder is a corporation, it
may also be subject to a branch profits tax (at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable
income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits (as adjusted for certain items) which will
include such gain.
Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or
exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets
used or held for use in a trade or business. We have not determined whether we currently are, a USRPHC for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, as long as our common stock is considered to be regularly
traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations, only a
non-U.S. holder that actually or constructively owns or owned at any time during the shorter of the five-year
period ending on the date of the disposition or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for the common stock,
more than 5% of our common stock will be taxable on gain recognized on the disposition of our common
stock as a result of our status as a USRPHC. If our common stock were not considered to be regularly traded
on an established securities market, and we were considered a USRPHC, all non-U.S. holders generally would
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a taxable disposition of our common stock, and a 10% withholding
tax would apply to the gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock by such non-U.S. holders.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the foregoing rules to
their ownership and disposition of our common stock.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Any dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder must be reported annually to the IRS and to the non-U.S. holder.
Copies of these information returns may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the
non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Payments of dividends to a non-U.S. holder generally will not be
subject to backup withholding if the non-U.S. holder establishes an exemption by properly certifying its non-
U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other appropriate version of IRS Form W-8.
Payments of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition by a non-U.S. holder of our common stock effected
by or through a U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to information reporting and backup
withholding (at the applicable rate) unless the non-U.S. holder establishes an exemption by properly certifying
its non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other appropriate version of IRS Form W-8 and
certain other conditions are met. Information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to any
payment of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock effected outside the United
States by a foreign office of a broker. However, unless such broker has documentary evidence in its records
that the holder is a non-U.S. holder and certain other conditions are met, or the non-U.S. holder otherwise
establishes an exemption, information reporting will apply to a payment of the proceeds of the disposition of
our common stock effected outside the United States by such a broker if it has certain relationships within the
United States.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the U.S. income tax liability (if any) of persons subject to
backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment
of taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Additional Withholding Requirements
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued
thereunder (“FATCA”), impose a 30% withholding tax on any dividends on our common stock and on the
gross proceeds from a disposition of our common stock in each case if paid to a “foreign financial
institution” or a “non-financial foreign entity” (each as defined in the Code) (including, in some cases, when
such foreign financial institution or entity is acting as an intermediary), unless (i) in the case of a foreign
financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain
payments, and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S.
account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well
as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners), (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign
entity, such entity certifies that it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the
Code) or provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial
United States owners of the entity, or (iii) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity
otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions
that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing these rules may be subject to
different rules. Under certain circumstances, a holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
Payments subject to FATCA withholding generally include dividends paid on common stock of a U.S.
corporation after June 30, 2014, and gross proceeds from sales or other dispositions of such common stock
after December 31, 2016. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of the FATCA withholding rules.
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS
TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL
ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS AND ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND TAX TREATIES.

The expenses of the offering that are payable by us are estimated to be approximately $         (excluding
underwriting discounts and commissions). We have agreed to pay expenses incurred by the selling
stockholders in connection with the offering, other than the underwriting discounts and commissions. We
have also agreed to reimburse the underwriters for certain of their expenses in an amount up to $        .
The management team may elect to cause the underwriters to direct a portion of the gross underwriting

shared expense amongst the underwriters.
Option to Purchase Additional Shares
The selling stockholders have granted the underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days after the date of this
prospectus to purchase, from time to time, in whole or in part, up to an aggregate of             shares from the
selling stockholders at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. This option
may be exercised to the extent the underwriters sell more than             shares in connection with this offering.
To the extent that this option is exercised, each underwriter will be obligated, subject to certain conditions, to
purchase its pro rata portion of these additional shares based on the underwriter’s percentage underwriting
commitment in the offering as indicated in the table at the beginning of this Underwriting Section.
Lock-Up Agreements
We, ASP FML, all of our directors and executive officers and certain of our principal stockholders and the
selling stockholders will agree that, for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, we and they will
not directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of at least two of the representatives consisting of
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. and subject to certain
exceptions (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of,
directly or indirectly, any shares of common stock (including, without limitation, shares of common stock that
may be deemed to be beneficially owned by us or them in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
SEC and shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of any options or warrants) or securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock (other than the stock and shares issued
pursuant to employee benefit plans, qualified stock option plans, or other employee compensation plans
existing on the date of this prospectus or pursuant to currently outstanding options, warrants or rights not
issued under one of those plans), (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in
whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of common stock, whether any
such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or such
other securities, in cash or otherwise or (3) file any registration statement with the SEC relating to the offering
of any shares of common stock or any securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., in their sole discretion,
may release the common stock and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above in
whole or in part at any time. When determining whether or not to release common stock and other securities
from lock-up agreements, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital Inc.
will consider, among other factors, the holder’s reasons for requesting the release, the number of shares of
common stock and other securities for which the release is being requested and market conditions at the
time. At least three business days before the effectiveness of any release or waiver of any of the restrictions
described above with respect to an officer or director of the Company, at least two of the representatives
consisting of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. will notify us
of the impending release or waiver and we have agreed to announce the impending release or waiver by press
release through a major news service at least two business days before the effective date of the release or
waiver, except where the release or waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer of common stock that is not
for consideration and where the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same terms as the lock-
up agreements described above to the extent and for the duration that such terms remain in effect at the time
of transfer.

Offering Price Determination
130
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price
was negotiated between the representatives and the selling stockholders. In determining the initial public
offering price of our common stock, the representatives considered:
•
•
•
•
•
the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;
our financial information;
the ability of our management and our business potential and earning prospects;
the prevailing securities markets at the time of this offering; and
the recent market prices of, and the demand for, publicly traded shares of generally comparable companies.
Indemnification
We and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be
required to make for these liabilities.
Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids
The representative may engage in stabilizing transactions, short sales and purchases to cover positions
created by short sales, and penalty bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the
price of the common stock, in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act:
•
•
•
•
Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not
exceed a specified maximum.
A short position involves a sale by the underwriters of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters
are obligated to purchase in the offering, which creates the syndicate short position. This short position may be
either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares
involved in the sales made by the underwriters in excess of the number of shares they are obligated to purchase
is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase by exercising their option to purchase additional
shares. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in their
option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may close out any short position by either exercising their
option to purchase additional shares and/or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of
shares to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares
available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through
their option to purchase additional shares. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters
are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing
that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution
has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions.
Penalty bids permit the representative to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the
common stock originally sold by the syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering
transaction to cover syndicate short positions.
These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising
or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price
of the common stock. As a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that might
otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on the NYSE or otherwise and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

131
Neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude
of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the common stock. In addition,
neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation that the representative will engage in these
stabilizing transactions or that any transaction, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.
Listing on the New York Stock Exchange
We have applied to list our common stock on the NYSE under the symbol “FMSA.”
Stamp Taxes
If you purchase shares of common stock offered in this prospectus, you may be required to pay stamp taxes
and other charges under the laws and practices of the country of purchase, in addition to the offering price
listed on the cover page of this prospectus.
Other Relationships
The underwriters and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage
activities. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the
future perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the issuer and
its affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses.
In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and certain of their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
issuer or its affiliates. If the underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those
underwriters or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the
underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or the securities
of our affiliates, including potentially the shares of common stock offered hereby. Any such credit default
swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the shares of common stock offered
hereby. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates may also communicate independent investment
recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
Selling Restrictions
This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell to, or a solicitation of an offer to buy from, anyone in any
country or jurisdiction (i) in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized, (ii) in which any person
making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or (iii) in which any such offer or solicitation would
otherwise be unlawful. No action has been taken that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of the
shares of common stock or possession or distribution of this prospectus or any other offering or publicity
material relating to the shares of common stock in any country or jurisdiction (other than the United States)
where any such action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, each underwriter has undertaken that it will
not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any shares of common stock or have in its possession, distribute or
publish any prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country
or jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in
compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and all offers and sales of shares of common stock by it
will be made on the same terms.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of FML Holdings, Inc.:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of FML Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. Organization
F-7
FML Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
FML Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a supplier of proppants and sand
products. The Company is organized into two segments: Proppant Solutions and Industrial & Recreational
Products. This segmentation is based on the end markets we serve, our management structure and the
financial information that is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and assess performance.
The Proppant Solutions business serves the oil and gas recovery markets in the United States, Canada,
Argentina, Mexico, China, northern Europe and the Middle East, providing raw and coated proppants
primarily for use in hydraulic fracturing. The raw sand and substrate for our coated sand generally consists of
high-purity silica sands produced at our facilities in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Texas.
The Industrial & Recreational Products business provides raw and coated sands to the foundry, building
products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries.
In addition to its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company owns 90% of a holding company, Technimat LLC,
which owns 70% of Santrol (Yixing) Proppant Co., a manufacturer of resin-based proppants located in China.
During 2013, the company liquidated its interest in Santrol (Tianjin) Proppant Company Ltd., which was
owned by Technimat. The noncontrolling interests in both entities are presented as “Noncontrolling interest”
on the balance sheet.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FML Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has
occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and risk of
loss transfer to the customer. This generally occurs when products leave a storage terminal or, in the case of
direct shipments, when products leave a production facility. Transportation costs to move product from a
production facility to a storage terminal are borne by the Company and capitalized into the cost of inventory.
These costs are included in the cost of sales as the product is sold.
The Company derives its revenue by mining and processing minerals that its customers purchase for various
uses. Its net sales are primarily a function of the price per ton realized and the volumes sold. In some
instances,
Table of Contents
F-8
FML Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
its net sales also include a charge for transportation services it provides to its customers. The Company’s
transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product it transports
under contract, service agreements with its customers, the mode of transportation used and the distance
between its plants and customers.
The Company primarily sells its products under market rate agreements with terms typically ranging from two
to ten years. The Company invoices the majority of its customers on a per shipment basis when the customer
takes possession of the product.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. At various times, the Company maintains funds on deposit at its banks in excess of
FDIC insurance limits.
Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect, and do not bear interest.
Management provides for uncollectible amounts based on its assessment of the current status of individual
accounts. Accounts receivable are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $796, and $1,189 as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The following table presents the activity in the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2013:

Included in accounts receivable is $7,163 and $5,797 of recoverable value-added taxes and other taxes
remitted in Mexico, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries determine cost using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used,
inventories would have been higher by $176 and $4,287 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The
significant decrease in the LIFO inventory reserve is due to the impact of purchase accounting for FTSI,
whereby acquired work-in-process inventory was stepped up to fair value, creating a significant increase in
the LIFO inventory on hand at the end of the year, as well as an ending quantity decrement at another location
(see note 8).
Such inventories comprise 24% and 20% of inventories reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The cost of inventories of all other subsidiaries is
determined using the FIFO method. The Company recognized a $4,958 permanent write-down in the value of
finished goods inventory, net of expected recoveries from suppliers, in the year ended December 31, 2013.
The inventory write-down is included in cost of sales.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures, including interest, for property, plant and
equipment and items that substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized, while
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
Depletion expense calculated for depletable land and mineral rights is based on cost multiplied by a depletion
factor. The depletion factor varies based on production and other factors, but is generally equal to annual
tons mined divided by total estimated remaining reserves for the mine.
The estimated service lives of property and equipment are principally as follows:
Land improvements
Machinery and equipment
Buildings and improvements
Furniture, fixtures, and other
10-
40 years  
3-20
years  
10-40
years  
3-10
years
Construction in progress is stated at cost, which includes the cost of construction and other direct costs
attributable to the construction. No provision for depreciation is made on construction in progress until such
time as the relevant assets are completed and put into use. Construction in progress at December 31, 2013,
represents machinery and facilities under installation.
The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property, plant, and equipment.
The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset’s
estimated useful life. Interest cost capitalized was $2,540 and $2,654 in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Depreciation and depletion expense was $35,917 and $27,562 in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Included in land and improvements are occupancy rights in China of $354 that are held for a term of 50 years
until December 2057.
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable
from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where
undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets or asset groups. The factors
considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends, and
prospects, as well as the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. As a
result of these tests, the Company recorded a write down in the carrying value of certain minerals rights of $0
and $273 in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt obligations and are included in other
assets. In connection with the refinancing of the Company’s debt in September 2013 (see note 10), the
Company incurred financing costs of $15,132 of which $14,171 were capitalized. In connection with the
refinancing, the Company wrote off $11,358 of costs that were previously capitalized. The following table
presents deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:

Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by applying a fair-value based test on an annual
basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company
assesses goodwill for possible impairment using a two-step method. The first step of the goodwill
impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an
indication of goodwill impairment exists. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, and the
residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.
The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable
from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where
undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets or asset groups.
The evaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets for possible impairment includes estimating fair value
using one or a combination of valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flows or based on comparable
companies or transactions. These valuations require the Company to make estimates and assumptions
regarding future operating results, cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling
prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are
reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.
The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for goodwill or other intangible assets in the years
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
Earnings per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share is presented for net income attributable to FML Holdings, Inc. Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to FML Holdings, Inc. common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares for the period. Diluted earnings per share is
computed
F-11
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except share and per share data)
by increasing the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares to include the additional common
shares that would be outstanding after exercise of outstanding stock options. Potential common shares in the
diluted earnings per share calculation are excluded to the extent that they would be anti-dilutive.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
Due to its variable-rate indebtedness, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company
uses interest rate swaps to manage this exposure. These derivative instruments are recorded on the balance
sheet at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings
or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging
relationship and, if it is, depending on the type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which the
Company is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during
which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of
all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation,
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps are reclassified
into income to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each
swap. In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during
which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
The Company formally designates and documents instruments at inception that qualify for hedge accounting
of underlying exposures in accordance with GAAP. Both at inception and for each reporting period, the
Company assesses whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting
changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposure.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance
sheet date; income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
The related translation adjustments are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
equity.
Concentration of Labor
Approximately 14% of the Company’s domestic labor force is covered under eight union agreements that
expire at various times through November 2016. None of the contracts expire before March 2015.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Approximately 39% and 38% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively,
was outstanding from three customers.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between
financial statement amounts and their respective tax bases. Management reviews the Company’s deferred tax
Table of Contents
F-12

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except share and per share data)
assets to determine whether their value can be realized based upon available evidence. A valuation allowance
is established if management believes it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.
Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the
period of change.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when the tax position is
more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is
measured as the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax uncertainties in income
tax expense.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related
facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements. We record the initial estimated
present value of reclamation costs as an asset retirement obligation and increase the carrying amount of the
related asset by a corresponding amount. We allocate reclamation costs to expense over the life of the related
assets and adjust the related liability for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either
the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for
more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively.
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development expenses consist of personnel and other direct and indirect costs
for internally funded project development. Total expenses for R&D for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012 were $5,364 and $1,815, respectively. Total research and development expenditures represented 0.54%
and 0.21% of revenues in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is a separate line within equity that reports the Company’s
cumulative income that has not been reported as part of net income. Items that are included in this line are
the income or loss from foreign currency translation, actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost related
to pension liabilities, and the unrealized gains and losses on certain investments or hedges, net of taxes. The
components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to FML Holdings, Inc. at

(ASU 2013-11). ASU 2013-11 requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a
loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions except where the
deferred tax asset or other carryforward are not available for use. The guidance is effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2013. The adoption of the guidance has not had a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial
Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations
and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08), which amended existing
requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, discontinued operations
reporting will be limited to disposal transactions that represent strategic shifts having a major effect on
operations and financial results. The amended guidance also enhances disclosures and requires assets and
liabilities of a discontinued operation to be classified as such for all periods presented in the financial
statements. The guidance is effective for disposal transactions occurring in reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2014. Presentation and disclosures of future disposal transactions after adoption of the
guidance may be different than under current standards.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (ASU 2014-09). Under ASU 2014-09, companies recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires
improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its
financial statements and disclosures.

8. Acquisitions
The Company made three acquisitions in 2013. On April 30, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of Self-
Suspending Proppant LLC (“SSP”) for total consideration of $56,320 plus contingent consideration. The
Company accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of a group of assets. SSP owned the exclusive
rights to certain intellectual property related to providing proppant with enhanced performance attributes
through proprietary coating technology. The contingent consideration is a fixed percentage of the cumulative
product margin, less certain adjustments, generated by our Propel SSP sales for the five years commencing
on October 1, 2015. Because the earnout is dependent on future sales and the related cost of sales, the
amounts of which are highly uncertain, it is not possible to estimate the amount that will be paid. The
contingent consideration will be capitalized, and the associated amortization expense will be recognized, at
the time a payment is probable and reasonably estimable.
On June 12, 2013, the Company purchased Great Plains Sands, LLC (“Great Plains”), located in Minnesota,
for total purchase consideration of $73,579. The Company accounted for this acquisition under ASC 805 as a
business combination. Included in the purchase amount is contingent consideration of $9,600 for additional
payments due to the seller based on the acquired plant meeting certain operating targets. The Company
believes it is highly likely these targets will be met and therefore has discounted the payments only to reflect
the time value of money until the expected payment date, which is within one year. The goodwill of $3,887 is
primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. The Company expects that all of
the goodwill generated in this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes. The production facilities were
not complete at the time of the acquisition, and accordingly there were no preacquisition revenues or cost of
sales. As a result, pro forma results would not be meaningful in evaluating the financial effect of this
acquisition. It is not practicable to determine revenue and net income included in the Company’s operating
results relating to Great Plains since the date of acquisition because Great Plains has been fully integrated
into the Company’s operations, and the operating results of Great Plains can therefore not be separately
identified.
On September 6, 2013, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from FTS
International Services, LLC (“FTSI”) and affiliates. The Company acquired sand reserves, frac sand
production capacity, resin coating capacity and logistics assets consisting of terminals and railcars. The
assets are located in various states, including Texas, Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, and Illinois. In
connection with this acquisition, the Company also entered into a ten year supply agreement with FTSI. In
April 2014, the agreed upon quantities of certain raw sand required under the supply agreement were lowered
to 80% of the original quantity. The total consideration was $347,704. The Company accounted for this
acquisition under ASC 805 as a business combination. The goodwill of $49,456 is primarily attributable to the
synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. The Company expects that all of the goodwill generated in
this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes. The historical financial information for the assets
acquired was impracticable to obtain, and inclusion of pro forma information would require the Company to
make estimates and assumptions regarding these assets’ historical financial results that may not be
reasonable or accurate. As a result, pro forma results are not presented. It is not practicable to determine
revenue and net income included in the Company’s operating results relating to FTSI since the date of
acquisition because FTSI has been fully integrated into the Company’s operations, and the operating results
of FTSI can therefore not be separately identified.
The purchase price for each of these acquisitions was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired. Such
determination of fair value is based on valuation models that incorporate the present value of expected future
cash flows and profitability projections. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the
determination of the fair value. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable,
deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.

On March 15, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment (“Amended Credit Agreement”) to the Credit and
Guaranty Agreement dated August 5, 2010 (“Original Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement
provided for revolving loans up to $75,000 and a Senior Secured Tranche B Term Loan in an aggregate
principal amount of $1,000,000. Unless otherwise accelerated, the Revolving Commitment was due to expire
on August 5, 2015 and the Tranche B Term Loan was due to mature on March 15, 2017.
On September 5, 2013, the Company entered into an amendment (“2013 Amended Credit Agreement”) to the
Amended Credit Agreement. The 2013 Amended Credit Agreement caused the issuance of two new term loans,
Senior Secured Term B-1 (“B-1 Term Loan”) of $325,000 and Senior Secured Term B-2 (“B-2 Term Loan”) of
$885,000, and a new Revolving Credit Agreement (“New Revolver”) with a commitment amount of $75,000. The
proceeds of the borrowings under the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the previous credit facility and to fund the acquisition of the proppant assets of FTSI (see
note 8).
The B-1 Term Loan matures on March 15, 2017 and requires quarterly principal repayments of $800 (1%
annually) with the balance due at maturity. The B-2 Term Loan matures on September 5, 2019 and requires
quarterly principal repayments of $2,200 (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. The New Revolver
expires on September 5, 2018. Until they were repriced in March 2014, borrowings under the B-1 Term Loan,
the B-2 Term Loan and the revolving credit facility bore interest, at the Company’s discretion, at the base rate
(the greater of prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5%, 2.0%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus 3.0% or the
adjusted Eurodollar Rate (subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 4.0%. With respect to borrowings under the B-1 Term
Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, the 2.0% minimum for Base Rate borrowings and 1.0% for Eurodollar Rate
borrowings did not apply. The applicable margin on the loans could be reduced by 0.25% if the Company’s
leverage ratio fell below 2.75. As of December 31, 2013, the borrowings for the B-1 Term Loan and the New
Revolver bore interest at 4.3% and the B-2 Term Loan at 5.0%. Additionally, the Company pays a commitment
fee of 0.5% per annum, based on the daily average of the unused commitment under the New Revolver.
The terms of the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement provide for customary representations and warranties and
affirmative covenants. The credit facility also contains customary negative covenants setting forth limitations
on further indebtedness, liens, investments, disposition of assets, acquisitions, junior payments and
restrictions on subsidiary distributions. The Company must maintain a leverage ratio as of the end of each
quarter of no more than 4.75 if the aggregate revolver borrowing is equal to or greater than 25% of the total
revolver commitment.
In February 2014 the Company executed a joinder agreement to borrow $41,000 as an additional B-2 Term
Loan. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay then outstanding amounts under the New Revolver.
The additional borrowings mature on the same date as the then existing B-2 Term Loan (September 5, 2019)
and the required quarterly principal repayments for the B-2 Term Loan were increased by one-quarter of 1% of
the amount borrowed with the balance due at maturity. There were no other changes in the terms, interest
rates or covenants of the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement.
In March 2014 the Company amended the existing credit agreement whereby the applicable margin for B-1 and
B-2 Base Rate loans was reduced to 2.5% and B-1 and B-2 Eurodollar Rate loans was reduced to 3.5%.
The Company granted the lenders a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets.
The Company has a $10,000 Industrial Revenue Bond outstanding related to the construction of a
manufacturing facility in Wisconsin. The bond bears interest, which is payable monthly, at a variable rate. The

Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements as a means to hedge its variable interest rate risk on
debt instruments. The notional value of these swap agreements is $560,550 at December 31, 2013 and
effectively fixes the variable rate in a range of 0.830% to 3.115%. The notional amount of these instruments is
scheduled to increase over time to provide a hedge against variable interest rate debt. The interest rate swap
agreements mature at various dates between December 31, 2013 and September 5, 2019.
Certain of the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. The following table
summarizes the fair values and the respective classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012:

agreements designated as hedges, in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect
$2,490 to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense in the year
ending December 31, 2014.
13. Fair Value Measurements
Financial instruments held by the Company include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
long-term debt and interest rate swaps. The Company is also liable for contingent consideration from an
acquisition that is subject to fair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes certain assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks
inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Based on the examination of the inputs used in the valuation
techniques, the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair value
hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair
values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the
following three categories:
Level 1
Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 1
Level 2   Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The book value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be
representative of their fair values because of their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s debt
is

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $426 and $664, respectively, of gross deferred tax assets
related to U.S. foreign tax credits which will begin expiring in 2021.
At December 31, 2013 and 2012, cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries included in
consolidated retained earnings amounted to $7,165 and $12,583, respectively. These earnings are indefinitely
reinvested in international operations. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. deferred taxes
related to future repatriation of these earnings, nor is it practical to estimate the amount of income taxes that
would have to be provided if the Company was to conclude that such earnings will be remitted in the
foreseeable future.

The Company or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico, and
Denmark. The Company is subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. Federal income taxes for the
preceding three fiscal years and, in general, is subject to state and local income tax examinations for the
same periods. The Company is subject to income tax examinations in Canada, China, Mexico, and Denmark
for calendar years 2009 through 2012.

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $4,544 and $4,767, respectively, of unrecognized tax
benefits. If the $4,544 were recognized, the full amount would affect the effective tax rate. We do not expect
that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next twelve months. Interest
and penalties are recorded in provision for income taxes. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had
$1,506 and $1,400, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
recorded.
15. Common Stock and Stock Based Compensation
The Company has two classes of common stock. Class A and Class B common stock have similar rights, with
the only difference being that Class B shares do not have voting rights.
The Company’s bylaws provide for certain rights with respect to share transactions. Transfers of shares are,
except in limited circumstances, subject to certain rights of refusal by the Company and other existing
stockholders, as defined. In addition, each stockholder has the right to request the Company to repurchase
the shares he or she owns during designated semi-annual redemption request periods (redemption requests).
The Board of Directors shall then determine, in its unconditional, sole and absolute discretion, the aggregate
number of shares, if any, that the Company will purchase. Further, employee stockholders are subject to
mandatory repurchase provisions in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances. The
purchase price under the redemption requests and the mandatory repurchase provisions shall be at fair
market value, as defined, payable in cash either immediately or on a deferred basis.
The Company has a stock option plan that allows for granting of options to acquire 350,000 Class B shares to
employees and key non-employees. The options are exercisable for a ten year period. Options are exercisable
at times determined by the compensation committee of the Company and, as set forth in each individual
option agreement. The options may become exercisable over a period of years or become exercisable only if
performance or other goals set by the Board are attained, or may be a combination of both. Options may be
exercised, in whole or in part, at any time after becoming exercisable, but not later than the date the option
expires, which is typically 10 years from the grant date. Options granted after 2009 contain a 7 year vesting
period that may be shortened to five years upon attainment of certain Company performance goals as
determined by the compensation committee. The stock option plan also contains a change in control
provision that provides for immediate vesting upon certain changes of ownership of the company. All options
granted prior to 2010 are fully vested. The Company uses shares available in treasury when options are
exercised, to the extent available.

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was
$181.80 and $185.19, respectively, based on the Black-Scholes-Merton options-pricing model, with the
following assumptions:
Dividend yield
Expected volatility
Risk free interest rate
Expected option life
2013
0.00%  
 
 
46.38%  
 1.12 - 2.00%  
  6.5 years
2012
0.00% 
 
 
49.66% 
 0.97 - 1.26% 
  6.5 years
The Company has no current plans to declare a dividend that would require a dividend yield assumption
other than zero. Expected volatility is based on the volatilities of various comparable companies’ common
stock. The comparable companies were selected by analyzing public companies in the industry based on
various factors including, but not limited to, company size, financial data availability, active trading volume,
and capital structure. The risk free interest rate is an interpolated rate from the U.S. constant maturity treasury
rate for a term corresponding to the expected option life. Because the Company does not have sufficient
historical data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected life of the options, the Company uses
the simplified method, which assumes the expected life is the mid-point between the vesting date and the end
of the contractual term.
In determining the underlying value of the Company’s stock, the company used a combination of the
guideline company approach and a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions in this estimate
include management’s projections of future cash flows, the Company-specific cost of capital used as a
discount rate, lack of marketability discount, and qualitative factors to compare the Company to comparable
guideline companies. During 2013, factors that contributed to changes in the underlying value of the
Company’s stock included the continued recovery of the oil and gas fracking market, changes to future cash
flows projected from the Company’s acquisitions, increases in operating leverage due to increased debt,
product mix including mix of raw versus resin coated sand, and other factors. As the Company is highly
dependent on sales to the oil and gas industry, the market conditions for this industry have a high degree of
impact on the Company’s value.
The Company recorded $10,133 and $11,434 of stock compensation expense related to these options, which is
included in additional paid-in capital, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(in thousands, except share and per share data)
Options outstanding as of December 31, 2013 have an aggregate intrinsic value of $136,059 and a weighted
average remaining contractual life of 6.3 years. Options that are exercisable as of December 31, 2013 have an
aggregate intrinsic value of $113,027 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.6 years. The
aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair value of the Company’s shares of $379.05
per share at December 31, 2013 and the exercise price of the dilutive options, multiplied by the number of
dilutive options outstanding at that date.
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
was $6,564 and $2,574, respectively.
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $1,277 and $716 in the years ended December 31,
2013 and 2012, respectively.
There was $2,461 and $965 of income tax benefits realized from stock option exercises in the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
At December 31, 2013, options to purchase 240,573 Class A shares and 317,690 Class B shares were
outstanding. At December 31, 2012, options to purchase 267,098 Class A shares and 271,190 Class B shares
were outstanding. As of December 31, 2013, $15,997 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years.
16. Defined Benefit Plans
The Company maintains two defined benefit pension plans covering all union employees at certain facilities
that provide benefits based upon years of service or a combination of employee earnings and length of
service. The plans are underfunded by $926 and $2,553 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The
Company is expected to fund the minimum annual contributions as determined by applicable regulations,
which will be $234 for 2014; the Company reserves the right to make contributions in excess of this amount.
The following assumptions were used to determine the Company’s obligations under the plans:
Discount rate
Wedron Pension
2012
2013
Troy Grove Pension  
  2012
2013
Discount rate
Long-term rate of return on plan assets
4.50%  
  9.00%
3.75%  
  9.00%
5.00%   
  9.00%
4.00% 
  9.00%
The difference in the discount rates used for the Wedron Pension and the Troy Grove Pension is due to the
differing characteristics of the two plans, including employee characteristics and plan size. The Company
uses a cash flow matching approach to determine its discount rate using each plan’s projected cash flows
and the Citigroup Discount Curve.
The long term rate of return on assets is based on management’s estimate of future long term rates of return
on similar assets and is consistent with historical returns on such assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
The written investment policy for the pension plans includes a target allocation of about 70% in equities and
30% in fixed income investments. Only high-quality diversified securities similar to stocks and bonds are
used. Higher-risk securities or strategies (such as derivatives) are not currently used but could be used
incidentally by mutual funds held by the plan. The pension plans’ obligations are long-term in nature and the
investment policy is therefore focused on the long-term. Goals include achieving gross returns at least equal
to relevant indices. Management and the plans’ investment advisor regularly review and discuss investment
performance, adherence to the written investment policy, and the investment policy itself.
Benefits under the Wedron plan were frozen effective December 31, 2012.

17. Other Benefit Plans
Certain union employees participate in a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under which monthly
contributions are made by the Company based upon payroll costs as governed by the collective bargaining
Table of Contents
F-29
Fairmount Minerals LTD. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
agreement. The risks of participating in a multiemployer plan are different from a single-employer plan in the
following aspects (a) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide
benefits to employees of other participating employers; (b) if a participating employer stops contributing to
the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and
(c) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, the Company may be required to
pay the multiemployer plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the multiemployer plan, referred to
as a withdrawal liability. The Company has no plans or intentions to stop participating in the plan as of
December 31, 2013. Pension expense for such plans totaled $155 and $367 for the years ended December 31,
2013 and 2012, respectively.
The Company has a defined contribution retirement savings trust and plan covering substantially all
employees. Under the provisions of the plan, the Company matches 50% of each employee’s contribution up
to 5% of an employee’s annual salary. Company contributions were $965 and $739 for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The Company has a profit sharing plan (Stock Bonus Trust and Plan). This plan covers substantially all
nonunion employees. Company contributions are discretionary and plan funds will be allocated to
participating employees based upon compensation, as defined. Discretionary contributions accrued at
December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $2,103 and $3,320, respectively. The Stock Bonus Trust and Plan held
238,679 of class A shares as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain
employees who participate in the Company’s qualified 401(k) plan and/or the Qualified Employee Stock Bonus
Plan (ESBP). The purpose of the SERP is to provide an opportunity for the participants of the SERP to defer
compensation and to receive their pro rata share of former ESBP contributions. Due to income restrictions
imposed by the IRS code, such contributions were formerly made to the ESBP but, in some instances, were
forfeited by these employees to the remaining ESBP participant accounts. Company contributions to the
SERP were $15 and $163 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The Company has deferred compensation agreements with various management employees that provide for
supplemental payments upon retirement. These amounts are being accrued for over the estimated
employment periods of these individuals.
18. Self-Insured Plans
Certain subsidiaries, located in Illinois and Michigan, are self-insured for workers’ compensation up to $1,000
per occurrence and $3,000 in the aggregate. The Company has an accrued liability of $748 and $364 as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for anticipated future payments on claims incurred to date.
Management believes these amounts are adequate to cover all required payments.
The Company is also self-insured for medical benefits. The Company has an accrued liability of $2,017 and
$2,092 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for anticipated future payments on claims incurred to
date. Management believes this amount is adequate to cover all required payments.
19. Commitments and Contingencies
Certain subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits in which the alleged injuries are claimed to be silicosis-related
and to have resulted, in whole or in part, from exposure to silica-containing products, allegedly
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
(in thousands, except share and per share data)
including those sold by certain subsidiaries. In the majority of cases, there are numerous other defendants. In
accordance with its insurance obligations, the defense of these actions has been tendered to and the cases
are being defended by the subsidiaries’ insurance carriers. Management believes that the Company’s
substantial level of existing and available insurance coverage combined with various open indemnities is
more than sufficient to cover any exposure to silicosis-related expenses.
The Company has entered into numerous mineral rights agreements, in which payments under the
agreements are expensed as incurred. Certain agreements require annual payments while other agreements
require payments based upon annual tons mined and others a combination thereof. Total royalty expense was
$1,818 and $1,503 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The Company leases certain machinery, equipment (including railcars), buildings and office space under
operating lease arrangements. Total rent expense associated with these leases was $34,195 and $25,375 for
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Minimum lease payments, primarily for equipment and office leases, due under the long-term operating lease

respectively.
The Company had purchases from an affiliated entity for material purchases related to its operations in China

21. Segment Reporting
The Company organizes its business into two reportable segments, Proppant Solutions and Industrial &
Recreational Products. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets
served by the Company and the financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.

(in thousands, except share and per share data)
The chief operating decision maker primarily evaluates an operating segment’s performance based on
segment contribution margin, which excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of
the segment. These corporate costs are separately stated below and include costs that are related to
functional areas such as operations management, corporate purchasing, accounting, treasury, information
technology, legal and human resources. The other accounting policies of the segments are the same as those

1. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of FML Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the
opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments
(which are of a normal, recurring nature) and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of the reported interim periods. The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 was derived from audited financial
statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period. These unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial
Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations
and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08), which amended existing
requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, discontinued operations
reporting will be limited to disposal transactions that represent strategic shifts having a major effect on
operations and financial results. The amended guidance also enhances disclosures and requires assets and
liabilities of a discontinued operation to be classified as such for all periods presented in the financial
statements. The guidance is effective for disposal transactions occurring in reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2014. Presentation and disclosures of future disposal transactions after adoption of the
guidance may be different than under current standards.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (ASU 2014-09). Under ASU 2014-09, companies recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The new requirements significantly
enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital
markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better
understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The Company is not
required to adopt this reporting standard until reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are in
the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements and disclosures.

In February 2014 the Company executed a joinder agreement to borrow $41,000 as an additional Term Loan B-
2. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay then outstanding amounts under the revolving credit
facility. The additional borrowings mature on the same date as the then existing Term Loan B-2 (September 5,
2019) and the required quarterly principal repayments for the Term Loan B-2 were increased by one-quarter of
1% of the amount borrowed with the balance due at maturity. There were no other changes in the terms,
interest rates or covenants of the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement.
In March 2014 the Company amended the existing 2013 Amended Credit Agreement whereby the applicable
margin for the Term Loan B-1 and the Term Loan B-2 base rate loans was reduced to 2.50% and the applicable
margin for the Term Loan B-1 and the Term Loan B-2 Eurodollar rate loans was reduced to 3.50% .

The calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and
2013 excludes 55,764 and 23,642 potential common shares, respectively, because the effect of including these
potential common shares would be antidilutive.
6. Derivative Instruments
The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements as a means to hedge its variable interest rate risk on
debt instruments. The notional value of these swap agreements is $542,300 at June 30, 2014 and effectively
fixes the variable rate in a range of 0.83% to 3.115% . The notional amount of these instruments is scheduled
to increase over time to provide a hedge against variable interest rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements
mature at various dates between March 31, 2015 and September 5, 2019.
The derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on
whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship and, if it is, depending on the type of
hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which the Company is hedging the variability of cash flows
related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are impacted by the variability
of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period
earnings. As interest

(unaudited)
expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
related to the interest rate swaps are reclassified into income to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal
to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap. In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to
maturity, gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) remain deferred and are
reclassified into earnings in the periods which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
The Company formally designated and documents instruments at inception that qualify for hedge accounting
of underlying exposures in accordance with GAAP. Both at inception and for each reporting period, the
Company assesses whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting
changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposure.
The following table summarizes the fair values and the respective classification in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013:

Fair Value Measurements
Financial instruments held by the Company include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
long-term debt and interest rate swaps. The Company is also liable for contingent consideration from an
acquisition that is subject to fair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes certain assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks
inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Based on the examination of the inputs used in the valuation
techniques, the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair value
hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair
values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the
following three categories:
Level 1   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2   Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.

(in thousands, except share and per share data)
(unaudited)
The book value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be
representative of their fair values because of their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s debt
is also considered to be representative of its fair value since the interest rate is variable and fluctuates with
the market. The contingent consideration related to the Great Plains acquisition is valued based on the
expected cash flows using a discount rate of 5%.
The following table presents the amounts carried at fair value as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for
the Company’s other financial instruments.

The contingent consideration related to the Great Plains Sands, LLC acquisition is revalued each period
based on the expected cash flows, using a discount rate of 5.0% . The amount due under the earnout
agreement was determined to be $10 million and was paid in July 2014.

11. Commitments and Contingencies
Certain subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits in which the alleged injuries are claimed to be silicosis-related
and to have resulted, in whole or in part, from exposure to silica-containing products, allegedly including
those sold by certain subsidiaries. In the majority of cases, there are numerous other defendants. In
accordance with its insurance obligations, the defense of these actions has been tendered to and the cases
are being defended by the subsidiaries’ insurance carriers. Management believes that the Company’s
substantial level of existing and available insurance coverage combined with various open indemnities is
more than sufficient to cover any exposure to silicosis-related expenses.
The Company has entered into numerous mineral rights agreements, in which payments under the
agreements are expensed as incurred. Certain agreements require annual payments while other agreements
require payments based upon annual tons mined and others a combination thereof.
The Company leases certain machinery, equipment (including railcars), buildings and office space under
operating lease arrangements. Total rent expense associated with these leases was $25,458 and $12,398 for
the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The Company is subject to a contingent consideration arrangement related to the purchase of Self-
Suspending Proppant LLC (“SSP”), which was accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The
contingent consideration is based on a fixed percentage of the cumulative product margin, less certain
adjustments, generated by sales of Propel SSP for the five years commencing on October 1, 2015. Because
the earnout is dependent on future sales and the related cost of sales, the amounts of which are highly
uncertain, it is not currently possible to estimate the amounts that will be paid. The contingent consideration
will be accrued and capitalized as part of the cost of the SSP assets at the time a payment is probable and
reasonably estimable.

12. Transactions with Related Parties
The Company had purchases from an affiliated entity for freight, logistic services and consulting services
related to its operations in China of $976 and $608 in the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
The Company had purchases from an affiliated entity for material purchases related to its operations in China
of $0 and $8 in the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The Company paid management fees of $526 and $500 in the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, to an affiliated entity.
13. Segment Reporting
The Company organizes its business into two reportable segments, Proppant Solutions and Industrial &
Recreational Products. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets
served by the Company and the financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The chief operating decision maker primarily evaluates an operating segment’s performance based on
segment contribution margin, which excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of
the segment. These corporate costs are separately stated below and include costs that are related to
functional areas such as operations management, corporate purchasing, accounting, treasury, information
technology, legal and human resources.

Table of Contents
F-47
APPENDIX A—GLOSSARY OF TERMS
activator: A substance that triggers chemical properties which create an increased propensity for undergoing
a specified chemical reaction.
API: American Petroleum Institute
BTU: British Thermal Unit
captive terminal: A terminal owned by or operated exclusively for the benefit of the Company.
ceramic proppant: An artificially manufactured proppant of consistent size and sphere shape that offers a high
crush resistance.
Class I Railroad: A designation by the Surface Transportation Board of the largest railroads based upon
annual carrier operating revenues.
curable resin: A resin that bonds together under closure stress and high temperatures. This resin is designed
to generate more uniform stress distribution.
diagenesis: A chemical reaction where proppants, under heat and pressure, react with the fracturing fluids
and/or formation face to degrade the proppant.
downhole completions: A set of events and protocols necessary to bring a wellbore into production once
drilling operations have been concluded, including but not limited to fracturing, pumping of frac fluid system,
and shut-in after installation of downhole hardware and equipment required to enable safe and efficient
production from an oil or gas well.
EBITDA: A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure defined as net income (loss) before net interest
expense, income tax expense and depreciation and depletion expense.
embedment: The ability of a proppant to embed into the surrounding rock formation, which results in reduced
flow capacity by decreasing the overall width of the fracture.
fines: Crushed sand grains.
frac sand: A proppant used in the completion and re-completion of oil and gas wells to stimulate and
maintain oil and natural gas production through the process of hydraulic fracturing.
GAAP: Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
hydraulic fracturing: The process of pumping fluids, mixed with granular proppants, into a geological
formation at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock.
in-basin: Refers to sales from one of our distribution terminals where a customer picks up our proppant in a
truck to transport directly to a well site. These distribution terminals are geographically situated to efficiently
and economically serve the applicable oil and gas basin.
md-FT: The most common unit of measure for conductivity. It represents the product of fracture permeability
and fracture width.
mesh size: Measurement of the size of a grain of sand indicating it will pass through a sieve of a certain size.
Table of Contents
A-1
mine horizon: The mix of grades of sand from top to bottom of the reserves deposit.
Northern White sand: A monocrystalline sand with greater sphericity and roundness enabling higher crush
resistances and conductivity.
polymer breaking: After higher viscosity fracturing fluid serves its purpose of fracturing the formation, it is
necessary to “break” the gelled polymer in order for hydrocarbons to flow. The polymer gel viscosity is
reduced significantly upon breaking. In short, polymer breaking means reduction in the molecular chain
length of the starting material. The chemical breakers used are either oxidizers, acids or enzymes.
proppant: A sized particle mixed with fracturing fluid to hold fractures open after a hydraulic fracturing
treatment.
proven reserves: Quantity of sand estimated with reasonable certainty, from the analysis of geologic and
engineering data, to be recoverable from well-established or known reservoirs with the existing equipment
and under the existing operating conditions.
reserves: Sand that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination based on relevant
legal, economic and technical considerations.
resin coated sand: Raw sand that is coated with a flexible resin that increases the sand’s crush resistance and
prevents crushed sand from dispersing throughout the fracture.
roundness: A measure of how round the curvatures of an object are. The opposite of round is angular. It is
possible for an object to be round but not spherical (e.g. an egg-shaped particle is round, but not spherical).
When used to describe proppant, roundness is a reference to having a curved shape which promotes
hydrocarbon flow, as the curvature creates a space through which the hydrocarbons can flow.
silica: A chemically resistant dioxide of silicon that occurs in crystalline, amorphous and cryptocrystalline
forms.
sold in-basin: Sales of proppant products in oil and gas producing basins proximate to their end use.
sphericity: A measure of how well an object is formed in a shape where all points are equidistant from the
center. The more spherical a proppant, the more highly it is desired relative to non-spherical proppant, as the
gaps created by it are typically the largest and this promotes maximum hydrocarbon flow.
tempered resin: A sand-grain coating that is designed to increase the strength of individual grains by adding
a thin deformable coating onto the grain. This coating allows greater grain-to-grain contact and more evenly
distributes the point stresses. These products do not require activation, as their chemical properties are
already active.
transloading capacity: The annual aggregate throughput volume of proppants at the Company’s terminals.
Tier I emissions: Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by a company.
Tier II emissions: Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from goods or resources used by a company.
turbidity: Measurement of the level of contaminants, such as silt and clay, in a sample.
unit train: A train made up of 100 or more railcars which are all shipped from the same origin to the same
destination without being split up or stored en route.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a director will not be liable to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. In addition,
if the DGCL is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided for in our
certificate of incorporation, will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended DGCL. Our amended
and restated bylaws will provide that the corporation will indemnify, and advance expenses to, any officer or
director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL.
Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other
employees and individuals against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with specified actions, suits and proceedings whether civil, criminal, administrative,
or investigative, other than a derivative action by or in the right of the corporation, if they acted in good faith
and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was
unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification
extends only to expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person
seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. The statute provides that it is not exclusive
of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
disinterested director vote, stockholder vote, agreement or otherwise.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also contain indemnification rights for our directors
and our officers. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we shall
indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. Further, we may maintain
insurance on behalf of our officers and directors against expense, liability or loss asserted incurred by them
in their capacities as officers and directors.

II-1
We have obtained directors’ and officers’ insurance to cover our directors, officers and some of our
employees for certain liabilities.
We will enter into written indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. Under these
proposed agreements, if an officer or director makes a claim of indemnification to us, either a majority of the
independent directors or independent legal counsel selected by the independent directors must review the
relevant facts and make a determination whether the officer or director has met the standards of conduct
under Delaware law that would permit (under Delaware law) and require (under the indemnification agreement)
us to indemnify the officer or director.
The underwriting agreement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of us and our officers and
directors, and by us of the underwriters, for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act or otherwise in
connection with this offering.
Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
During the past three years, we have issued unregistered securities to a limited number of persons, as
described below. None of these transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or
commissions or any public offering, and we believe that each of these transactions was exempt from the
registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, Regulation D or Regulation S
promulgated thereunder or Rule 701 of the Securities Act. All share and price information included in this
section does not reflect the impact of the expected pre-offering split of our common stock.
The following table sets forth information on the restricted stock awards issued by us and common stock
issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options in the three years preceding the filing of this registration
statement.

The issuances of common stock described above either represent grants of restricted stock under, or were
made pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under our compensation plans to our officers,
directors, employees and consultants in reliance upon an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, including those contained in Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of
the Securities Act. Among other things, we relied on the fact that, under Rule 701, companies that are not
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act are exempt from
registration under the Securities Act with respect to certain offers and sales of securities pursuant to
“compensatory benefit plans” as defined under that rule.

Item 16. Exhibits and financial statement schedules
See the Exhibit Index immediately following the signature page hereto, which is incorporated by reference as
if fully set forth herein.
Item 17. Undertakings
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the
underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the
underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors,
officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In
the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of
expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:
(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form
of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of
prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be
deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that
contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities
offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
offering thereof.
(3) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule
424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on
Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and
included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that
no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made
in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or
prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior
to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or
prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to
such date of first use.
(4) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
distribution of the securities, in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this
registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if
the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the
undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities
to such purchaser:
i.
Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be
filed pursuant to Rule 424;
II-5
Table of Contents
ii.
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or
used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;
iii. The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about
the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
iv. Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
