Galaxy Resources Limited (ASX: GXY) (“Galaxy” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide the following update for its Mt Cattlin project in 
Ravensthorpe, Western Australia.
In July 2016, General Mining Corporation Limited (“General Mining”) announced the decision to upgrade the annual throughput of Mt 
Cattlin from 800,000 tonnes per annum to 1,600,000 tonnes per annum. This decision will deliver substantial operational efficiency and 
greater capacity to meet the current demand for spodumene production from the Chinese market. The upgraded capacity of the plant will 
see  annual  spodumene  concentrate  production  increased  to  at  least  160,000t  (based  on  a  50%  recovery  yield),  from  the  previously 
budgeted 80,000 tonnes.
Following  the  successful  completion  of  the  takeover  of  General  Mining,  the  Company  engaged  experienced  lithium  plant  engineering 
company Primero Group (“Primero”) to conduct a comprehensive review of the status of the Mt Cattlin plant construction, commissioning 
and production schedule.
Galaxy is pleased to report that the refurbishment and upgrade of Mt Cattlin has passed 80% completion. Primero mobilised their team to 
site in late August to finalise the construction and completions packages and to begin implementing their planned commissioning and start-
up program. The Primero team has significant experience as project managers in the construction, commissioning and ramp-up of other 
hard rock lithium/tantalum projects very similar to Mt Cattlin.
Since  mobilising  to  site  Primero  have  undertaken  a  complete  gap  analysis.  Resequencing  of  a  number  of  activities  has  enabled  the 
construction to progress along the critical path elements to maintain focus on key areas of the plant for commissioning and ramp-up.
The combination of changes being built into the mica removal circuit, increased throughput capacity, the project management changes 
and a period of heavy seasonal weather have resulted in delays to the production and shipment forecast previously announced by General 
Mining. Galaxy now expects final commissioning and first production to be during November, with first shipment from the Port of Esperance 
during December 2016.
Galaxy has kept their offtake counterparty, Mitsubishi Corporation, fully informed of the anticipated delays including taking representatives 
of Mitsubishi and one of their Chinese customers to site during the week of 22 August 2016.  Notwithstanding the anticipated delay to first

shipment, customers have requested increased tonnage above the already contracted amount for 2017 and later years.  Galaxy is now 
negotiating terms with Mitsubishi and its Chinese customers for the additional tonnage now available from the expanded production.
Detailed Progress Update
Previous spodumene production from Mt Cattlin had a high mica content which resulted in much higher operational costs through higher 
transport charges and penalties. An integral part of the restart of Mt Cattlin has therefore incorporated a redesign of the mica removal 
circuit to incorporate reflux classifiers. By joining mica removal with lithium beneficiation as a single stage, the redesign focused on:
  Reduction of mica content below 5% total mass in the finished concentrate 
  Upgrading fine lithium content to above 5.5% Li2O 
  Reduction of operational costs for fines treatment by removal of flotation circuit
The reflux classifier separates particles based on density, similar to that of the  coarse circuit at  Mt Cattlin where coarse  particles are 
separated in the dense medium separation (“DMS“) circuit. Due to the size limitations of DMS, fine spodumene is historically only recovered 
through flotation, which requires:
 
 
 
 


chemicals  
specific water quality 
separate water recovery circuit 
specialised equipment 
additional operating labour 
increased filtration capacity 
fine grind size
The revised flow sheet incorporating the use of reflux classifiers as a dual-duty mica removal and lithium beneficiation circuit is expected 
to achieve considerable efficiencies. The change required the addition of a second reflux classifier to the fines circuit. This allowed for a 
closer  particle  size  range  in  each  unit,  reducing  the  loss  of  lithium  to  tails.  These  circuit  changes  will  however  require  an  extended 
commissioning duration. Further optimisation steps are planned to increase final yields and may incorporate a small flotation circuit as a 
second stage lithium concentration circuit.

Crushing ROM Material for Commissioning
Galaxy and Primero are also currently undertaking a detailed assessment of the capital costs expended to date and forecast to complete 
the construction and commissioning of Mt Cattlin until first revenue is received from Mitsubishi, now scheduled for December 2016. The 
total capital cost is now forecast to be A$22.4 million compared to the A$15million previously announced by General Mining, resulting from 
the throughput capacity upgrades together with the other plant modifications as outlined. To the extent that any cash shortfall is forecast 
after  utilization  of  existing  cash  resources,  including  the  prepayments  received  from  the  Chinese  customers,  some  directors  of  the 
Company have indicated their willingness to assist in arranging the necessary working capital from their own resources until such time as 
significant free cash flow is achieved in 2017 when operations reach full capacity. 
 
Subject to any legal requirements, holders of outstanding options including those held by director Mr Michael Fotios, resulting from the 
takeover of General Mining, have committed to exercising early during September. The amount to be received by Galaxy from the exercise 
of these options is approximately $2.4 million. 
 
Galaxy will continue to update the market as the outlined milestones are reached.

About Galaxy (ASX: GXY)
Galaxy Resources Limited (“Galaxy”) is a global lithium company with lithium production facilities, hard rock mines and brine assets in 
Australia, Canada and Argentina. It owns the Mt Cattlin spodumene and tantalum project near Ravensthorpe in Western Australia and 
the James Bay lithium pegmatite project in Quebec, Canada.
Galaxy is advancing plans to develop the Sal de Vida lithium and potash brine project in Argentina situated in the lithium triangle 
(where Chile, Argentina and Bolivia meet), which is currently the source of 60% of global lithium production. Sal de Vida has excellent 
potential as a low cost brine-based lithium carbonate production facility.  
 
Lithium compounds are used in the manufacture of ceramics, glass, and consumer electronics and are an essential cathode material 
for long life lithium-ion batteries used in hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as mass energy storage systems. Galaxy is bullish about 
the global lithium demand outlook and is aiming to become a major producer of lithium products.
