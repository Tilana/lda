<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 12/21, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene a workshop on how a better 
understanding of traditional values of humankind underpinning international human rights 
norms and standards could contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, and to present to the Council a summary of the discussions. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 16/3, the Human Rights Council welcomed the holding of the 
above-mentioned workshop on 4 October 2010 and the report of the Office of the High 
Commissioner (OHCHR) containing the summary of its discussions held at the workshop. 
The Council affirmed that dignity, freedom and responsibility are traditional values, shared 
by all humanity and embodied in universal rights instruments, recognized that the better 
understanding and appreciation of these values contribute to promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and requested the Advisory Committee to prepare 
a study on how a better understanding and appreciation of traditional values of dignity, 
freedom and responsibility could contribute to the promotion and protection of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>3. At its seventh session, the Advisory Committee adopted recommendation 7/1 by 
consensus, in which it established a drafting group consisting of the following members: 
Ahmer Bilal Soofi (Chairperson), Vladimir Kartashkin (Rapporteur), Obiora Chinedu 
Okafor, Anantonia Reyes Prado, Mona Zulficar, Dheerujlall Seetulsingh, Laurence Boisson 
de Chazournes, Shiqiu Chen, Alfred Ntunduguru Karakora and Chinsung Chung. The 
Committee also requested the drafting group to prepare the above-mentioned study and to 
submit it to the Committee for consideration at its ninth session. 
</p>
<p>4. At its eighth session, the Advisory Committee adopted recommendation 8/6 by 
consensus, in which it took note of the comments and suggestions made during the 
discussions on the preliminary study prepared by Mr. Kartashkin, and requested the 
drafting group to submit a revised preliminary study to the Committee at its ninth session 
for further consideration. At its ninth session, the Committee considered the revised 
preliminary study and requested the drafting group to finalize it in the light of the 
discussions held. In its resolution 21/3, the Human Rights Council accorded the Committee 
additional time to finalize the study, in accordance with Committee recommendation 9/4. 
</p>
<p>5. In pursuing its mandate, the drafting group is guided by, inter alia, Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 6/30, in which the Council requested the Advisory Committee to 
</p>
<p>regularly and systematically integrate a gender perspective into the implementation of its 
</p>
<p>mandate, including when examining the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women, and to include in its reports information on and qualitative analysis of 
</p>
<p>human rights of women and girls. 
</p>
<p>6. The Advisory Committee is mindful that discussions on the relationship between 
</p>
<p>traditional values and human rights have revealed divided views, demonstrating the need to 
</p>
<p>reflect on both the negative and the positive impact that traditional values may have on the 
</p>
<p>effective implementation of human rights. Assessing how a &#8220;better understanding&#8221; of these 
</p>
<p>values can contribute to human rights, as mentioned by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 16/3, involves analysis of existing United Nations and other human rights-
</p>
<p>focused publications from all perspectives, including consideration of the role traditional 
</p>
<p>values may play in promoting respect for human rights, as well as the ways in which 
</p>
<p>legitimate concerns may best be addressed.  </p>


<p><b> II. Concepts 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Traditional values of humankind  
</b></p>
<p>7. There is no agreed definition of the term &#8220;traditional values of humankind&#8221;. No such 
definition resulted from the discussions held by the Human Rights Council or the Advisory 
Committee. To the extent that humankind in its entirety can be said to share a common set 
of values, such values are those which &#8220;have made an important contribution to the 
</p>
<p>development of international human rights norms and standards&#8221;.1 As noted in the report on 
the OHCHR workshop on traditional values, such values were inscribed in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights that, having incorporated diverse, cultural and political 
traditions and perspectives, &#8220;represents a common standard of achievement for all peoples 
</p>
<p>and all nations&#8221;.2 
</p>
<p>8. The term &#8220;traditional values&#8221; has been used in regional human rights instruments; 
for example, the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights specifies in its article 17.3 
that &#8220;the promotion and protection of morals and traditional values recognized by the 
</p>
<p>community shall be the duty of the State&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9. According to the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, the core values that human rights protect and promote, including dignity, 
equality and the notion of rights itself, have been articulated in an array of literatures, 
religions and cultural practices of people all around the world, and became formalized into 
international law through consensus decisions of representatives of States Members of the 
United Nations in multilateral negotiations and advocacy of civil society groups.3 
</p>
<p>10. Human rights have moral universality, since human rights are held universally by all 
persons &#8220;simply because one is a human being&#8221;, and international normative universality, 
</p>
<p>meaning that human rights are universally accepted by Governments through their 
commitments and obligations under international human rights law.4 
</p>
<p>11. Nevertheless, traditions are so varied and complex that, while some traditions 
comply with human rights norms and contribute to their promotion and protection, others 
undermine or are in conflict with them. As seven special procedures mandate holders 
underlined in a joint statement, issues of culture and tradition must be addressed within a 
human rights framework: 
</p>
<p>Cultural diversity&#8230; can only thrive in an environment that safeguards fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms and human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interconnected and 
interdependent. No one may invoke cultural diversity as an excuse to infringe on 
human rights guaranteed by international law or limit their scope, nor should cultural 
diversity be taken to support segregation and harmful traditional practices which, in 
the name of culture, seek to sanctify differences that run counter to the universality, 
indivisibility and interdependence of human rights.5

</p>
<p>United Nations experts on the World Day on Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, 21 
May 2010.  </p>


<p>12. In paragraph 38 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World 
Conference on Human Rights stressed the importance of working towards the elimination 
of the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices, cultural prejudices and 
religious extremism, and emphasized that, &#8220;while the significance of national and regional 
particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in 
mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8221;6 The preamble to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women affirms that 
&#8220;a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the 
</p>
<p>family is needed to achieve full equality between men and women.&#8221; The Human Rights 
Council, in its resolution 16/3, in which it mandated the present study, similarly stressed 
that traditions should not be invoked to justify harmful practices violating universal human 
rights norms and standards. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Dignity 
</b></p>
<p>13. Since ancient times, the definition of dignity has been a concern in many cultures, 
and has developed in several historical phases. For example, during the Renaissance, it was 
formulated to encompass three ideals: the right to dissent; respect for cultural and religious 
diversity; and the right to growth and enrichment of life.7 Although there has always been a 
connection between the notion of dignity and the legal comprehension of human rights,8 the 
concept has been further developed in modern times. In human rights law, dignity is an 
inherent aspect of being human. It is directly linked with the concept of equality and of 
each human being as worthy of respect.  
</p>
<p>14. Dignity is first mentioned at the beginning of the Charter of the United Nations: 
&#8220;We the peoples of the United Nations determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human 
rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women 
and of nations large and small&#8230;&#8221; The preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights states, &#8220;Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable 
rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace 
in the world.&#8221; Article 1 of the Universal Declaration provides that &#8220;all human beings are 
born free and equal in dignity and rights.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>15. Subsequent instruments, including the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, refer to these 
statements. The preambles to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights state that &#8220;these 
rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person&#8221;. In these uses of the word

<i>Metaphilosophy</i>, vol. 41, No. 4, July 2010, pp. 464-480.  </p>


<p>&#8220;dignity&#8221;, the concept is connected with equality and the idea that human dignity, which 
belongs to everyone equally, is the source of all rights.9  
</p>
<p>16. Dignity is not just a ground of rights, but also an aspect of the content of certain 
rights. Dignity appears in specific articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
such as articles 22 and 23, where it is connected with economic rights, including the right to 
social security and just remuneration. It is associated with conditions of detention in article 
10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;all 
persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the 
inherent dignity of the human person.&#8221;10 In the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, dignity is linked to autonomy.11 United Nations treaty bodies regularly refer to 
dignity in connection with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment,12 discrimination,13 conditions of detention14 and the right to an 
adequate standard of living.15  
</p>
<p>17. Dignity also appears in many regional instruments. For instance, the Charter of the 
Organization of African Unity (now the African Union) states that &#8220;freedom, equality, 
justice and dignity are essential objectives for the achievement of the legitimate aspirations 
of the African peoples.&#8221; Article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
connects respect for dignity with the prohibitions of slavery, torture and cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. A similar link is established in articles 5 (torture) and 7 
(forced labour) of the American Convention on Human Rights. According to the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights, the concept of equality is &#8220;inseparable from the essential 
dignity of the person&#8221;.16 
</p>
<p>18. Dignity is a fundamental principle in national constitutions and jurisprudence in 
diverse regions, including Canada, India, Poland, South Africa and Uganda. Courts in 
Canada and South Africa in particular link dignity with the idea of equality.17 For example,

South Africa); and <i>Minister of Home Affairs v. Fourie</i>, 2006 (Constitutional Court of South Africa). </p>


<p>the Constitutional Court of South Africa confirmed that &#8220;the protection of diversity is the 
hallmark of a free and open society. It is the recognition of the inherent dignity of all 
human beings. Freedom is an indispensable ingredient of human dignity.&#8221;18 In Uganda, the 
Constitution provides that &#8220;laws, cultures, customs or traditions which are against the 
dignity, welfare or interest of women or which undermine their status are prohibited by this 
Constitution.&#8221; In India, dignity is associated with the right to an adequate standard of 
living.19  
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom 
</b></p>
<p>19. Human rights instruments typically refer to the &#8220;rights and freedoms&#8221; that they 
guarantee.20 International law guarantees &#8220;rights&#8221; &#8211; such as the right to liberty and security 
of the person or the right to life &#8211; and also guarantees &#8220;freedoms&#8221;, which essentially means 
the right to do something (for example, movement) or have something (for example, belief) 
free from State interference. Freedom as referred to in international human rights 
instruments denotes both the state or quality of being free and the absence of State 
interference in the exercise of rights.  
</p>
<p>20. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all human 
beings are born &#8220;free and equal&#8221; in dignity and rights. In this sense, freedom is the original 
condition. It is the property of all human beings from birth, endowed with dignity and 
rights.21 
</p>
<p>21. Freedom may also refer to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of free human beings 
enjoying &#8220;freedom from fear and want&#8221; can be achieved only if conditions are created 
whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his 
or her civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>22. More broadly, freedom means that the exercise of these rights is not subject to 
unjustifiable restrictions or limitations imposed by the State.22 It denotes the absence of 
coercion or interference; it is thus possible to speak of &#8220;freedom of movement&#8221;, &#8220;freedom 
of thought, conscience and religion&#8221;, &#8220;freedom of opinion and expression&#8221; and &#8220;freedom of 
peaceful assembly and association&#8221;.23 Freedom of opinion means that any &#8220;form of effort to 
coerce the holding or not holding of any opinion is prohibited&#8221;.24 In general, rights can be 
characterized as &#8220;freedoms&#8221; when they impose on States the obligation both to refrain from 
interference and to take some positive action, such as ensuring the necessary preconditions 
for the exercise of that right.25

 20  See the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 2, and the preamble to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. See also the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p> 21 Consistent with this understanding, the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the 
Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, states in its preamble that &#8220;freedom is 
the birthright of every human being&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 22 See the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, arts. 1, 2, 4, 13, 16 (2), 18, 19, 20(1), 21(1), 23(1) 
and 27(1); the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 1, 12, 18, 19 and 22; and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, arts. 1 and 6. 
</p>

 24 Ibid., para. 10. 
 25 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 21, para. 6.  </p>


<p>23. Although some rights and freedoms, such as the prohibition on torture, are absolute, 
others may, in certain circumstances, be restricted. For those that may be restricted by State 
action, as explained by the treaty bodies, the essence of the right must be preserved. 
Restrictions may not &#8220;put in jeopardy the right itself&#8221;.26 The right is the norm and the 
restriction is the exception. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
emphasized that &#8220;the Covenant&#8217;s limitation clause, article 4, is primarily intended to protect 
the rights of individuals rather than to permit the imposition of limitations by States&#8221;.27 
Furthermore, restrictions may never violate other rights guaranteed under international law, 
including the right to equality and non-discrimination, on any grounds. 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to freedom of movement, the Human Rights Committee stated, in its 
general comment No. 27, paragraph 14, that restrictive measures must conform to the 
principle of proportionality; they must be appropriate to achieve their protective function; 
they must be the least intrusive instrument among those which might achieve the desired 
result; and they must be proportionate to the interest to be protected.  
</p>
<p>25. Freedom is therefore closely linked with both dignity and equality; it is an essential 
quality to the pursuit by each individual of his or her aspirations and self-fulfilment, in 
dignity and rights, free from unjustifiable interference by the State or by other actors. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>26. According to the norms of international law, the notion of responsibility refers 
primarily to the State. The State is responsible for the promotion, protection and fulfilment 
of all human rights for all persons. For example, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action emphasizes &#8220;the responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter of the 
United Nations, to develop and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for all&#8221;. The Committee on the Rights of the Child described the responsibility of 
the State party as &#8220;the primary duty-bearer for the realization of the rights guaranteed under 
the Convention&#8221;.28 While the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms recognizes the right and the responsibility of 
individuals, groups and associations to promote respect for and foster knowledge of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels, it stresses that &#8220;the 
prime responsibility and duty to promote and protect human rights and fundamental 
freedoms lie with the State.&#8221;29 
</p>
<p>27. In general, the responsibility to guarantee human rights imposes three levels of 
obligations: to respect, to protect and to fulfil rights.30 States bear the responsibility to 
ensure that private actors do not impair rights. The Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women noted that, under general international law and specific 
human rights covenants, States may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act 
with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of 
violence, and for providing compensation.31 In the case of <i>A.T. v. Hungary</i>, the Committee 
found that Hungary had violated the rights of a woman who had been subject to repeated

afford her sufficient protection from domestic violence at the hands of a private actor.32 
</p>
<p>28. Similarly, the Committee against Torture, in its general comment No. 2, clarified 
that the Convention imposed obligations on States parties, not on individuals. States bore 
international responsibility for the acts and omissions of their officials and others, including 
agents, private contractors and other persons acting in an official capacity or on behalf of 
the State, in conjunction with the State, under its direction or control, or otherwise under 
colour of law. The Committee added that it had made clear that, where State authorities or 
others acting in an official capacity or under colour of law knew or had reasonable grounds 
to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment were being committed by non-State officials 
or private actors and they failed to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute 
and punish such non-State officials or private actors in accordance with the Convention, the 
State bore responsibility and its officials should be regarded as authors, complicit or 
otherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such 
impermissible acts.33 
</p>
<p>29. In certain circumstances, non-State actors may also have responsibilities in 
international human rights law, particularly when they are acting in the place of the State or 
fulfilling the functions of the State. 34  In his commentary to the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises  35 
affirmed that the responsibility to respect human rights is a global standard of expected 
conduct for all business enterprises, wherever they operate. It exists independently of 
States&#8217; abilities and/or willingness to fulfil their own human rights obligations, and does not 
diminish those obligations. Furthermore, it exists over and above compliance with national 
laws and regulations protecting human rights.36 The Special Representative added that the 
responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises: 
</p>
<p>(a) Avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their 
own activities, and address such impacts when they occur; 
</p>
<p>(b) Seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly 
linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they 
have not contributed to those impacts.37 
</p>
<p>30. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights also refers to individuals&#8217; 
duties, which go beyond the conventional notion that duties may be correlative to rights.38 
Asian Confucian tradition emphasizes the responsibility of individuals, families and 
communities in caring for others, which is consistent with the notions of respect and 
solidarity in the culture of certain indigenous peoples. Similarly, the preambles to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognize that the individual is &#8220;under a

<p>responsibility to strive for the promotion and observance of the rights recognized in the 
present Covenant&#8221;. Thus, although it should be emphasized that human rights are 
inalienable and inherent in the human person, and are not conditional upon &#8220;responsible 
</p>
<p>behaviour&#8221;, individuals may be regarded as having a responsibility to promote respect for 
human rights, and not to cause human rights violations against other individuals. 
</p>
<p>31. In 2005, the Economic and Social Council voted against a proposal to develop a text 
on &#8220;human responsibilities&#8221; owing to concerns that this could undermine the principle of 
universality. For example, in a report addressing the issue of honour crimes, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, noted that, in 
patriarchal and patrilineal societies, maintaining the honour of the family is a woman&#8217;s 
responsibility, and explained that this contributed to the concept of women as commodities, 
expected to be obedient and passive, and not as human beings endowed with dignity and 
rights equal to those of men. 39  There is no need for new standards on individual 
responsibility, as international human rights law already reflects the fact that some &#8211; though 
not all &#8211; rights may be subject to limitations that are provided for by law and necessary for 
certain permissible purposes, such as protecting the rights of others.40  
</p>
<p><b> III. Relationship between traditional values and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>32. The relationship between traditional values and human rights is complex; diverse 
traditional values are at the root of universal human rights, although some traditional values 
have contributed to justifications for the subordination of women and minority groups in 
both Western and non-western countries. The international community has made efforts to 
respect traditional values and, at the same time, to abolish, correct or adjust traditional 
values and practices that have a harmful impact on human rights. Traditional values have 
been applied to support efforts to implement and reinforce human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The roots of universal human rights in diverse traditional and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>contexts 
</b></p>
<p>33. As was noted by many States during the adoption of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the values underpinning the Declaration reflected diverse cultures and 
societies. For example, Ecuador stated that the &#8220;multiplicity of origin of human rights could 
be detected in reading the articles of the Declaration&#8221;. Pakistan affirmed its full support for 
article 19, quoting from the Koran, stating that Islam &#8220;had unequivocally proclaimed the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of conscience and had declared itself against any kind of compulsion in 
matters of faith or religious practices&#8221;. China stressed that Chinese thought had influenced 
</p>
<p>the evolution of ideas of the rights of man in the Western world. Brazil stated that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>Declaration did not reflect the particular point of view of any one people or of any one 
group of peoples, neither was it the expression of any particular political doctrine or 
philosophical system. It was the result of the intellectual and moral cooperation of a large 
number of nations; that explained its values and interest and also conferred upon it great 
moral authority&#8221;.41

<p> 41 See A/PV.180, 181, 182 and 183. According to the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), the &#8220;common set of values&#8221; of humankind are those inscribed in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, which, having incorporated diverse cultural and political traditions and perspectives 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>34. It was also clear that the Declaration was meant to be forward-looking, in part 
advancing rights that had not previously been protected. As the delegate of India noted, 
&#8220;earlier declarations had not mentioned rights such as the right to equal pay for equal work; 
the right of mothers and children to social protection, whether the children were born in or 
out of wedlock; the right to education; equality of rights for men and women. Those rights 
were the expression of a new social order, of true democracy based on social justice.&#8221;42 
</p>
<p>35. Scholars have noted examples of traditional values reflected in international human 
rights law,43 such as the concept of equality among the Akaamba of Kenya,44 the high value 
placed on human dignity by the Akan of Ghana,45 and the commitments to due process 
among the Amhara of Ethiopia and Kuba in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.46 In 
addition, the indigenous Andean concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i> bases the notion of well-being 
not in the isolated individual but in the relationship between the individual, the community 
and nature. 47  <i>Ahimsa</i>, a tenet of some Indian religions such as Hinduism, Jainism and 
Buddhism, is a term meaning non-violence. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi successfully 
promoted the principle of <i>ahimsa</i> by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to 
politics.48 His non-violent resistance movement had an immense impact in India, impressed 
public opinion in Western countries and influenced the leaders of various civil and political 
rights movements, including Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. 49  Sikhism 
emphasizes the principle of equality of all humans and rejects discrimination on the basis of 
caste, creed and gender.50  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has researched 
customary laws and the administration of justice among indigenous societies around the 
world. In a report submitted to the Commission on Human Rights in 2004, the Special 
Rapporteur wrote that indigenous customary law was rooted in local traditions and customs 
and usually answered the needs of indigenous communities regarding the maintenance of 
social order and harmony, the solution of conflicts of various kinds and the process of 
dealing with offenders. He added that countries that had been able to incorporate respect for 
customary indigenous law in their formal legal systems found that justice was handled more 
effectively, particularly when dealing with civil and family law, but also in certain areas of

<p>criminal law, so that a kind of legal pluralism appeared to be a constructive way of dealing 
with diverse legal systems based on different cultural values.51 
</p>
<p>37. According to the American Anthropological Association, &#8220;people and groups have a 
generic right to realize their capacity for culture &#8230; so long as such activities do not 
</p>
<p>diminish the same capacities of others.&#8221; As such, they affirm the importance of human 
</p>
<p>diversity. In its Declaration on Anthropology and Human Rights, the Association also noted 
that it had &#8220;long been, and should continue to be, concerned whenever human difference is 
made the basis for a denial of basic human rights&#8221;.52  
</p>
<p>38. Explaining international human rights principles in ways that resonate in diverse 
cultures and traditions may assist in promoting respect for human rights. For example, 
during a panel discussion at the Human Rights Council on the theme &#8220;discriminatory laws 
and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and 
gender identity&#8221;,53 the Ambassador of South Africa, as moderator of the panel, invoked the 
doctrine of <i>Ubuntu</i>: 
</p>
<p>What Ubuntu essentially says is, &#8220;I am because you are&#8221;. And in that, it conveys that 
we are all linked in our common humanity, and therefore we have a responsibility to 
protect each other according to the basic principles that in fact underlie our concepts 
of human rights.54 
</p>
<p><b> B. The negative impact of traditional values on vulnerable groups  
</b></p>
<p>39. Special procedures mandate holders, treaty bodies and OHCHR have published 
many works that emphasize the importance of ensuring that &#8220;traditions&#8221;, &#8220;attitudes&#8221; and 
&#8220;customary practices&#8221; are not elevated above universal human rights standards. 55 They 
highlighted the fact that such terms are often used to justify the marginalization of minority 
groups and gender-based inequalities, discrimination and violence, and that there is a need 
to situate these terms within a human rights context. 
</p>
<p>40. In the report of the OHCHR workshop on the traditional values of humankind, 
attention was drawn to the fact that perceptions of what constituted &#8220;traditional values&#8221; 
were highly subjective and dependent on societal power structures. It was noted that some 
practices and attitudes at odds with human dignity were derived from traditional values. 
Tradition is often invoked to justify maintaining the status quo, failing to take into account 
the reality that traditions, cultures and social norms have always evolved and will continue 
to change with time; a human rights-based approach, by contrast, often requires changes to 
the status quo in order to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. 
Those who benefit most from the status quo are more likely to appeal to tradition to 
maintain power and privilege, and also to speak on behalf of tradition, while those most 
marginalized and disenfranchised have the most to lose from a traditional values approach 
to human rights. In its general recommendation No. 19, the Committee on the Elimination

Children&#8221;, Human Rights Fact Sheet No. 23, 1995. </p>


<p>of Discrimination against Women stated that traditional attitudes by which women are 
regarded as subordinate to men or as having stereotyped roles perpetuate widespread 
practices involving violence or coercion, such as family violence and abuse, forced 
marriage, dowry deaths, acid attacks and female circumcision. Such prejudices and 
practices may thus justify gender-based violence as a form of subordination or control of 
women. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
noted that cultural relativism is often an excuse to allow for inhumane and discriminatory 
practices against women in the community, and that, &#8220;in the next century, the problem 
posed by cultural relativism, and the implications for women&#8217;s rights, will be one of the 
most important issues in the field of international human rights.&#8221;56 The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women has consistently expressed concern about the 
persistence of practices, traditions, patriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes that 
perpetuate discrimination against women, and continues to express concern at States&#8217; 
failure to take effective and systematic action to modify or eliminate stereotypes and 
negative traditional values and practices.57 Similar analysis is reflected in paragraph 119 of 
the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.58 In the context of the right to take part in 
cultural life, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasized the 
responsibility of States &#8220;to combat practices harmful to the well-being of a person or group 
of persons&#8221;, including female genital mutilation and allegations of witchcraft.59 
</p>
<p>42. It is important to note that those who challenge the social constructions of gender on 
the basis of values said to be traditional, cultural or religious are particularly exposed to the 
risk of violence and abuse of human rights. In a report on human rights defenders working 
on gender-related issues, the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders noted that 
women defenders were more at risk of suffering certain forms of violence and other 
violations, prejudice, exclusion and repudiation than their male counterparts, owing to the 
fact that women defenders were perceived as challenging accepted socio-cultural norms, 
traditions, perceptions and stereotypes about femininity, sexual orientation and the role and 
status of women in society.60 The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights stressed 
that cultural rights include the right not to participate in specific traditions, customs and 
practices, particularly those that infringe on human rights and dignity, and to revise and 
(re)negotiate existing traditions, values or practices, regardless of their provenance.61  
</p>
<p>43. Such violations justified by traditional, cultural or religious values are often targeted 
against minority or disenfranchised groups that are not in a position to shape the dominant 
discourse defining the values of the overarching society or community. In a report to the 
Human Rights Council in 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
observed that the master-slave relationships persisting in one country reflected the 
structural inequities that result from deeply engrained discriminatory attitudes about 
indigenous peoples. These attitudes appeared to have been internalized by both indigenous

<p>and non-indigenous segments of society to a significant extent, leading to acquiescence to 
these destructive power dynamics between the stronger and weaker elements of society.62 
</p>
<p>44. The negative impact of traditional practices arises not only in non-Western countries. 
The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, warned 
against mystifying and reducing non-Western culture to its symbolic, ritualized or 
supposedly &#8220;traditional&#8221; manifestations.63 
</p>
<p><b> C. Application of traditional values in the implementation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>45. Strategies to promote human rights and eliminate harmful practices can be more 
effective if they use the positive elements of traditional values as a basis for their 
arguments. Certain East Asian traditions, for example, may be effective in enhancing 
respect for human rights at the regional level. If the ultimate aim of human rights 
diplomacy is to persuade others of the value of human rights, then this is an argument more 
likely to be won if it builds on, rather than challenges, local cultural traditions. Building 
human rights practices on traditional values is more likely to lead to long-term commitment 
to human rights ideas and practices through the building of ownership of those norms.64  
</p>
<p>46. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women acknowledged that 
such an approach revalidates and harnesses the positive elements of local culture, stating 
that successfully upholding universal values requires systematic engagement in a &#8220;cultural 
negotiation&#8221; whereby positive cultural elements are emphasized and oppressive elements in 
culture-based discourses are demystified. Contrary to what some may claim or fear, such an 
engagement with culture did not erode or deform local culture, but rather challenged its 
discriminatory or oppressive aspects. She added that negotiating culture with human rights 
concerns contributed to harnessing the positive elements of local culture to advance human 
rights and gender equality, a process that also revalidated culture itself.65 
</p>
<p>47. While noting that, as cultural relativist discourses strengthen, &#8220;we need unashamedly 
to invoke universal human rights and defend the principles for which women around the 
world have struggled with more pride, not less&#8221;, 66  the Special Rapporteur provided a 
number of examples in which women&#8217;s rights activists had successfully mobilized artistic 
and symbolic expressions of culture, including local women&#8217;s movements in the north of 
</p>
<p>Mexico incorporating human rights language with symbolic actions to counter a culture of 
impunity and violence against women; women in France dressing as &#8220;Marianne&#8221;, the iconic 
</p>
<p>symbol of French liberation, to draw attention to gender violence; and a meeting in Cairo of 
a group of Islamic scholars, who issued a set of recommendations recognizing female 
genital mutilation as a &#8220;deplorable inherited custom&#8221; incompatible with their understanding 
</p>
<p>of Islamic teachings.67 
</p>
<p>48. Human rights and traditional values may interface in various ways. The international 
instruments that protect human rights and the conventions and recommendations of the 
International Labour Organization have promoted social dialogue as a means to strengthen 
human dignity and the freedom of workers. In this way, traditional values may be vehicles 
for promoting and implementing human rights.

<p>49. Many States have taken positive steps to adopt laws based on traditional and 
religious values in order to introduce changes in conformity with international human rights 
standards. In Egypt, the women&#8217;s movement succeeded in having a law passed in 2000 
giving women the right to unilaterally terminate their marriage contracts by repudiation, 
based on the right to <i>khul</i>, a sharia law concept, thus achieving equality with men, who held 
the right to unilaterally terminate marriage contracts by divorce. The law, which respects 
women&#8217;s dignity, has been subject to extensive judicial and constitutional challenges, and 
recently to parliamentary attempts to drop it. Nevertheless, it has remained in force and is 
helping to promote equality primarily because it is based on the traditional values admitted 
by sharia law.68 
</p>
<p>50. Even though the &#8220;traditional&#8221; mindset is still one of the key obstacles to combat 
discrimination against Dalits,69 the Governments of India, Nepal and Sri Lanka have taken 
several steps to prohibit the practice of untouchability; for example, the Constitution of 
India has special provisions that are directed at the practice of caste discrimination, and the 
Government has passed several laws, including the Protection of Civil Rights (Anti-
Untouchability) Act.70 
</p>
<p>51. The above positive examples of using local culture and tradition to promote respect 
for human rights and to eliminate harmful practices and prejudice illustrate the role that 
traditional values supporting and underpinning international standards may play in the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Promotion and protection of human rights through 
traditional values 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Role of human rights education through traditional values 
</b></p>
<p>52. Treaty bodies have repeatedly emphasized the importance of human rights education 
as a means to implement human rights. In its general comment No. 3, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that educational measures were among the 
steps that States should take to meet their obligation to implement the rights in the 
Covenant. Similarly, the Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 28, stated 
that measures by States to achieve equal rights between men and women must include 
public education.  
</p>
<p>53. In resolution 49/184, in which the General Assembly proclaimed the United Nations 
Decade for Human Rights Education, the Assembly noted that education for human rights 
and democracy was itself a human right and a prerequisite for the realization of human 
rights, democracy and social justice. Furthermore, in the United Nations Declaration on 
Human Rights Education and Training, the Assembly declared that everyone has the right 
to know, seek and receive information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
and should have access to human rights education and training.71  
</p>
<p>54. Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that goals of 
education include respect for human rights, peace, tolerance and equality, as well as respect

<p>for the national values of the country in which the child lives. In its general comment No. 1, 
the Committee underlined the need to view rights within their broader ethical, moral, 
spiritual, cultural or social framework and the fact that most children&#8217;s rights, far from 
being externally imposed, are embedded within the values of local communities. 
</p>
<p>55. In its general comment No. 1, the Committee on the Rights of the Child also pointed 
out that education should familiarize the child with the values of human rights, and that this 
is a life-long process, starting with reflection on human rights in daily life and within the 
child&#8217;s own experience. The responsibility to relate human rights to personal experience is 
also reflected in the Committee&#8217;s recommendation that States should develop creative 
methods, in particular at the local level, when promoting awareness of human rights.72  
</p>
<p>56. Within the context of the obligation placed on States, the concept of &#8220;traditional 
values&#8221; could have a role to play. In article 5, paragraph 3, of the United Nations 
Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training, the General Assembly stated that 
human rights education and training should embrace and enrich, as well as draw inspiration 
from, the diversity of civilizations, religions, cultures and traditions of different countries, 
as it is reflected in the universality of human rights. In a statement made on the 
International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, the Executive Director of the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) noted that his organization&#8217;s work on culture was based 
on principles, inter alia, that &#8220;human rights can be recognized and internalized through a 
culturally sensitive approach that gives social basis and support to the legal approach and 
that builds on positive cultural values and religious interpretations that strengthen human 
rights principles.&#8221; 73  The World Plan of Action on Education for Human Rights and 
Democracy also states that &#8220;a key challenge for the future is to enhance the universality of 
human rights by rooting these rights in different cultural traditions.&#8221; 74  Thus, a better 
appreciation of diverse cultural and traditional contexts can enhance understanding of the 
international human rights framework; where traditional or cultural values are inconsistent 
with international human rights law, however, human rights education can assist States in 
fulfilling their responsibility to modify or eliminate harmful prejudices or stereotypes.75

<p><b> B. Social institutions and the transmission of values 
</b></p>
<p>57. In its resolution 16/3, the Human Rights Council noted the important role of family, 
community, society and educational institutions in upholding and transmitting traditional 
values, which contributes to promoting respect for human rights and increasing their 
acceptance at the grass roots.  
</p>
<p>58. It must be emphasized that families themselves are diverse and that, as the General 
Assembly noted in its resolution 59/147, &#8220;in different cultural, political and social systems, 
various forms of the family exist.&#8221;76 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also 
noted that, within the Convention, the &#8220;family&#8221; refers to a variety of arrangements that can 
provide for young children&#8217;s care, nurturance and development, including the nuclear

<p>family, the extended family, and other traditional and modern community-based 
arrangements, provided these are consistent with children&#8217;s rights and best interests.77 
</p>
<p>59. The institutions that form the context within which an individual lives his or her life 
socialize a person and mould his or her values. At the same time, it has been noted that 
these institutions can transmit positive values consistent with international human rights, 
but may also be sites for the transmission of negative values that undermine human rights.78 
</p>
<p>60. Young children are particularly susceptible to absorbing values from their families, 
communities and educational institutions. In a statement on the occasion of the World Day 
on Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, seven special procedures mandate 
holders declared that: 
</p>
<p>States should adopt measures conducive to the creation and preservation of open 
spaces necessary for the exercise of cultural freedoms and for enabling individuals 
and groups to address and manage cultural changes in a participatory way and to 
safeguard, develop and transmit their cultural heritage. In this regard, educational 
institutions play a vital role since they can either inculcate a spirit of tolerance or 
promote tensions, even at an early age. Therefore, emphasis must be placed on 
enlightened education that teaches children to recognize and to appreciate the 
diversity that exists. 
</p>
<p>61. In its general recommendation No. 19, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women observed that family violence was one of the most insidious 
forms of violence against women, and that it was prevalent in all societies. &#8220;Within family 
relationships, women of all ages are subjected to violence of all kinds, which are 
perpetuated by traditional attitudes.&#8221;79 
</p>
<p>62. In certain country visits, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, found that sociocultural constraints linked to family structure, 
religion and tradition acted as an important deterrent for women to report violence, 
especially when it occurred in the home, and that domestic violence was often accepted as a 
normal part of family life, mainly because of entrenched perceptions of the preservation of 
family honour, the social and economic subordination of women to their husbands and male 
relatives, and the fear of becoming outcasts from the family and community if the violence 
was reported.80 
</p>
<p>63. It is therefore particularly important that States take steps to ensure that the values 
instilled by core social institutions are consistent with human rights. The power of these 
institutions, and the role that they play in shaping values, is recognized in the Beijing 
Declaration and Platform for Action, where it states, in paragraph 120, that:  
</p>
<p>Developing a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to the challenging task of 
promoting families, communities and States that are free of violence against women 
is necessary and achievable. Equality, partnership between women and men and 
respect for human dignity must permeate all stages of the socialization process. 
Educational systems should promote self-respect, mutual respect and cooperation 
between women and men.  
</p>
<p>  
 77 General comment No. 7, para. 15. 
 78 See for example A/HRC/19/41, paras. 66-67. 
 79 See also <i>Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 38</i>

 80 A/HRC/17/26/Add.3, para. 64. </p>


<p>64. States have the responsibility not only to take proactive measures to educate 
individuals about human rights but also to ensure that those institutions that frame every 
individual&#8217;s outlook transmit values that are consistent with international human rights 
standards. Thus, while the Committee on the Rights of the Child recognized that the 
primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child lies with the parents 
or with legal guardians, it also emphasized the ultimate responsibility of States to ensure 
that the rights of the child are protected by taking all appropriate legislative, administrative, 
social and educational measures to protect the child from violence, abuse (including sexual 
abuse), neglect, maltreatment and exploitation while in the care of parents or legal 
guardians. As noted by the the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, States should develop and put into practice educational programmes to promote 
human rights, to &#8220;intensify cooperation &#8230; with civil society organizations, women&#8217;s groups 
and community leaders, traditional and religious leaders, as well as teachers and the 
media.&#8221;81 
</p>
<p><b> C. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>65. In order to achieve universal observance of human rights, it is particularly important 
that awareness and ownership of human rights are promoted in all their dimensions. The 
history of human rights itself shows that these are the result of the growing awareness of 
human dignity. For example, feminist criticism made a significant contribution to a greater 
understanding of human rights. The promotion of human rights requires a holistic view, 
with the resources offered by new technologies and the mechanisms of education in a way 
that promotes participatory and democratic learning. The methods should be consistent with 
the content of human rights. There are various examples from around the world of States 
and other bodies developing human rights education programmes that acknowledge the role 
that social institutions play in transmitting values, and that strive to ensure that the values 
transmitted are those that promote and protect human rights, thereby contributing to the 
implementation of human rights standards on the ground.  
</p>
<p>66. In Indonesia, the National Working Group for Human Rights Dissemination and 
Promotion was assigned the task of creating a national framework for the domestic 
promotion of the international human rights system. Recognizing the important role played 
by key opinion leaders in the community in transmitting values, the Working Group 
worked closely with these actors to identify universal values familiar in Indonesian cultural 
and religious traditions that could be used as a basis for introducing and promoting 
international human rights standards in a way that connected to the experiences and 
understanding of the local population.82  
</p>
<p>67. By engaging such stakeholders in the process, the Working Group was rewarded 
with their support; as a result, the stakeholders were trained under the programme to use the 
curricula that were developed. The aim is for the population to attain a better understanding 
of human rights concepts through both the use of traditional values with which they are 
already familiar and the promotion of human rights on the basis of such values by multiple 
significant actors within their communities. The programme takes seriously the importance 
of families, societies, communities and educational institutions in transmitting values, and 
directs its energies towards ensuring that the values transmitted will promote and protect 
human rights.

<p>68. The programme was significant because of its engagement with Muslim religious 
leaders, some of whom believed that human rights did not need to be taught specifically, 
given the alignment that they saw between human rights and the values found within Islam. 
While there are indeed common values, framing those values in the language of human 
rights ensures universal protection for all individuals.  
</p>
<p>69. In Cambodia, the Human Rights Teaching Methodology Programme, launched by 
the Cambodian Institute of Human Rights and the Cambodian Ministry of Education, 
Youth and Sports, uses values identified with Buddhism as tools for explaining 
international human rights standards.83 The Programme is being implemented in educational 
institutions, specifically primary and secondary schools.84 The Institute set out to train all of 
the country&#8217;s more than 70,000 primary and secondary school teachers in teaching human 
rights according to the methodology. 85  In this way, the Programme aims to create a 
community of human rights educators. By focusing on school children, the Institute also 
hopes that the human rights message will be transmitted to families and the community at 
large. The Programme recognizes that schools are central to the development of society, 
and that by developing the potential of learners, schools empower individuals for life in 
society.86  
</p>
<p>70. Educational programmes that promote and protect human rights should be 
developed. The programmes would give children the confidence to claim their own rights, 
but also the skills and means to promote and protect the rights of others. OHCHR has 
developed guidelines for teaching children that take into account the emphasis of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child that such education should be centred on the child&#8217;s 
experience, by connecting human rights to values that the child is able to understand.87 The 
guidelines suggest that the foundation for teaching human rights should be an examination 
of the values of life, freedom, justice and equality, and of the destructive nature of 
deprivation, suffering and pain. Through the discussion of such universal values, the idea of 
human rights can be gradually introduced to pupils in a way that bases those rights upon 
these universally understood values. Where relevant, the values can be mediated through 
local culture and tradition in order to provide local illustration and ownership of the 
universal values of human rights. This can help each and every person to identify himself or 
herself as someone who bears those values, and to be motivated to defend and promote 
them.

<p>respect for international standards within informal and traditional justice systems by 
situating human rights learning within a local context.88 
</p>
<p>72. When developing programmes that introduce the concept of human rights by means 
of familiar traditional values, it is important that those values serve the goal of promoting 
and protecting human rights. As illustrated above, traditional values can be misapplied to 
justify discrimination or subjugation of minority or marginalized groups. Care must be 
taken to ensure that international human rights standards remain paramount when 
developing a programme of human rights education. The use of traditional values that may 
be more familiar to individuals and communities should be a tool for introducing and 
promoting the acceptability and implementation of international human rights standards; 
those traditional values must never, however, be presented as a substitute for international 
standards, given the generally subjective and unclear framing of values when compared 
with human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Realizing the rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international instruments has 
</b></p>
<p><b>been a challenging and continuing process in which States from diverse cultural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious backgrounds have to cooperate at a universal level. There is a growing 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding and reflection of universal human rights standards in the policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities of regional organizations, which have adopted universal mechanisms for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights. Such organizations have established not only commissions 
</b></p>
<p><b>but also courts, thus making it possible to consider reports from State parties as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as individual complaints, while still taking the distinctive features of their countries</b>&#8217;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultures, religions and traditions into account.  
</b></p>
<p>74. Increasing people&#8217;s <b>awareness, acceptance and implementation of universal 
human rights norms and standards at the grass-roots level has been a particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficult process; a better understanding and the promotion of positive traditional 
</b></p>
<p><b>values underpinning such universal norms and standards could have a useful role to 
</b></p>
<p><b>play in it. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The international community has reached consensus that each and every 
person is entitled to all the rights and freedoms recognized in the Universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration of Human Rights. Under international law, all States, regardless of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>political, economic and cultural systems, have the responsibility to promote and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Dignity is inherent to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human person, and is inextricably related to equality and non-discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>Freedom is the sphere of the individual&#8217;s actions, beliefs and opinions<b>, free from State 
</b></p>
<p><b>interference. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>States, and in some cases non-State actors, have a responsibility to take 
sustained and systematic action to modify or eliminate stereotypes and negative, 
</b></p>
<p><b>harmful and discriminatory practices justified by traditional values, and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to identify progress in this regard when reporting to international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights monitoring mechanisms. Individuals may also be encouraged, particularly

<p><b>through human rights education, to exercise responsibility by striving for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion, respect and observance of human rights for all. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Traditional values consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
can be instrumental in the promotion, protection and implementation of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in diverse social and cultural contexts. Human rights education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>training through such traditional values can be effective in the local context by rooting 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in such familiar positive traditional values, thus enhancing their 
</b></p>
<p><b>acceptability and eliminating the negative perception that human rights are foreign or 
</b></p>
<p><b>alien concepts. It is important to recognize and safeguard the links between positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional values and human rights to strengthen universal respect for and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Families, communities, societies and educational institutions have an important 
role to play in upholding and transmitting the universal values of humankind as 
</b></p>
<p><b>outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights through human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and training. Positive traditional values that underpin and support human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights may be instrumental in increasing acceptability and implementation at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>grass-roots level. States should respect the cultural diversity and pluralism that exist 
</b></p>
<p><b>within communities and societies as a source of enrichment and value added to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>social and cultural fabric of those communities and societies, as well as of 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized and vulnerable groups; this should not, however, justify any breach of 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Although human rights have been for many years recognized as universal, 
inalienable and indivisible according to many international human rights instruments, 
</b></p>
<p><b>their realization has faced obstacles, especially in certain areas where the population 
</b></p>
<p><b>continues to live according to centuries-old traditions and customs in conditions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty and deprivation. Regional, cultural and religious specificities that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistent with universal human rights may be instrumental in promoting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness, acceptability and implementation of human rights in diverse local contexts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This must not, however, prejudice the responsibilities of States to promote, protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>and fulfil universal human rights in their respective countries and to cooperate at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international level.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In order to ensure that a better understanding and appreciation of traditional 
values of dignity, freedom and responsibility may contribute to the promotion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection and fulfilment of human rights at the regional, national and grass-roots 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels, the distinctive features of different cultures and religions should be accorded 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect, on the condition that they are consistent with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards. To that end, there should be a constant dialogue between different 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries and peoples, and respect shown for positive customs and diverse paths of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, while recognizing the responsibility of all States to promote and protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights for all. Such an approach would be an important step towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>preserving the cultural diversity of our world, preventing conflict and ensuring the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal application of human rights.
