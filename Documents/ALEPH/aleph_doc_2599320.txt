Principal Activity
The principal continuing activity of the Group during the half year was exploration and development 
of the Jervois multi-metal project in the Northern Territory.
Review of Operations 
 
Throughout the half year to 30 June 2016, the Company continued to pursue a strategy of increasing 
and  upgrading  the  total  mineral  resource  at  the  100%  owned  Jervois  Copper-Silver-Gold  Project  in 
the Northern Territory. 
 
The  aim  is  to  place  Jervois  among  the  world’s  lowest  cost  copper  projects  before  advancing  to 
development.  The  Company  made  good  progress  with  a  highly  targeted,  technology  driven 
exploration program, limiting expenditure in response to the period of low commodity prices.   
 
At the emerging Rockface prospect, high grade copper was intersected in diamond drilling programs 
and new zones of significant mineralisation discovered.
At the Green Parrot prospect, shallow drilling confirmed high grade, near surface copper, silver, lead 
and zinc mineralisation
Rockface Prospect 
The  copper  mineralisation  at  Rockface  is  rapidly  growing  in  size  and  significance  to  the  Jervois 
Project. 
 
As  the  result  of  an  Orion  3D  Induced  Polarisation  (3DIP)  survey  completed  in  July  2015,  several 
anomalies  were  detected,  including  a  strong  coincident  3DIP  chargeability/conductivity  anomaly 
beneath  Rockface.    In  late  2015,  the  drilling  of  hole  KJCD171  targeting  the  3DIP  anomaly  at 
Rockface  intersected  a  broad  interval  of  massive  magnetite-chalcopyrite  mineralisation  with  high 
copper grades.   
 
A  follow-up  Down-Hole  Electromagnetic  (DHEM)  survey  of  KJCD171  identified  two  strong  off-hole 
conductors  that  were  targeted  by  drilling  in  March  and  April  2016.  Two  holes,  KJCD182  and 
KJCD183, encountered further massive magnetite-chalcopyrite, a deeper extension of the high grade 
mineralisation first intersected in KJCD171. 
 
KJCD182 included:
  9m @ 2.91% Cu, 17.6g/t Ag and 0.2g/t Au from 284m, and  
  6m @ 1.6% Cu, 9.3g/t Ag and 0.16g/t Au from 296m.
KJCD183 included:
  16m @ 3.34% Cu, 16.7g/t Ag and 0.17g/t Au from 362m.
The  DHEM  is  proving  an  effective  tool  for  locating  high-grade  copper  mineralisation.  As  reported 
above, hole KJCD183 targeted the Conductor 3 anomaly identified by the DHEM survey of hole

KJCD171. Subsequent DHEM surveys conducted in KJCD183 and other recent holes increased the 
size and extent of Conductor 3.   
 
A drilling program commenced in June 2016 to extend Rockface mineralisation both along strike and 
down dip.  The first hole, KJCD195, intersected mineralisation including:
  10.5m @ 8.76% Cu, 42.9g/t Ag and 0.51g/t Au from 478.4m.
This was approximately 105m below and 15m to the west of KJCD183.  
 
Hole KJCD195 intersected a second zone of mineralisation including:
  5.1m @ 2.66% Cu, 0.39% Zn, 13.8g/t Ag and 0.27g/t Au from 513.6m.
The drilling program at Rockface continued in July 2016.  Hole KJCD196 targeted the western extent 
of  Conductor  3.    The  width  and  grade  of  mineralisation  was  weaker  than  the  massive  magnetite-
chalcopyrite  observed  in  KJCD195.  The  hole  intersected  a  4.5m  zone  of  veined  and  stringer 
chalcopyrite-pyrite in a moderately altered garnet-magnetite host rock from 476m to 480.5m.  Above 
this  zone  in  the  hanging  wall  the  hole  intersected  20m  (456-476m)  of  disseminated  pyrite-
chalcopyrite in a weakly to moderately magnetite altered rock. 
 
These high grade intercepts and the  intersection of multiple mineralised lenses continued to extend 
the size of the sulphide mineralisation at Rockface and demonstrated the potential for further growth. 
 
DHEM surveys of KJCD195-6 confirmed that Conductor 3 extended further down dip than previously 
modelled,  and  also  identified  a  new,  larger  DHEM  anomaly,  Conductor  5,  located  in  the  footwall  to 
Conductor 3.   
 
To test Conductors 3 and 5, KJCD197, the third of the latest program of three holes targeting DHEM 
anomalies, was drilled in August 2016.  It intersected two significant zones of mineralisation within a 
broader downhole mineralised interval of 47.3m from 530.8m to 578.1m.  This is approximately 70m 
down dip of the two mineralised intercepts in KJCD195.   Final assay results are anticipated  in mid-
September  2016.    A  further  DHEM  survey  of  KJCD197  is  being  undertaken  to  help  target  further 
drilling into the highest grade mineralisation. 
 
During the half-year, a shallow diamond drilling program at Rockface confirmed that mineralisation 
continues to the surface. The Company used man-portable equipment in steep terrain inaccessible to 
conventional rigs.  Significant results included:
  8.2m  @  0.75%  copper,  4g/t  silver  and  0.05g/t  gold  from  Om  (Hole  KIDO15)  incl.
3.3m @ 1.49% copper, 3.8g/t silver and 0.09 gold from 1.7m
  7.35m @ 1.22% copper, 2.1g/t silver and 0.06g/t gold from 0m (Hole KIDO16)
incl. 2.6m @ 2.83% copper, 3.1g/t silver and 0.12g/t from 0m
o  4.9m @ 1.04% copper, 10.1g/t silver and 0.06g/t gold from 0m (KIDO20) incl. 3.5m
@ 1.32% copper, 13.4g/t silver and 0.04g/t gold from 1.4m.
Green Parrot 
At  the  Green  Parrot  prospect,  drilling  to  upgrade  the  shallow  mineralisation  amenable  to  open  pit 
mining from inferred to the measured and indicated categories confirmed high grade mineralisation, 
with  assays  of  more  than  40%  combined  copper-lead-zinc  plus  high  silver  encountered.  Significant 
results included:
o  7m  @  3.15%  copper,  27.24%  lead,  13.01%  zinc,  333.1g/t  silver  and  0.07g/t  gold
from 39m (KJCD179)
o  17m @ 1.68% copper, 10.46% lead, 4.24% zinc, 169g/t silver and 0.19g/t gold from 
54m (KJCD177) incl. 2m @ 0.57% copper, 26.53% lead, 8.36% zinc, 227.3g/t silver 
and 0.01g/t gold from 54m.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued) 
Review of Operations (continued)
Gravity Survey 
A detailed gravity survey  at Jervois, completed in March 2016, has helped to better understand the 
geology  and  identify  new  exploration  targets.  Dense  magnetite  and  garnet-altered  rocks  within  and 
adjacent to mineralisation make good gravity targets. The presence of high density sulphide minerals 
can  make  the  gravity  response  even  larger.    The  gravity  response  is  high,  and  therefore  an 
encouraging sign of mineral-bearing rocks, in areas such as Marshall, Reward and the Rockface “fold 
hinge” along the 12-kilometre Jervois strike zone.

Notes to the financial statements for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Note 1. Basis of preparation
These  general  purpose  financial  statements  for  the  half-year  reporting  period  ended  30  June  2016  have 
been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134:  Interim  Financial  Reporting 
and the Corporations Act 2001.
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  are  based  on  historical  costs, 
modified, where applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets 
and financial liabilities.
These  half-year  financial  statements  do  not  include  all  the  notes  of  the  type  normally  included  in  annual 
financial  statements  and  therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  provide  as  full  an  understanding  of  the  financial 
performance,  financial  position  and  financing  and  investing  activities  of  the  consolidated  entity  as  the  full 
financial statements. Accordingly, these half-year financial statements are to be read in conjunction with the 
annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by 
KGL  Resources  Limited  during  the  half-year  reporting  period  in  accordance  with  the  continuous  disclosure 
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.
The same accounting policies and methods of computation have generally been followed in these half-year 
financial statements as compared with the most recent annual financial statements.  There are no accounting 
policies which have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
Going Concern
The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal 
business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As  disclosed  in  the  financial  report,  the  consolidated  entity  achieved  a  net  loss  of  $1,448,419  and  net 
operating  cash  outflows  of  $1,176,148  for  the  period  ended  30  June  2016.  As  at  30  June  2016  the 
consolidated entity has cash of $1,718,052.
The  ability  of  the  consolidated  entity  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  is  principally  dependent  upon  one  or 
more of the following:
 
 

the ability of the Company to raise capital as and when necessary.  
the successful exploration and subsequent exploitation of the consolidated entity’s tenements, and/or 
receipt of proceeds from research and development claims.
These  conditions  give  rise  to  material  uncertainty  which  may  cast  significant  doubt  over  the  consolidated 
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors believe that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate due to the following reasons:

the consolidated entity has a proven history of successfully raising funds which included during the 
period raising $2,906,005 through a two for nine entitlement offer.
  The Directors believe there is sufficient cash available for the consolidated entity to continue
operating until it can raise sufficient further capital to fund its ongoing activities, and
  Management have submitted research and development claims and are awaiting confirmation that
these claims will be paid.
Should  the  consolidated  entity  be  unable  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  it  may  be  required  to  realise  its 
assets and extinguish its liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business, and at amounts that differ 
from those stated in the financial report.
This  financial  report  does  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and  classification  of 
recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities and appropriate disclosures that may be 
necessary should the consolidated entity be unable to continue as a going concern.

Notes to the financial statements for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 
 
New and revised accounting standards
In the current period, the Group has  adopted all the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued 
by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (the AASB) that are relevant to its operations and effective for 
annual  reporting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2016.  The  adoption  of  these  new  and  revised 
Standards and Interpretations has resulted in no changes to the Group’s financial results.
Note 2. Segment information
Following the sale of the Bashkol Project in June 2015 and the loss of control of the Geothermal Project 
disclosed in Note 3, the Group now identifies only one operating segment, based on the internal reports that 
are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (chief operating decision makers) in assessing performance 
and determining the allocation of resources. The Group does not yet have any products or services from 
which it derives an income. 
 
Accordingly, management currently identifies the Group as having only one reportable segment, being 
exploration at the Jervois site in the Northern Territory. The financial results from this segment are equivalent 
to the financial statements of the Group. 
 
All assets are located in Australia.

On  the  1  January  2014  KGL  lost  control  of  Kentor  Energy  a  100%  owned  subsidiary.    The  loss  of  control 
arose from entering into a  Farm In Agreement with Geodynamics over the exploration  of tenements held by 
this  entity.    Subsequent to  entering  into  the agreement  25%  interest  in the operations  was  issued to Kentor 
Energy leaving KGL with a 75% interest.
As  a  result  of  the  loss  of  control  on  1  January  2014  Kentor  Energy  was  deconsolidated  and  a  loss  was 
recognised in the profit or loss.  The investment recognised as this date has been recognised at cost as the 
Directors have determined that this represents the fair value of the investment at that point in time.
Subsequent  to  1  January  2014  KGL  Resources  Limited’s  investment  in  Kentor  Energy  has  been  equity 
accounted for.
On 24 August 2016 the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 75% Participating Interest in the Savo 
Island  Prospecting  Licence  (PL-01/12)  for  a  sale  price  of  $1.  Upon  completion  of  the  sale  KGL  Resources 
Limited will have no further interest in or liability for the tenement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT
To the members of KGL Resources Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of KGL Resources Limited, which 
comprises the  consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes 
comprising a statement of accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ 
declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the 
half-year’s end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We 
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review 
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, 
on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe 
that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving 
a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its 
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of KGL Resources 
Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the 
annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which 
has been given to the directors of KGL Resources Limited, would be in the same terms if given to the 
directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the half-year financial report of KGL Resources Limited is not in accordance with the 
Corporations Act 2001 including:
(a)  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and
of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
(b)  complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and Corporations
Regulations 2001.
Emphasis of matter
Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to Note 1 in the half-year financial report, which 
indicates that the ability of the consolidated entity to continue as a going concern is dependent upon 
the future successful raising of necessary funding through equity, successful exploration and 
subsequent exploitation of the consolidated entity’s tenements and/or receipt of proceeds from 
research and development claims. These conditions, along with other matters as set out in Note 1, 
indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the consolidated 
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be unable to 
realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
