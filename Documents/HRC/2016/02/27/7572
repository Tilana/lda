<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of India, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official visit to 
that country from 22 April to 1 May 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its invitation. She 
appreciates the opportunity provided to assess the situation directly. In New Delhi, 
consultations were held with officials of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, 
the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Ministry of 
Labour and Employment, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Delhi Police. The Special 
Rapporteur also met with the chief secretaries and State officials in Rajasthan, Gujarat and 
Manipur. She also held meetings with officials from the National Mission for the 
Empowerment of Women, the National Commission for Women and the National Human 
Rights Commission. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, despite her specific requests prior 
to and during the mission, no visits to State-run shelters, prisons or detention centres were 
programmed. She also regrets that no meeting was arranged with the Committee on 
Amendments to Criminal Law (Verma Committee). 
</p><p>3. The Special Rapporteur consulted extensively with civil society and victims in 
various locations within the country. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the United Nations country team for its support 
prior to and during her visit. She is grateful to all interlocutors, including survivors of 
violence who shared their experiences with her. She looks forward to a fruitful dialogue 
with the Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of her 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission was underpinned by knowledge of the ongoing 
struggle in India for women&#8217;s rights and its present complexities. The establishment of self-
governance during the colonial period was influenced by the leadership of Mahatma 
Gandhi, whose discourse included the need to address recurrent issues affecting women in 
India, such as caste-based discrimination, harmful customary and religious practices and 
sexual violence. The historical struggle against patriarchy was also shaped by the role of the 
women&#8217;s rights movements in exposing the root causes of inequality, discrimination and 
violence against women. 
</p>
<p>6. While due recognition of the complexities inherent to the country&#8217;s size and 
diversity need to be taken into account, it is imperative that those are not used to explain, 
defend or justify violence against women or the failure to address it. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Manifestations of violence against women and girls, its causes 
and consequences 
</b></p>
<p>7. Violence against women in India is systematic and occurs in the public and private 
spheres. It is underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter- and intra-
gender hierarchies. Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only on the 
basis of sex, but on other grounds, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition 
and other realities. That exposes many to a continuum of violence throughout the life cycle, 
commonly referred to as existing &#8220;from the womb to the tomb&#8221;. The manifestations of 
violence against women are a reflection of the structural and institutional inequality that is a 
reality for most women in India. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women in the family 
</b></p>
<p>8. According to numerous interlocutors, the physical, sexual and psychological abuse 
of women in the private sphere is widely tolerated by the State and the community. The 
perpetrators include husbands, in-laws and other family members. Many victims live in 
family settings that are rooted in deeply entrenched patriarchal and customary practices that 
are sometimes harmful to women. The widespread socioeconomic dependency of women 
subordinates them to their husbands and other family members. The fear of social exclusion 
and marginalization, and the lack of effective responses to violence, keeps them in a 
context of continuous violence and intimidation. 
</p>
<p>9. Violence and killings linked to dowry payments are alarming across the country. 
Data from the National Crime Records Bureau reflect an increasing trend of crimes 
reported under the Dowry Prohibition Act since 2008, and a significant increase in such 
crimes since 2010.1 Marriage is often used by the husband and/or his family to obtain 
property or other assets from the wife and/or her family, either directly or indirectly. While 
its practice has evolved through time, the payment of dowry today is based on the idea that 
women are a burden. It is also commonly considered to be crucial to ensure the safety of 
the bride, especially within poor communities. Despite the payment of dowry, many women 
and girls find themselves forced into a life of servitude and experience repeated acts of 
harassment, intimidation, sexual abuse and violence by their husbands and other family 
members as part of demands for more dowry. 
</p>
<p>10. &#8220;Honour crimes&#8221; are usually perpetrated by family members, often with the 
complicity of community leaders. Reasons range from a woman&#8217;s refusal to be forced into 
marriage and retaliation for marrying the man of her choice, to refusal to follow prescribed 
and expected dress codes. Women and girls suffer a wide range of physical and 
psychological abuse and the denial of basic freedom of movement and expression, and are 
sometimes killed in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. Customary practices in the family and community point to a pattern of daughter 
aversion and son preference. Research has documented a trend of declining girl-child sex 
ratio from 962 per 1,000 males in 1981, to 945 in 1991, to 927 in 2001, to 914 in 2011.2 
Patriarchal norms and socioeconomic factors have reportedly fuelled the decline. The desire 
for sons has led to a &#8220;policing&#8221; of pregnancies by spouses and families through prenatal 
monitoring systems. The results can lead to sex-selective abortions, which are often forced 
on women in violation of their sexual and reproductive rights. Despite specific legislation 
to address this problem,3 including stringent measures in case of contravention, there is a 
continuing prevalence of sex-selection practices in some states. Furthermore, some of those 
measures are perceived as the State policing pregnancies broadly and violating women&#8217;s 
sexual and reproductive choices. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women in the community 
</b></p>
<p>12. Sexual violence, including rape and sexual harassment, is widespread across the 
country and perpetrated in public and private spaces. According to the National Crime

</b></p>
<p>Records Bureau, in 2012, 2.84 cases of rape were reported every hour.4 Many interlocutors 
stated that there was a general sense of insecurity for women in public spaces, especially in 
urban settings. Women are easy targets of attacks, including sexual violence, whether while 
using public transportation or sanitation facilities or on the way to collect wood and water. 
Many victims of sexual violence carry a deep sense of shame, which is further exacerbated 
by the stigma and exclusion they experience, especially from family members and the 
community, and which may result in suicide. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to early and/or forced marriages, the implementation of the Prohibition 
of Child Marriage Act, 2006 has resulted in some reduction in the overall percentage of 
early marriages.5 However, the high prevalence of such marriages continues to endanger the 
lives of girls, whether in respect of domestic violence, marital rape or early pregnancies. It 
also deprives them of numerous human rights, including the right to education and the 
enjoyment of their childhood. 
</p><p>14. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the high incidence of acid attacks on 
women in the country, despite the development of new legislative measures.6 Victims of 
acid attacks are predominantly women who challenge patriarchal norms, including by 
opposing a marriage or partner proposal.7 The disfiguring of the victim&#8217;s face and body 
forces the survivors to live in stigma, shame and exclusion. It also creates a climate of fear 
for other women as regards the consequences of failing to abide by and respect traditional 
practices and roles. 
</p>
<p>15. Violence against various groups is also of concern. Dalit and Adivasi women and 
women from other scheduled castes and tribes and other &#8220;backward classes&#8221; are frequent 
victims of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, as well as violence. Caste-
based discrimination, which also includes intra-caste hierarchies, continues to be pervasive 
and widespread. The intergenerational nature of caste-based discrimination condemns 
women to a life of exclusion, marginalization and disadvantage in every sphere of life. 
Many of those women are denied an education and economic opportunities, and perform 
dangerous and unprotected work, including bonded labour (debt bondage) and manual 
scavenging, which are both widely regarded as forms of forced labour and modern forms of 
slavery. Women represent the vast majority of manual scavengers in the country, and are 
commonly from scheduled castes and minority groups. While legislation has been adopted 
to eradicate bonded labour and manual scavenging,8 reports and interlocutors indicate that 
there is a consistent failure in the implementation of such laws9 and a tendency to minimize 
the significance of the problem.  
</p>
<p>16. Numerous testimonies shared on recurrent episodes of communal violence against 
religious minorities, including Muslims and Christians, reflect a deep sense of insecurity 
and trauma of women living in those communities. Experiences included women being

<p>stripped, burned, attacked with objects inserted into their vaginas and sexually assaulted in 
myriad ways because of their religious identity. It was reported that perpetrators of those 
crimes usually held positions of authority and often went unpunished. Further, those 
minorities are allegedly excluded from access to education, employment and adequate 
housing on equal terms with other citizens, despite the existence of affirmative action 
schemes and measures by the Ministry of Minority Affairs and the National Commission 
for Minorities aimed at empowering minority women through the provision of knowledge, 
tools and training. 
</p>
<p>17. Women employed as domestic workers are often irregular migrants and unregistered 
women who operate in a poorly regulated labour market and who are usually considered as 
belonging to the bottom of a social class. They become easy targets for abusive employers, 
who force them to work long hours in return for low salaries and often deduct amounts for 
leave days taken. Many are prevented from using the employer&#8217;s sanitary facilities and are 
forced to defecate and bathe in public, and are subjected to various forms of harassment and 
violence. Many women are primary breadwinners, either as a result of widowhood or 
unemployed spouses, and their low pay makes it difficult to assume financial responsibility, 
including for their children&#8217;s health and education needs. Alcohol abuse by husbands was 
also reported to be a contributing factor to the violence many of those women experienced. 
</p>
<p>18. Women with disabilities face multiple challenges, including, for example, the lack 
of adequate access to public spaces, utilities and buildings, and often experience harassment 
in public. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a troubling practice whereby a payment 
incentive was offered, either as a State scheme or a dowry from the family, in exchange for 
marriage to a woman with disabilities. She was also informed of violence perpetrated 
against women with disabilities in State-sponsored shelters. 
</p>
<p>19. Women in same-sex relationships and transgender women also confront violence 
and exclusion. Section 377 of the Penal Code criminalizes sexual activities &#8220;against the 
order of nature&#8221;. This particularly affects the protection rights of lesbian and transgender 
women and has been used by parents as an excuse to prevent homosexuality in their 
families. The mere perception of different sexual orientation is sufficient to put people at 
risk of violence and is a contributory factor to the inability of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex community to report cases of violence.10 
</p>
<p>20. Sex workers are exposed to a range of abuse, including physical attacks, and 
harassment by clients, family members, the community and State authorities. Many sex 
workers are forcibly detained and rehabilitated, and they also face a consistent lack of legal 
protection. Many face challenges in gaining access to essential health services, including 
for treatment for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. A recent order of the 
Supreme Court of India took the position that a sex worker engaged in such work to survive 
and was &#8220;not leading a life of dignity&#8221;.11 In her discussions with interlocutors, the Special 
Rapporteur noted a tendency to conflate sex work with trafficking in persons, and when sex 
workers are identified as victims of trafficking, the assistance that is provided to them is not 
targeted to their specific needs.

 In a recent decision, <i>Suresh Kumar Koushal and another</i> v. <i>Naz Foundation (India) Trust</i>, 2013, the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, while setting aside the decision of the Delhi High Court on section 377 of the Indian 
Penal Code, ruled that the Parliament had to legislate on the issue and upheld section 377, as it still 
remained in the statutes of the country.

<p>21. Widows also face particular vulnerabilities, as they are often denied and 
dispossessed of property by their in-laws following the death of a spouse. In addition, social 
exclusion and poverty lead some widows to engage in sex work and prostitution, and their 
children to perform hazardous labour or beg on the streets. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of brutal acts of violence against women, 
including executions, commonly referred to as &#8220;witch-hunting&#8221;. The stigma that is attached 
to women who are labelled a &#8220;witch&#8221;, and the rejection they experience within their 
communities, leads to various violations and is an obstacle to gaining access to justice. 
Such labelling affects family members across generations. There is reportedly little or no 
official investigation into such violations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women condoned or perpetrated by the State 
</b></p>
<p>23. Women living in militarized regions, such as Jammu and Kashmir and the north-
eastern states, live in a constant state of siege and surveillance, whether in their homes or in 
public. Information received through both written and oral testimonies highlighted the use 
of mass rape, allegedly by members of the State security forces, as well as acts of enforced 
disappearance, killings and acts of torture and ill-treatment, which were used to intimidate 
and to counteract political opposition and insurgency. Testimonies also highlight the impact 
of that situation on women&#8217;s health, including psychological disorders such as post-
traumatic stress disorder, fear psychosis and severe anxiety, with such conditions having a 
negative impact on women&#8217;s physical well-being. Additionally, the freedoms of movement, 
association and peaceful assembly are frequently restricted. The specific legal framework 
that governs those areas, namely, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and its variations, 
allows for the overriding of due process rights and nurtures a climate of impunity and a 
culture of both fear and resistance by citizens. 
</p>
<p>24. Violence against women in custodial settings remains a concern. In 2012 there were 
20 women&#8217;s prisons and 21 centres for the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.12 
Furthermore there are rehabilitation centres for sex workers. Women account for 4.4 per 
cent of all inmates in the country.13 Women prisoners are scattered across the country, often 
in violation of international standards aimed at ensuring that those wishing to maintain 
family relationships during custody can do so.14 Concerns were raised about a lack of 
adequate protective measures to ensure the safety of inmates, including from gender-related 
killings. In 2012, 55 deaths of female inmates were registered, of which eight were 
suicides.15 There was also a reported lack of access to essential services, including medical 
care, for inmates due to limited resources.16 
</p>
<p>25. Women were also found to suffer violence in the context of forced evictions. The 
State&#8217;s efforts to foster economic growth and implement development projects are allegedly 
often conducted without adequate consultations with affected communities, with the sole 
objective being one of economic growth at any cost. The consequences for women include 
being forced to live in insecure environments, displacement, the degradation of their 
environment, the loss of land and livelihoods and forcible evictions. Many victims are left 
without adequate relocation alternatives, forcing them to live in slums or on the streets. The 
Government&#8217;s twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012&#8211;2017 includes elements to improve housing

<p>conditions through a new slum rehabilitation programme and schemes to assist States to 
improve livelihood opportunities in urban areas.17 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur noted concerns with regard to profit-oriented microfinance 
institutions involving microfinance products for women, and the failure of the State to 
protect and prevent abuses. Vulnerable women reportedly receive multiple loans and are 
sold financial products with little or no information, and the unequal bargaining power 
between such institutions and clients is not addressed by regulation. Such practices result in 
over-indebtedness and the inability to pay back, which leads to harassment and threats and 
women being excluded from their families and communities. Some have reportedly 
committed suicide as a result of such abuse. It is unclear if the larger problem is a lack of, 
or inadequate, regulation of microfinance institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women in the transnational sphere 
</b></p>
<p>27. Many women refugees and asylum seekers are unskilled workers who often perform 
hazardous labour in urban and informal settings. While access to education and health care 
is provided for free by the Government, access to livelihoods is still a challenge, 
particularly in urban or semi-urban areas. Many of those women earn low wages and are 
forced to live in small and overcrowded apartments, with a lack of access to basic sanitation 
in less developed urban settings. Such factors contribute to poor health conditions and other 
vulnerabilities. Language barriers often impede their ability to gain access to health care, 
education and the justice system. Despite improvements in criminal law and police 
procedures, women refugees and asylum seekers continue to voice safety concerns, as they 
are frequent targets of attacks and harassment by employers, landlords and community 
members in public and private spheres. 
</p>
<p>28. The trafficking of women and girls from, and to, India was reported as widespread. 
Disadvantaged women from minority groups, scheduled castes and tribes and the 
&#8220;backward castes&#8221; are usually the main victims. Young unskilled women are allegedly 
given false work promises, resulting in forced domestic servitude in foreign countries. 
Women who are trafficked and forced into prostitution are left unable to defend their rights, 
and lack access to rehabilitation and compensation for such crimes. This lack of protection 
and prioritization of the problem by the State has intensified the violence perpetrated 
against them by criminals or those involved in trafficking practices. The complicity of State 
officials in human trafficking was also reported as a concern. The Immoral Traffic 
(Prevention) Act, 1956 and its amendments18 are reportedly more directed at safeguarding 
public moral than combating trafficking in line with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

<p><b> III. Implications of inequality, discrimination and violence on 
women&#8217;s enjoyment of their human rights 
</b>29. The protection of human rights has advanced significantly since India achieved 
independence. The adoption of the first democratic Constitution in 1949 marked progress 
towards developing a normative framework conducive to the protection of women&#8217;s human 
rights. For the first time, the Constitution recognized freedoms and rights of women, 
strengthened the principle of equality between men and women and afforded legal 
protection to all, without discrimination on the basis of sex, among other criteria. It also 
allowed for affirmative action measures for women. 
</p>
<p>30. India has ratified numerous international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

<p>31. At the national level, laws and policies have been put in place to prevent and 
respond to violence against women. These include the Penal Code, the Criminal Law 
(Amendment) Act 2013, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prohibition, 
Prevention and Redressal) Act, 2013, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence 
Act, 2005, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986, the Scheduled 
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, the Dowry 
Prohibition Act, 1961, the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1961, the Immoral Traffic 
(Prevention) Act, 1956 and the Bonded Labour System (Prohibition) Act of 1976, among 
others. Despite those positive developments, effective implementation of those laws and the 
allocation of financial resources to support their execution adequately is reportedly lacking 
in many instances. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights  
</b></p>
<p>32. In terms of women&#8217;s participation in political and public affairs, significant 
challenges remain at both the national and local levels. According to the Inter-
Parliamentary Union, India ranks 111th of 188 States in terms of women&#8217;s participation in 
parliaments.19 The Special Rapporteur was informed that a bill aimed at reserving one third 
of all seats for women in the lower house of the Parliament (the Lok Sabha) and the State 
legislative assemblies was still outstanding.20 In terms of the judiciary, the proportion of 
female judges is very low.21 At the local level, citizens may participate in community-level 
self-government institutions, named Gram Panchayats (village councils). The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that she was not able to engage directly with that sector of Government, 
despite her requests. 
</p>
<p>33. Measures have been put in place to ensure greater representation of women in 
positions of authority in village councils, including women belonging to marginalized 
groups. The Government has also piloted a programme for women Gram Panchayat 
representatives, who would serve as counsellors for women victims at the community level. 
Their main function is to facilitate information-sharing on issues relating to women, and

of abuse of authority by and patriarchal attitudes of women elected to Gram Panchayats 
(whether by choice or through coercive influences), and of abuse by community leaders, 
including members of the illegal22 informal courts of the Khap Panchayats. 
</p>
<p>34. The lack of registration and the difficulty in obtaining an identity card were noted as 
impeding women&#8217;s participation in public life, including their access to essential services. 
No information was available to ascertain the measures in place to address that problem. 
</p>
<p>35. Fair trial rights, equality before the law and equal protection of the law were affected 
by numerous challenges, beginning with the reporting of cases of violence against women 
to the police. Many interlocutors said that victims were often discouraged from reporting to 
the police and that many women did not file a complaint owing to fear of reprisals or lack 
of guarantees of adequate shelter and access to livelihoods. Informal dispute settlement 
alternatives are often sought, allegedly by police, family members or community leaders. 
Many interlocutors described the complete or partial absence of legal, housing, security and 
financial assistance measures for victims. To be able to officially report complaints and 
continue throughout the often lengthy judicial process in safety and with an adequate 
standard of living is not an option for many women. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur received information indicating that human rights defenders, 
including women&#8217;s organizations, face numerous challenges, including harassment, 
intimidation and reprisals. Those concerns echo the findings contained in the 2011 report of 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (A/HRC/19/55/Add.1), 
the 2012 report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
(A/HRC/23/47/Add.1 and Corr.1) and concerns voiced during the universal periodic review 
of India in 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic rights and the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>37. India recently underwent a significant wave of reforms to liberalize its economy, 
which has resulted in unprecedented growth and prosperity. Economic growth reportedly 
constitutes an overriding priority in the run-up to the May 2014 general elections. The 
country&#8217;s twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012&#8211;2017 is focused on economic sustainability and is 
aimed at making such growth irreversible. Unfortunately, the economic development focus 
for women remains one of subsistence and does not necessarily take into account, or 
address sufficiently, the gendered and class nature of systemic and structural inequality and 
discrimination. Gender budgeting, as a tool to establish gender differential impacts and to 
ensure that gender commitments are translated into budgetary commitments, was 
highlighted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.23 However, its 
implementation across the country is not consistent. 
</p>
<p>38. Whereas the participation of all citizens in the economy is considerable, women&#8217;s 
labour force participation is significantly lower, at 25.7 per cent, as compared to men, at 
77.4 per cent.24 Moreover, job opportunities for women are in decline.25 Women are also

indicates that the participation of women in the workforce fell from 37.3 per cent in 2004/05 to 29.0 
per cent in 2009/10; only 44 per cent of the decline can be explained by the increased enrolment of

<p>found in precarious jobs requiring low skills and offering low and unequal wages. 
According to official statistics, the general trend of daily earnings for women in recent 
decades has been comparatively lower than those of men in virtually all sectors, including 
manufacturing, mining and service sectors.26  
</p>
<p>39. Labour legislation in India provides for safeguards to ensure respect for the rights of 
women at work, and schemes are in place to help women improve their skills in specific 
occupations, thus moving beyond subsistence labour skills. For example, there are training 
institutes to help women gain access to the labour market, including industrial training 
institutes, with 14,059 centres across the country. Public/private schemes have been 
designed by companies and public institutions to provide training for women in key 
industrial areas, but there is no commitment to future employment in those companies. 
</p>
<p>40. Legal measures have been instituted to address sexual harassment in the workplace. 
The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) 
Act, 2013 defines sexual harassment comprehensively and is largely in line with the 1997 
Vishaka judgement.27 It provides for complaints committees in all workplaces employing at 
least 10 persons. Moreover, while penalties are prescribed in the event of a false or 
malicious complaint, the Act seeks to prevent the revictimization of victims who are unable 
to provide adequate proof or substantiate a complaint. 
</p>
<p>41. In terms of safety and health at work, in 2009 the Government instituted the 
National Policy on Safety, Health, and Environment at the Workplace, including an action 
programme for implementation, which is to be reviewed every five years. The policy is 
guided by constitutional principles relating to work, which include maternal protection, 
health and strength at work, prohibition of child labour, and participation in decision-
making.28 
</p>
<p>42. Microcredits are used widely in the country, particularly by poor and vulnerable 
women. Most loans are provided by microfinance institutions, including non-banking 
financial (or &#8220;Section 25&#8221;) companies. Despite concerns about a lack of adequate regulation 
and abusive practices, the adoption of legislation at the Union level, such as the Micro 
Finance Institutions (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2011 is still pending. Some States 
have adopted legislative frameworks, but the overall view is that those institutions operate 
in a largely unregulated market. 
</p>
<p>43. In terms of the prohibition of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as bonded 
labour, the Bonded Labour System (Prohibition) Act, 1976 was enacted as a deterrent.

</p>
<p><b> C. Social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>44. Pervasive gender stereotyping, whether in the media, in the community or in 
discourses by public officials, was highlighted as an impediment to women&#8217;s development. 
The pervasive culture of denigrating and marginalizing women&#8217;s perspectives, concerns 
and also their identity was an issue that was raised by several interlocutors. Concerns were 
also raised about the resulting impact on the social standing of women. According to 
official data, between 2011 and 2012 the number of cases involving insult to the modesty of 
women increased by 7 per cent.29 In 1986, the Indecent Representation of Women 
(Prohibition) Act was enacted to prohibit indecent representation in advertisements, 
publications, writings and paintings or in any other manner. New amendments have been 
proposed to include new forms of communication, to strengthen penalties and to provide 
for preventive measures. No official information was shared as to accountability measures 
to address the continuing occurrence of such stereotyping by either State or non-State 
actors. 
</p>
<p>45. Effective implementation of legislation is dependent on the cultural and social norms 
that exist in a society. Women&#8217;s role in participating and shaping such norms is essential, 
but is dependent on whether gender equality is the dominant culture and whether the status 
of women allows for their effective participation. As indicated above, women&#8217;s 
participation in shaping the culture of equality is restricted by the dominant patriarchal 
culture that is deeply entrenched and pervasive. 
</p>
<p>46. Many interlocutors also pointed to the denial of the rights to social goods such as 
education, health and social benefits as a barrier to the fulfilment of the rights necessary for 
a life of dignity. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges in fulfilling the State&#8217;s obligation to act with due 
diligence to eliminate violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>47. States are required to exercise due diligence to prevent and respond to all acts of 
violence against women. A comprehensive system of prevention and protection, with real 
prospects of mitigating harm, altering outcomes and ensuring accountability, must be the 
norm. 
</p>
<p>48. A framework of analysis to assess the obligation of India to prevent, protect, 
investigate, prosecute and punish, and provide for effective redress measures for acts of 
violence against women, in accordance with international and national law, is provided 
below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>49. Violence against women became a priority political issue following the brutal gang 
rape, on 16 December 2012, and tragic death of a young student in New Delhi. The outrage 
and condemnation that followed in India, and beyond, was accompanied by widespread 
social mobilization of citizens demanding justice, accountability and more protection for 
women and girls. As a consequence, the Verma Committee was established by the 
Government to review existing normative gaps. The committee&#8217;s January 2013 report 
included observations and recommendations on addressing sexual violence in the country, 
with respect to, inter alia, reforms to the police, judiciary, political institutions and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>29

<p><b>A/HRC/26/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>education; improvement of security in public spaces; and protection in the family. The 
recommendations led to the adoption of new legislation, notably the new Criminal Law 
(Amendment) Act, which recognizes acid attacks as a new criminal offence; provides for 
penalties for sexual harassment, assault against or use of criminal force on a woman with 
the intent to disrobe, voyeurism and stalking; introduces the crime of trafficking; and 
criminalizes rape and gang rape. The Act improved the legislative framework significantly, 
introducing new criminal offences and stronger sanctions. 
</p>
<p>50. However, the laws that were adopted did not fully reflect the recommendations of 
the Verma Committee. The opportunity to adopt a holistic approach to violence against 
women, including addressing the root causes and consequences of such violence, was lost. 
In fact, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act failed to: criminalize existing beliefs and 
practices linked to chastity; protect women with disabilities, unmarried women, lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender persons, religious minorities, and girls below 18 years of age 
from sexual violence; or recognize marital rape as a criminal offence. Moreover, gang rapes 
and mass crimes involving brutal acts of sexual violence are not considered as multiple 
crimes against women, but as a single punishable crime under this law. Many concerns 
were raised about the deterrent effect of the application of the death penalty, as provided for 
in the Act. This is a statutory option for the courts in cases of gang rape where a perpetrator 
is a repeat offender, or if sexual violence results in the death of the victim, or puts the 
victim in a permanent vegetative state. It is of concern that conviction in such cases may 
entail higher evidential burdens for the victim, since the death penalty is a consideration in 
sentencing. The current legislative framework is therefore still in need of reform. 
</p>
<p>51. Serious concerns were expressed with regard to the insensitive and taunting attitude 
of some members of Parliament with regard to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that some political leaders are not fully committed to the process 
of legal and social change as regards women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>52. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 seeks to protect, and 
prevent harm to, women who are or have been abused by a male spouse or a family 
member. The law broadly defines domestic violence and upholds the right of victims to live 
in the household, irrespective of title rights, and has a number of provisions for the issuing 
of protection orders. Other aspects include procedures for obtaining relief, such as financial 
assistance, and a detailing of the role and powers of service providers. 
</p>
<p>53. The National Mission for Empowerment of Women has a National Mission 
Authority at the apex level under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. It is mandated to 
ensure policy convergence among ministries and state governments and to strengthen the 
overall processes that promote the all-round development of women. The Mission 
facilitates the convergence of gender-sensitive schemes for women; carries out research, 
awareness-raising, education and capacity-building activities; and works to strengthen the 
institutional framework. However, challenges were noted in terms of collaboration with 
some states, notably those in which the ruling political party was different to that of the 
central Government. Moreover, some interlocutors noted that the budget allocation for 
women&#8217;s issues was much lower than that for children&#8217;s issues in the Ministry of Women 
and Child Development. The Mission confirmed the lack of gender programmes in that 
ministry, and also the need to designate gender convergence officers in every ministry to 
address the gaps. 
</p>
<p>54. As regards early marriages, good practices were reported in Rajasthan, whereby 
specialized local officers were assigned to conduct prevention activities. Despite some 
positive developments, there are significant gaps in the legislation, particularly in the Penal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>Code, whereby child marriages are allowed through the practice of declaring them 
voidable, not void, despite the protection provided in the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 
2006.30 
</p>
<p>55. The prevalence of dowry-related practices throughout the country was raised as a 
serious concern. The Dowry Prohibition Act prohibits the giving of, taking of and demand 
for dowry, and establishes dowry prohibition officers to ensure the implementation of the 
law. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau reflects an increasing trend of reported 
dowry-related deaths since 2008.31 Concerns about the lack of effective implementation of 
the law were noted. 
</p>
<p>56. In order to better address &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;, the Law Commission of India issued a 
report entitled &#8220;Prevention of interference with freedom of matrimonial alliance (in the 
name of honour and tradition): a suggested legal framework&#8221;, in August 2012. While the 
report is only recommendatory in nature, the Special Rapporteur was informed that such 
recommendations are given due consideration by the Government. 
</p>
<p>57. National human rights institutions are crucial to promoting and monitoring the 
effective implementation of legislation and the State&#8217;s obligations under both national and 
international law. India has the National Human Rights Commission and 23 state human 
rights commissions dealing with human rights. The National Human Rights Commission 
has a broad human rights mandate, which includes women&#8217;s rights. The National 
Commission for Women has the specific mandate to review constitutional and legal 
safeguards for women, recommend remedial legislative measures, facilitate redress of 
grievances, including on violence against women, and advise the Government on all policy 
matters affecting women. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur received reports indicating that the legal basis of the 
National Commission for Women is not in accordance with international standards; that the 
institution lacks foundational, functional, operational, political and financial independence; 
and that the Commission is generally unable to adapt to the evolving and transformative 
demands of the human rights of women. According to section 3 of the National 
Commission for Women Act, 1990, the Commission&#8217;s composition is determined by the 
central Government. A number of allegations highlighted the Commission&#8217;s inability to 
deal with complaints effectively and undertake independent investigations into violations of 
women&#8217;s rights. Reports also reflect the Commission&#8217;s failure to address the causes and 
consequences of violence against women, including, for example, by finding that no 
particular religious group was targeted during the 2002 Gujarat massacre;32 by consistently

 In 2012, the Delhi High Court held that: &#8220;Consent below the age of 16 years is immaterial, except 
</p>
<p>when the rape is committed by a male who is married to the girl. Section 376 [Indian Penal Code] 
does not treat the rape committed by a husband on his wife above the age of 15 years as an offence&#8221;. 
Moreover, the Court also held that the marriage was not void but voidable: &#8220;if the girl is more than 16 
years, and the girl makes a statement that she went with her consent and the statement and consent is 
without any force, coercion or undue influence, the statement could be accepted&#8221;. According to 
section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, such marriages are &#8220;voidable at the option of the 
contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage&#8221;. See the Court&#8217;s judgement of 27 July 
2012 on the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, paras. 47 and 51. Available from

<p>justifying sexual assault on women as a result of &#8220;provocative dressing&#8221;;33 by its inability, 
over many years, to promote much needed law reform; and by denying reports of sexual 
violence by security forces, including in regions governed by the Armed Forces (Special 
Powers) Acts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection 
</b></p>
<p>59. The lack of implementation of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence 
Act was a concern often raised. Under the Act, women victims require the assistance of a 
protection officer to lodge a complaint and to file a domestic incident report. The 
recruitment and deployment of protection officers in the country is limited; they often work 
part-time and lack the resources to assist victims to file complaints. For instance, in the 
State of Rajasthan, with a population including approximately 27 million women,34 there 
are only 607 designated protection officers and 118 organizations registered as service 
providers.35 The inadequacy of resources to provide a mandatory service is a reflection of a 
failure to act with due diligence. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the central 
Government is considering providing financial assistance to states to fund full-time 
protection officers. In addition, concerns were raised with regard to the lack of protection 
for people in same-sex relationships, due to the language in the law as regards jurisdiction. 
</p><p>60. Although telephone hotlines are available, the police are usually the first point of 
contact for many women, according to reports received. Victims of violence, who require 
from the State special security, shelter, public housing, health care and socioeconomic 
protection, often face significant challenges. Many services are channelled through 
providers that lack sufficient resources. Numerous allegations were made of de facto caste-
based discrimination, perpetrated by police officers, public representatives and community 
members, with regard to access to services. 
</p>
<p>61. Another concern highlighted was that the criminal justice system does not operate 
fully on the basis of the rule of law in accordance with international standards. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed of cases in which courts have criminalized women victims of 
violence, including victims of sexual and communal violence. Also repeatedly raised was 
the concern that legal aid, a right guaranteed in article 39A of the Constitution, was not 
equally granted to women in practice, and in particular to poor and marginalized women. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>62. Concerns were voiced with regard to the investigation of cases and the prosecution 
and punishment for crimes committed against women. The proportion of women in the 
police and in the judiciary is seriously low, which contributes to a lack of attention to 
women&#8217;s issues.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/38/Add.1

</p>
<p>63. Deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes of police officers, prosecutors, judicial 
officers and other relevant civil servants, with regard to the handling of cases, further 
contribute to victims not reporting, withdrawing complaints and not testifying. Also, the 
attitudes and prejudices of many village leaders in Khap Panchayats, who act as informal 
judicial officers, often lead to a pre-arranged settlement between the families, thus failing to 
provide effective redress for victims. Few police stations have specialized women&#8217;s 
mechanisms to address the concerns of women, including violence cases, and to provide the 
assistance and protection that is required during the investigation phase. Impunity for 
abuses committed by police officers and the need for civilian oversight was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>64. Concerns were also raised about evidence gathering, including the practice of 
degrading medical and forensic examinations, such as the &#8220;two-finger test&#8221; for victims of 
sexual violence. The test is often carried out without the victim&#8217;s consent, and despite the 
practice being officially discontinued by the Director General of Health Services in 2011, 
and a Supreme Court decision of 2013 branding it as a violation of the victims&#8217; right to 
privacy. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur heard complaints about the failure by the justice system in 
some states to ensure that women victims and witnesses of acts of violence benefit from 
adequate safety measures and judicial safeguards. Numerous allegations were received of 
women being subjected to acts of coercion and duress in a deliberate attempt to prevent the 
investigation of cases and punishment of perpetrators. Other accounts highlight the denial 
of the right of women to a fair trial, owing to a failure to receive legal assistance to pursue 
their cases. 
</p>
<p>66. The overall conviction rate in India for crimes listed in the Penal Code was 38.5 per 
cent in 2012, the lowest in 10 years, largely owing to delays in the finalization of cases.36 
According to the National Crimes Records Bureau, the average conviction rate for crimes 
against women is 21.3 per cent for cases of kidnapping and abduction of women and girls, 
assault on women, insult to the modesty of women, cruelty by family members and 
trafficking of girls.37 Moreover, the annual analysis provided by the Bureau indicates that in 
2012, reports of crimes against women had increased by 6.8 per cent over 2011 and by 24.7 
per cent over 2008.38 The proportion of registered cases of crimes committed against 
women vis-&#224;-vis crimes in total increased from 8.9 per cent in 2008 to 10.2 per cent in 
2012.39 The low conviction rate and the higher number of cases registered will not act as a 
deterrent for future crimes against women, nor will it engender trust in the judicial system. 
</p><p>67. Impunity for crimes relating to communal violence is the norm. The 
recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
relating to the Gujarat massacre (CEDAW/C/IND/CO/SP.1) have not been fully addressed 
as yet. Moreover, the draft Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of 
Victims) Bill has been pending in Parliament for over eight years; despite the necessity for 
such a law. 
</p>
<p>68. In terms of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Armed Forces (Jammu 
and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990, which provide a wide range of powers to the 
army, the Special Rapporteur was informed that their powers are broader than those

<p>permissible under states of emergency. Under the Acts, special powers are granted to the 
security forces in the &#8220;disturbed&#8221; regions of Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern 
States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and 
Tripura. Due to the enforcement of those laws, numerous allegations of human rights 
abuses were shared. These include violations of the right to life; sexual violence; arbitrary 
detention; torture and ill-treatment; violations of freedom of movement, expression, 
peaceful assembly and association; and violations of due process and equal protection 
before the law. The Special Rapporteur was not informed of any measures to ensure 
accountability and redress for victims. On the contrary, reports have been received alleging 
a total disregard of the non-derogable nature of some rights, provided for in article 4 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and also an overall failure to justify 
restrictions of fundamental freedoms in a manner that is in compliance with the Covenant, a 
requirement reiterated by the Human Rights Committee on numerous occasions.40 
Moreover, the Army Act, 1950 limits the scope for civil courts to consider allegations of 
violence against women perpetrated by army officials, including killings and sexual 
violence. According to that legislation, only victims not subjected to military, naval or air 
force law can access civil courts, which effectively excludes persons living in the territories 
under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Provision of effective redress, including reparations 
</b></p>
<p>69. As noted above, the Special Rapporteur was not provided with data on any measures 
to ensure redress for women victims of violence in the areas under the Armed Forces 
(Special Powers) Act and its variations. The norm of impunity that governs those territories 
is of great concern, as victims and their families are prevented from exercising their right to 
know the truth about violations, have no access to effective remedies and are not given 
guarantees of non-recurrence. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to systemic failures, the low rate of prosecution and conviction for acts 
of violence against women contributes to the lack of effective redress provided to victims. 
Redress begins with the filing of domestic incident reports and a First Information Report. 
As noted above, this is deficient in many respects. Compensation payment is dependent on 
the filing of a case, which is dependent on the availability of protection officers and the 
provision of some form of legal identification. Women belonging to marginalized groups, 
including irregular migrants, domestic workers, scheduled castes and tribes and so-called 
backward castes are often unregistered citizens, or lack identification cards. Such factors 
contribute to a culture of normalization of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>71. Women experience obstacles in gaining access to mechanisms of redress, including 
legal aid, counselling services and shelters. They are also revictimized and exposed to 
further risk of violence through the denial of redress in the context of informal trials or 
negotiations between families and community leaders. The payment of financial 
compensation by the perpetrator or his family for acts of violence against women, in lieu of 
legal remedies, was a recurrent concern <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the formal and informal justice systems.

<p><b> E. Remedies for specific groups at risk 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full 
Participation) Act, 1995 lists the entitlements for persons with disabilities and the 
obligations of the central and state Governments and local bodies. The Act contains no 
provisions to address the specific needs of women with disabilities who are victims of 
violence. Responses to violence against women with disabilities often fail to adapt to the 
type of impairment, whether psychological, physical, sensory or intellectual. Moreover, 
reports highlight a consistent lack of disaggregated data collection on disabilities, which 
renders the violence committed against women with disabilities invisible. In 2006, the 
Government issued a National Policy for Persons with Disabilities which, according to 
information received, needed to be harmonized with the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities.41 Following the ratification by India of the Convention, a new bill 
amending the 1995 Act was proposed, with specific provisions to protect women from 
violence.42 
</p>
<p>73. In 2012, the Government expanded protection to refugee women, by allowing all 
refugees recognized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to apply for 
long-stay visas and work permits. This allowed refugees and asylum seekers access to 
health and education services on equal terms with Indian citizens. However, adequate 
measures are still required to ensure access to these services by women, including those 
who have been forcibly displaced within the country. Reports indicate that many victims do 
not have access to the necessary services provided by the women&#8217;s protection clinics of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as those are either not 
present in the area where they live or lack sufficient resources. Specific programmes are 
needed to address the lack of livelihood opportunities for refugees and asylum seekers, as 
they are often excluded from gaining access to services and participating in decision-
making. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the draft Communal Violence 
(Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill envisages offering protection to 
religious and linguistic minorities and to scheduled castes and tribes, while providing 
standards for addressing communal violence. The Bill reaffirms the importance of non-
discrimination when public officials discharge their responsibilities, in particular with 
regard to addressing violence against religious and linguistic minorities and scheduled 
castes and tribes. However, as noted by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the Bill should include, inter alia, &#8220;a comprehensive system 
of reparations for victims of such crimes; and gender-sensitive victim-centred procedural 
and evidentiary rules&#8221; (CEDAW/C/IND/CO/3, para. 25). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>75. <b>The Government of India has recognized the need to address violence against 
women as a human rights violation, and also as an issue that detracts from the 
country&#8217;s path to prosperity and inclusive development. It has taken legislative 
measures in that regard, including measures to address rape and sexual violence. 
However, significant gaps remain in the legislative framework as regards the failure to

<p><b>recognize all forms of violence against women and to adopt a holistic approach that 
addresses the root and structural causes of violence against women. Moreover, there is 
a lack of effective remedies to address the main manifestations of violence against 
women, owing either to the absence of specific programmes or to a lack of 
implementation. The inability to ensure accountability and redress for victims has led 
to an increase of violence against women and the continued discriminatory treatment 
of victims.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The persistence of harmful practices, pervasive gender stereotypes and deeply 
entrenched patriarchal social and cultural norms is of serious concern. Based on the 
idea of superiority of men over women, those manifestations exacerbate women&#8217;s 
position of dependence and subordination and significantly obstruct effective 
implementation of relevant legislative and policy measures. Without a comprehensive 
effort to address them, in schools or university, at work, in the family, in the 
community and in printed and electronic media, the elimination of violence against 
women remains a challenge. It is essential that the authorities do not underestimate 
the negative effects of this challenge in their efforts to eliminate all forms of violence 
against women.

<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to address the recommendations listed 
below to the Government.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Law and policy reforms 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify all outstanding international human rights instruments; 
 (b) Withdraw the declarations and reservation to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, in particular regarding 
articles 5 (a); 16, paragraphs 1 and 2; and 29, paragraph 1; 
 (c) Amend the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 and in particular 
review the provisions that provide for the death penalty in section 376A; include a

transgender and intersex women, religious minorities and underage citizens; and 
define gang rape as multiple crimes requiring appropriate punishment (section 376D); 
 (d) Repeal section 377 of the Penal Code, which criminalizes consensual 
same-sex behaviour; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Review the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 that de facto 
criminalizes sex work and ensure that measures to address trafficking in persons do 
not overshadow the need for effective measures to protect the human rights of sex 
workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Repeal, as a matter of urgency, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 
and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act and ensure that

</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Take effective measures to ensure access to justice and effective redress 
for all victims of violence against women. In particular, it should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Ensure that the full ban on Khap Panchayats by the Supreme Court is 
 implemented throughout the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Ensure that cases of violence against women are addressed by the 
judiciary and not by informal justice mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Monitor the implementation of judicial decisions on cases relating to 
 violence against women, and ensure that victims have prompt access to effective
