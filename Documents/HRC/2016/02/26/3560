</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (<i>g</i>) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
in which the Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in 
its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 16/10 of 24 March 2011 on the 
composition of staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of all the relevant resolutions on these issues adopted by the General 
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> <i>also </i>of the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the High Commissioner1 and on the funding and 
staffing of the Office,2 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>paragraphs 31 to 34 of the &#8220;Outcome of the review of the work and 
functioning of the Human Rights Council&#8221;, as contained in the annex to Council resolution 
16/21 of 25 March 2011, which focus on the resources and funding for the activities of the 
Council, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
 1  A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1. 
 2 JIU/REP/2007/8. 
</p>

<p><i> Regretting</i> that, despite repeated requests by the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly, the issue of rectifying the imbalance of the geographical distribution of 
staff of the Office of the High Commissioner has not made significant progress, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, although the amount of regular budget funding appropriated for the 
Office of the High Commissioner has been increasing gradually since 2005, 60 per cent of 
the global funding needs of the Office are met from voluntary contributions, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
</p>
<p> 1<i>. Expresses</i> <i>its serious concern</i> at the fact that the imbalance in the 
geographical representation of the composition of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights continues to be significant, and that a single region 
occupies more posts in both the professional and technical categories, as well as permanent 
and temporary categories, than the other four regions combined; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Requests </i>the High Commissioner to include in her annual report to the 
Human Rights Council detailed information regarding the following: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) A list of staff of the Office of the High Commissioner based on their 
nationality or nationalities, grade and level, type of contract, source of funding, and 
mandate, and  the measures taken to correct the imbalance in geographical composition of 
staff of the Office, in order to facilitate monitoring of the issue of imbalance of the 
geographical distribution of staff of the Office by the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Information pertaining to the allocation of the regular budget according to 
programme and mandate, including to field offices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Details of voluntary contributions received by the Office of the High 
Commissioner and their allocation, as well as the conditionalities that may be attached to 
them; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Information pertaining to the allocation of unearmarked and earmarked 
voluntary contributions, according to programme and mandate, including to field offices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Information pertaining to the allocation of funding for the special procedures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Joint Inspection Unit to assist in systematically monitoring the 
implementation of the present resolution by submitting annual reports to the Human Rights 
Council.
