Changes in Executive Compensation
As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as part of the Company’s general salary and wage reductions,
on February 26, 2016 the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the
Board of Directors of TETRA Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”), at the request of Company
management, approved ten percent (10%) reductions in the base annual salaries of certain
officers of the Company, including all of the officers who were identified as named executive
officers in the Company’s 2016 proxy statement (the “Initial Reductions”). Such Initial Reductions
were effective for the six-month period from February 6, 2016 through August 5, 2016.
In addition, as previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May
6, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, at the request of
Company management, approved additional ten percent (10%) reductions in the base annual
salaries of certain officers of the Company (as reduced by the Initial Reductions), including all of
the officers who were identified as named executive officers in the Company’s 2016 proxy
statement (the “Second Reductions”). Such Second Reductions commenced on May 14, 2016
and are expected to continue through September 30, 2016, unless extended by the
Compensation Committee.
As part of the Company’s extension of the Initial Reductions applicable to a majority of its U.S.-
based employees, on August 4, 2016 the Compensation Committee, at the request of Company
management, determined that the Initial Reductions, which cover all of the officers who were
identified as named executive officers in the Company’s 2016 proxy statement, should be
extended from August 6, 2016 to December 31, 2016, unless further extended by the Committee.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
In order to align the compensation of our board members with employee wage and salary
reductions, the non-employee directors of the Company previously agreed to a 10% reduction in
their annual cash retainers and meeting fees for the period March 1, 2016 through August 31,
2016 (the “First Reduction”). On May 3, 2016, the non-employee directors voluntarily agreed to
an additional 10% reduction in their annual cash retainers and meeting fees for the period May 1,
2016 through September 20, 2016. On August 3, 2016, the non-employee directors of the
Company voluntarily agreed to an extension of the First Reduction for the period September 1,
2016 through December 31, 2016.
