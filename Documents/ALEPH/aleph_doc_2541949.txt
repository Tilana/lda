EXPLANATORY NOTE
This Form 10-QSB/A has been amended principally to reflect certain corrections to the financial
statements included in the Company’s Form 10-QSB filed on October 4, 2005.  These financial
statement  corrections  relate  to:  (i)  a  recalculation  of  the  earnings  per  share  included  in  the
Consolidated  Income  Statement;  (ii)  reclassification  of  the  Gain  on  Reduction  of  Debt  of
Discontinued Subsidiary from a line item within the Continuing Operations section to a separate
line  item  of  the  Consolidated  Income  Statement;  (iii)  to  include  disclosure  relating  to  the
Company  curing  the  deficiencies  in  its  reporting  obligations  under  NASD  Rule  6530  as  a
consequence of which the Company was re-listed to be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin
Board.   Certain minor textual modifications have also been made herein.

RECOV ENERGY CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2005
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
RECOV Energy, Corp., f/k/a Interactive Multimedia Network, Inc. (the “Company”) was organized
in the State of New Jersey on March 04, 1994 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware on
September 13, 1995.  The name of the Company changed to RECOV Energy, Corp. effective
March 29, 2005. The Company is a shell company that is actively seeking a potential merger or
acquisition candidate.
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-QSB of Regulation S-B. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete
financial  statements.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  such  interim  statements  reflect  all
adjustments  (consisting  of  normal  recurring  accruals)  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial
position  and  the  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  for  the  interim  periods  presented.  The
results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected  for  the  year  ending  March  31,  2006.  These  financial  statements  should  be  read  in
conjunction  with  the  audited  financial  statements  and  footnotes  included  in  the  Company's
annual report on Form 10-KSB/A-2 for the year ended March 31, 2005.
The Company had two subsidiaries:  AutoSmart USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation and AutoSmart
USA Leasing, Inc., a Florida corporation, which operate in tandem the vehicle sales operations of
the  Company.    During  the  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2002,  these  two  subsidiaries  ceased
operations.
RECOV Energy, Corp. prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting;
consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are
recognized when incurred. Financial statement items are recorded at historical cost and may not
necessarily represent current values.
The applicable opening balances in the stockholders' equity accounts were restated to reflect the
reverse stock split.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-
owned  subsidiaries.    All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period.  Certain amounts included in the financial statements are estimated based on
currently  available  information  and  management’s  judgment  as  to  the  outcome  of  future
conditions  and  circumstances.    Changes  in  the  status  of  certain  facts  or  circumstances  could
result in material changes to the estimates used in the preparation of financial statements and
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions.  Every effort is made to ensure the
integrity of such estimates.
Fair value of Financial Instruments
The  carrying  amounts  reported  in  the  balance  sheet  for  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts
receivable,  other  receivables,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities
approximate  fair  value  because  of  the  immediate  or  short-term  maturity  of  these  financial
instruments.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
Property and Equipment
Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.    Depreciation  is

The cost of fixed assets retired or sold, together with the related accumulated depreciation, are
removed from the appropriate asset and depreciation accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is
included  in  operations.    Maintenance  and  repairs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Repairs  and
maintenance  are  charged

Revenue Recognition
Revenues  are  principally  from  services  and  commissions  from  providing  marketing  plans,
services  related  to  the  Internet  marketing  arena  and  sales  from  health  related  products.
  Revenues  from  marketing  and  Internet  related  activity  are  recognized  when  the  services  are
completed.  Revenues from the sale of health related products are recognized when the products
are shipped to the customer.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin  No.  101  (“SAB  101”),  “Revenue  Recognition,”  which  provides  guidance  on  the
recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC.
 SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance
for  disclosures  related  to  revenue  recognition  policies.    Management  believes  that  RECOV
Energy, Corp.’s revenue recognition practices are in conformity with the guidelines of SAB 101.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.  There was no advertising expense for the
three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2005
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
Earnings (Loss) per Share of Common Stock
Earnings  (Loss)  per  common  share  are  calculated  under  the  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  128,
“Earnings per Share,” which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings (loss)
per share.  SFAS No. 128 requires the Company to report both basic earnings (loss) per share,
which  is  based  on  the  weighted-average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  during  the
period, and diluted earnings (loss) per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding plus all potential dilutive common shares outstanding.  Options and
warrants  have  not  been  considered  in  calculating  diluted  earnings  (loss)  per  share  since
considering such items would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Statement of Cash Flows
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, as applicable, the Company considers all highly
liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
The  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (SFAS)  No.  141,  “Business
Combinations,” was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in July 2001.
 This Statement establishes standards for accounting and reporting for business combinations.
  This  statement  requires  the  purchase  method  of  accounting  to  be  used  for  all  business
combinations,  and  prohibits  the  pooling-of-interests  method  of  accounting.    This  Statement  is
effective for all business combinations initiated after September 30, 2001 and supercedes APB
Opinion  No.  16,  “Business  Combinations”  as  well  as  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  38,  “Accounting 
for  Preacquisition
Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises.”  The adoption of this statement by the Company did
not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.
The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets,”  was  issued  by  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  in  July
2001.  This Statement addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition.  This
statement requires goodwill amortization to cease and for goodwill to be periodically reviewed for
impairment, for fiscal years beginning after October 31, 2001.  SFAS No. 142 supercedes APB
Opinion No. 17, “Intangible Assets.” The adoption of this statement by the Company did not have
a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.
The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement  Obligation,”  was  issued  by  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  in
August  2001.    This  Statement  requires  companies  to  record  a  liability  for  asset  retirement
obligations in the period in which they are incurred, which typically could be upon completion or
shortly thereafter.  The FASB decided to limit the scope to legal obligation and the liability will be
recorded at fair value.  The adoption of this statement by the Company did not have a material
impact on its financial condition or results of operations.
The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment  or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,”  was  issued  by  the  Financial  Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) in October 2001.  This Statement provides a single accounting model
for  long-lived  assets  to  be  disposed  of  and  replaces  SFAS  No.  121  “Accounting  for  the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.”  This Statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of this statement by
the Company did not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

NOTE 4 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - LITIGATION
The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings.  In October 2001, the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiaries, AutoSmart USA, Inc. and AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc. ceased operations.
 AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc. et. al. are currently the defendants in one lawsuit in which the total
amount being requested for recovery is approximately $175,000, plus legal fees and interest.
AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc has no assets and the corporation was administratively dissolved
pursuant to Florida law on October 4, 2002.  To the best of management's knowledge and belief,
should  the  plaintiff  in  this  lawsuit  prevail  against  AutoSmart  Leasing  USA,  Inc.  or  the  other
named defendants, the ultimate outcome of this matter would have no effect on the Company.
Further due to the dissolution of both of these subsidiaries, pursuant to applicable state law, the
Company has been advised by counsel that it has no liability for any unpaid obligations of either
company. (See Note 11).
NOTE 5 – GOING CONCERN
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  assuming  the  Company  will
continue as a going concern. The Company has sustained continuing operating losses and has
net working capital and shareholders’ equity deficits at June 30, 2005.  Currently the Company
has no operating business or source of revenue.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.    Management  anticipates  that  additional
investments  will  be  needed  to  develop  an  effective  sales  and  marketing  program  before  the
organization  will  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  from  operations  to  meet  current  operating
expenses and overhead. Management has continued to develop a strategic plan to develop a
management team, maintain reporting compliance and seek new expansive areas in marketing
through  multiple  media  channels.  Management  intends  to  seek  new  capital  from  new  equity
security issuances that will provide funds needed to increase liquidity, fund internal growth, and
fully implement its business plan. There is no assurance that management will be successful in
these endeavors.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 6 –  SUBSIDIARY RELATED TRANSACTIONS
In October 2001 the Company ceased operations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Auto Smart
USA, Inc. (a Nevada corp.) and AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc. (a Florida corp.)  After not receiving
a timely annual report for the corporation, the state of Nevada revoked the corporate charter of
Auto  Smart  USA,  Inc.  in  December  of  1999.    This  revoked  status  subsequently  became
permanent.  On October 4, 2002, AutoSmart USA Leasing, Inc. was administratively dissolved
pursuant to Florida law, for failure to file an annual report.
The  Company’s  legal  counsel  has  advised  the  Company  that  the  shareholders  of  an
administratively  dissolved  Florida  corporation  are  not  responsible  for  the  debts  of  that
corporation.    Management  has  applied  this  same  premise  to  the  Nevada  corporation  and
considers the effect of the administrative dissolutions to be the equivalent of legal releases.  The
Company  did  not  initially  de-recognize  these  liabilities,  consisting  of  various  third  party  trade
payables and certain other accruals, from its consolidated balance sheet due to the possibility
that the trade creditors of the two subsidiaries might attempt to pierce their corporate veils and
proceed against the Company or its corporate predecessor.
During the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, management determined that this
contingency was removed with respect to $882,812 of the liabilities of these two subsidiaries and
the Company de-recognized aggregate liabilities in this amount.
Management’s determination was based on: (i) the settlement of two outstanding lawsuits; in one
the Company was a named party and in the other, the applicable debt was guaranteed by an
officer  of  the  Company,  whose  guarantee  had  been  given  in  furtherance  of  the  subsidiary’s
business while it was operating, (ii) there then being no other matters naming the Company with
respect  to  either  subsidiary  then  pending,  and  (iii)  no  claims  had  been  brought  against  the
Company  with  respect  to  the  trade  liabilities  of  either  company.    Accordingly  management
determined that the likelihood of a trade or other creditor coming forward at that date and then
successfully piercing either corporate veil was remote.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2005 it was determined that $221,160 of debt principal and
accrued interest included in the first quarter write-off should not have been de-recognized and the
gain originally taken in the first quarter was reduced by that amount.
The corrected amounts applicable to the first quarter of fiscal 2005 have been disclosed in Note
11  –  Restatement  and  Fourth  Quarter  Adjustments,  together  with  other  disclosures  related
thereto.    The  net  credit  arising  from  the  elimination  of  these  liabilities  from  the  Company’s
consolidated balance sheet is reported as a gain on the statement of operations due to the fact
that the release of the liabilities is based on Florida and Nevada statutes and that none of the
liabilities involved were due to related parties.
On February 17, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to divest itself of Best Health, Inc.
and SoySlim. This was effectuated by declaring and issuing a stock dividend on March 28, 2005
to all shareholders of record on February 17, 2005. To accomplish this divestiture, the shares
owned by the Company were returned to its subsidiaries.  Concurrently Best Health, Inc. and
SoySlim,  Corp.  each  issued  one  share  of  its  own  common  stock  to  each  shareholder  of  the
Company on a one to one basis. The Company incurred a net loss of $10,841 on the divestiture
of these two subsidiaries.
NOTE 7 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

the  former  President  of  the  Company  and  the  former  President  of  the  Company  has  loaned
money to the Company.  There were no loans to this party during the three month period ended
June 30, 2005 and the year ended March 31, 2005.  The Company was obligated to the former
President for notes payable and accrued interest of $259,899 and $255,935 as of June 30, 2005

pursuant to an exemption under S ection 4(2) to its president for services to be rendered for the
period from April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006.  This issuance was made in contemplation of
the  negotiations  with  the  Company’s  then  acquisition  target  Carbon  Recovery  Corporation,
concurrent  with  these  ongoing  negotiations  and  the  due  diligence  necessitated  by  such  an
acquisition.  It  was  a  condition  precedent  to  the  potential  closing  of  that  acquisition  that  these
shares would be returned to treasury and cancelled.  The president returned such shares to the

determined that these shares were still outstanding and had not been cancelled.  Additionally, it
was determined that pursuant to Delaware corporate law these shares were in fact not validly
issued.  Delaware corporate law does not allow shares to be issued in futuro which was the case
in this issuance. The shares were returned to the transfer agent for cancellation on September
26, 2005 and returned to the Company treasury.
Paid in Capital
The  Company  recognized  an  increase  in  paid-in  capital  for  the  amount  of  imputed  interest
expense  related  to  the  beneficial  conversion  feature  of  its  convertible  demand  notes  and  the
value of rent contributed by Verdiramo and Verdiramo, P.A.
NOTE 9 – INCOME TAXES
The Company did not provide any current or deferred federal or state income tax provision or
benefit for the periods ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, due to operating losses incurred since
inception.  The  Company  has  provided  a  full  valuation  allowance  on  the  deferred  tax  asset,
consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of the uncertainty regarding its
realizability.
NOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - OTHER
The Company had acquired two products from another entity. Under the terms governing these
purchases, the Company had to fund the development of these products. The Company has not
been able to meet its obligations so it returned all rights title and interest in these products to the

obligations associated with these two products.

$436,897.  The  income  per  share  for  that  quarter,  as  adjusted  is  $0.669,  compared  to  the
previously reported amount of $1.254.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
Results of Operations
On  August  16,  2005  the  Company  discontinued  its  negotiations  to  acquire  Carbon  Recovery
Corporation.  The negotiations had reached an impasse and management determined that the
continued  negotiations  and  discussions  would  not  have  resulted  in  the  consummation  of  the
acquisition.  The Company is continuing its search for potential merger candidates.
Three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004
During  the  three  month  period  ending  June  30,  2005,  the  Company  incurred  a  loss  from
operations of $67,447 compared to a loss of $3,595 for the same period ended June 30, 2004.
 The main component contributing to this increase was an increase in consulting services.
Additionally,  the  Company  recognized  a  Gain  on  the  Reduction  of  Debt  of  a  Discontinued
Subsidiary of $440,492. This was an extraordinary item associated with the Company’s former
AutoSmart subsidiaries.
Revenues
During the three month period ending June 30, 2005, the Company’s revenues from operations
$-0- compared to $1,052 for the same period ended June 30, 2004.  This decrease was the result
of  the  Company  having  spun  off  its  two  subsidiaries  as  a  stock  dividend  to  its  shareholders
effective March 28, 2005. Revenues for the period ended June 30, 2004 were from the provision
of marketing services which are recognized when the services are completed.
Operating Expenses
During  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2005,  the  Company  incurred  $67,447  in  operating
expenses from operations as compared to $4,647 in the same period in 2004. This increase was
due to an increase in Selling, General and Administrative expenses of $15,215 during the three
month  period  ended  June  30,  2005  compared  to  the  same  period  ended  June  30,  2004.
Additionally, there was an increase in consulting expenses of $53,700 during the three month
period ended June 30 2005 compared to the same period ended June 30, 2004.
Material changes in financial condition, liquidity and capital resources
At June 30, 2005, the Company had $ -0- in cash and cash equivalents compared to $38 in cash
at March 31, 2005.  The Company had a negative working capital of approximately $402,815 at
June 30, 2005.  The Company currently has no revenue producing operations.  The Company
has reviewed all non-essential activities and expenditures and has aggressively curtailed these
items to assist in reducing the cash used in operating activities.
Item 3.   Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The  Registrant’s  President  and  Principal  Accounting  Officer  (both  the  same  person)  has
evaluated the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days of the original filing
date of this quarterly report.  Based upon this evaluation, the Registrant’s President and principal
Accounting Officer then concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed is included in the reports
that it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
As  a  result  of  the  corrections  that  were  required  to  be  made  to  the  Company’s  financial
statements included in the Form 10-KSB/A – 2 filed on October 4, 2005, the Company’s certifying
officer  determined  that  the  Company’s  system  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  had  not
been effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed was included in the
reports  that  had  been  filed  with  the  SEC.    The  Company  had  retained  the  services  of  an
accounting and reporting consultant, familiar with SEC regulations, to assist it in preparing that
filing.  The Company’s certifying officer now concludes that its system of disclosure controls and
procedures, as modified to include the use of such consulting services, is effective in ensuring
that material information required to
15
be  disclosed  is  included  in  the  reports  that  it  files  with  the  SEC.    The  Company  is  currently
seeking a qualified person with experience in audit procedures and SEC filing to fill the position
of CFO as a consultant and eliminate the need for the current CEO/CFO to provide both services.
The Company believes that the utilization of a CFO consultant is a cost-effective way for a shell
company  with  limited  resources  to  maintain  an  adequate  system  of  disclosure  controls  and
procedures.    At  such  future  time,  if  any,  that  the  Company  is  able  to  effect  a  merger  with  an
operating  company,  the  Company  expects  that  such  company  will  either  have  the  requisite
financial reporting professional(s) already employed on a full-time basis or the resources to do
so.
There were no other significant changes in the Registrant’s internal controls or, to the knowledge
of the management of the Registrant, in other factors that could significantly affect these controls
subsequent to the evaluation date.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.
The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings.
The  Company's  discontinued  subsidiary  AutoSmart  Leasing  USA,  Inc.,  is  a  party  to  in  one
lawsuit:  SunTrust Bank v. AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc., William Auletta, et al., Case No. 02-
6512 (08) Complaint over $15,000, 17th Judicial Circuit, Broward County.  This case is open and
pending.  The total prayer for relief is $175,000 plus legal fees and interest.  This case relates to
certain automotive sales related transactions between AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc. and certain
automotive dealerships and lenders. This case does not name the Company as a party.
AutoSmart Leasing USA, Inc has no assets and the corporation was administratively dissolved
pursuant to Florida law on October 4, 2002.  To the best of management's knowledge and belief,
should  the  plaintiff  in  this  lawsuit  prevail  against  AutoSmart  Leasing  USA,  Inc.  or  the  other
named defendants, the ultimate outcome of this matter would have no effect on the Company.
Item 2.  Changes in Securities.
During the period ended June 30, 2005, the Company issued 2,422,666 shares of free trading
common stock, in conversion of $44,819 of convertible notes payable.  The conversion price was
$0.0185 per share.  The Company received an opinion from counsel that the shares issued in
these transactions were free trading.
During  the  period  ended  June  30,  2005,  the  Company  issued  6,100,000  restricted  shares
pursuant to an exemption under S ection 4(2) to its president for services to be rendered for the
period from April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006.  This issuance was made in contemplation of
the  negotiations  with  the  Company’s  then  acquisition  target  Carbon  Recovery  Corporation,
concurrent  with  these  ongoing  negotiations  and  the  due  diligence  necessitated  by  such  an
acquisition.  It  was  a  condition  precedent  to  the  potential  closing  of  that  acquisition  that  these
shares would be returned to treasury and cancelled.  The president returned such shares to the
Company  in  anticipation  of  their  cancellation  but  do  to  the  protracted  duration  of  these
negotiations  these  shares  remained  issued  and  un-cancelled  until  the  current  period  when
during  the  preparation  of  the  Form  10-QSB  for  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2005  it  was
determined that these shares were still outstanding and had not been cancelled.  Additionally, it
was determined that pursuant to Delaware corporate law these shares were in fact not validly
issued.  Delaware corporate law does not allow shares to be issued in futuro which was the case
in this issuance. The shares were returned to the transfer agent for cancellation on September
26, 2005 for return to the Company treasury.

Item 5.  Other Information.
Effective September 26, 2005, the Company’s common stock was de-listed from the Over the
Counter  Bulletin  Board  and  is  currently  listed  on  the  Pink  Sheets  under  the  trading  symbol
“RCOV”.  The  Company  failed  to  comply  with  NASD  6530  due  to  its  not  being  current  in  its
periodic  reporting  obligations.    This  reporting  deficiency  was  caused  by  the  lapse  of  time
required to adequately amend its Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended March 31,
2005  in  response  to  a  letter  of  comments  received  by  the  Company  from  the  Staff  of  the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The time needed to amend the annual report resulted in
the Company being unable to file that report as well as its Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB for
the quarter ended June 30, 2005 prior to the NASD’s required compliance date.
On September 26, 2005 the Company did file its amended annual report on Form 10 KSB/A for
the  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2005.    The  Company  subsequently  amended  that  F  orm  10
KSB/A with the Form 10 KSB/A – 2 which was filed on October 4, 2005.  The filing of that Form
10-KSB and the Form 10-QSB on October 4, 2005 satisfied the reporting deficiency under NASD
6530.
On October 26, 2005 the Company was re-listed on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under
the trading symbol ‘RCOV”.
