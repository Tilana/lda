<p><b>  Annual report of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
Conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict presents her activities undertaken in discharging her mandate, 
including information on her field visits and on the progress achieved with regard to the 
signing of action plans, in addition to challenges remaining on the children and armed 
conflict agenda. The report covers the period from May 2011 to May 2012. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative acknowledges the progress made since the previous 
reporting period with regard to accountability for perpetrators of attacks on schools and 
hospitals through the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1998 (2011), and with 
regard to a system of deterrence for perpetrators of violations against children through the 
first judgement of the International Criminal Court on the war crime of recruitment and use 
of children. She also acknowledges the progress made with regard to the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the signing of 
action plans to release children from armed groups.  
</p>
<p> This progress notwithstanding, the Special Representative is concerned about the 
continued impunity of violating parties and delays in the development of action plans for 
the release of children in some countries. She also discusses other child protection issues, 
such as the restoration of children&#8217;s rights through reparations and protective measures to 
prevent children&#8217;s association with armed forces and groups. Moreover, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative highlights the growing trend of killing and maiming children through the 
use of explosive weapons in populated areas.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 * The annexes to the present document are reproduced as received, in the language of submission only. 
</p>

<p> Lastly, the Special Representative outlines a series of recommendations addressed to 
States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States that are under review of 
the Human Rights Council universal periodic review mechanism, the Human Rights 
Council and Member States to further the protection of children&#8217;s rights.

  other situations, bearing in mind other violations and abuses committed against children ..............  22 </p>


<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, covering the period from May 2011 to May 2012, is submitted 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51/77 and other subsequent resolutions of the 
Assembly on the rights of the child, including its most recent resolution 66/141, in which 
the Assembly requested the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict to 
continue to submit a report to the Human Rights Council on the activities undertaken in the 
fulfilment of her mandate, including information on her field visits and on the progress 
achieved and the challenges remaining on the children and armed conflict agenda. 
</p>
<p>2. Armed conflict not only leads to violations of children&#8217;s human rights, but also 
deprives them of their basic socioeconomic rights. Conflict-affected countries and fragile 
States continue to lag behind in education and child mortality indicators, and the realization 
of other Millennium Development Goals. Children are disproportionately affected by this 
situation. Of the primary-school-age children in the world who are not enrolled in school, as 
many as two thirds live in such countries. In these contexts, children often voluntarily join 
armed forces and groups for lack of other options. Furthermore, thousands of children 
continue to be killed, maimed, abducted, subjected to sexual violence, denied humanitarian 
access and deprived of health care in many countries. Children were also subjected to 
arbitrary arrests, detention, torture and ill-treatment, and used as suicide bombers and 
human shields in several countries during the reporting period. 
 
3. The need to address impunity and bring to justice those most responsible for 
violations of children&#8217;s rights in situations of armed conflict continues to be a central 
concern of the Office of the Special Representative. Since the Special Representative&#8217;s 
previous report (A/HRC/18/38), significant progress has been made in efforts to end 
impunity for perpetrators of grave violations against children, as illustrated by the<b> </b>first 
judgement of the International Criminal Court on the war crime of recruitment and use of 
children. Progress has also continued with regard to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which has been 
ratified by 147 countries. Impunity remains widespread, however, and holding persistent 
perpetrators to account must be an utmost priority for the international community. The 
Human Rights Council is also a leading partner in ensuring that States apply the 
international norms and standards that protect children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Representative welcomes the adoption by the Human Rights Council of 
its resolution 18/12 on human rights in the administration of justice, in particular juvenile 
justice. She especially appreciates the call on States to develop and implement a 
comprehensive juvenile justice policy with a view to promoting the use of alternative 
measures, such as diversion and restorative justice. She wishes to stress the need to ensure 
that, if children associated with armed forces and groups are arrested, detained or 
imprisoned, they should be separated from adults, to the greatest extent feasible. She also 
stresses the importance of including rehabilitation and reintegration strategies for child 
perpetrators in juvenile justice policies with a view to their assuming a constructive role in 
society. Lastly, she wishes to highlight the importance of tackling the specific issue of 
juvenile justice for children affected by armed conflict, in particular those children formerly 
or allegedly associated with armed groups. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Representative also appreciates the adoption of resolution 19/37 on the 
rights of the child, in which the Council condemned in the strongest terms all violations 
committed against children in armed conflict and urged all parties to end such violations 
and to seek to end impunity for perpetrators. She welcomes the call upon States to endorse 
the Paris Commitments to protect children from recruitment or use by armed forces or </p>


<p>armed groups, to take special measures to protect children in contact with the law, and to 
take all feasible measures to ensure the release and reintegration of children used in armed 
conflicts and to implement effective measures for their rehabilitation and reintegration into 
society.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Representative also appreciates the adoption of resolutions 19/9, on 
birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition everywhere as a person before the 
law, and 17/18, on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
communications procedure, under which individuals or groups of individuals, including 
children themselves, who claim to be victims of violations under the Convention and its two 
optional protocols will be able to submit communications to the Committee for 
examination. <b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Working with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Office of the Special Representative continues to work in close collaboration 
with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
with a view to mainstreaming child rights issues relating to armed conflict in the work of 
human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review of the Human Rights 
Council, the treaty bodies and the special procedures. Furthermore, recommendations 
pertaining to the issue of children and armed conflict by United Nations human rights 
mechanisms continue to be important advocacy tools in the work of the Special 
Representative. 
</p>
<p>8. The field presence of OHCHR and its deployment of human rights officers to 
peacekeeping operations and political missions, such as in Colombia and Nepal, also 
continue to make an important contribution to the monitoring and reporting of grave 
violations against children during armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Representative attaches great importance to the process for reporting to 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the implementation of the Optional Protocol on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict. During the period under review, the Office of 
the Special Representative provided information relevant to the issue of children and armed 
conflict to the Committee, in particular ahead of the Committee&#8217;s country reviews for the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar and Thailand. The Office is pleased that its 
concerns were reflected in the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations and will continue to 
use the relevant observations of the Committee for its advocacy purposes. The Office 
encourages States parties to the Convention to implement the recommendations of the 
Committee as a matter of priority and to submit timely reports under the Optional Protocol 
to the Committee. 
</p>
<p>10. The Office of the Special Representative has also submitted input to the universal 
periodic review on Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and intends to submit information on the Central 
African Republic, Colombia and Mali for consideration by the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review during its upcoming sessions. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Representative reiterates the recommendation made in her previous 
report (A/HRC/18/38), in which she encouraged the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review to systematically take into account the concluding observations made by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child when reviewing a State submission. The Special 
Representative urges States parties to accord priority to the implementation of relevant 
recommendations of the Working Group, with the assistance of the international community 
as needed. </p>


<p>12. The Special Representative reiterates her call to all special procedures mandate 
holders, during their missions and in their reports and recommendations, to take into 
account the challenges faced by children insofar as they are relevant to their respective 
mandates, and to bring those concerns to her attention.  
</p>
<p>13. When considering or adopting resolutions on country-specific situations or thematic 
issues, the Human Rights Council is encouraged to include recommendations on or 
references to the protection of children affected by armed conflict. Several Council 
resolutions during the period under review included such references, including resolutions 
S-17-1 and S-18-1, on the Syrian Arab Republic, in which the Council strongly condemned 
the extensive violations of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Progress and challenges in addressing grave violations 
against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>14. Since the previous report of the Special Representative, progress has been made 
towards the protection of children in armed conflict. On 12 July 2011, the Security Council 
adopted resolution 1998 (2011), in which it requested the Secretary-General to include in 
the annexes to his reports on children and armed conflict perpetrators of recurrent attacks on 
schools and/or hospitals and recurrent attacks or threats of attacks against protected 
personnel in relation to such facilities. The Security Council also called for such 
perpetrators to prepare, without delay, time-bound action plans to halt those violations and 
abuses. It also reiterated its determination to ensure respect for its resolutions on children 
and armed conflict, including by enhancing communications between the Working Group 
on Children and Armed Conflict and the sanctions committees.  
</p>
<p>15. In the same month, following a briefing by the Special Representative on the 
situation of conflict-affected children in Somalia, the Security Council Committee pursuant 
to resolutions 751 (1992) and 1907 (2009) concerning Somalia and Eritrea expanded its 
sanctions designation criteria to include grave violations against children, including 
recruitment and use, killing and maiming, sexual violence, abductions, attacks on schools 
and hospitals and forced displacement in Somalia. This brings to four the number of 
sanctions committees that have designation criteria pertaining to grave violations against 
children (C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and the Sudan).  
</p>
<p>16. Since the previous report of the Special Representative, the child protection 
commitments made by the Governments of Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, 
Chad, Somalia and South Sudan have been translated into specific actions by these parties. 
New action plans to cease the recruitment and use of children and to secure their release 
were signed by the United Nations and the Chadian National Army on 15 June 2011, the 
Central African Arm&#233;e populaire pour la restauration de la d&#233;mocratie (APRD) on 22 
October 2011, the Central African Convention des patriotes pour la justice et la paix (CPJP) 
on 20 November 2011 and the Sudan&#8217;s People&#8217;s Liberation Army on 13 March 2012, 
respectively. 
</p>
<p>17. In Nepal, the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist took the measures required 
for full compliance with its action plan by suspending payments, ceasing the provision of 
housing and encouraging disqualified minors to register for reintegration programmes. In 
Sri Lanka, the Government investigated the whereabouts of the remaining children 
allegedly associated with the faction led by Iniya Bharati, thus entering into compliance 
with its commitments under its action plan. In November 2011, during the visit of the 
Special Representative to Somalia, the Transitional Federal Government reconfirmed its 
commitment to negotiating an action plan to release girls and boys within the ranks of the 
Government forces and allied militias and began working with the United Nations towards </p>


<p>that goal. In Myanmar, negotiations with the Government towards the signing of an action 
plan to end the recruitment and use of children in the armed forces, including the integrated 
border guard forces, are in their final phase, and the prompt signing of an action plan is 
expected. 
</p>
<p>18. There has also been progress in the protection of children abducted across borders 
by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA), with the establishment by the Uganda People&#8217;s 
Defence Force in May 2011 of standard operating procedures for the reception and 
handover of children and women separated from LRA in the Central African Republic, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan, which stipulate that all children 
separated from LRA in the custody of the Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Force must be handed 
over to child protection actors within seven days. 
</p>
<p>19. The progress made notwithstanding, significant challenges in addressing grave 
violations against children remain. Impunity for grave crimes perpetrated against children 
remains<b> </b>a serious challenge. The Special Representatives notes with great concern the 
growing list of persistent perpetrators of grave violations against children, with 32 parties 
to conflict having been listed by the Secretary-General for at least five years. More must 
be done to enforce compliance with international obligations and to address factors that 
undermine efforts to combat impunity, such as the lack of political will, weak legal and 
judicial infrastructures, and the insufficient allocation or absence of<b> </b>resources and 
expertise to conduct investigations and prosecutions.  
</p>
<p>20. Obstacles to dialogue for the development of action plans between the United 
Nations and non-State armed groups continue to persist. These include lack of access to 
armed groups and of political will, fragmentation within armed groups or the inability to 
identify perpetrators and hold groups accountable for violations committed. Countries 
affected by these constraints include Afghanistan, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, the Philippines, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.  
</p>
<p>21. The lack of economic opportunities and insufficient long-term funding continue to 
hamper the reintegration of children formerly associated with armed forces and groups. 
This is the case in the Central African Republic, Chad and the Philippines, for example, 
where many children remain associated with armed actors through their communities. In 
many countries, continuing fighting and insecurity make children vulnerable to 
rerecruitment and limit the access of actors delivering reintegration support.  
</p>
<p>22. An additional challenge lies in ensuring that timely and reliable information on 
grave violations against children is available in emerging crises. During the reporting 
period, such challenges arose in Libya, Mali and the Syrian Arab Republic. The Special 
Representative would welcome a dialogue with all United Nations partners on how to 
better address the situation of children in rapidly evolving conflicts. She also stresses the 
need for the early deployment of specific child protection capacity.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. First judgement of the International Criminal Court on the 
war crime of recruitment and use of children 
</b></p>
<p>23. On 14 March 2012, the International Criminal Court delivered its verdict in the case 
<i>The</i> <i>Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</i>, convicting Thomas Lubanga of the crimes of 
conscripting and enlisting children under the age of 15 years into the Forces patriotiques 
pour la lib&#233;ration du Congo and using them to participate actively in hostilities. The Court&#8217;s 
first judgement on the issue of child recruitment constitutes important international 
jurisprudence for future cases. In 2008, the Special Representative testified as an expert 
witness before the Court and submitted an amicus curiae brief providing clarification on the </p>


<p>terms &#8213;conscripting and enlisting children&#8214; and &#8213;using them to participate actively in 
hostilities&#8214;. Both interpretations adopted by the Court allow for greater protection for all 
children associated with armed forces or armed groups. 
</p>
<p>24. Trial Chamber I accepted the approach taken by the Pre-Trial Chamber and 
suggested by the Special Representative, according to which both conscription and 
enlistment are forms of recruitment, in that they refer to the incorporation of a boy or a girl 
under the age of 15 years into an armed group, whether coercively or voluntarily. The 
Special Representative argued in her brief to the Court that the distinction between 
voluntary enlistment and forced recruitment was a distinction without meaning, as even the 
most voluntary of acts could be a desperate attempt to survive by children with a limited 
number of options. In such circumstances, any consent given by a child could not be 
regarded as truly voluntary in the full sense of the word. Whether the child enlisted or was 
conscripted, the line between voluntary and involuntary recruitment was legally irrelevant 
and practically superficial in the context of children&#8217;s association with armed forces or 
armed groups in times of conflict. 
</p>
<p>25. The Chamber also decided to apply a broad interpretation of the term &#8213;participate 
actively in hostilities&#8214; to ensure justice and protection for all children associated with armed 
forces or armed groups. The Court held that the term included a wide range of individuals, 
from those on the front line (who participated directly) to the boys and girls who were 
involved in multiple roles that supported the combatants. The Court further refined that 
interpretation, using a case-by-case determination and adopting a double test: whether 
support was given and whether the support provided to the combatants exposed the child to 
real danger as a potential target. The Chamber made a clear distinction between the term 
&#8213;direct participation in hostilities&#8214;, which determines combatant status under international 
humanitarian law, and the term &#8213;actively participating in hostilities&#8214;, which is the criteria 
applicable to the use of children in hostilities, holding that the latter was to be interpreted 
broadly, and without conferring combatant status on those children.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Reparations for children and </b>the restoration of children&#8217;s 
<b>rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. Where children are concerned, justice includes far more than punishing a 
perpetrator. Equally important are measures to restore children&#8217;s rights and an element of 
reparation to address the loss of their childhood, family, education and livelihood. For 
various reasons, only a small proportion of children who have suffered harm during armed 
conflict are likely to participate as victims or witnesses in trials before a national or 
international court. Access to justice for children in conflict and post-conflict situations 
should therefore take place through both judicial and non-judicial processes. For many 
children in these situations, non-judicial mechanisms such as reparations can provide more 
immediate accountability, foster community reconciliation and allow children to move on 
with their lives. There are, however, significant challenges to the implementation of non-
judicial mechanisms, such as the lack of financial and human resources, the victims&#8217; 
expectations and the need for long-term political support. 
</p>
<p>27. Reparations are intended to acknowledge the suffering of victims and harm inflicted 
upon them, and to provide compensation, restitution and redress for violations, with the aim 
of returning victims to their previous condition to the maximum extent possible. The 
principles underlying reparations can be found in the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the 
Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (2005), which were 
adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 60/147. According to the Basic Principles 
and Guidelines, States must, as required under international law, ensure that their domestic </p>


<p>law is consistent with their international legal obligations by making available adequate, 
effective, prompt and appropriate remedies to victims, including reparations, defining them 
as restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. 
Reparations can take various forms and may be individual, collective and/or community-
based. The effectiveness of any form of reparations is limited when the objective is only to 
return victims to the situation that existed before the violations, without addressing 
underlying gender inequalities and pre-existing discriminatory practices. 
</p>
<p>28. The conviction of Thomas Lubanga by the International Criminal Court not only set 
an important international precedent in terms of the war crime of recruiting and using 
children, but may also constitute a significant contribution to the development and 
definition of the right to reparations in international human rights law and customary 
international humanitarian law. Article 75 (1) of the Rome Statute requires the Court to 
establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims of war crimes and 
crimes against humanity, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation. The Court&#8217;s 
upcoming decision on reparations in the <i>Lubanga</i> case could strengthen the existing 
recognition of the right to reparations, as described in regional and international human 
rights law, including article 39 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>29. The International Criminal Court is the first international tribunal to include 
reparations to victims of war crimes in its mandate. It established the Trust Fund for 
Victims, which is tasked to provide general assistance in the form of physical rehabilitation, 
material support and psychosocial counselling to victims of international crimes in countries 
where the Court has jurisdiction, and to implement Court-ordered reparation awards. The 
Trust Fund has introduced an innovative approach to reparations in two ways: it is not 
linked to any specific case before the Court and supports victims both individually and 
collectively; and it is financed through basket funding from States and voluntary donations, 
which means that reparations are not limited to the financial means of the convicted person. 
Following the judgement in the <i>Lubanga</i> case, the Court and the Trust Fund will deal with 
legal and practical questions on the implementation of the reparations mandate, which may 
have implications for the larger child protection community. 
</p>
<p>30. Previous experience with reparations for children, either administrative or court-
ordered, has been limited. Past and present initiatives provide useful lessons learned and a 
sense of the challenges ahead. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, for 
example, was the first ad hoc and hybrid court mandated to order reparations to victims, 
albeit only of a collective and symbolic nature. The Special Court for Sierra Leone had no 
mandate to award reparations. Instead, the Government established an administrative 
reparations programme on the basis of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Resource 
limitations, however, have put a significant strain on the implementation of this reparations 
process. In Colombia, in the framework of the Justice and Peace Act, the Supreme Court 
ordered reparations to child victims of forced recruitment in the case against Freddy Rend&#243;n 
Herrera, alias &#8213;<i>El Alem&#225;n</i>&#8214;, who was accused of unlawful recruitment. The Court 
considered the needs and experience of each victim, in particular girls, to be different, and 
decided to focus on individual rehabilitation measures rather than collective material 
reparations. 
</p>
<p>31. The experiences of a significantly larger number of victims, and the loss and harm 
resulting from a wider range of violations, can be acknowledged and repaired through 
reparations programmes. Any decision on reparations should avoid an overly narrow 
definition of victims and their eligibility and not limit the violations allowing for 
reparations. It is important to include those victims who have not participated in court 
proceedings, maintaining an open list of applicants and conducting a series of registration 
periods. In deciding who is eligible for reparations, however, the limited human and 
financial resources must be taken into account. Priority should therefore be accorded to the </p>


<p>immediate and direct victims of the crime and their families, including the victims of forced 
recruitment and the victims and families of the crimes committed by the armed group. 
Moreover, an assessment of the current needs of the victims is crucial as several years may 
have passed since the events took place. 
</p>
<p>32. Any reparations process should consist of a combination of reparative measures, 
including individual, collective and community-based initiatives. The range of reparations 
spans from material (such as cash payments, access to education and health care, and skills 
training) to symbolic (such as public acknowledgements and memorials). For various 
reasons, lump-sum payments may not be the ideal form of reparations. Violations of 
children&#8217;s rights most often lead to lost opportunities, such as loss of schooling, family and 
livelihood. Accordingly, other reparation benefits, such as education programmes, physical 
rehabilitation, skills training and the provision of psychosocial support may be more 
restorative alternatives. In addition, community-based reparations, with a focus on 
reconciliation, may help to reduce tensions within and across communities. In this context, a 
project-based approach, involving communities in livelihood and infrastructure initiatives, 
may be a useful option, but should avoid overlap with regular development programmes. 
</p>
<p>33. Reparations programmes should bear in mind that victims who were children at the 
time of the commission of the violation may face stigmatization or marginalization as 
former child soldiers or forced wives, leading to the social exclusion of, in particular, girl 
child soldiers. Community members may also resent former child soldiers, who they feel 
are being rewarded for having taken part in hostilities, thus reinforcing existing divisions. 
The child perpetrator dilemma tends to be confusing for both the child and those who may 
have been their victims. Reparations, however, could also assist in signalling that past 
modes of operation will no longer be tolerated and could contribute to dismantling the 
relationship between former commanders and their victims. A public statement by 
community leaders on the legal findings of responsibility, followed by an intensive 
awareness-raising campaign on the judgement and a declaration to the effect that child 
victims of recruitment should not be held legally or morally responsible for their actions as 
combatants during the conflict, would be the best guarantee of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Prevention of child recruitment 
</b></p>
<p>34. Children become associated with armed forces and groups for various reasons. In 
some situations, they are forcibly recruited or abducted by armed elements, or coerced 
and intimidated into joining them. Recruitment of children also takes place in the context 
of poverty, discrimination, revenge and loyalty to an ethnic, religious or tribal group. Often, 
insecurity and displacement propel children, especially those who have become separated 
from their families, to voluntarily join an armed group for protection and survival.  
</p>
<p>35. Given the complex set of factors influencing child recruitment, prevention strategies, 
to be successful, require a holistic approach and should be conducted by a variety of actors 
at the local, national and international levels. From a broad perspective, three prevention 
strategies can be identified: effective legal prevention mechanisms at the national level, 
strengthening community protection mechanisms at the local level, and providing children 
with alternatives.  
</p>
<p><b>  Development, dissemination and enforcement of the law 
</b></p>
<p>36. The criminalization of under-age recruitment and the domestication of international 
norms and standards against the recruitment and use of children are crucial measures for the 
prevention of under-age recruitment. It is crucial that States enact legislation to explicitly 
criminalize under-age recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups in their 
penal codes. Effective criminalization can be hindered by amnesties and de facto </p>


<p>immunities granted to members of armed forces suspected of serious human rights abuses 
and/or armed groups that will become part of a national army in the framework of a peace 
process. In developing legal provisions, care must be taken to ensure that amnesties are not 
applicable to individuals who recruit children. 
</p>
<p>37. Measures to foster the dissemination of the law are also critical for prevention. 
These may include the creation of child protection units in the military, which have played 
an important role in some countries. Educational training programmes to inform armed 
forces and groups of the legal protection for children during armed conflict are equally 
important in increasing awareness of and compliance with international norms. 
</p>
<p>38. At the national level, effective investigations and prosecutions are potentially 
powerful prevention tools but continue to be weak. The failure to investigate grave 
violations against children or to sanction those responsible is often linked to broader 
accountability issues. Short of systematic prosecution, a system for deterrence should be 
built through the prosecution of the most persistent violators. Furthermore, practical 
measures can be implemented by Governments to prevent under-age recruitment, such as 
free birth registration or alternative mechanisms for age verification, in addition to 
conscription policies and mandatory vetting procedures to monitor child recruitment by 
national armies.  
</p>
<p><b>Strengthening family and community protection mechanisms</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Establishing and strengthening community protection mechanisms and raising the 
awareness of families, communities and their leaders of the issue are other critical factors 
for prevention. Child protection and recruitment prevention policies are unlikely to work in 
contexts in which the community promotes the association of children with armed groups. 
Children are also most vulnerable to recruitment when family and community protection 
systems are weakened. In some contexts, children join armed groups because they are 
encouraged to do so by their families and/or communities. Domestic violence has also been 
found to be a central factor in the recruitment of children. Abusive families propel children 
on to the streets, where they are more vulnerable to recruitment, or directly into the ranks of 
an armed group. In Colombia, for example, the decision of children, mainly girls, to run 
away and join an armed group has been found to be closely linked to domestic exploitation 
and physical and sexual abuse.  
</p>
<p>40. Communities can prevent the voluntary or forced association of children with armed 
forces and groups in several ways. Community-based child protection systems can warn of 
the threat of recruitment or rerecruitment. Where armed groups depend on the moral or 
material support of local people, community structures may be able to put pressure on local 
commanders to release children and provide support for their protection. Community 
figures such as elders and traditional leaders can also reach non-State parties to promote 
child protection commitments and prevent recruitment. In Afghanistan, for example, elders 
have in some cases reached agreements with local commanders to impede the recruitment 
of children. Community-based child protection systems can also help to reduce the overall 
vulnerability of children and provide special protection to children living and working in the 
streets, orphans and separated children, who are at particular risk of recruitment. 
</p>
<p>41. Partnering with and building the capacity of local child protection systems requires a 
situation analysis of each country in order to identify the strengths of and gaps in child 
protection systems at both the national and community levels. Community-based child 
protection mechanisms have been found to be a highly diverse and adaptable approach to 
child protection in different contexts. In some situations, child protection mechanisms have 
sprung out of women&#8217;s associations and been engaged in collecting information on 
violations of children&#8217;s rights and in protecting children at particular risk of recruitment. </p>


<p>Other community-led protection networks spring up spontaneously or are fostered by non-
governmental organizations working with the community.  
</p>
<p>42. Initiatives to raise community awareness about the rights of children and the long-
term implications of children&#8217;s association with armed groups and to promote attitudinal 
change or encourage the intervention of community and religious leaders to halt child 
recruitment should be conducted in close collaboration with parents, community and 
religious leaders, teachers and children themselves. Dialogue to foster community 
ownership is crucial, as are consultations that aim at identifying and building on existing 
positive practices. 
</p>
<p>43. A common challenge is the creation of linkages between local, community-based 
protection structures, on the one hand, and elements of the formal child protection system 
and Government services, on the other. Often, the existence of strong legal and policy 
frameworks notwithstanding, Government-led services are not filtering down to the 
communities. In extremely fragile contexts, the weakness of the State and its lack of control 
over all areas may be a factor accounting for gaps in Government services at the community 
level. In other contexts, it is a sign of insufficient priority and resources being accorded to 
the commitments made in the national framework. In the absence of formal mechanisms, 
community-led mechanisms often step in. These may include groups formed specifically for 
the purpose, such as child protection committees or community care coalitions, or they may 
simply consist of existing structures, such as women&#8217;s groups, faith-based organizations and 
other community associations that take on a role in protecting children. To be effective, 
these mechanisms need adequate funding, capacity and knowledge to deal with child 
protection issues.  
</p>
<p><b>  Empowering children through education, skills and livelihood opportunities  
</b></p>
<p>44. In many contexts, joining armed forces or groups is a deliberate choice for children 
who otherwise lack opportunities and a sense of purpose in life. It is unlikely that children 
will want to leave an armed group or refrain from rejoining unless the reasons why they 
originally volunteered have been addressed. 
</p>
<p>45. Ensuring children&#8217;s access to education<b> </b>is itself a powerful means of protecting them 
from becoming involved with armed forces or groups in conflict-affected countries or 
fragile situations. If children attend school, they are busy and less likely to join armed 
forces or groups because they have other alternatives. In contrast, a lack of access to 
education leads many young people to see military training as their only opportunity to 
learn. In situations of armed conflict, when the protective function of schools is most 
required, schools often become targets for attacks. The use of schools for military purposes 
equally reduces the likelihood of children attending school, and thus may increase the 
likelihood of voluntary association of children with armed groups. All stakeholders must 
therefore ensure that schools are protected. Measures that field-based practitioners in 
conflict settings have used to prevent schools from being attacked include physical 
protection, community involvement in protection of schools, alternative delivery of 
education, negotiations with stakeholders to make schools conflict-free zones, restrictions 
on the military and political use of schools, and advocacy initiatives. 
</p>
<p>46. Evidence from armed conflicts suggests that there is a strong association between 
recruitment into armed forces or groups, on the one hand, and poverty and social 
disadvantage, on the other. Poverty, often combined with social exclusion, has been found 
to stir the frustration of young people and create incentives to join armed groups. In many 
post-conflict societies, young people have little choice but to remain unemployed or accept 
short-term and exploitative work. Accordingly, providing children and young people with 
alternatives through high-quality education, both formal and non-formal, and national 
programmes for job creation and income generation for young people should be top </p>


<p>priorities in national prevention strategies. Food security and livelihood measures, tailored 
to the specific economic context, together with cultural and psychosocial support activities, 
can also contribute to preventing the recruitment and the rerecruitment of children. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Explosive weapons: an emerging concern 
</b></p>
<p>47. An emerging concern is the use of explosive weapons by Governments and non-
State actors, especially in populated areas, which has a devastating impact on civilians, 
including children. A particular cause for concern has been the use of heavy explosive 
weapons that can have wide-area effects, such as multiple-launch rockets, high-explosive 
artillery and mortars, car bombs and other improvised explosive devices.  
</p>
<p>48. Explosive weapons touch on four of the six grave violations against children and 
armed conflict, including killing or maiming. They are also used for direct and physical 
attacks on schools and hospitals, where they may result in forced closure or compromised 
functioning. Children recruited and used as suicide bombers and victim bombers both carry 
explosive weapons. In some country situations, children are denied humanitarian access 
because of the presence of explosive remnants of war. Recent developments in countries 
such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, the Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic, where 
thousands of children have been killed and maimed, have confirmed the gravity of the issue.  
</p>
<p>49. Recognition of the distinct and specific problems associated with explosive weapons 
is growing. Acknowledgment that the use of explosive weapons in populated areas causes 
severe harm to civilians and is a serious concern for the protection of children in armed 
conflict has to be further strengthened, however. Systematic data collection and analysis of 
the human cost of these weapons is critical to this end. In addition, the humanitarian 
principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution must always guide the use of 
explosive weapons in compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. 
When dealing with country-specific situations where parties to conflict are listed by the 
Secretary-General for patterns of killing and maiming children, and attacks on schools and 
hospitals, action plans to end these violations should tackle the issue of explosive weapons. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Field visits by the Special Representative 
</b></p>
<p>50. During the period under review, the Special Representative carried out field 
missions to Chad (June 2011), the Central African Republic and Somalia (November 
2011) and South Sudan (March 2012). The purpose of these visits was to take stock of the 
situation of children in these countries, to witness the signing of action plans, to secure and 
facilitate the implementation of child protection commitments on the ground, to foster 
more effective coordination among the principal stakeholders and to follow up on the 
recommendations of the Secretary-General and the main provisions of Security Council 
resolutions 1612 (2005), 1882 (2009) and 1998 (2011). 
</p>
<p>51. The main commitments made by Governments and other parties to the conflict 
during these missions are highlighted below. It is crucial for the protection of children that 
the Human Rights Council and the broader international and human rights community 
continue to collectively monitor follow-up actions and encourage parties to honour their 
commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Chad 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Representative visited Chad from 13 to 16 June 2011 to witness the 
signing of the action plan between the Government and the United Nations for the release </p>


<p>of children associated with the Chadian army and associated security forces. She met the 
President and other Government officials, together with representatives of the United 
Nations country team, the diplomatic community, international and national non-
governmental organizations and civil society. She also travelled to the east of the country, 
where she visited a Sudanese refugee camp and met local authorities and traditional 
leaders. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Representative stressed the need to support educational infrastructure  
and economic reintegration as critical measures in preventing rerecruitment. She obtained 
a commitment from the Government to take the steps necessary to develop a national 
legislative framework for the protection of children.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Central African Republic  
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Representative travelled to the Central African Republic from 15 to 23 
November 2011 to take stock of the challenges facing children affected by armed conflict 
in the country. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Representative met the Prime Minister and other Government officials, 
the leaders of armed groups (APRD, Union des forces d&#233;mocratiques pour le 
rassemblement and CPJP) and representatives of the Ugandan People&#8217;s Defence Force, the 
diplomatic community, non-governmental organizations and the United Nations country 
team. She travelled to the LRA-affected region to meet LRA victims, local authorities and 
the Ugandan People&#8217;s Defence Force to discuss the implementation of standard operating 
procedures for the handover of children in its custody. She also travelled to the north of the 
country, where she witnessed the signing of an action plan between the United Nations and 
CPJP to end the recruitment of children in its ranks. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Representative travelled to Somalia from 23 to 25 November 2011 to 
discuss the development of an action plan with the Government and challenges facing the 
country task force on monitoring and reporting in relation to grave violations against 
children. 
</p>
<p>57. In Mogadishu, the Special Representative met the President and Prime Minister of 
Somalia, representatives of the Transitional Federal Government&#8217;s forces and the Force 
Commander of the African Union Mission in Somalia to discuss the development of an action 
plan to end the recruitment of children. She then met representatives of the diplomatic 
community and United Nations country team members to assess progress made in 
establishing a monitoring and reporting mechanism for Somalia. 
</p>
<p><b> D. South Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>58. During her visit to South Sudan from 12 to 16 March 2012, the Special Representative 
witnessed the signing of a renewed action plan by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army to end 
the recruitment and use of children in its ranks.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Representative met the President and high-level representatives of the 
Government, urging them to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its 
Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict. She also voiced her concern 
to the Governor of Malakal, Upper Nile State, which adjoins the Sudan, regarding the 
recruitment of children by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army in its regional barracks.  </p>


<p>60. The Special Representative travelled to the town of Renk to assess in person the 
situation of children returning from the Sudan living in camps and host communities. 
Although her trip to Jonglei was cancelled, the Special Representative met United Nations and 
civil society partners and raised concerns about the abduction of children in the area. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Towards universal ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Representative continues to mobilize support for the signing and 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict. During the reporting period, she held bilateral 
meetings with Member States that had not ratified the treaty. The Office also continued to 
conduct media outreach to promote broader awareness, information and support. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Representative wishes to reiterate her urgent call upon States to 
establish 18 years as the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces 
when depositing their binding declaration (under article 3) upon rat ification of the 
Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>63. Since the launch of the global campaign on ratification, &#8213;Zero Under 18&#8214; in May 
2010, important progress has been achieved. Between May 2011 and May 2012, the 
Optional Protocol was signed by Saint Lucia and ratified by San Marino. In addition, five 
Member States (C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Grenada, Malaysia, the Niger and Saudi Arabia) acceded to 
the Optional Protocol, bringing the total number of States parties to 147. A total of 23 
Member States have signed but not ratified the Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>64. Given the resource implications and reporting requirements that ratification and 
implementation entail, the Special Representative would like to encourage leadership by 
one or more countries that have already ratified the Optional Protocol to provide guidance 
and other forms of assistance to those countries willing to ratify.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Representative welcomes the strengthened collaboration between 
her Office and the United Nations human rights system, and reiterates her 
</b></p>
<p><b>continued support, including through regular information-sharing and advocacy for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the protection of children affected by armed conflict. The Special Representative 
</b></p>
<p><b>reiterates that, unless all parties to conflict adhere to their commitments, comply 
</b></p>
<p><b>with their international obligations and are held accountable for non-compliance, 
</b></p>
<p><b>there will be no improvement in the situation of children in armed conflict. To this 
</b></p>
<p><b>end, the Special Representative makes the recommendations below. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>involvement of children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Representative urges States parties to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child to strengthen national and international measures for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention of recruitment of children into the armed forces or armed groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their use in hostilities, in particular by signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict and enacting </b></p>


<p><b>legislation to explicitly prohibit and criminalize the recruitment of children into armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces or groups and their use in hostilities. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>States parties should also establish mechanisms to identify children who have 
been or may have been recruited or used in hostilities, and provide such children 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the necessary assistance, including psychological and psychological 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitation and social integration, and prohibit the export of arms to countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>where children are being recruited or used in hostilities. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>States parties to the Convention and to the Optional Protocol are further 
urged to implement the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Child as a matter of priority and to submit timely reports to the Committee under 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Optional Protocol. To this end, States parties are encouraged to establish effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>interministerial coordination mechanisms with a view to ensuring comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to prevent and protect children from offences under the Optional Protocol. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>States are encouraged to establish 18 years as the minimum age for voluntary 
recruitment into armed forces when depositing their binding declaration upon 
</b></p>
<p><b>ratification of the Optional Protocol. Those States that have ratified but not adopted 
</b></p>
<p><b>what is known as the </b>&#8220;stra<b>ight-</b>18 position&#8221;<b>1 are urged to reconsider their 
declarations and to raise the minimum age to 18 years.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Since ratification and the implementation processes of the Optional Protocol 
place a clear burden on the resources of those States willing to ratify the instrument, 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership by one or more countries that have already ratified is encouraged, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide guidance and other forms of assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Representative urges the international community to continue to 
advocate 18 years as the minimum age for recruitment and participation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostilities; to exert international pressure on parties that continue to recruit and use 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; to monitor and compel adherence by parties to conflict to commitments 
</b></p>
<p><b>made to protect children, and to hold them accountable for failure to comply with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards; to address the political, social and economic factors 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitating the recruitment and use of children; and to respond to the rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reintegration needs of former child soldiers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>During the universal periodic review process, States are urged to include, as 
appropriate, in their recommendations to the State under review specific references 
</b></p>
<p><b>to information from the monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>against children established in accordance with Security Council resolution 1612 
</b></p>
<p><b>(2005), in addition to the country conclusions adopted and recommendations made 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Working Group of the Security Council on Children and Armed Conflict, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 
reports submitted by States parties under the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also be taken into consideration by the Working Group on the Universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Periodic Review when reviewing a State submission under the review process. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 1 See A/HRC/15/58, para. 17. </p>


<p>74. <b>States should further begin to accord priority to the implementation of 
relevant recommendations by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the assistance of the international community, wherever it is needed. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Human Rights Council is encouraged, when considering or adopting 
resolutions on country-specific situations or thematic issues, to include therein 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations on, or references to, the protection of children affected by armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict. It is also encouraged to act as a complementary follow-up mechanism to 
</b></p>
<p><b>assess the implementation of the observations and recommendations of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on the Rights of the Child, particularly with regard to the parties to 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict in all situations of concern addressed in the annual report of the Secretary-
</b></p>
<p><b>General (A/66/782-S/2012/261).  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Member States bear a central and immediate political, legal and moral 
responsibility for the protection of children and should comply with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>law for the protection of children within their territories. The Rome Statute defined 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recruitment and use of children in armed forces or armed groups as a war crime. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Member States should enact the appropriate legislation to criminalize these violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and hold adult recruiters to account, including military commanders and political 
</b></p>
<p><b>leaders, for both the crime of child recruitment and for the crimes that they forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>children to commit. They should also take action against other grave violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>against children through their national justice systems, including by bringing their 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws into line with international obligations and by according priority to child 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection capacity and training for the military, the police and law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>and judiciary officials in the context of national security sector reform efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Member States should continue to insist that parties listed in the annexes to 
the report of the Secretary-General on the recruitment and use of children, killing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and maiming of children, and/or rape and other sexual violence against children, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition to attacks against schools and hospitals (see annexes I and II to the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report), in contravention of applicable international law, prepare and implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific time-bound action plans to halt those violations and abuses, and take 
</b></p>
<p><b>punitive measures against any parties that fail to comply. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Lastly, the Special Representative urges all special procedures mandate 
holders, during their missions and in their reports and recommendations, to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>into account the challenges faced by children insofar as they are relevant to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>respective mandates, and to bring those concerns to her attention. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Accountability of perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>International and national courts should continue to investigate, prosecute and 
sentence perpetrators of the crime of recruitment and use of children. Courts are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to use and build on the jurisprudence arising from the judgement handed 
</b></p>
<p><b>down by the International Criminal Court in the <i>Lubanga</i> case and to be guided by the 
</b></p>
<p>Court&#8217;s legal interpretations of <b>the terms </b>&#8220;conscription and enlistment of children&#8221; 
and &#8220;using them to participate actively in hostilities&#8221;<b>. </b></p>


<p><b> E. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Member States should put in place administrative reparation programmes to 
address the needs of children affected by conflict, and should also include reparations 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the mandates of international, hybrid and national courts. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The relevant courts should include reparations to children affected by conflict 
in their judgements and sentencing hearings, providing victims with assistance in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>form of physical rehabilitation, education, livelihood skills and psychosocial support. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Reparation programmes should be designed to meet the particular needs of 
children and to encourage reconciliation within communities. Governments and 
</b></p>
<p><b>donors play a central role in providing sustainable resources to make such initiatives a 
</b></p>
<p><b>success. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F.  Prevention of child recruitment 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Member States should enact the appropriate legislation to criminalize the 
recruitment of children and investigate cases of recruitment and prosecute adult 
</b></p>
<p><b>recruiters in a timely and systematic manner.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Member States should accord priority to funding the strengthening of 
community-based child protection mechanisms as a critical measure in preventing 
</b></p>
<p><b>child recruitment and linking community-based protection systems to formal child 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection systems. Children and young people should be provided with alternatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>through high-quality education, both formal and non-formal, and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes for job creation and income generation for young people should be the 
</b></p>
<p><b>main priorities in national prevention strategies. </b></p>
