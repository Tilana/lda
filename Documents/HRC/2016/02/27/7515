<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
was held at the 8th meeting on 1 May 2014. The delegation of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea was headed by So Se Pyong, Ambassador, Permanent Representative, 
Geneva. At its 14th meeting, held on 6 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report 
on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea: 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/PRK/1 and the annex thereto);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/PRK/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/PRK/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea through the troika. Those questions are available 
on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that during the reporting period broad consultations had been 
held with a large number of institutions and organizations with a view to giving serious 
consideration to the recommendations received during the country&#8217;s first-cycle review; as a 
result, a decision was taken to accept many of those recommendations and take note of 
some others. Most of the accepted recommendations had been implemented or were under 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>6. The Government attached importance to the UPR mechanism and expected that the 
review would be a good occasion to provide an objective and impartial assessment of the 
human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>7. A series of human rights-related laws, including in the areas of education, health 
care, the protection of the rights of the child, women and persons with disabilities, and 
disaster prevention were adopted or amended during the reporting period. Due regard was 
given to the international human rights instruments to which the country was a party. </p>


<p>8. Innovative measures taken for the protection and promotion of civil and political 
rights were described. A general pardon had been granted to convicts. Owing to the 
amendment of the Criminal Law in 2010, the terms of penalties had been shortened and the 
degree of punishment mitigated. The independence and impartiality of the judiciary was 
further ensured through the amending of the Criminal Procedure Law in 2011.  
</p>
<p>9. The Government made efforts to improve economic construction and people&#8217;s living 
and to build a socialist civilized country. In order to address food shortages the Government 
paid special attention to the agricultural sector, inter alia, incentivizing farmers through the 
introduction of new agricultural management methods and innovating agricultural science 
and technology. 
</p>
<p>10. Efforts were focused on laying the material and technical foundations for people to 
fully enjoy the benefits of a universal free medical-care system, while trying to achieve 
international standards in major health indicators. 
</p><p>11. The universal compulsory education had been transformed from an 11-year system 
to a 12-year system, starting from the 2014/15 school year. The quality of university 
education had been further enhanced through the improved educational conditions. A tele-
education system had been set up, linking the local libraries and scientific and educational 
institutions to the central library. 
</p>
<p>12. Thousands of modern houses and welfare facilities had been built in Pyongyang and 
in the provinces. In 2013 alone, hundreds of places for leisure and cultural activities had 
been set up countrywide. 
</p>
<p>13. Progress had been made in protecting and promoting the rights of children, women, 
the elderly and persons with disabilities. Special attention was given to health care and 
education for children without parents. 
</p>
<p>14. Measures had been taken for the care of older persons with no one to depend on and 
a new support system had been established. The Korean Federation for the Protection of 
Persons with Disabilities had refined the scope of its activities, with a series of measures 
taken for the early detection and recovery of children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation reiterated the Government&#8217;s commitment to continue efforts to 
ensure the enjoyment of human rights by the population despite the serious challenges 
faced. The persistent politically motivated pressure and military threat by outside forces 
remained major sources contributing to the destruction of the peaceful environment needed 
for economic development and improvement of people&#8217;s standard of living. Moreover, the 
economic sanctions threatened the people&#8217;s right to existence and the peaceful development 
of the country. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government would further promote cooperation and dialogue with friendly 
countries and open up new channels for improved relationships with others without 
questioning the past. The delegation assured the Human Rights Council of the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to fulfil its international human rights obligations. It expressed 
the conviction that the review would serve as an occasion to promote understanding of the 
real human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and follow up the recommendations of the commission of

responsible for crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>32. Austria expressed concern about the situation of human rights in the country, noting 
the report of commission of inquiry, which substantiated that violations in many instances

and noted the reduction of maternal mortality and progress towards achieving Millennium

</p><p>34. Belarus welcomed the adoption of legislation regarding vulnerable groups, and 
achievements in education, health care and food security. 
</p>

continue to strengthen human rights protection at the institutional, legal and policy levels.

</p><p>41. Chad encouraged efforts to continue to improve the human rights situation. It noted

</p>
<p>46. The Czech Republic was concerned about the human rights situation in the country 
as reported by the commission of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>47. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted the adoption of laws; the signature of

Financing of Terrorism.  
</p>
<p>48. Denmark expressed its regret that the country had declined to cooperate with the 
commission of inquiry, and expressed concern about reports of systematic torture in 
detention, a matter raised in UPR recommendations presented in 2009 that had not been 
accepted by the country.  
</p>
<p>49. Ecuador noted new legislation to protect the rights of vulnerable groups, and areas 
requiring additional efforts, especially regarding detention centres, where conditions should 
be improved. 
</p>
<p>50. Egypt noted challenges to combating domestic violence and human trafficking and 
to protecting children&#8217;s rights. It commended the new legislation and investment in 
education and health. 
</p>
<p>51. Estonia expressed regret at the country&#8217;s unwillingness to cooperate with the 
commission of inquiry, including its prevention of access to the country and rejection of the 
commission&#8217;s findings. 
</p>
<p>52. Ethiopia was encouraged that the country was on track to achieve MDG 4. It called 
on the international community to provide sustainable humanitarian assistance funding. </p>


<p><b> 7 
</b></p>
<p>53. Finland asked how the country would ensure universal access to food, particularly 
for marginalized groups. It encouraged the country to cooperate with human rights 
mechanisms to address violations. 
</p>
<p>54. France noted that the report of the commission of inquiry contained a full 
description of the dramatic human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. 
</p>
<p>55. Germany expressed hope that the country would seriously consider the 
recommendations presented in the review, and remained deeply concerned about a wide 
range of issues. 
</p>
<p>56. Ghana commended steps towards the implementation of some recommendations 
accepted during the first UPR, including signature of CRPD. 
</p>
<p>57. The delegation expressed its view that the creation of the &#8220;commission of inquiry&#8221; 
was motivated by reasons other than human rights. The purpose of its mission was to 
defame the country and ultimately eliminate the ideology and social system chosen by its 
population. The &#8220;report&#8221; of the commission contained fabrications and constituted a 
manifestation of politicization, selectivity and double standards that ran counter to the 
principles of the Human Rights Council. Therefore, the Government had rejected the 
&#8220;commission&#8221;, its &#8220;report&#8221; and the consequent &#8220;resolution&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. With regard to <i>Songun</i> politics, the delegation stated that safeguarding national 
sovereignty provided a guarantee for the enjoyment by people of their human rights. The 
right to life was the foremost issue in guaranteeing human rights and of great importance to 
the people of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, who had been exposed, for more 
than half a century, to persistent military threats by hostile forces. <i>Songun</i> politics served to 
safeguard national sovereignty and had prevented the outbreak of war, making it possible to 
attain tangible achievements on the economic front. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation stated that alleged discrimination based on social classification of 
people was unimaginable in the country, where all people were the masters of the State and 
society, and noted that equality was guaranteed by the Constitution and in practice. 
</p>
<p>60. It was reiterated that &#8220;political prison camps&#8221; did not exist and were a complete 
fabrication. Those persons sentenced to the penalty of reform through labour under the 
country&#8217;s Criminal Law served their terms in reform institutions. 
</p>
<p>61. The Constitution also guaranteed freedom of religion; the State respected the 
religious life and ceremonies of religious people and ensured the freedom to set up 
churches and other religious buildings. 
</p>
<p>62. Freedom to travel was fully guaranteed both by the Constitution and the law. 
Persons in the country could travel abroad after complying with the necessary formalities. 
People were free to travel anywhere within the country, with the exception of the front lines 
and areas with military installations, where one could travel after obtaining permission. 
</p>
<p>63. It was also reiterated that freedom of expression was a fundamental human right 
protected by law. The people in the country freely expressed their views through the radio, 
newspapers and magazines. Any violation of those rights was subject to legal punishment. 
</p><p>64. Greece condemned the atrocities and ongoing grave human rights violations in the 
country, which amounted in many instances to crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>65. Hungary asked about the nature of the acts for which the death penalty could be 
imposed and about the number of executions. It expressed concern regarding torture in 
prison facilities. </p>


<p>66. Iceland condemned in the strongest terms the unparalleled denial of human rights in 
the country. It urged the country to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including by allowing the 
Special Rapporteur access to the country. 
</p>
<p>67. India welcomed progress, including in the health sector. It expressed concern about 
access to food. India urged regular family reunions. A national human rights institution 
would improve the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>68. Indonesia acknowledged relevant new legislation and the institutional reorganization 
to ensure its implementation. It encouraged the country to engage in technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>69. Ireland expressed concern about the unparalleled human rights situation, reports of 
rape and sexual abuse of women in detention, chronic food insecurity and malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>70. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted the signature of CRPD and the consideration of 
other human rights instruments. International mechanisms, based on mutual respect, 
domestic requirements and understanding, would facilitate efforts by the country to 
enhance an environment conducive to continued improvement of human rights. 
</p>
<p>71. Israel noted human rights violations, including starvation, suppression of freedom of 
movement and expression, gender-based discrimination, public executions, enforced 
disappearance, torture, abductions and prison camps. 
</p>
<p>72. Italy expressed concern about the death penalty, undue restrictions of freedom of 
movement, the criminalization of repatriated citizens and gender discrimination. It stressed 
the need for cooperation with international mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>73. Kazakhstan called for an abstention from politicization, for impartiality and for the 
country to strengthen its cooperation with United Nations mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>74. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted the country&#8217;s accession to 
international conventions and the enactment of national legislation. It welcomed the 
improved education, and encouraged experience-sharing and international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>75. Latvia noted reports that the country had refused to cooperate with the special 
procedures and urged the country to grant access to mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>76. Lithuania remained concerned about systemic and gross human rights violations. It 
urged the country to take steps to halt such violations. 
</p>
<p>77. Malaysia noted efforts to address gender-based violence, strengthen the economy 
and improve international cooperation. The development of a knowledge-based economy 
was encouraged. 
</p>
<p>78. Mexico expressed appreciation of the steps taken to implement CRPD, and invited 
the country to ratify it. It encouraged the country to consider accession to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(ICERD), the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p><p>79. Montenegro condemned the grave human rights violations, including restrictions on 
the freedom of expression and movement and the use of political prison camps. 
</p>
<p>80. Mozambique noted the country&#8217;s ratification of some international instruments, 
which were later incorporated into national legislation; and the increased investment in 
health care and drinking-water provision. 
</p>
<p>81. Myanmar welcomed the country&#8217;s active participation in the UPR, and the universal 
12-year free and compulsory education system. </p>


<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>82. Namibia welcomed the signing of CRPD, the ratification of the International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the enactment of the acts 
on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>83. The Netherlands was gravely concerned about the use of torture in the country. It 
commented that a life in dignity was difficult for citizens, who had to serve the State, rather 
than the other way around.  
</p>
<p>84. New Zealand, given the findings of the commission of inquiry, remained deeply 
concerned about human rights in the country, the severe lack of access to basic human 
needs, and political prison camps.  
</p>
<p>85. Nicaragua noted advances in economic, social and cultural rights and the adoption of 
legislation on preventing and mitigating natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>86. Norway requested a clear and timely response to all recommendations presented 
during the review, and urged the country to honour its legal obligations as a party to human 
rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>87. Pakistan noted the strengthening of domestic legislation, the restructuring of 
ministries and efforts to modernize the health-care system. It encouraged ratification of 
CRPD. 
</p>
<p>88. Poland stressed the obligation of the State under review to take a clear position on 
all UPR recommendations at the adoption by the Human Rights Council of the report of the 
Working Group, at the latest.  
</p>
<p>89. Portugal was deeply worried about long-standing, systematic and widespread 
violations of human rights, which amounted to crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>90. The Republic of Korea expressed its regret at the delayed response of the State 
under review regarding its position on the previous UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Romania welcomed the action on CRPD. Noting the findings of the commission of 
inquiry, it expressed regret that the issue of international abductions remained unsettled. 
</p>
<p>92. The Russian Federation noted steps taken to improve the human rights situation in 
light of the recommendations of the first review, and expressed hope that those efforts 
would be intensified. 
</p>
<p>93. On the right to food, the delegation noted that the Government had directed primary 
efforts to increase food production. Details regarding action taken in that regard had been 
provided. The country never practiced discrimination in food distribution.  
</p>
<p>94. The delegation noted, on the issue of separated families, that although the inter-
Korean relations had deteriorated in an unprecedented manner during the period under 
review, the Government, with a view to relieving the pain of the families and relatives 
separated in the north and south, had persevered in its efforts for the realization of reunions, 
and as a result, reunions had been resumed and held twice in February 2014.  
</p>
<p>95. The delegation also reiterated that the issue of prisoners of war had been completely 
settled in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and that the issue of &#8220;abduction of 
south Koreans&#8221; did not exist.  
</p>
<p>96. The delegation indicated that, to promote dialogue and cooperation with human 
rights mechanisms, replies had been sent to OHCHR clarifying the country&#8217;s positions on 
questions raised. At the same time, recommendations by treaty bodies had been faithfully 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>97. Unfortunately, the country had been singled out for naming and shaming through the 
coercive adoption of unjust &#8220;resolutions&#8221; in the General Assembly and the Human Rights </p>


<p>Council each year. Such &#8220;resolutions&#8221; were full of distortions and fabrications and imposed 
unjust demands. 
</p><p>98. The country attached great importance to constructive dialogue in the field of human 
rights. It had acceded to international human rights instruments, such as the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and was doing all it could to fulfil its obligations under 
those treaties. Consultations were under way on possible accession to additional 
international human rights instruments. Furthermore, the reports on the implementation of 
the instruments to which it was a party were under preparation. 
</p>
<p>99. With regard to the presentation of the country&#8217;s position on recommendations of the 
first cycle, the delegation clarified that, of the 167 recommendations received, 50 
politicized ones had been rejected. Subsequently, in the plenary session in 2010 it had 
stated that the rest of the recommendations had been duly taken note of, as per the general 
practice then. Unfortunately, although it had simply followed general practice, the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was unjustly singled out for accusations. That did 
not mean that the country was indifferent to the implementation of recommendations. On 
the contrary, it was truly committed to the UPR process and would provide responses to the 
recommendations made at the present session in due course. 
</p>
<p>100. Sierra Leone noted the enactment of legislation on higher education and the rights of 
children and persons with disabilities. It urged the country to submit its overdue reports to 
the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>101. Singapore noted the country&#8217;s strengthened legislative framework and that 
challenges remained in development and improving people&#8217;s well-being. 
</p>
<p>102. Slovakia was concerned about the death penalty, torture and ill-treatment of 
detainees, restrictions on freedoms and access to information, and political prisoners. 
</p>
<p>103. Slovenia was concerned about violations of economic, social and cultural rights and 
the findings of the commission of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>104. South Sudan commended the country&#8217;s progress in education, health care, the 
provision of safe drinking water and the care of orphans. It encouraged continued efforts in 
the area of health. 
</p>
<p>105. Spain expressed concern about the separation of powers and human rights violations 
against political prisoners held in large camps.  
</p>
<p>106. Cuba noted that the State under review was endeavouring to consolidate a socialist 
society in the face of aggressive imperialist policies directed against its country. 
</p>
<p>107. The Sudan welcomed the signing of CRPD and progress in health care and 
education. It encouraged continued efforts to raise awareness of human rights throughout 
the country. 
</p>
<p>108. Sweden was alarmed at the findings of the commission of inquiry, which had 
highlighted a systematic infringement of human rights, atrocities against political prisoners 
and evidence of crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>109. The Syrian Arab Republic expressed its appreciation of the country&#8217;s efforts to 
improve living standards despite challenges, notably economic sanctions, and its progress 
in education, health care and women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>110. Thailand welcomed the engagement with the UPR mechanism, but noted 
discrepancies in information in the reports, given the inability of the United Nations and 
other stakeholders to verify information provided by the Government. </p>


<p><b> 11 
</b></p>
<p>111. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia expressed its dismay at extrajudicial 
killings and public executions, restrictions on freedom of movement and conditions of 
detention for political prisoners.  
</p>
<p>112. Timor-Leste commended the revision of the legislative framework and the adoption 
of human rights legislation, including on education and children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>113. Tunisia encouraged the completion of legislative reform and the establishment of the 
rule of law. It urged the country to adopt measures to guarantee citizens&#8217; rights without 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>114. Turkey, concerned by the findings of the commission of inquiry, urged the State 
under review to fulfil its international human rights obligations and to cooperate with the 
international community. 
</p>
<p>115. Switzerland deplored the lack of cooperation with human rights mechanisms, and 
was concerned about impunity for human rights violations and crimes against humanity, 
chronic malnutrition and violations of the right to food.  
</p>
<p>116. Japan was concerned about the systematic violations highlighted in the report of the 
commission of inquiry. It did not agree that there was no abduction issue; the 
reinvestigation agreed to in 2008 had not been carried out, proving that the abduction issue 
had not been resolved.  
</p>
<p>117. The delegation gave details on the laws and structures in place to ensure the 
independence of the judiciary. It reiterated that, in principle, executions were not open to 
the public. Public executions may occur only in exceptional cases, where the crime 
committed was extremely grave. Information was also provided on reforms regarding the 
imposition of penalties and treatment of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>118. With regard to questions on illegal border crossing, it was noted that the economic 
difficulties of the mid-1990s had caused some people to cross the borders illegally. 
However, although those people had breached the law they were never punished, as they 
did so for economic reasons.  
</p>
<p>119. With regard to the abduction of citizens of other countries, the delegation reiterated 
that no citizens of any countries other than Japan had been abducted into the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The delegation recalled that the issue had been completely 
resolved as a result of sincere efforts made by the country in faithful compliance with the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea-Japan Pyongyang Declaration published in 
September 2002. 
</p>
<p>120. The delegation provided further information on the improved quality of medical 
services, including on the introduction of telemedicine and improvements in maternal and 
child health. 
</p>
<p>121. The delegation indicated that legislation, including the Criminal Law, protected 
women from violence. Recommendations to end violence against women were based on a 
lack of understanding of the situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>122. The delegation stated that allegations of &#8220;systematic, widespread and gross human 
rights violations&#8221; in the country were ridiculous and a complete fabrication. 
</p>
<p>123. In conclusion, the delegation stated that the session had been a good occasion for a 
sincere and constructive dialogue and that it would continue its efforts for genuine 
cooperation in the field of human rights, including in the UPR process. </p>
