<p>1. The only major comments that we would like to make relates to traditional beliefs 
and practices.  Contrary to the image portrayed in the report, there is no &#8220;traditional African 
religion&#8221; as such, practised in Sierra Leone.  Everyone identifies with a religion, mainly 
Christianity and Islam, while at the same time having varying degrees of traditional beliefs 
and following certain traditional practices.  Thus, the harmful traditional practices referred 
to in the report are prevalent among both Christians and Muslims, but are not done in the 
name of religion. 
</p>
<p>2. The above fact can be considered positive, in that it creates the avenue for public 
awareness and campaign against such practices.  Thus, for instance, a national consultative 
forum of Traditional and Religious leaders on maternal mortality and morbidity reduction 
in Sierra Leone has held two conferences on the subject.  Organized by the Office of the 
First Lady in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) the forum 
aims to accelerate a reduction of maternal mortality in Sierra Leone, with the assistance of 
the religious and traditional leaders. 
</p>
<p>3. As in any country in which unexplained tragedies, such as child deaths are prevalent, 
there is a belief in an evil power &#8211; witchcraft.  History has shown that with education and 
improved health and low mortality, this belief in witchcraft disappears.   
</p>
<p>4. As regards female genital cutting, the Government has worked very closely with the 
UN family agencies to ensure that a memorandum of understanding was signed with the 
&#8216;Soweis&#8221;-the female traditional leaders who perform FGC-in order to maintain the legal age 
of eighteen below which it is currently illegal to perform such harmful practices. The 
Government will continue to support massive sensitization and awareness-raising on the ills 
of this issue.
