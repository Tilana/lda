 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action held the first part of its fifth session in Geneva 
from 5 to 9 March 2007, and the second part from 3 to 7 September 2007. 
</p>
<p> At the first part of its session, the Working Group examined two thematic areas: the role of 
national action plans in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, with presentations by panellists and a presentation by the Secretariat; and 
complementary international standards, with the preliminary exchange of views with the 
five experts selected to conduct a study on gaps in existing international instruments to combat 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> The panellists on the role of national action plans in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance explored the effectiveness of national action 
plans and the obstacles to their implementation. They also highlighted specific national 
experiences, provided comparative analyses of national action plans, and drew attention to points 
that should be taken into account when preparing and drafting national action plans against 
racism.  
</p>
<p> On the thematic issue of complementary international standards, the experts discussed the 
methodology that they had adopted for the study. The Working Group flagged combating 
xenophobia, standards of protection in the media and the protection of indigenous peoples, 
migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees as areas that would probably require particular 
consideration by the experts. Much of the debate also revolved around the questions of religious 
intolerance and discrimination based on multiple grounds. 
</p>
<p> At the second part of its session, the Working Group examined the study submitted by the 
Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination on possible measures to 
strengthen implementation through optional recommendations or the update of its monitoring 
procedures (A/HRC/4/WG.3/7), and a report submitted by the experts on the content and scope 
of substantive gaps in the existing international instruments to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/4/WG.3/6). 
</p>
<p> The Working Group adopted by consensus several recommendations on each of the themes 
discussed during the two parts of the session. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 1/5 and decision 3/103. While the recommendations contained in section VII 
were adopted by consensus by the Working Group, the other sections of the present report are 
the sole responsibility of the Chairman-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Working Group held the first part of its fifth session from 5 to 9 March 2007 and the 
second part from 3 to 7 September 2007, in Geneva. During the first part, the Working Group 
held a total of nine meetings. During the second part, it held seven meetings. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. Both parts of the session were attended by representatives of States Members, international 
coordinating committees and regional groups of national institutions, specialized agencies, and 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations (see annex I). 
</p>
<p>4. During the first part of the session, presentations on the theme of national action plans to 
combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance were made by the 
following panellists: Anita Danka, staff attorney of the European Roma Rights Centre in 
Budapest; Mark Lattimer, Executive Director of Minority Rights Group International; 
Joseph Rajkumar of Pax Romana; Alejandro Gelover, Director of Institution Relations and 
International Affairs of the National Council for the Prevention of Discrimination of Mexico; 
and Bart Mondelaers of the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism. 
</p>
<p>5. The five experts engaged with the Working Group in a preliminary exchange of views 
and vision on complementary standards as a provisional measure pending the completion of 
their report. The experts were: Professor Jenny Goldschmidt (Netherlands); Professor 
Dimitrina Petrova (Bulgaria); Syafi&#8217;i Anwar (Indonesia); Professor Tiyanjana Maluwa (Malawi 
and South Africa);<b> </b>and Waldo Luis Villalpando (Argentina). 
</p>
<p>6. During the second part of the session, a member of the Committee on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Professor Alexei Avtonomov, presented a study by the 
Committee on possible measures to strengthen implementation through optional 
recommendations or the update of its monitoring procedures (A/HRC/4/WG.3/7). 
</p>
<p>7. The experts presented their study on the content and scope of substantive gaps in the 
existing international instruments to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance (A/HRC/4/WG.3/6). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the first part, the Director of the Division of Human Rights Procedures opened the 
session on behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. During the 
second part, the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the session on behalf of 
the High Commissioner. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Election of the Chairman-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>9. During the first part of the fifth session, Juan Martabit (Chile) was re-elected 
Chairman-Rapporteur by acclamation. During the second part, at the first meeting, on 
3 September, Juan Eduardo Eguiguren, the Deputy Permanent Representative at the Permanent 
Mission of Chile to the United Nations in Geneva was elected interim Chairman-Rapporteur by 
acclamation, in the absence of Mr. Martabit, the Permanent Representative of Chile who 
assumed the chairmanship of the Working Group on 5 September. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the first meeting of the first part, the Working Group adopted the agenda for the 
first part of its fifth session (A/HRC/4/WG.3/1) (annex II). At the first meeting of the second 
part, the Working Group adopted the agenda for the second part of its fifth session 
(A/HRC/4/WG.3/3) (annex III).  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the first part of its fifth session, the Working Group approved its programme of 
work (A/HRC/4/WG.3/2). During the second part, the Working Group approved its programme 
of work (A/HRC/4/WG.3/4). 
</p>
<p><b>III.  GENERAL STATEMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the first part, delegates speaking on behalf of regional groups and as representatives 
of their own countries reiterated their commitment to combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and highlighted the importance of following up the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>13. Several delegates provided overviews of their countries&#8217; national initiatives to follow up 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. National action plans, new legislation, 
budgetary resources, updates to school textbooks, the establishment of a special tribunal and 
employment, housing and health-care programmes were some of the initiatives flagged in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>14. Several delegates commented on the development of new standards to combat racism. 
While some delegates welcomed the creation of new standards, one delegate representing a 
regional group expressed the view that new standards might only be useful if they strengthened 
the fight against racism at the national level. 
</p>
<p>15. During the second part of the fifth session, delegates speaking on behalf of regional groups 
and as representatives of their own countries informed the Working Group on their 
implementation of the Durban Programme of Action. Several delegates reiterated their 
commitment to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and 
highlighted the importance of following up on the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. Several delegates provided overviews of their countries&#8217; national initiatives. In particular, 
they discussed the development of national action plans to promote diversity, constitutional and 
legislative measures to protect the collective rights of people of African descent and indigenous 
peoples and the establishment of independent specialized national human rights institutions to 
combat racism and racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>17. A representative also made a presentation, on behalf of a regional group, on the 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action at the regional level, 
outlining the work done on the strengthening of regional anti-discrimination legislation; the 
development of anti-racism strategies, and the enactment of laws criminalizing acts of a racist 
and xenophobic nature. Observers also took the floor to inform the Working Group on their 
implementation activities in recent months. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THEMATIC ANALYSIS:  THE ROLE OF NATIONAL ACTION PLANS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Presentations by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the first part of its fifth session, the Working Group began its thematic analysis on 
national action plans. The Director of Institution Relations and International Affairs of the 
National Council for Prevention of Discrimination of Mexico analysed the problem of 
discrimination in his country. He highlighted the initiatives of the Government of Mexico to 
implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. He drew attention to the 
multi-dimensional nature of discrimination and pointed out that there was no single strategy to 
combat discrimination. He also stressed that often discrimination was not strictly a legal issue: 
the real problem lay in the translation of standards into practice. 
</p>
<p>19. The attorney from the European Roma Rights Centre in Budapest focused her presentation 
on the Roma people and the essential components which should be included in an effective 
national action plan. She explained that there were two effective avenues for addressing racial 
discrimination: legislative frameworks and governmental policies. She explained that countries 
needed to review and reassess all relevant policies and their impact, instead of simply 
synthesizing existing policies. She also stressed the importance of mainstreaming social 
inclusion into all laws and policies, setting clear and specific implementation objectives, 
determining indicators for monitoring and ensuring funding for implementation. Public 
independent bodies were essential for investigating, prosecuting and monitoring acts of 
discrimination. She noted the necessity of transparency, information-sharing and cooperation 
among concerned Government ministries.  
</p>
<p>20. The human rights consultant to Forum Asia, provided a comparative analysis of national 
action plans. He pointed out that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action provided 
important guidelines for combating racism. In the Asia Pacific region, 12 countries had adopted 
national action plans on human rights which addressed the need to protect vulnerable groups, 
even if they did not use the word &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. He flagged the importance of the grounds of 
&#8220;descent&#8221; when examining discrimination, and referred to the system of protection of women 
against violence adopted by India as an example of how soft law could become hard law. While 
he acknowledged that there was a need for new norms in a few areas, the main issue was the 
proper implementation of existing standards.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. The representative of the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to 
Racism presented the national action plan against racism of Belgium which was currently being 
drafted and included references, targets and contents of provisions from the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action. He spoke about the advantages of having an independent public 
institution draft the national action plan, and detailed the working methods used by the Centre. 
He also highlighted the importance of including all stakeholders in the process; establishing a 
national follow-up commission; and making the national action plan a structural element to 
ensure continuity over time. He commented that the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action was a declaration of intent and that it would be very useful to have some minimum 
standards of a binding nature.  
</p>
<p>22. The Executive Director of Minority Rights Group International explored a range of 
experience in national action plans. He flagged six crucial points<b> </b>to be taken into account in 
developing national action plans. The first point was recognition: in many States, recognition of 
certain groups was a controversial subject. It was, however, exceptionally difficult to assist or 
protect a group without first recognizing that group. The second point was disaggregated data: 
while they were essential for understanding the extent of marginalization, the gathering of data 
needed to be undertaken in consultation with the communities concerned. Third, participation: 
consulting and involving the concerned community was essential for States in order to take 
focused and effective action. Fourth, measures to prevent discrimination and special measures to 
address it; there was a need for a legal regime to address equality of opportunity and a set of 
programmes for positive action. Fifth, targets: it was important to establish some form of target 
in order to monitor progress over time. The sixth point was institutional implementation 
mechanisms: each national plan of action required a budget adequate for the actions envisaged 
by it. Institutional mechanisms, such as ministers, parliamentary committees and committees 
involving members of the group targeted in the plan were also needed to move the actions 
identified in the national action plan forward. 
</p>
<p>23. During the discussion and debate which followed the presentations, State representatives 
presented overviews of the national action plans developed in their own countries. Some 
delegates addressed issues regarding racial profiling, national security, migration and 
discrimination. One delegate expressed the view that national security should be used as an 
argument to promote the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
A panellist noted that the topic of undocumented migrants presented a whole separate series of 
difficult issues, and that the issue of migration was addressed by another agency of the 
United Nations. 
</p>
<p>24. The themes of urbanization and spatial segregation were also examined during the 
discussion. One panellist noted that, in countries where communities were highly segregated, it 
was always the result of exclusion rather than voluntary segregation.  
</p>
<p>25. The need to involve non-State actors in developing anti-discrimination policy was 
mentioned by a panellist, as was the importance of putting human rights education at the centre 
of such a policy. Issues surrounding the use of mother-tongue languages and integration versus 
assimilation were also addressed.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. One State representative commented that the understanding of the concept of minority and 
the historical experience surrounding minorities were not the same around the world. The 
representative maintained that, while minorities in some parts of the world were marginalized 
and excluded, minorities in other parts of the world had historically been the oppressors. The 
representative also noted that minority was a concept and not always a question of numbers. 
</p>
<p>27. Several panellists and State representatives also addressed the issues of data collection, 
monitoring and disaggregated data. One representative raised questions about data collection in 
relation to patterns of shifting identities, while a panellist reiterated the importance of 
data-collection and storage methods and emphasized that data should never be personally 
identifiable. One panellist also spoke on the need to develop international standards for data 
collection.  
</p>
<p>28. One delegate expressed the view that the lack of reference to the 1992 Declaration on the 
Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities in the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action<b>1</b> constituted a gap. The same delegate also 
mentioned that article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights needed to be 
better implemented. 
</p>
<p>29. The Chairman noted that the first part of the session had underscored the need for more 
work on disaggregated data and reliable indicators, as well as the need to update the information 
on the websites of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) and those dedicated to the Durban follow-up.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Presentation by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>30. The coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Unit presented an overview on the assistance 
that OHCHR could provide with regard to developing and implementing national action plans. 
The coordinator explained that such assistance originated from a request made by the concerned 
State and was implemented on the basis of an agreement reached with the particular 
Government. 
</p>
<p>31. The national action plan of Argentina was highlighted as an example that could be useful 
in the development of further technical assistance projects by OHCHR with States. The 
development of the action plan included three phases: methodology, guidelines and the 
identification of groups requiring attention.  
</p>
<p>32. In the course of the discussion, several delegations raised the point concerning the capacity 
of OHCHR to assist Member States in the development of action plans. They stressed that the 
High Commissioner needed to strengthen the capacity of the Anti-Discrimination Unit in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>1
</b>  General Assembly resolution 47/135, annex. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V. THEMATIC ANALYSIS:  COMPLEMENTARY  
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 
</b></p>
<p>33. On 8 March 2007, the Working Group benefited from an exchange of views with the five 
experts selected to conduct the study on gaps in existing international instruments to combat 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and to make concrete 
recommendations on the avenues and means to bridge those gaps. 
</p>
<p>34. The experts were Professor Jenny Goldschmidt (Group of Western European and other 
States); Professor Dimitrina Petrova (Group of Eastern European States); Syafi&#8217;i Anwar (Group 
of Asian States); Professor Tiyanjana Maluwa (Group of African States); and Waldo Luis 
Villalpando (Group of Caribbean and Latin American States). 
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Villalpando, the Chairman of the group of experts recalled that they met for the first 
time in Geneva on 21 and 22 January 2007. He informed delegates that the next meeting of the 
experts was scheduled for April and that a third meeting would be held in May. He submitted 
that, despite the limited time allocated to the study, the experts would try their best to produce a 
report by the end of June.  
</p>
<p>36. Mr. Villalpando stated that the experts would examine the following categories, as 
formulated by the Chairman of the Working Group at its fourth session: (a) religious groups; 
(b) refugees; (c) asylum-seekers; (d) stateless persons; (e) migrant workers; (f) internally 
displaced persons; (g) descent-based communities; (h) indigenous peoples; (i) minorities; and 
(j) people under foreign occupation. He added that they would also consider the following 
phenomena, as formulated by the Chairman of the Working Group: (a) multiple discrimination 
or aggravated forms of racial discrimination; (b) ethnic cleansing; (c) genocide; (d) religious 
intolerance and defamation of religious symbols; (e) racial discrimination in the private sphere; 
and (f) incitement to racial hatred and dissemination of hate speech and xenophobic and 
caricatural pictures, through traditional mass media and information technology, including the 
Internet. 
</p>
<p>37. The Chairman of the group of experts also explained that the identification of gaps should 
be conducted with the participation of all relevant stakeholders. In that regard, the experts held 
meetings with members of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, members 
of other treaty bodies, and representatives of non-governmental organizations. At those 
meetings, the parties stressed that, while the identification of gaps should be conducted with the 
participation of all relevant stakeholders, States would remain primarily responsible for fulfilling 
their obligations. 
</p>
<p>38. Following the introduction by the Chairman, each of the experts expressed their view of 
the study. One expert asserted that additional standards could be required in those areas specified 
under the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action but not contained in the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The experts highlighted 
combating xenophobia as one such area and the use of new information technologies, such as the 
Internet, for purposes contrary to the respect for human values, equality and non-discrimination, 
such as for propagating racism, racial discrimination, racial hatred, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>39. Another expert referred to the current work by the Organization of American States on the 
draft convention against racism and all forms of discrimination and intolerance as evidence that 
substantive gaps existed with regard to the protection of vulnerable groups. One expert 
considered vital the need to direct particular attention to the issue of multiple or aggravated 
forms of discrimination. The view that only a cross-cutting approach would provide for an 
effective system of protection was also expressed. The need to clarify and reach a better 
understanding of the contents of article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>40. Views were expressed on how to strike a fair balance between freedom of religion and of 
expression. One delegate stressed the need to preserve the fundamental right to freedom of 
expression. On the issue of religious intolerance, one expert stated that increasing trends of 
incitement to religious hatred and defamation of religions showed how religious intolerance as a 
whole had become one of the most dangerous threats to international peace and security. Another 
representative considered erroneous the opinion that defaming a religion per se was different 
from inciting hatred against people who identify themselves on the basis of a particular religion. 
Another stated that criminalizing defamation of religions would be inconsistent with the 
fundamental principle that human rights reside in the individual rather than in group association, 
race, culture or religion. It was also suggested that the Working Group should avoid theoretical 
discussions and rather focus on practical issues. The view that the Working Group should take 
into consideration the recent reports of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief was also submitted.  
</p>
<p>41. One participant emphasized that the interest of the victims should guide the examination 
being undertaken by the experts. The participant also recommended that the experts should 
consult with members of the former Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights as well as with relevant non-State actors.  
</p>
<p>42. Throughout the discussions, the experts considered that, while they remained cognizant of 
the increase in ethnic and/or religious tensions globally, they believed that the following areas 
would benefit from their examination: the concept of responsibility to protect; the identification 
of protection gaps in situations involving natural disasters; discrimination in the private sphere; 
and different protection options offered by soft law mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>43. Several of the participants underscored the main gap as the discrepancy between the 
existing obligations and their effective implementation and follow-up. Reference was made to 
the lack of implementation of the right to individual petition under various international human 
rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>44. Some delegates stated that, as a matter of ensuring the coherence and effectiveness of the 
current system of protection, the process of exploring new standards should be conducted with a 
holistic approach. The process should take into consideration all currently existing mechanisms 
in order to avoid possible duplications with provisions already set forth in other international 
instruments. Specific references were made to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>45. Some delegates expressed the view that the setting of complementary international 
standards should result neither in weakening existing mechanisms nor in creating new platforms 
which may justify human rights violations. Once identified, gaps could be filled either by 
strengthening existing instruments with, for example, additional protocols, or by drafting new 
instruments. The desire that possible new instruments should be universally ratified was 
expressed, though there was also the recognition that no international instrument had been 
universally ratified to date.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  STUDY ON COMPLEMENTARY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Presentation by the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>46. On the second day of the second part of its session, the Working Group began its 
discussions on complementary international standards. A member of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination introduced a study on possible measures to strengthen 
implementation through optional recommendations or the update of its monitoring procedures.  
</p>
<p>47. The member provided a summary of the study on behalf of the Committee. He began by 
speaking on the various procedures at the disposal of the Committee, highlighting recent 
developments, such as the new follow-up procedures developed by the Committee for both its 
concluding observations and its opinions adopted on individual and group communications. He 
stressed the Committee&#8217;s satisfaction at the success of the follow-up procedure, as established by 
the initial assessment of the follow-up procedure. He referred to a country visit conducted 
in 2006 by the coordinator on follow-up at the invitation of the State party in question. 
</p>
<p>48. The member went on to discuss the various obstacles, as presented in the study, to the 
effectiveness of the monitoring role with which the Committee had been entrusted. He 
highlighted the non-compliance of States parties with their reporting obligations as a major 
obstacle to the Committee&#8217;s work and the effective implementation of the Convention. 
Regarding individual complaints, he stated that the potential of the procedure remained to be 
fully exploited. 
</p>
<p>49. During the interactive dialogue which followed the presentation, several questions were 
put to the Committee member. One delegate referred to the proposal relating to treaty body 
reforms on the submission of consolidated reports. He stated that the consolidated report 
approach was an interesting proposal and expressed his concern at the large number of reports 
States had to submit to various human rights treaty bodies and mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>50. Another delegate queried how to evaluate the inputs for the review procedure of state 
reports. He also asked whether it would be possible to draft general guidelines for the early 
warning and urgent procedures. He also enquired about cooperation between the Committee and 
the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities. 
</p>
<p>51. Several delegates declared that failure by States to implement the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and to meet their reporting obligations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>under it remained the obstacles to eliminating racism. Several delegates also declared that 
implementation of existing standards and the elaboration of new standards to fill in gaps were 
mutually inclusive and that lack of implementation could not be used as an excuse to move away 
from complementary standards. 
</p>
<p>52. The member addressed some of the questions by providing additional information about 
the work of the Committee and the recommendations issued by it in its study. He explained the 
various procedures at the disposal of the Committee, highlighting recent developments, such as 
the new follow-up procedures developed by the Committee for both its concluding observations 
and its opinions adopted on individual and group communications. The Committee also stressed 
that the initial assessment of the follow-up procedure was quite positive, including a country visit 
conducted in 2006 by the coordinator on follow-up at the invitation of the State party in question. 
</p>
<p>53. The member listed various obstacles to the effectiveness of the monitoring role with which 
the Committee has been entrusted. In particular, he stressed non-compliance of States parties 
with their reporting obligations as a major impediment to the Committee&#8217;s work and the 
effective implementation of the Convention. Regarding individual complaints, he noted that the 
potential of the procedure was still to be fully exploited. 
</p>
<p>54. Regarding the Committee&#8217;s recommendations to address procedural gaps, the member 
summarized the list of recommendations and proposals as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Committee continued to urge States to regard the reporting process as being for 
their own benefit as well as obligatory, in compliance with article 9 of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Committee suggested that the practice of follow-up visits by the coordinator on 
follow-up should be further developed and that the framework for such visits be explored, 
including through the adoption of an optional protocol to the Convention that would further 
elaborate the conditions and procedures appropriate for such visits, including the financial 
aspects; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Committee continued to encourage States to consider making the declaration 
under article 14 of the Convention providing for the possibility for individuals and groups of 
individuals to submit communications to the Committee and to give adequate publicity to that 
mechanism. It also recalled its proposal concerning the establishment of a single body to deal 
with individual communications to all treaty bodies by the means of an optional protocol to the 
relevant treaties. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Presentation by the experts 
</b></p>
<p>55. On the third day of the second part of its session, the Working Group began its discussions 
on the study by the five experts on the content and scope of substantive gaps in the existing 
international instruments to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. The Chairman of the group of experts introduced the study.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. The Chairman spoke on general matters and provided a brief overview of themes 
addressed by the study, then discussed the experts&#8217; recommendations. He summarized some of 
the difficulties the experts faced while preparing the study, in particular the time constraints. 
During the second half of his presentation, the Chairman provided a detailed overview of each 
theme covered in the study, including key points and recommendations.  
</p>
<p>57. The Chairman explained that chapter I provided an analysis of the positive obligations of 
States parties and the finding by the experts of the existence of a normative gap in that area. The 
experts concluded the chapter with a recommendation for the adoption of a comprehensive 
binding instrument establishing the duty to promote non-discrimination, tolerance and equality 
of rights irrespective of race, ethnicity and other related grounds through human rights education.  
</p>
<p>58. In chapter II, the experts examined possible gaps with regard to groups requiring special 
protection against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The experts 
considered the following categories, as formulated by the Chairman of the Working Group at its 
fourth session: (a) religious groups; (b) refugees; (c) asylum-seekers; (d) stateless persons; 
(e) migrant workers; (f) internally displaced persons; (g) descent-based communities; 
(h) indigenous peoples; (i) minorities; and (j) people under foreign occupation. 
</p><p>59. In chapter III, the experts address possible gaps with regard to manifestations of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The experts considered the following 
phenomena, as formulated by the Chairman of the Working Group: (a) multiple discrimination 
or aggravated forms of racial discrimination; (b) ethnic cleansing; (c) genocide; (d) religious 
intolerance and defamation of religious symbols; (e) racial discrimination in the private sphere; 
and (f) incitement to racial hatred and dissemination of hate speech and xenophobic and 
caricatural pictures, through traditional mass media and information technology, including the 
Internet. The experts provided an assessment and recommendations at the end of each thematic 
section. 
</p>
<p>60. Following the Chairman&#8217;s introduction of the study, each one of the experts explained their 
individual approach to the study which they had to merge in a single effort in order to reach 
consensus on all of their conclusions and recommendations, except for one. The experts did not 
reach consensus on the inclusion of any discussion and/or reference to sexual orientation in 
relation to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the study. 
Mr. Anwar specifically requested that his dissenting position on this matter be recorded. 
</p>
<p>61. Furthermore, the experts indicated that areas in the study might be considered unclear 
because of the drastic reduction of the content of the document in order to meet the required page 
limit. The experts stressed the crucial role of human rights education in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>62. During the interactive dialogue that followed the presentations by the experts, various 
delegates took the floor to share their views and concerns. Several delegates noted that the study 
was circulated late and did not allow sufficient time for them to consult with capitals and to 
prepare well-thought-out comments on the study. Many delegates specified that their comments 
were of a preliminary nature.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>63. One delegate expressed his concerns with regards to the section in the study on internally 
displaced persons. He noted that the guidelines on internally displaced persons mentioned in the 
text were not binding and the conclusion that an increasing number of States apply them was not 
convincing; therefore it needed reference. The delegate pointed out that the primary 
responsibility of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was 
refugees, while States should take care of problems related to internally displaced persons. 
Several delegates expressed their support for a strong emphasis on implementation, while several 
others highlighted the need for complementary standards.  
</p>
<p>64. Several delegates requested clarification on the experts&#8217; recommendation for a convention 
on human rights education. The questions raised were about the possible content of such a 
convention and which body would take the lead in drafting it, and whether the elaboration should 
be entrusted to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
or to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>65. Another delegate pointed out that a distinction should be made between racial 
discrimination and discrimination in general. The same delegate warned that a specific group of 
countries would not support any reference to sexual orientation, gender and disabilities in 
Durban follow-up work as they were not considered in the context of racial discrimination and 
the framework of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>66. One delegate underlined that statements suggesting that there were no substantive gaps and 
no need for complementary standards were not consistent with the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, as such a request was made in the document. With regards to the 
arguments of implementation and application of international norms, the delegate proposed to 
include the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination as an item in the agenda of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>67. One delegate noted that many of the issues analysed in the study were substantive and 
constituted parts of the mandates of other existing mechanisms within the United Nations 
system, and that the study should have dealt exclusively with racism and racial discrimination. 
Discrimination on the basis of descent and issues connected with a caste system were therefore 
inconsistent with racism and racial discrimination and that they were not contained in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>68. One delegate supported the findings in the study, especially the section on the positive 
obligations of States, but cautioned that a gradual approach was needed. The delegate also 
agreed with the finding that human rights and humanitarian law were not mutually exclusive and 
that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination needed to look further into 
multiple forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>69. One delegate asserted that there was a contradiction in interpretation regarding the scope of 
protection of existing treaty bodies and that some of the comments and recommendations in the 
study went beyond the mandate of those treaty bodies. The delegate recommended that there 
should be new complementary standards, not simply further elaboration of recommendations by 
treaty bodies.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>70. One delegate enquired about the best way to move forward regarding the proposal for a 
convention on human rights education, which would go beyond article 7 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. He also agreed with the 
section in the study relating to multiple forms of racism and the importance of such a section. He 
enquired about the possibility of identifying tools to help better understand multiple forms of 
racism.  
</p>
<p>71. In addressing some of the comments raised by delegates, Professor Goldschmidt explained 
that, in the study, the experts had tried to address questions on substantive gaps that fell under 
United Nations human rights treaties while taking into consideration new manifestations of 
racism and discrimination. With regard to multiple forms of discrimination, she explained that it 
was a complex area, as it was not always clear which grounds should be taken into consideration 
when dealing with multiple discrimination.  
</p>
<p>72. Professor Petrova took the floor to address the concern expressed by some delegates that 
the study emphasized only the strengthening of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and concluded that there was no need for complementary 
standards. She stated that the study went beyond answering the question as to whether there were 
gaps. According to the experts, the problem was not only one of lack of implementation, but of 
insufficiency of standards, as some of the existing standards could benefit from further 
development. They were therefore also arguing in favour of more detailed standards.  
</p>
<p>73. Professor Petrova reiterated the existence of a gap regarding human rights education, as 
there was no legally binding document establishing the duty to promote non-discrimination, 
tolerance and equality of rights irrespective of race, ethnicity and other related grounds through 
human rights education. With regard to definitions of racism and xenophobia, she stated that the 
experts had been guided by the language in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
She also restated the importance of recognizing multiple forms of racism and defining strategies 
to tackle them.  
</p>
<p>74. Professor Maluwa addressed the question asked by one delegate as to the extent to which, 
if any, socio-economic factors and the millennium development goals played a role in the 
production of the study. He admitted that the study did not reflect those areas, although the 
experts did have detailed discussions on their impact on racism. One example concerned the 
various discussions the experts held on environmental degradation and their consequences as 
related to racism. However, given the exigencies imposed by the scope of their mandate, the 
experts decided to adhere to the themes outlined in the Chairman&#8217;s conclusions during the fourth 
session of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>75. In relation to internally displaced persons, Professor Maluwa responded to a delegate&#8217;s 
concerns at the lack of reference to the draft African Union convention on the rights of internally 
displaced persons in Africa. He reminded delegates of paragraph 2 of Human Rights Council 
resolution 1/5, which created the mandate of the experts and specified that the experts were to 
study the content and scope of the substantive gaps in international instruments to combat 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that there was no reference 
to regional instruments therein, which explained the lack of reference to any regional 
instruments, scholarly reports or studies.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>76. Mr. Anwar focused on human rights education and the strong recommendation that 
religious schools should teach human rights education, which would increase understanding and 
could help to prevent misunderstanding and hatred.  
</p>
<p>77. Serguei Lazarev of UNESCO took the floor to comment on the readiness of that body to 
elaborate and/or to contribute to the elaboration of a human rights instrument on education to 
combat racism. He also emphasized that the experience accumulated by UNESCO over the years 
in that particular area put it in a favourable position regarding the elaboration of such an 
instrument. He also referred to the role of publications on education and human rights, and listed 
various books published by UNESCO. 
</p>
<p>78. The Chairman of the group of experts addressed some of the questions from the delegates. 
In particular, he stated that the recognition by States under article 14 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination on the competence of the 
Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals 
within its jurisdiction could improve the implementation of the Convention. He also expressed 
the view that the development of national action plans would make an important contribution in 
combating racism. With regard to the impression that the selection of some of the issues 
examined in the study was arbitrary, he explained that the theme on multiple forms of 
discrimination was proposed by the Working Group in the conclusions of the Chairman at its 
fourth session and that the experts had simply followed the guidelines in paragraph 2 of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>79. The Chairman made concluding remarks and thanked the experts for the work performed 
on an extremely complex subject. He stated that it was important to decide what was to be done 
in the future. A starting point would be to read through the two studies in more detail, as they 
were very dense texts. He also stated that, pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 3/103, he 
would transmit the study to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the 
Elaboration of Complementary Standards to the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  First part of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS </b></p>
<p><b>National action plans 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Working Group urges States, in accordance with paragraph 66 of the Durban 
Programme of Action, to establish and implement without delay national policies and 
action plans to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
including their gender-based manifestations. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Working Group emphasizes that it is essential for States to recognize the 
presence of individuals or groups of individuals who are victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including multiple and aggravated 
forms of discrimination within their jurisdictions. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The Working Group affirms that the adoption of measures to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance at the international, regional and 
national levels are likely to remain ineffective if those measures are not accompanied by a 
comprehensive understanding of racial discrimination and related intolerance and effective 
implementation measures. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Working Group recalls that the importance of implementing national action 
plans in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance has 
been emphasized in various recommendations contained in its previous reports. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Complementary international standards 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Working Group affirms that the preliminary exchange of view with the highly 
qualified experts selected to produce a base document outlining substantive gaps in the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and 
make concrete recommendations on the means and avenues to bridge these gaps was very 
fruitful. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Working Group recognizes the independence and competence of the experts and 
looks forward to the fulfilment of their mandate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>

<p>86. <b>The Working Group expresses the need for States, as bearers of the primary 
responsibility for national action plans, to involve all stakeholders, including victims, 
national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and civil society in 
general in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of national action plans 
as a tool to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to recognize the importance of national action 
plans and other measures that serve to strengthen efforts to combat and monitor racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Working Group encourages States to take adequate measures to ensure 
appropriate human and financial resources are made available in the consultations leading 
to the preparation, elaboration, implementation and monitoring of national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Working Group calls on States to analyse, review and update all existing laws 
and policies which could have a potentially adverse effect on the preparation, 
implementation and monitoring of national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to ensure that national action plans are 
consistent with international human rights instruments to which they are parties, and in 
particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The Working Group calls upon States that have not yet done so to establish 
mechanisms and to provide for an effective process to oversee the preparation and 
implementation of their national action plans. States are to ensure that these mechanisms 
are adequately funded and staffed. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Working Group encourages States to recognize the importance of education as 
an effective tool for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. Human rights education as a tool must be an integral component of any 
national plan of action. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Working Group invites States to ensure that the contents of national action plans 
allow for easy understanding by all stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group encourages States to request technical assistance from OHCHR

victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in the 
preparation, elaboration, implementation and monitoring of national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group recommends the creation of appropriate channels of 
communications to be established at the national level by States with non-governmental 
organizations, the private sector, the mass media and non-State actors to facilitate their 
involvement in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of national action plans, in 
order to promote and ensure ownership and transparency. 
</b></p>

and evaluation and implementation of their national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Working Group invites States to periodically review and update their national 
action plans. It encourages States to establish objectives, benchmarks and indicators to 
monitor the implementation of national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Working Group encourages States to ensure that they establish, update and/or 
adapt their mechanisms for the collection of disaggregated data in accordance with 
international standards for the protection of personal information in order to ensure 
inclusiveness in national action plans of all victims of racism. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>The Working Group calls upon States, as requested in the Durban Programme of

the preparation and implementation of national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Working Group invites OHCHR to post on the Internet relevant information on 
Durban follow-up activities, thereby facilitating the exchange of information on the 
follow-up and implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and 
contributing to a higher visibility of those activities. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Working Group invites OHCHR to increase its collaboration with 
United Nations agencies and country teams with regard to the follow-up and 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</b></p>

capacity to assist States in the preparation and implementation of national action plans. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Second part of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Working Group notes the study submitted by the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination on possible measures to strengthen implementation through 
optional recommendations or the update of its monitoring procedures, and the study 
submitted by the five experts on the contents and scope of substantive gaps in the existing
