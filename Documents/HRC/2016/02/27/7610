<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session 
from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Afghanistan was held at the 2nd 
meeting, on 27 January 2014. The delegation of Afghanistan was headed by Mohammad 
Qasim Hashemzai, Senior Advisor, Ministry of Justice. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 
January 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Afghanistan: Benin, Estonia and the United 
Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Afghanistan: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

Denmark, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, 
Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation affirmed the commitment of Afghanistan to the 
promotion and the protection of human rights, in particular women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. 
That commitment was evident at the national level in the provisions of the Constitution and 
various laws, and in policies and plans that had been enacted in accordance with the 
Constitution and international obligations. The Government had taken major steps to 
pragmatically implement human rights conventions and to prepare and present national 
reports on the status of their implementation. 
</p>
<p>6. Afghanistan had gone through the first UPR cycle in May 2009, and received 143 
recommendations. At that time, Afghanistan had declared its support for most of those 
recommendations; only 10 did not enjoy its support. It had taken the recommendations 
seriously, undertaking a number of initiatives in various ministries and institutions in 
Afghanistan. To prepare the report for the second UPR cycle, the Government had 
established a national process, whereby civil society and human rights institutions had been 
involved in the process of data collection and report analysis. The report had been prepared 
on the basis of a plan of action the Government had created in 2012 for follow-up to the 
recommendations. </p>


<p>7. The Government had actively promoted and protected civil and political rights in 
Afghanistan. Afghanistan was a good example in the region with respect to promoting 
freedom of speech, freedom of the media and freedom of associations without censorship. 
</p>
<p>8. The President of Afghanistan constantly met with representatives of national and 
international media, human rights activists and women&#8217;s rights defenders. The High 
Council of Media, composed of representatives of civil society, media groups and the 
Ministry of Information and Culture, was working to protect the rights and activities of the 
media and journalists. 
</p><p>9. Afghanistan was currently preparing for the presidential and provincial council 
elections. The Government had invited international observers to monitor the process of fair 
and free elections. According to the Independent Election Commission, in 2013 3,305,799 
citizens, 1,140,854 of whom were women, had received voting cards to participate in the 
elections. Human rights organizations and civil society activists would closely monitor the 
upcoming elections. The political opposition groups freely organized their political 
programmes without any intervention from the Government. There were 59 registered 
political parties in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>10. Afghan citizens had access to health care, education, employment and trade unions. 
</p>
<p>11. The Constitution guaranteed education as a right of all citizens; education was 
provided free of charge and in native languages up to the bachelor&#8217;s degree level . 
</p>
<p>12. Owing to efforts made by Afghanistan to improve the quality and quantity of 
education, the following progress had been made between 2009 and 2013: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Schools had been constructed, increasing the total number from 11,460 schools in 
2009 to 15,169 in 2013; of those, 2,267 were allocated to girls 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The number of students had increased from 6,504,715 in 2009 to 8,643,940 in 2013; 
of those, 3,353,991 were female 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A total of 135 million books had been printed between 2009 and 2013, at a cost of 
US$ 90 million 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The number of students enrolled in vocational schools had increased from 18,296 in 
2009 to 71,625 in 2013; 11 per cent of those were female 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The number of training centres for literacy had increased from 20,031 in 2009 to 
26,486 in 2013, providing courses to 563,460 students 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Total enrolment in higher education had increased from 52,000 in 2009 to 220,000 
in 2013 
</p>
<p>13. In accordance with the Constitution, the Government was obliged to provide free 
health services for all Afghan citizens without any discrimination. 
</p>
<p>14. With respect to health services, various policies and strategies had been developed. 
Of particular note were: the public health programme entitled &#8220;Health for all Afghans&#8221;, 
covering the period 2012&#8211;2020; the System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition 
project, aimed at supporting health-care provision for the period 2013&#8211;2018; the Health and 
Human Rights Strategy and the Gender Strategy; and the Health Financing Policy 2012&#8211;
</p><p>2020. 
</p>
<p>15. Recent data indicated that substantial improvements had been made in the health-
care sector. For example, the maternal mortality ratio had dropped from 1,600 to 327 deaths 
per 100,000 live births, the under-five mortality rate had been reduced from 257 to 97 
deaths per 1,000 live births and the infant mortality rate had decreased from 129 to 77 </p>


<p>deaths per 1,000 live births. About 46 per cent of infants had received the measles 
vaccination and the rate of polio vaccination had increased from 50 to 95 per cent. 
</p>
<p>16. The main challenge, however, was the lack of security in some of the remote areas 
of Afghanistan. Terrorist groups targeted schools, hospitals and other public-service 
institutions. Teachers, health workers, women activists and childcare staff were considered 
to be the most targeted groups. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government continued the process of legal reform in the light of the 
international conventions that Afghanistan had ratified. The Government had reviewed 73 
laws, 34 regulations and 27 strategies, including the Civil Code, the Penal Code, the 
Juvenile Code, the Elimination of Violence against Women Law and the Citizenship Law. 
</p>
<p>18. Women&#8217;s rights and gender equality remained a top priority for the Government. 
Afghan women constituted 27 per cent of legislators in the Parliament. Women occupied 25 
per cent of government jobs, including 9 per cent of those at decision-making levels. Girls 
currently represented about 40 per cent of the nearly 9 million children attending school in 
Afghanistan. About 30 per cent of the school teachers and 15 per cent of the university 
lecturers were women. In terms of the workforce in other areas, Afghan women constituted 
24 per cent in the health-care sector, 5 per cent in security and 30 per cent in agriculture. 
Women also accounted for 20 per cent of the enrolment in higher education and 35 per cent 
of the participants in vocational training. Women represent at least 50 per cent of those 
working in the country&#8217;s independent media and civil society groups. 
</p>
<p>19. In addition to fostering greater participation of women in the above-mentioned 
sectors, the Government had adopted various measures for the protection of women and the 
prevention of violence against them in the previous four years. Of particular note were: (a) 
the adoption of the Elimination of Violence against Women Law; (b) the establishment of 
special prosecution offices for cases of violence against women; (c) the establishment of the 
High Commission for Prevention of Violence against Women and provincial offices thereof 
in 23 provinces; (d) the establishment of 16 protection centres/shelters for women victims 
of family violence; (e) the establishment of departments of women&#8217;s affairs in 32 
provinces; (f) the establishment of gender units in 22 ministries; and (g) the establishment 
of a gender and human rights unit within the police academy. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government was developing a national plan of action on women, peace and 
security for beyond 2014, with a view to adopting additional measures to increase the 
participation of women, to prevent violence against women and to provide relief and 
recovery services. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government had adopted appropriate measures to ensure that children were 
protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the legislative 
provisions of the Labour Law, the Juvenile Code and the human trafficking law and of the 
policy provisions and activities under, inter alia, the National Strategy for Children at Risk 
and the national plan of action on children in armed conflict. Afghanistan had also received 
from the United Nations a 15-point road map on further implementation of the national plan 
of action on children in armed conflict that the Government intended to approve and 
implement. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government continued to stand firm in fighting corruption. Several measures, 
including the adoption of the Anti-Corruption Law and the establishment of civil and 
military anti-corruption prosecution units and tribunals, had been taken. 
</p>
<p>23. The Constitution prohibited torture and inhuman, humiliating and cruel punishment 
under all circumstances. In order to track torture-related cases, human rights units and 
supervisory boards had been established in the Ministry of the Interior, the National 
Directorate of Security and the Ministry of Defence. The second report of Afghanistan </p>


<p>under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT) was being prepared and would be submitted in September 2014. 
</p><p>24. Afghanistan still faced a number of challenges, relating to terrorism, extremism, 
narcotics and insecurity in some parts of the country, that had slowed progress in the area of 
human rights and the implementation of transitional justice. 
25. Poverty and corruption had made it difficult to tackle those challenges. The scarcity 
of resources to finance a nationwide welfare programme was another challenge. 
</p>
<p>26. Afghanistan was a war-torn country that had achieved enormous gains and successes 
in the previous 12 years in various areas, including human rights; those achievements had 
been won in the face of exceptionally tough conditions and ongoing challenges. 
</p>
<p>27. Afghanistan was strongly determined to take effective measures to strengthen its 
capabilities, in collaboration with the international community. 
</p>
<p>28. The head of the delegation concluded his introductory remarks by stating that the 
implementation of programmes and reforms aimed at promoting and protecting human 
rights in Afghanistan required the cooperation and participation of all governmental bodies 
and civil society, as well as direct cooperation and support from the international 
community, in particular international organizations active in the area of human rights. He 
expressed hope that Afghanistan would gradually witness greater improvements in human 
rights.

killings. It expressed concern about acts against freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>123. Algeria noted that further efforts were required to promote human rights, 
particularly in the areas of judicial reform, the fight against discrimination and the 
strengthening of human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>124. Argentina encouraged Afghanistan to take more vigorous action to implement the 
Elimination of Violence against Women Law. 
</p>
<p>125. Sweden welcomed the enactment of the Elimination of Violence against Women 
Law, but noted that women continued to suffer discrimination and abuse. 
</p>
<p>126. Austria expressed its concern about impunity and called for further efforts to ensure 
accountability.  
</p>
<p>127. Bahrain noted that, notwithstanding intensified efforts to promote gender equality, 
discrimination against women and girls persisted. 
</p>
<p>128. Kyrgyzstan commended the measures taken to improve the quality and quantity of

equality and non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>129. The delegation recalled that the combined initial and second periodic reports on the 
implementation of CEDAW had been considered in 2013; it would provide the Committee 
its national plan of action for that implementation. The committee responsible for reviewing 
the Penal Code and other laws would do so in the light of the international human rights 
conventions to which Afghanistan was a party. Afghanistan intended to accede to the 
Optional Protocol to CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>130. The delegation confirmed that forced marriage and child marriage were still major 
challenges in Afghanistan. However, the Government had taken specific measures </p>


<p>regarding that issue, including: the signing by relevant bodies of the Protocol for the 
Elimination of Violence against Women and the Elimination of Child and Forced 
Marriages; the incorporation of forced and child marriage as a crime in the Family Law and 
the Elimination of Violence against Women Law; and awareness-raising through media 
campaigns, workshops, seminars and campaigns at the provincial level. Regarding &#8220;running 
away&#8221;, the delegation confirmed that running away from home was not a crime. The 
Government would not punish a woman or a girl for running away from home unless 
crimes were associated with that act. Regarding the media, the country&#8217;s record had 
improved over a period of 12 years; there were currently more than 55 television stations, 
150 radio stations and 1,000 printing and publication companies in the country. Article 34 
of the Constitution recognized freedom of speech. Journalism-related issues were regulated 
by the Law on Mass Media. A number of amendments had recently been made to the Law 
on Mass Media for the benefit of media organizations and journalists. The delegation 
confirmed that media organizations could prepare their programmes free of censorship by 
or intervention from the Government. However, oversight of and support activities for 
media organizations were carried out through the Ministry of Information and Culture and 
the High Council of Media. 
</p>
<p>131. Regarding the role of women in the peace process in Afghanistan, the delegation 
confirmed that the Government believed in the Afghan-led peace process, with the 
participation of women and the inclusive structure of peace negotiations. In addition to the 
nine female members of the High Peace Council, several members of the provincial peace 
committees and the Secretariat of the High Peace Council were women. The High Peace 
Council activities were guided by a gender-balance strategy that guaranteed the presence of 
women at the negotiations table. 
</p>
<p>132. The head of the delegation stated that the Penal Code criminalized honour killing 
and that perpetrators of such crimes were not exonerated. The Penal Code was currently 
under review; the article on honour killing most probably would be revised in line with the 
State&#8217;s commitment to the international community and CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>133. Regarding the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, the head of the 
delegation stated that the Commission had been established in accordance with the Afghan 
Constitution and General Assembly resolution 48/134. The principles relating to the status 
of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris 
Principles) had also been considered during the recent selection of the members of the 
Commission. The Commission was the most influential institution monitoring human rights 
in Afghanistan and maintained its independence. A total of US$2 million had been 
allocated for its budget: US$500,000 for 2012 and US$1.5 million for 2013. 
</p><p>134. The delegation stated that a legal aid programme had been set up and that there was 
a law on legal aid, which benefited women and girls in particular; the aid was free of 
charge. 
</p>
<p>135. The head of the delegation concluded his remarks by thanking all international 
partners and human rights monitoring bodies for their continued and fruitful assistance and 
cooperation, which helped Afghanistan strengthen its commitment to human rights. He 
expressed his gratitude to all those countries that supported and helped Afghanistan and that 
were interested in the issues of Afghanistan, and to all those who had participated in the 
Working Group. The head of the delegation thanked the President of the Council and the 
participants for the interactive discussions. He stated that the people of Afghanistan were 
striving towards development and the enjoyment of human rights in a nation affected by 
generations of war and terrorism. He affirmed the State&#8217;s commitment to respecting, 
promoting and protecting human rights. </p>
