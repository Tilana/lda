DISCLOSURES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) of the Company includes “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These
statements express a belief, expectation or intention and generally are accompanied by words that convey
projected future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements may include projections and
estimates concerning the Company’s capital expenditures, liquidity, capital resources and debt profile, the
potential effects of a restructuring transaction on the Company’s operations, management, and employees,
the Company’s ability to consummate a restructuring transaction, the timing and success of specific
projects, outcomes and effects of litigation, claims and disputes, elements of the Company’s business
strategy, compliance with governmental regulation of the oil and natural gas industry, including
environmental regulations, acquisitions and divestitures and the effects thereof on the Company’s financial
condition and other statements concerning the Company’s operations and financial performance and
condition. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate,” “assume,”
“target,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “potential,” “could,” “may,” “foresee,” “plan,”
“goal,” “should,” “intend” or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. The
Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about
future events. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in
light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future
developments as well as other factors the Company believes are appropriate under the circumstances.
The actual results or developments anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, may
not have the expected consequences to or effects on the Company’s business or results. Such statements
are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from
those projected in such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the
date hereof. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements
unless required by law, and it cautions readers not to rely on them unduly. While the Company’s
management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject
to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties
relating to, among other matters, the risks and uncertainties discussed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Form 10-
K”) and in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report.
The forward-looking statements related to one or more plans of reorganization (the “Plan”) involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by other forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, including but not limited to potential adverse effects related to the following: potential
restructuring of the Company’s outstanding debt and related effects on the holders of the Company’s
outstanding equity; potential effects of the industry downturn on the Company’s business, financial
condition and results of operations; potential limitations on the Company’s ability to maintain contracts and
other critical business relationships; requirements for adequate liquidity to fund operations in the future,
including obtaining sufficient financing on acceptable terms; and other matters related to the potential
restructuring and indebtedness, including any defaults related thereto.

SANDRIDGE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Chapter 11 Proceedings
On May 16, 2016, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively with the
Company, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy
Petitions constitutes an event of default that accelerated the Company’s obligations under its senior credit
facility, its Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and its Unsecured Notes (as defined below). Under
the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under such agreements and instruments are stayed from taking any
action against the Company as a result of an event of default.
Debtor-In-Possession. The Company and the Debtors are currently operating as debtors in possession in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court has granted
motions filed by the Company that were designed primarily to mitigate the impact of the Chapter 11
proceedings on the Company’s operations, customers and employees. As a result, the Company is able to
conduct normal business activities and pay all associated obligations for the period following its
bankruptcy filing and is authorized to pay and has paid certain pre-petition obligations, including for
employee wages and benefits, goods and services provided by certain vendors, transportation of the
Company's production, royalties and costs incurred on the Company’s behalf by other working interest
owners. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 case, all transactions outside the ordinary course of
business require the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Automatic Stay. Subject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 filings
automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Company and efforts by creditors to
collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims. Absent an order from
the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all of the Debtors’ pre-petition liabilities are subject to settlement under
the Bankruptcy Code.
Restructuring Support Agreement. Prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, on May 11, 2016, the
Company entered into a restructuring support and lock-up agreement (including term sheets and other
exhibits attached thereto, the “Restructuring Support Agreement” or “RSA”). The RSA sets forth, subject to
certain conditions, the commitments and obligations of the Debtors and the Consenting Creditors (as
defined in the RSA) to support a comprehensive restructuring of the Company’s long-term debt (the
“Restructuring Transactions”). The Restructuring Transactions will be effectuated through a plan of
reorganization (the “Plan”) filed in the Chapter 11 proceedings as described further below.
The RSA commits each of the Debtors to, among other things, and subject to certain conditions: (a) support
and take all reasonably necessary and appropriate actions to obtain approval by the Bankruptcy Court of
the Plan and to effectuate the Restructuring Transactions, (b) take no action that is inconsistent or is likely
to interfere with the Restructuring Transactions, and (c) comply with certain operating covenants.
The RSA may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, including, the failure to meet certain
milestones related to the consensual use of cash collateral and the Plan, and upon certain breaches by the
Debtors and the Consenting Creditors under the RSA. The RSA is subject to termination if the effective
date of the Plan has not occurred within 225 days of the bankruptcy filing. There can be no assurance that
the Plan will be consummated.
Plan of Reorganization. The Company filed the Plan and a related disclosure statement with the
Bankruptcy Court on May 18, 2016. The Plan is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. On July 15,
2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Company’s disclosure statement with respect to the Plan, and
the Company is in the process of soliciting votes with respect to the Plan. The Company intends to seek
confirmation of the Plan at a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court, currently scheduled to begin September

If the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors would exit Chapter 11 pursuant to the terms of
the Plan. Under the Plan, the claims against and interests in the Debtors are organized into classes based,
in part, on their respective priorities. The Plan provides that, upon emergency from bankruptcy:
•
First Lien Credit Agreement. Claims under the senior credit facility will receive their proportionate share of
(a) $35.0 million in cash and (b) participation in the $425.0 million New First Lien Exit Facility.

(Unaudited)
Senior Secured Note Claims. The Senior Secured Notes will receive their proportionate share of (a) the
New Mandatory Convertible Debt, and (b)  85% of the post-reorganization new common stock in the
•reorganized Company (the “New Common Stock”), as fully diluted by the New Mandatory Convertible
Debt measured through the conversion date, subject to dilution by (i) the Warrants, (ii) a Rights Offering, if
any, and (iii) the Employee Incentive Plan. Holders of Senior Secured Notes may also be entitled to
participate in the Rights Offering under specified circumstances.
•
General Unsecured Claims. The Company’s general unsecured claims, including the Unsecured Notes,
will receive their proportionate share of (a) $10.0 million in cash, (b) 15% of the New Common Stock, as
fully diluted by the New Mandatory Convertible Debt measured through the conversion date, subject to
dilution by the Employee Incentive Plan, the Rights Offering, and the Warrants, (c) the Warrants, (d) the
cash proceeds of the $35.0 million New Building Note, and (e) the Rights Offering. Holders of general
unsecured claims, including the Unsecured Notes, may also be entitled to participate in the Rights
Offering under specified circumstances.
•
Preferred and Common Stock. The Company’s existing 7.0% and 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred
stock and common stock will be canceled and released under the Plan without receiving any recovery on
account thereof.
•
Rights Offering. The Restructuring Support Agreement entitles the Debtors to implement a Rights Offering
for up to $150.0 million of the New Common Stock at a valuation of the lesser of (a) $1.215 billion or (b)
90% of the equity value under the Plan. The Consenting Creditors are exclusively entitled to purchase the
Rights Offering equity until the earlier of 30 days following approval of a disclosure statement by the
Bankruptcy Court, 15 days before the date of the confirmation hearing set forth in the disclosure statement
order or 90 days after the Chapter 11 filing.
The Plan provides for the following new debt and other instruments:
New First Lien Exit Facility. The New First Lien Exit Facility will have an initial borrowing base of $425.0
million with no borrowing base redeterminations to occur until October 2018 and semiannual borrowing
base redeterminations thereafter. The New First Lien Exit Facility will mature on the earlier of March 31,
2020, or 40 months from the Effective Date, with interest payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 4.75% per
annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The New First Lien Exit Facility will be secured by (i) first-priority
mortgages on at least 95% of the present value of the proved developed producing reserves and 95% of
the present value of all proved reserves included in the most recently delivered reserve report, (ii) a first-
priority perfected pledge of capital stock of each credit party and their respective wholly owned
subsidiaries and (iii) a first-priority security interest in the cash, cash equivalents, deposit, securities and
other similar accounts, and a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible (other
than the Company’s corporate buildings in Oklahoma City) and intangible assets of the credit parties
(including but not limited to as-extracted collateral, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general
intangibles, investment property, intellectual property, real property and the proceeds of the foregoing).
The New First Lien Exit Facility is subject to a variety of other terms and conditions including conditions
precedent to funding, financial covenants, and various other covenants and representations and
warranties.
New Mandatory Convertible Debt. The New Mandatory Convertible Debt will have a principal amount of
$300.0 million. The New Mandatory Convertible Debt will mandatorily convert to 46.5% of the New
Common Stock no later than four years after the Effective Date or upon the occurrence of certain specified
conversion events. The New Mandatory Convertible Debt is subject to being fully or partially secured by
springing liens in the same collateral as the New First Lien Exit Facility only upon the occurrence of
certain specified litigation events expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business of the
reorganized Company.
Warrants. The Warrants to purchase up to 12.5% of the New Common Stock will be exercisable at any
time, in whole or in part, until their expiration date for a per share price based upon a $1.625 billion
•
•
•
aggregate value of the New Common Stock at the trailing 30-day volume-weighted average price. The
expiration date for the Warrants will be six years from the Effective Date.
•
New Building Note. The New Building Note will have a principal amount of $35.0 million and be secured
by first priority mortgages on the Company’s headquarters facility and certain other non-oil and gas real
property located in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Interest will be payable on the New Building
Note at 6% per annum for the first year following the Effective Date, 8% per annum for the second year
following the Effective Date, and 10% thereafter through maturity. Interest will be payable in kind from the
Effective Date through the earlier of September 30, 2020, 46 months from the
10

(Unaudited)
Effective Date or 90 days after the refinancing or repayment of the New First Lien Exit Facility and
thereafter in cash. The New Building Note will mature five years after the Effective Date. Under the
Restructuring Support Agreement, certain holders of the Unsecured Notes have committed to purchase the
New Building Note. On July 14, 2016, the Company conducted an auction for the New Building Note,
which auction yielded a winning bid in the amount of $27.0 million in cash.
The Plan contemplates the following additional terms, among others:
•
Consensual Cash Collateral Use. The Company intends to fund ongoing operations and other cash
needs during the Chapter 11 proceedings with cash on hand and cash from operations. Under the RSA,
the Consenting Creditors have consented to the use of cash collateral during the Chapter 11 Cases
through the effective date of the Plan, subject to certain terms, conditions, and termination events.
•
Releases. The Plan provides for releases of specified claims held by the Debtors, the Consenting
Creditors, and certain other specified parties against one another and for customary exculpations and
injunctions.
•
Employee Incentive Plan. The Employee Incentive Plan contemplates the issuance of up to 10% of pro
forma ownership interests in the reorganized Company to officers and/or other employees of the
reorganized Company. The Employee Incentive Plan will be subject to approval of the board of directors
of the reorganized Company.
Executory Contracts. Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume,
assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is
treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain
exceptions, relieves the Debtors from performing their future obligations under such executory contract or
unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for
damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to rejected contracts or leases may assert
unsecured claims in the Bankruptcy Court against the applicable Debtors’ estate for such damages.
Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure existing
monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of
future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with the
Debtors, including where applicable a quantification of the Company’s obligations under any such
executory contract or unexpired lease of the Debtors, is qualified by any overriding rejection rights the
Company has under the Bankruptcy Code.
Potential Claims. The Debtors have filed with the Bankruptcy Court schedules and statements setting forth,
among other things, the assets and liabilities of each of the Debtors, subject to the assumptions filed in
connection therewith. These schedules and statements may be subject to further amendment or
modification after filing. Certain holders of pre-petition claims that are not governmental units were required
to file proofs of claim by the deadline for general claims, (the “bar date”), which was set by the Bankruptcy
Court as July 22, 2016.
Differences between amounts scheduled by the Debtors and claims by creditors are being investigated
and will be reconciled and resolved to within an immaterial amount in connection with the claims resolution
process. In light of the expected number of creditors, the claims resolution process may take considerable
time to complete and likely will continue after the Debtors emerge from bankruptcy. Accordingly, the
ultimate number and amount of allowed claims is not presently known, nor can the ultimate recovery with
respect to allowed claims be presently asserted.
Reorganization Expenses. The Company and the Debtors have incurred and will continue to incur
significant costs associated with the reorganization, primarily legal and professional fees. The amount of
these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, are expected to significantly affect the Company’s
results of operations. In accordance with applicable guidance, certain costs associated with the bankruptcy
proceedings have been recorded as reorganization items within our accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016. For
additional information, see “Reorganization Items” below.
Financial Statement Classification of Liabilities Subject to Compromise. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016, includes amounts classified as liabilities
subject to compromise, which represent liabilities the Company anticipates will be allowed as claims in the
Chapter 11 case. These amounts represent the Debtors’ current estimate of known or potential obligations
to be resolved in connection with the Chapter 11 proceedings, and may differ from actual future settlement
amounts paid. Differences between liabilities estimated and claims filed, or to be filed, will be investigated

and resolved in connection with the claims resolution process. The Company will continue to evaluate
these liabilities throughout the Chapter 11 process and adjust amounts as necessary. Such adjustments
may be material.
Liabilities subject to compromise includes amounts related to the rejection of various executory contracts
and unexpired leases. Additional amounts may be included in liabilities subject to compromise in future
periods if additional executory contracts and unexpired leases are rejected. Conversely, to the extent that
executory contracts or unexpired leases are not rejected and are instead assumed, liabilities associated
therewith would constitute post-petition liabilities which will be satisfied in full under the Plan. The nature of
many of the potential claims arising under the Debtors’ executory contracts and unexpired leases has not
been determined at this time, and therefore, such claims are not reasonably estimable at this time and may
be material.

Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 (in thousands):

Reorganization Items. The Company and the Debtors have incurred significant one-time costs associated
with the reorganization, primarily the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and related unamortized
debt premiums, discounts and derivatives, as well as adjustments for estimated allowable claims related to
the Company’s legal proceedings and executory contracts approved for rejection by the Bankruptcy Court,
and professional fees incurred subsequent to the Chapter 11 filings for the restructuring process. These
costs, which are being expensed as incurred, significantly impact the Company’s results of operations.

2. Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015
have been derived from the audited financial statements contained in the Company’s 2015 Form 10-K. The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the accounting policies stated in the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the 2015 Form
10-K. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have
been condensed or omitted, although the Company believes that the disclosures contained herein are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, the
accompanying financial statements include all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments
unless otherwise disclosed, necessary to state fairly the information in the Company’s accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included
in the 2015 Form 10-K. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Given risks involved with respect to the Chapter
11 proceedings, there is no assurance that the Company will emerge from bankruptcy proceedings as a
going concern, and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial adjustments
and/or changes in ownership, are also subject to uncertainty. As a result of these uncertainties,
management has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern as it is currently structured.
The Company has applied Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 852 “Reorganizations” in preparing
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. ASC 852 requires that the financial
statements, for periods subsequent to the Chapter 11 filings, distinguish transactions and events that are
directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly,
certain revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or
incurred during the bankruptcy proceedings, including losses related to executory contracts that have been
approved for rejection by the Bankruptcy Court, and unamortized deferred financing costs, premiums,
discounts and derivatives associated with debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise, are recorded
as reorganization items. In addition, pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the Chapter 11
process have been classified on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016
as liabilities subject to compromise. These liabilities are reported at the amounts the Company anticipates
will be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. See Note 1 for
more information regarding reorganization items.
While operating as debtors in possession under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may sell or otherwise
dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities in amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated
financial statements, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise as permitted in the
ordinary course of business. Further, a plan or reorganization could materially change the amounts and
classification in the Company’s historical financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2015,
the Company fully consolidated the activities of the Royalty Trusts as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for
which the Company was the primary beneficiary. Activities of the Royalty Trusts attributable to third party
ownership were presented as noncontrolling interest and included as a component of equity in the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. As discussed further below, during the
six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company proportionately consolidated the activities of the
Royalty Trusts. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Significant Accounting Policies. For a description of the Company’s significant accounting policies, see
Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K as well as the items noted
below.
Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial statements to
conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the Company’s
previously reported results of operations.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.

The more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates include: oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) reserves; impairment tests of long-lived assets; depreciation, depletion
and amortization; asset retirement obligations; determinations of significant alterations to the full cost pool
and related estimates of fair value used to allocate the full cost pool net book value to divested properties,
as necessary; income taxes; valuation of derivative instruments; contingencies; accrued revenue and
related receivables; and estimation of liabilities subject to compromise. Although management believes
these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ significantly.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis,” which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, affecting all
reporting entities involved with limited partnerships or similar entities, particularly industries such as the oil
and gas, transportation and real estate sectors. The guidance simplifies and improves current guidance by
placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest and reducing the
frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a
VIE. The requirements of the guidance were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, which resulted in the determination that the
Royalty Trusts no longer qualify as VIEs. As a result, for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016, the Company proportionately consolidated the activities of the Royalty Trusts. Under the
proportionate consolidation method, the Company accounts for only its share of each Royalty Trust’s asset,
liabilities, revenues and expenses within the appropriate classifications in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02 on a
modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2016 that
resulted in decreases of approximately $243.4 million to total assets and approximately $510.2 million to
noncontrolling interest and increases of approximately $9.7 million to accounts payable and approximately
$257.1 million to retained earnings.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,"
which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The guidance is effective on a
retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within
that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2016, and
resulted in a decrease of approximately $69.1 million to other assets and current maturities of long-term
debt in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December
31, 2015, with no impact to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations. See Note 1 for treatment and classification of unamortized debt issuance costs subsequent to
filing the Chapter 11 petitions. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Presentation and
Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,” which
excludes line-of-credit debt issuance costs from the scope of ASU 2015-03. The guidance was adopted on
January 1, 2016 in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2015-03 by making an accounting policy election
to present line-of-credit arrangement debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the
deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether
there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit. The adoption of this policy resulted in no impact
to the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use
in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue
recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle requires that an entity
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Certain of the provisions also amend or supersede existing guidance applicable to the recognition of a
gain or loss on transfers of nonfinancial assets that are not an output of an entity’s ordinary activities,
including sales of property, plant and equipment and real estate. In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date," which
defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, and either a full retrospective or
modified approach may be used for adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that
the updated standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern,” which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-
concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform
interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the
date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if “conditions or events
raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.” The guidance is effective
14

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
(Unaudited)
for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption
permitted. The Company evaluated the effect of the guidance and has determined that it will have no
impact on its related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which requires companies to
recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases of assets on
the balance sheet. The guidance requires adoption by application of a modified retrospective transition
approach for existing long-term leases and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, “Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments”
which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the
payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts, which is one of
the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative. The amendments eliminate diversity in practice in
assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments. The guidance requires adoption by
application of a modified retrospective approach to existing and future debt instruments effective for fiscal
years after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Share-Based Payment Accounting”
which was part of the FASB simplification initiative and involves several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance requires
adoption by various application methods. All amendments must be adopted in the same period. The
amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
3. Divestiture
Divestiture of West Texas Overthrust (the “WTO”) Properties and Release from Treating Agreement. On
January 21, 2016, the Company paid $11.0 million in cash and transferred ownership of substantially all of
its oil and natural gas properties and midstream assets located in the Piñon field in the WTO to Occidental
Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and was released from all past, current and future claims and
obligations under an existing 30 year treating agreement between the companies. As of the date of the
transaction, the Company had accrued approximately $111.9 million for penalties associated with
shortfalls in meeting its delivery requirements under the agreement since it became effective in late 2012.
The Company recognized a loss of approximately $89.1 million on the termination of the treating
agreement and the cease-use of transportation agreements that supported production from the Piñon field
and reduced its asset retirement obligations associated with its oil and natural gas properties by $34.1
million.

4. Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures and reports certain assets and liabilities on a fair value basis and has classified
and disclosed its fair value measurements using the following levels of the fair value hierarchy:
Level 1
Level 2
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
 
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 
Measurement based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the
Level 3fair value measurement and less observable for objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no
market activity).
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, which may affect the valuation of the fair value of
assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The determination of the fair
values, stated below, considers the market for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, the
associated credit risk and other factors. The Company considers active markets as those in which
transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis. The Company has assets and liabilities classified in each level of the
hierarchy as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as described below.
Level 1 Fair Value Measurements
Investments. The fair value of investments, consisting of assets attributable to the Company’s non-qualified
deferred compensation plan, is based on quoted market prices. Investments are included in other assets in
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Level 2 Fair Value Measurements
Commodity Derivative Contracts. The fair values of the Company’s oil and natural gas fixed price swaps
and oil and natural gas collars are based upon inputs that are either readily available in the public market,
such as oil and natural gas futures prices, volatility factors and discount rates, or can be corroborated from
active markets. Fair value is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow model or option pricing
model using the applicable inputs, discussed above. The Company applies a weighted average credit
default risk rating factor for its counterparties or gives effect to its credit default risk rating, as applicable, in
determining the fair value of these derivative contracts. Credit default risk ratings are based on current
published credit default swap rates.
Mandatory Prepayment Feature - PGC Senior Secured Notes. In conjunction with the acquisition of and
termination of a gathering agreement with Piñon Gathering Company, LLC (“PGC”) in October 2015, the
Company issued the PGC Senior Secured Notes with a $78.0 million principal value. These notes bear
payment terms identical to and are secured by the same assets as the 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due
2020 issued by the Company in June 2015 as discussed in Note 6. The 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due
2020 issued in June 2015 and PGC Senior Secured Notes (collectively, “Senior Secured Notes”) mature
on June 1, 2020; provided, however, that if on October 15, 2019, the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Company’s unsecured 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 exceeds $100.0 million, the Senior
Secured Notes mature on October 16, 2019. The issuance of the PGC Senior Secured Notes at a
substantial discount, as discussed in Note 6 and Note 7, resulted in the treatment of the mandatory
prepayment feature contained in those notes as an embedded derivative that met the criteria to be
bifurcated from its host contract, the PGC Senior Secured Notes, and accounted for separately from those
notes. Prior to the Chapter 11 filings, the mandatory prepayment feature contained in the PGC Senior
Secured Notes was recorded at fair value each reporting period based upon values determined through
the use of discounted cash flow models of the PGC Senior Secured Notes both (i) with the mandatory
prepayment feature and (ii) excluding the mandatory prepayment feature. Subsequent to the Chapter 11
filings in May 2016, the value of the mandatory repayment feature of $2.5 million was written off and is
included in reorganization items in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016.

Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Commodity Derivative Contracts. The fair values of the Company’s natural gas basis swaps are based
upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the derivative contracts. These values were reviewed
internally for reasonableness through the use of a discounted cash flow model using non-exchange traded
regional pricing information. Additionally, the Company applied a weighted average credit default risk
rating factor for its counterparties or gave effect to its credit risk, as applicable, in determining the fair value
of these commodity derivative contracts. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value
measurement of the Company’s natural gas basis swaps is the estimate of future natural gas basis
differentials. Significant increases (decreases) in natural gas basis differentials could result in a
significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs and the range and
weighted average of these inputs used in the fair value measurements of the Company’s natural gas basis

Debt Holder Conversion Feature. The Company’s 8.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 and 7.5%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (collectively, the “Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes” and together
with the Senior Unsecured Notes, the “Unsecured Notes”), each contain a conversion option whereby,
prior to the Chapter 11 filings, the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes holders had the option to convert
the notes into shares of Company common stock. Further, with respect to any such conversions prior to the
second anniversary of the issuance of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes, in addition to the shares
deliverable upon conversion, holders were entitled to receive an early conversion payment. These
conversion features were identified as embedded derivatives that met the criteria to be bifurcated from their
host contracts, the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes, and accounted for separately from those notes.
Prior to the Chapter 11 filings, the holder conversion features were recorded at fair value each reporting
period. Subsequent to the Chapter 11 filings in May 2016, the value of the debt holder conversion features
of $7.3 million was written off and is included in reorganization items in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016.
The fair values of the holder conversion features were determined using a binomial lattice model based on
certain assumptions including (i) the Company’s stock price, (ii) risk-free rate, (iii) recovery rate, (iv) hazard
rate and (v) expected volatility. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of
the conversion features is the hazard rate, an estimate of default probability. Significant increases
(decreases) in the hazard rate could result in significantly (lower) higher fair value measurement. The
significant unobservable inputs and range and weighted average of these inputs used in the fair value
measurement of the conversion options at December 31, 2015 are included in the table below.

Guarantee. The Company guaranteed on behalf of Fieldwood Energy, LLC (“Fieldwood”) certain plugging
and abandonment obligations associated with the sale of its Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast oil and natural
gas properties (the “Gulf Properties”) from the date of closing in February 2014 until the Company was
released from the guarantee in the third quarter of 2015. The fair value of this guarantee was based on the
present value of estimated future payments for plugging and abandonment obligations associated with the
Gulf Properties, adjusted for the cumulative probability of Fieldwood’s default prior to the Company’s
release by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management from its obligation under the guarantee (3.71% at
December 31, 2014). The discount and probability of default rates were based upon inputs that are readily
available in the public market, such as historical option adjusted spreads of the Company’s senior notes,
which are publicly traded, and historical default rates of publicly traded companies with credit ratings
similar to Fieldwood. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value

measurement of the guarantees was the estimate of future payments for plugging and abandonment of
approximately $372.0 million, which was developed based upon third-party quotes and then-current actual
costs.

6. Debt
Chapter 11 Proceedings
The Chapter 11 filings constituted an event of default with respect to the Company’s existing debt
obligations. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, the obligations arising under the Company's pre-petition
senior credit facility, Senior Secured Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes and Convertible Senior Unsecured
Notes became immediately due and payable, but the enforcement of any obligations thereunder was
automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 filings.
Reclassification of Debt. The balance outstanding under the senior credit facility of $448.9 million, par
value of the Senior Secured Notes of $1.3 billion, par value of the Senior Unsecured Notes of $2.2 billion
and par value of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes of $87.6 million have been reclassified as
liabilities subject to compromise on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet
at June 30, 2016. Additionally, a non-cash charge to write off all of the related unamortized debt issuance
costs and associated discounts and premiums of approximately $158.6 million and the fair value of
associated debt derivatives of $9.8 million as of May 16, 2016 related to the Company's debt is included in
reorganization items in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for
the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, as discussed in Note 1.
See Note 5 for the fair values and carrying values of the senior notes outstanding at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, there were no amounts outstanding under the
senior credit facility, and the carrying values of the senior notes were net of unamortized discounts,
premiums, and deferred costs of $342.6 million, and included the fair value of debt derivatives of $32.3
million.
Senior Credit Facility
The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constitutes an event of default that accelerated its
obligations under the senior credit facility. Due to the Chapter 11 proceedings, however, most acts to
exercise remedies under the Company’s credit facility, including those related to defaults of various
financial covenants and ratios, were stayed as of May 16, 2016, the date of the Chapter 11 petition filing,
and continue to be stayed. No further funds are available to the Company under the credit facility.
The terms of the senior credit facility contain certain financial covenants, including maintenance of agreed
upon levels for the (a) ratio of total secured debt under the senior credit facility to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), which could not exceed 2.00:1.00 at each quarter end
and (b) ratio of current assets to current liabilities, which must be at least 1.0:1.0 at each quarter end. For
the purpose of the current ratio calculation, any amounts available to be drawn under the senior credit
facility are included in current assets, and unrealized assets and liabilities resulting from mark-to-market
adjustments on the Company’s commodity derivative contracts are disregarded. The senior credit facility
matures by its terms on the earlier of March 2, 2020 and 91 days prior to the earliest date of any maturity
under or mandatory offer to repurchase the Company’s currently outstanding notes.
The senior credit facility also contains various covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of
its subsidiaries to: grant certain liens; make certain loans and investments; make distributions; redeem
stock; redeem or prepay debt; merge or consolidate with or into a third party; or engage in certain asset
dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The terms of the senior
credit facility allow the Company to redeem or purchase outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes for up to
$275.0 million in cash subject to certain limitations. Additionally, the senior credit facility limits the ability of
the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness with certain exceptions. See
Note 1 for information regarding the Company’s Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11 proceedings.
The obligations under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by certain Company subsidiaries and are
required to be secured by first priority liens on all shares of capital stock of certain of the Company’s
material present and future subsidiaries, all of the Company’s intercompany debt, and certain of the
Company’s other assets, including proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves representing at least 80.0% of
the discounted present value (as defined in the senior credit facility) of proved oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves of the Company.
At the Company’s election, interest under the senior credit facility, as amended, is determined by reference
to (a) the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited LIBOR (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin between
1.750% and 2.750% per annum or (b) the “base rate,” which is the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus
0.5%, (ii) the prime rate published by Royal Bank of
21
Table of Contents
SANDRIDGE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
(Unaudited)
Canada under the senior credit facility or (iii) the one-month Eurodollar rate (as defined in the senior credit
facility) plus 1.00% per annum, plus, in each case under scenario (b), an applicable margin between
0.750% and 1.750% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly for base rate loans and at the applicable
maturity date for LIBOR loans, except that if the interest period for a LIBOR loan is six months or longer,
interest is paid at the end of each three-month period. Quarterly, the Company pays commitment fees
assessed at an annual rate of 0.5% on any available portion of the senior credit facility.
On March 11, 2016, the administrative agent notified the Company that the lenders had elected to reduce
the borrowing base to $340.0 million from $500.0 million pursuant to a special redetermination. On April
20, 2016, the Company submitted for consideration by its lenders additional properties to serve as
collateral under the senior credit facility to support a borrowing base of $500.0 million. On May 11, 2016, in
connection with the execution of the RSA and in exchange for waivers from the requisite percentage of
lenders with respect to certain specified defaults and events of defaults under the senior credit facility, the
Company permanently repaid $40.0 million of borrowings to the lenders, which payment correspondingly
reduced the lenders’ commitments. See Note 1 for further discussion of the senior credit facility and the
plan of reorganization.
The senior credit facility had $448.9 million drawn at June 30, 2016 and had $10.2 million in outstanding
letters of credit. Additionally, at June 30, 2016, the Company had incurred $1.3 billion in junior lien debt
subject to an intercreditor agreement as a result of the issuance of Senior Secured Notes in June 2015 and
the PGC Senior Secured Notes in October 2015.
Senior Secured Notes
The Company issued $1.25 billion of 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 in June 2015. Net proceeds
from the issuance were approximately $1.21 billion after deducting offering expenses, a portion of which
was used to repay amounts outstanding at that time under the Company’s senior credit facility. The Senior
Secured Notes were issued to qualified institutional buyers eligible under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act.
Additionally, the Company issued $78.0 million par value of the PGC Senior Secured Notes in conjunction
with the acquisition of and termination of a gathering agreement with PGC in October 2015. Because the
PGC Senior Secured Notes were issued as partial consideration for the acquisition and termination, these
notes were recorded at fair value of approximately $50.3 million, which included mandatory prepayment
feature liabilities and a discount. Fair value at issuance was determined based upon the then-current
market value of the Senior Secured Notes. The unamortized portions of the discount and the carrying value
of the mandatory prepayment feature as of the date of the Chapter 11 filings, May 16, 2016, were written off
to reorganization items on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 as noted above.
The Company accrued interest on its Senior Secured Notes at a fixed rate of 8.75% prior to the Chapter 11
filings, with no interest accrued subsequent to the filings. The Senior Secured Notes are by their terms
redeemable, in whole or in part, prior to their maturity at specified redemption prices and are jointly and
severally guaranteed unconditionally, in full, on a second-priority secured basis by certain of the
Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
The Senior Secured Notes are secured by second-priority liens on all of the Company’s assets that secure
the senior credit facility on a first-priority basis; provided, however, the security interest in those assets that
secure the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees are contractually subordinated to liens thereon that
secure the credit facility and certain other permitted indebtedness. Consequently, the Senior Secured
Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to the credit facility and such other indebtedness to
the extent of the value of such assets.
Maturity Date and Mandatory Prepayment Feature. Pursuant to the indenture, the Senior Secured Notes
mature on June 1, 2020; provided, however, that if on October 15, 2019, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the unsecured 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 exceeds $100.0 million, the Senior
Secured Notes mature on October 16, 2019. See further discussion of the mandatory prepayment feature
Note 4 and Note 7, which with respect to the PGC Senior Secured Notes was an embedded derivative that
was accounted for separately from these notes, prior to being written-off to reorganization items on the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016, as discussed in Note 1.
Indenture. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that restrict the
Company’s ability to take a variety of actions, including limitations on the payment of dividends, incurrence
of indebtedness, create liens, enter into consolidations or mergers, purchase or redeem stock or
subordinated or unsecured indebtedness, certain dispositions and transfers
22

(Unaudited)
of assets, transactions with related parties, make investments and refinance certain indebtedness. The
Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constitutes an event of default that accelerated the
Company’s obligations under its Senior Secured Notes. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under
these debt agreements are stayed from taking any action against the Company as a result of an event of
default. See Note 1 for additional details about the Company’s Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11
proceedings.
Senior Unsecured Notes
The Company accrued interest on its Senior Unsecured Notes at a fixed rate through the date of the
Chapter 11 filings, with no interest accrued subsequent to the filings. The Senior Unsecured Notes are by
their terms redeemable, in whole or in part, prior to their maturity at specified redemption prices and are
jointly and severally guaranteed unconditionally, in full, on an unsecured basis by certain of the
Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries. See Note 14 for condensed financial information of the subsidiary
guarantors. Certain of the Senior Unsecured Notes were issued at a discount or a premium. Prior to the
Chapter 11 filings, the discount or premium was amortized to interest expense over the term of the
respective series of Senior Unsecured Notes. The unamortized portions of the discount or premium as of
the date of the Chapter 11 filings, May 16, 2016, were written off to reorganization items on the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 as noted above.
The unamortized portion of the debt issuance costs associated with the Senior Unsecured Notes as of the
date of the Chapter 11 filings, May 16, 2016, was written off to reorganization items on the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 as noted above.
Indentures. Each of the indentures governing the Company’s Senior Unsecured Notes contains covenants
that restrict the Company’s ability to take a variety of actions, including limitations on the incurrence of
indebtedness, payment of dividends, investments, asset sales, certain asset purchases, transactions with
related parties and consolidations or mergers. The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constitutes
an event of default that accelerated the Company’s obligations under its Senior Unsecured Notes. Under
the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under these debt agreements are stayed from taking any action against
the Company as a result of an event of default. See Note 1 for additional details about the Company’s
Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11 proceedings.
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes
    
The Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes were issued in conjunction with exchanges and repurchases of
Senior Unsecured Notes that took place in August and October 2015. The Convertible Senior Unsecured
Notes are guaranteed by the same guarantors that guarantee the Senior Unsecured Notes and are subject
to covenants and bear payment terms substantially identical to those of the corresponding series of Senior
Unsecured Notes of similar tenor, other than the conversion features, described further below, and the
extension of the final maturity by one day. The Company accrued interest on its Convertible Senior
Unsecured Notes at a fixed rate through the date of the Chapter 11 filings, with no interest accrued
subsequent to the filings. The transactions were determined to be an extinguishment of each of the Senior
Unsecured Notes exchanged. As such, the newly-issued Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes were
recorded at fair value on the date of issuance.
The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constitutes an event of default that accelerated the
Company’s obligations under its Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the
creditors under these debt agreements are stayed from taking any action against the Company as a result
of an event of default, and further conversions of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes into shares of
the Company’s common stock were also stayed. See Note 1 for additional details about the Company’s
Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11 Cases.
Conversions to Common Stock. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, holders of $200.5
million aggregate principal amount ($67.4 million net of discount and including holders’ conversion feature)
of 8.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 and $31.6 million aggregate principal amount ($10.4 million
net of discount and holders’ conversion feature) of 7.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 exercised
conversion options applicable to those notes, resulting in the issuance of approximately 84.4 million
shares of Company common stock and aggregate cash payments of $33.5 million for accrued interest and
early conversion payments. The conversions resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $41.3
million, including the write off of $4.3 million of net unamortized debt issuance costs, which is included in
other income on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2016. There were no conversions during the three-month period ended June 30, 2016.

Both a default by the Company under its senior credit facility and a Chapter 11 filing by the Company
constitute defaults under its commodity derivative contracts. As a result, certain commodity derivative
contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2016 and prior to their contractual maturities (“early
settlements”) after the Chapter 11 filings occurred, resulting in $11.5 million of cash receipts. Additionally,
new agreements have been executed with four counterparties for current and future trading purposes.
Commodity Derivatives
The Company is exposed to commodity price risk, which impacts the predictability of its cash flows from
the sale of oil and natural gas. The Company seeks to manage this risk through the use of commodity
derivative contracts, which allow the Company to limit its exposure to commodity price volatility on a
portion of its forecasted oil and natural gas sales. None of the Company’s commodity derivative contracts
may be terminated prior to contractual maturity solely as a result of a downgrade in the credit rating of a
party to the contract. Cash settlements and valuation gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts
are included in gain on derivative contracts in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations. Commodity derivative contracts are settled on a monthly or quarterly basis. Derivative assets
and liabilities arising from the Company’s commodity derivative contracts with the same counterparty that
provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2016,
the Company’s commodity derivative contracts consisted of fixed price swaps and basis swaps, which are
described below:
Fixed price swaps
Basis swaps
The Company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to
the counterparty over a specified period for a contracted volume.
 
The Company receives a payment from the counterparty if the settled price differential is
greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the settled price
differential is less than the stated terms of the contract, which guarantees the Company a
price differential for oil or natural gas from a specified delivery point.
The Company recorded losses on commodity derivative contracts of $8.0 million and $33.0 million for the
three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which include net cash receipts upon
settlement of $32.4 million and $74.4 million, respectively. The Company recorded a loss (gain) on
commodity derivative contracts of $5.2 million and $(16.8) million for the six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes net cash receipts upon settlement of $58.0 million and $211.3
million, respectively. Included in the net cash receipts for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 are $11.5 million of cash receipts related to early settlements.
Master Netting Agreements and the Right of Offset. The Company has master netting agreements with all
of its commodity derivative counterparties and has presented its derivative assets and liabilities with the
same counterparty on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the netting provisions,
the Company's maximum amount of loss under commodity derivative transactions due to credit risk is
limited to the net amounts due from its counterparties. As of June 30, 2016, the counterparties to the
Company’s open commodity derivative contracts consisted of two financial institutions, which are also
lenders under the Company’s senior credit facility. The Company is not required to post additional
collateral under its commodity derivative contracts as the majority of the counterparties to the Company’s
commodity derivative contracts share in the collateral supporting the Company’s senior credit facility. The
following tables summarize (i) the Company's commodity derivative contracts on a gross basis, (ii) the
effects of netting assets and liabilities for which the right of offset exists based on master netting
arrangements and (iii) for the Company’s net derivative liability positions, the applicable portion of shared
collateral under the senior credit facility (in thousands):

Debt Holder Conversion Feature. As discussed further in Note 4 and Note 6, the Convertible Senior
Unsecured Notes contain a conversion feature that prior to the Chapter 11 filings was exercisable at the
holders’ option. This conversion feature was identified as an embedded derivative as the feature (i)
possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics
of the host contract, the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes, and (ii) separate, stand-alone instruments
with the same terms would qualify as derivative instruments. As such, the holders’ conversion feature was
bifurcated and accounted for separately from the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes. The holders’
conversion feature was recorded at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value included in
interest expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations prior to the Chapter 11
filings, at which time, the remaining value of the holders’ conversion feature was written-off and included in
reorganization items on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for
the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016.

Mandatory Prepayment Feature - PGC Senior Secured Notes. As discussed further in Note 4 and Note 6,
the Senior Secured Notes contain a mandatory prepayment feature that prior to the petition date was
triggered if the outstanding principal amount of the unsecured 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 exceeds
$100.0 million on October 15, 2019. With respect to the PGC Senior Secured Notes, which were issued at
a substantial discount, this mandatory prepayment feature was identified as an embedded derivative as the
feature (i) possessed economic characteristics that were not clearly and closely related to the economic
characteristics of the host contract, the PGC Senior Secured Notes, and (ii) separate, stand-alone
instruments with the same terms would qualify as derivative instruments. As such, the mandatory
prepayment feature contained in the PGC Senior Secured Notes was bifurcated and accounted for
separately from those notes. The mandatory prepayment feature contained in the PGC Senior Secured
notes was recorded at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value included in interest

8. Commitments and Contingencies
Chapter 11 Proceedings
Commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases automatically stayed many of the proceedings and actions
against the Company noted below, including actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise
control over the property of the Company’s bankruptcy estates, and the Company intends to seek authority
to pay all general claims in the ordinary course of business notwithstanding the commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases in a manner consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement. The Plan in the
Chapter 11 Cases, if confirmed as contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement, will provide for
the treatment of claims against the Company’s bankruptcy estates, including pre-petition liabilities that
have not otherwise been satisfied or addressed during the Chapter 11 Cases. See Note 1 for further
discussion about the Company’s Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11 Cases.
In connection with the estimation of general unsecured claims asserted in its bankruptcy, the Company is
required to establish reserves for litigation matters in amounts that it estimates will be characterized as
“allowed” in the claims administration process.  Such amounts include potential settlements that the
Company would not entertain outside of the bankruptcy process. In that regard, the Company recorded an
adjustment to adjust the reserve for the below described litigation of $20.5 million, which is included in
reorganization items in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for
the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, to bring the total reserves for current anticipated
allowed claim amounts for litigation matters to $24.5 million, which is included in liabilities subject to
compromise on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Additionally, effective June 6, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued orders allowing the Company to
reject nine long-term executory contracts, including two firm transportation service agreements, a drilling
carry obligation and various other agreements. Accordingly, the Company recorded an adjustment for the
rejected contracts of approximately $18.2 million, which is included in reorganization items in the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016, to bring the total estimated liability for the current anticipated claim amounts
related to such contracts to $27.5 million, which is included in liabilities subject to compromise on the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. See Note 1 for
further discussion of reorganization items and liabilities subject to compromise.
Legal Proceedings
On April 5, 2011, Wesley West Minerals, Ltd. and Longfellow Ranch Partners, LP filed suit against the
Company and SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC (collectively, the “SandRidge Entities”) in the
83rd District Court of Pecos County, Texas. The plaintiffs, who have leased mineral rights to the
SandRidge Entities in Pecos County, allege that the SandRidge Entities have not properly paid royalties
on all volumes of natural gas and CO2 produced from the acreage leased from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs
also allege that the SandRidge Entities have inappropriately failed to pay royalties on CO2 produced from
the plaintiffs' acreage that results from the treatment of natural gas at Occidental’s CO2 treatment plant in
Pecos County, Texas the (“Century Plant”). The plaintiffs seek approximately $45.5 million in actual
damages for the period of time between January 2004 and December 2011, punitive damages and a
declaration that the SandRidge Entities must pay royalties on CO2 produced from the plaintiffs' acreage
that results from treatment of natural gas at the Century Plant. The Commissioner of the General Land
Office of the State of Texas (“GLO”) is named as an additional defendant in the lawsuit as some of the
affected oil and natural gas leases described in the plaintiffs' allegations cover mineral classified lands in
which the GLO is entitled to one-half of the royalties attributable to such leases. The GLO has filed a cross-
claim against the SandRidge Entities asserting the same claims as the plaintiffs with respect to the leases
covering mineral classified lands and seeking approximately $13.0 million in actual damages, inclusive of
penalties and interest. On February 5, 2013, the Company received a favorable summary judgment ruling
that effectively removes a majority of the plaintiffs' and GLO's claims. On April 29, 2013, the court entered
an order allowing for an interlocutory appeal of its summary judgment ruling.
The plaintiffs appealed the rulings to the Texas Court of Appeals in El Paso. On November 19, 2014, that
court issued its opinion, which affirmed the trial court’s summary judgment rulings in part, but reversing
them in part. The Court of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment rulings in the SandRidge Entities’ favor
against the GLO. The court also affirmed the summary judgment rulings in the SandRidge Entities’ favor
against Wesley West Minerals, Ltd., on the largest oil and gas lease involved in the case, which accounted
for much of the total damages the plaintiffs are claiming. The court reversed certain rulings on other leases,
thus deciding those matters for the plaintiffs. The parties have petitioned the Supreme Court of Texas for
review of the

Court of Appeals’ decision. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining issues in the trial
court, as well as future appellate proceedings.
Between December 2012 and March 2013, seven putative shareholder derivative actions were filed in
state and federal court in Oklahoma:
•
•
•
•
Arthur I. Levine v. Tom L. Ward, et al., and SandRidge Energy, Inc., Nominal Defendant - filed on
December 19, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma

Lisa Ezell, Jefferson L. Mangus, and Tyler D. Mangus v. Tom L. Ward, et al., and SandRidge Energy, Inc.,
Nominal Defendant - filed on March 22, 2013 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma
•
Each lawsuit identified above was filed derivatively on behalf of the Company and names as defendants
current and former directors of the Company. The Hefner lawsuit also names as defendants certain current
and former directors and senior executive officers of the Company. All seven lawsuits assert overlapping
claims - generally that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, mismanaged the Company, wasted
corporate assets, and engaged in, facilitated or approved self-dealing transactions in breach of their
fiduciary obligations. The Depuy lawsuit also alleges violations of federal securities laws in connection
with the Company allegedly filing and distributing certain misleading proxy statements. The lawsuits seek,
among other relief, injunctive relief related to the Company's corporate governance and unspecified
damages.
On April 10, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma consolidated the Levine,
Depuy, Elliot, Brothers, and Ezell actions (the “Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation”) under the
caption “In re SandRidge Energy, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation,” appointed a lead plaintiff and
lead counsel, and ordered the lead plaintiff to file a consolidated complaint by May 1, 2013. On June 3,
2013, the Company and the individual defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the
consolidated complaint. On September 11, 2013, the court granted the defendants’ respective motions to
dismiss the consolidated complaint without prejudice, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended
consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint on October 9, 2013, in
which plaintiffs allege that: (i) the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Tom Ward, breached
his fiduciary duties by usurping corporate opportunities, (ii) certain of the Company’s current and former
directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, (iii) Mr. Ward and certain of the Company’s current and
former directors wasted corporate assets, (iv) certain entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Ward aided and
abetted Mr. Ward’s breaches of fiduciary duties, (v) Mr. Ward and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Ward
misappropriated the Company’s confidential and proprietary information, and (vi) entities allegedly
affiliated with Mr. Ward were unjustly enriched. On November 15, 2013, the Company and the individual
defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint. On September
22, 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss filed on behalf of the Company and the director
defendants. The court also granted in part and denied in part the respective motions to dismiss filed on
behalf of the other defendants.
On May 8, 2013, the court stayed the Romano action pending further order of the court. On October 29,
2014, the court granted plaintiff’s application to dismiss the action without prejudice.
On September 26, 2014, the Board formed a Special Litigation Committee (“SLC”), composed of two
independent and disinterested Company directors, and delegated absolute and final authority to the SLC
to review and investigate the claims alleged by the plaintiffs in the Federal Shareholder Derivative
Litigation and in the Hefner action, and to determine whether or how those claims should be asserted on
the Company’s behalf.

On November 30, 2015, the court stayed the Hefner action until further order of the court.
On October 7, 2015, the derivative plaintiffs in the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation, the SLC, and
the individual defendants in the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation (Tom Ward, Jim Brewer, Everett
Dobson, William Gilliland, Daniel Jordan, Roy Oliver Jr., and Jeffrey Serota), executed a Stipulation of
Settlement, which would result in a partial settlement of the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation by
settling all claims against the individual defendants, subject to certain terms and conditions, including the
approval of the court. Under the terms of the proposed partial settlement, the Company would implement or
agree to maintain certain corporate governance reforms, and the insurers for the individual defendants
would pay $38.0 million to an escrow fund, which would be used to pay certain expenses arising from
pending securities litigation and, to the extent funds remain after paying such expenses, would be paid to
the Company without any further restrictions on the Company’s use of such funds. The proposed partial
settlement expressly provides, among other terms, that the settling defendants deny all allegations of
wrongdoing and are entering into the settlement solely to avoid the costs, disruption, uncertainty, and risk
of further litigation.
On October 9, 2015, the court issued an Order granting preliminary approval of the Stipulation of
Settlement and, after notice and a hearing on December 18, 2015, the court issued a Final Judgment and
Order on December 22, 2015, granting final approval of the Stipulation of Settlement. The partial settlement
did not settle any of the derivative plaintiffs’ claims against non-settling defendants WCT Resources,
L.L.C., 192 Investments, L.L.C., and TLW Land & Cattle, L.P in the Federal Shareholder Derivative
Litigation. On January 12, 2016, a shareholder who objected to the Stipulation of Settlement filed a notice
of appeal of the court’s Final Judgment and Order approving the Stipulation of Settlement.
On March 31, 2016, the derivative plaintiffs in the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation, the SLC, and
the remaining defendants, WCT Resources, L.L.C., 192 Investments, L.L.C., and TLW Land & Cattle, L.P.,
executed a Stipulation of Settlement, which would resolve the remaining claims in the Federal Shareholder
Derivative Litigation. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the remaining defendants would make a
payment of $500,000 to the Company, less taxes, expenses, and incentive awards. Counsel for the
derivative plaintiffs have agreed that they will not seek reimbursement of expenses in excess of $120,000.
Counsel for the derivative plaintiffs have also agreed that they will not seek incentive awards for the two
named plaintiffs in excess of $15,000 each.
On April 6, 2016, the court issued an Order granting preliminary approval of the Stipulation of Settlement
and establishing procedures for notice to shareholders and consideration of any shareholder objections to
the settlement. The court also set a hearing for final approval of the proposed settlement on June 15, 2016.
On December 5, 2012, James Glitz and Rodger A. Thornberry, on behalf of themselves and all other
similarly situated stockholders, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the
Company. On January 4, 2013, Louis Carbone, on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated
stockholders, filed a substantially similar putative class action complaint in the same court and against the
same defendants. On March 6, 2013, the court consolidated these two actions under the caption “In re
SandRidge Energy, Inc. Securities Litigation” (the “Securities Litigation”) and appointed a lead plaintiff and
lead counsel. On July 23, 2013, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, which asserts a variety
of federal securities claims against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors,
among other defendants, on behalf of a putative class of (a) purchasers of SandRidge common stock
during the period from February 24, 2011 to November 8, 2012, (b) purchasers of common units of the
Mississippian Trust I in or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April 12, 2011, and (c)
purchasers of common units of the Mississippian Trust II (together with the Mississippian Trust I, the
“Mississippian Trusts”) in or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April 23, 2012. The claims are
based on allegations that the Company, certain of its current and former officers and directors, and the
Mississippian Trusts, among other defendants, are responsible for making false and misleading
statements, and omitting material information, concerning a variety of subjects, including oil and natural
gas reserves, the Company's capital expenditures, and certain transactions entered into by companies
allegedly affiliated with the Company's former CEO Tom Ward.
On May 11, 2015, the court dismissed without prejudice plaintiffs’ claims against the Mississippian Trusts
and the underwriter defendants. On August 27, 2015, the court dismissed without prejudice plaintiffs’
claims against the Company and the individual current and former officers and directors, and granted
plaintiffs leave to file a second amended consolidated complaint.
On October 23, 2015, plaintiffs filed their Second Consolidated Amended Complaint in which plaintiffs
assert federal securities claims against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and
directors on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of SandRidge common stock during the period
between February 24, 2011, and November 8, 2012. The claims are based on allegations that the
Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors are responsible for making false

and misleading statements, and omitting material information, concerning a variety of subjects, including
oil and gas reserves, the Company’s capital expenditures, and certain transactions entered into by
companies allegedly affiliated with the Company’s former CEO Tom Ward. Each of the Mississippian
Trusts has requested that the Company indemnify it for any losses it may incur in connection with the
Securities Litigation.
On July 15, 2013, James Hart and 15 other named plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas (the “Kansas District Court”) in an action undertaken
individually and on behalf of others similarly situated against SandRidge Energy, Inc., SandRidge
Operating Company, SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC, SandRidge Midstream, Inc., and Lariat
Services, Inc. In their Amended Complaint, plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to properly calculate
overtime pay for the plaintiffs and for other similarly situated current and former employees. The plaintiffs
further allege that the defendants required the plaintiffs and other similarly situated current and former
employees to engage in work-related activities without pay. The plaintiffs assert claims against the
defendants for (i) violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, (ii) violations of the Kansas Wage Payment
Act, (iii) breach of contract, and (iv) fraud, and seek to recover unpaid wages and overtime pay, liquidated
damages, statutory penalties, economic damages, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees
and costs, and both pre- and post-judgment interest.
On October 3, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Conditional Collective Action Certification and for
Judicial Notice to the Class and a Motion to Toll the Statute of Limitations. On October 11, 2013, the
defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma (the “Oklahoma District Court”). On February 25, 2014, the Kansas
District Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue to the Oklahoma District Court.
On April 2, 2014, the Oklahoma District Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and granted
plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint by April 16, 2014, which they did on such date. On July 1,
2014, the Oklahoma District Court granted plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Collective Action Certification
and for Judicial Notice to the Class, and denied plaintiffs’ Motion to Toll the Statute of Limitations.
On May 27, 2015, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit. Pursuant to such
agreement, the Company will establish a settlement fund from which to pay participating plaintiffs’ claims
as well as plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final negotiations
between the parties and court approval. During 2015, the Company established a $5.1 million reserve for
this lawsuit.
On June 9, 2015, the Duane & Virginia Lanier Trust, individually and on behalf of all others similarly
situated, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among other
defendants, on behalf of a putative class of (a) purchasers of common units of the Mississippian Trust I
pursuant or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April 7, 2011, and/or at other times during the
time period between April 7, 2011, and November 8, 2012 (the “Class Period”), and (b) purchasers of
common units of the Mississippian Trust II pursuant or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April
17, 2012, and/or at other times during the Class Period. The claims are based on allegations that the
Company, certain of its current and former officers and directors, and the Mississippian Trusts, among other
defendants, are responsible for making false and misleading statements, and omitting material information,
concerning a variety of subjects, including oil and natural gas reserves and the Company's capital
expenditures. The Company and the other defendants intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously. Each of the
Mississippian Trusts has requested that the Company indemnify it for any losses it may incur in connection
with this lawsuit.
On July 30, 2015, Barton Gernandt, Jr., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a
putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the
Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among other defendants, on behalf of
a putative class comprised of all persons, except the named defendants and their immediate family
members, who were participants in, or beneficiaries of, the SandRidge Energy, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the
“401(k) Plan”) at any time between August 2, 2012, and the present, and whose 401(k) Plan accounts
included investments in SandRidge common stock. The plaintiff purports to bring the action both
derivatively on the 401(k) Plan’s behalf pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (“ERISA”) §§ 409 and 502, and as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. The plaintiff’s claims are based on allegations that the defendants breached their fiduciary
duties owed to the 401(k) Plan and to the 401(k) Plan participants by allowing the investment of the 401(k)
Plan’s assets in SandRidge stock when it was otherwise allegedly imprudent to do so based on the
financial condition of the Company and the fact the Company’s common stock was artificially inflated
because, among other things, the Company materially overstated the amount of oil being produced and the
ratio of oil to natural gas in one of its core holdings.

On August 19, 2015, Christina A. Cummings, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed
a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the
Company and certain of its current and former officers, among other defendants, on behalf of a putative
class comprised of all participants for whose individual accounts the 401(k) Plan held shares of the
Company’s common stock from November 8, 2012, to the present, inclusive. The plaintiff purports to bring
the action both derivatively on the 401(k) Plan’s behalf pursuant to ERISA §§ 409 and 502, and as a class
action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff’s claims are based on
allegations that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the 401(k) Plan and to the 401(k)
Plan participants by allowing the investment of the 401(k) Plan’s assets in SandRidge stock when it was
otherwise allegedly imprudent to do so based on the financial condition of the Company. On September
10, 2015, the Court consolidated this action with the Gernandt action.
On September 14, 2015, Richard A. McWilliams, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,
filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against
the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among other defendants, on behalf
of a putative class comprised of all persons, except the named defendants and their immediate family
members, who were participants in, or beneficiaries of, the 401(k) Plan at any time between August 2,
2012, and the present, and whose 401(k) Plan accounts included investments in the Company’s common
stock. The plaintiff purports to bring the action both derivatively on the 401(k) Plan’s behalf pursuant to
ERISA §§ 409 and 502, and as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The plaintiff’s claims are based on allegations that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to
the 401(k) Plan and to the 401(k) Plan participants by allowing the investment of the 401(k) Plan’s assets
in the Company’s common stock when it was otherwise allegedly imprudent to do so based on the
financial condition of the Company and the fact the Company’s stock was artificially inflated because,
among other things, the Company materially overstated the amount of oil being produced and the ratio of
oil to natural gas in one of its core holdings. On September 24, 2015, the Court consolidated this action
with Gernandt action.
On November 24, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint in the consolidated
Gernandt action. The Company intends to defend this consolidated lawsuit vigorously.
On November 18, 2015, Mickey Peck, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, filed a First
Amended Collective Action Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma against SandRidge Energy, Inc., and SandRidge Operating Company for violations of the Fair
Labor Standards Act. Plaintiff alleges that the Company improperly classified certain of its consultants as
independent contractors rather than as employees and, therefore, improperly paid such consultants a day
rate without paying any overtime compensation. On January 14, 2016, the Court entered an Order
conditionally certifying the class and providing for notice.
On January 12, 2016, Lisa Griggs and April Marler, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated,
filed a putative class action petition in the District Court of Logan County, Oklahoma, against SandRidge
Exploration and Production, LLC, and certain other oil and gas exploration companies. In their petition,
plaintiffs assert various tort claims based upon purported damage and loss resulting from earthquakes
allegedly caused by the defendants’ operations of wastewater disposal wells. Plaintiffs seek to certify a
class of “all residents of Oklahoma owning real property from 2011 through the time the Class is certified.”
On February 16, 2016, the defendants filed a Notice of Removal of the lawsuit to the Oklahoma District
Court. On April 8, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Remand the action back to the District Court of Logan
County, Oklahoma. On June 30, 2016, the Oklahoma District Court denied the plaintiffs’ Motion to Remand.
On July 21, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit without prejudice.
On February 12, 2016, Brenda Lene and Jon Darryn Lene filed a petition in the District Court of Logan
County, Oklahoma, against SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC, and certain other oil and gas
exploration companies. In their petition, plaintiffs assert various tort claims based on their allegations that
their home suffered damages due to earthquakes allegedly caused by the defendants’ operations of
wastewater disposal wells. On July 20, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit without
prejudice.
On April 11, 2016, Public Justice, on behalf of the Sierra Club, filed a civil action against SandRidge
Exploration and Production, LLC, among other defendants, in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the citizen suit
provision of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) to enforce alleged violations of RCRA
relating to earthquakes allegedly induced by the defendants’ injection and disposal into the ground of oil
and gas production wastes. Plaintiff seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants
by ordering them to (i) substantially reduce the amounts of production wastes being injected into the
ground, (ii) reinforce vulnerable

action complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that, commencing on or around December 27, 2007, and continuing until at least March 31, 2012,
the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the market for the purchases of oil and natural gas
leasehold interests and properties containing producing oil and natural gas wells located in certain areas
of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, in violation of Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Plaintiff seeks to certify two separate and distinct classes of members.
On March 10, 2016, Don Beadles, in Trust for the Alva Synagogue Church, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma against SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L.
Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff alleges that since as early as December 2007, and continuing until
at least as late as March 2012 (the “Relevant Class Period”), the defendants conspired to rig bids and
otherwise depress the amounts they paid to property owners for the acquisition of oil and gas leasehold
interests and producing properties located in certain areas of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, in
violation of Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of “[a]ll persons
and entities that, during the Relevant Class Period, provided or sold to one of more of the Defendants (a)
oil and gas leasehold interests on their property and/or (b) the producing properties, in exchange for lease
payments, including but not limited to lease bonuses.”
On March 24, 2016, Janet L. Lowry, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, filed a putative
class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that, commencing on or around December 27, 2007, and continuing until at least March 31, 2012,
the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the price of royalty and bonus payments exchanged for
purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests and interests in properties containing producing oil
and natural gas wells located in certain areas of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, in violation of
Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Plaintiff seeks to certify two separate and distinct classes of
members.
On April 15, 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma consolidated the
Thieme, Beadles, and Lowry cases under the caption “In re Anadarko Basin Oil and Gas Lease Antitrust
Litigation,” together with nine additional subsequently filed cases, as well as with any other cases pending
in the court, alleging similar violations under the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform
Act.
On March 29, 2016, Harold Koppitz, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, filed a putative
class action petition in the District Court of Woods County, Oklahoma, against SandRidge Energy, Inc. and
the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff alleges that, commencing on
or around February 1, 2007, and continuing until at least March 31, 2012, the defendants conspired to rig
bids and depress the market for purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests located within the
State of Oklahoma in violation of the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act. Plaintiff seeks to certify two separate
and distinct classes of members. On August 3, 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the Company from
this lawsuit without prejudice.
On April 26, 2016, the defendants filed a Notice of Removal of the lawsuit to the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. On that same date, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his petition.
On April 29, 2016, plaintiff filed a new petition in the District Court of Woods County, Oklahoma, against

On April 13, 2016, Wesley and Towanda Mallory, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,
filed a putative class action petition in the District Court of Stephens County, Oklahoma, against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiffs
allege that, commencing on or around December 27, 2007, and continuing until at least April 1, 2013 (the
“Class Period”), the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress prices for oil and natural gas leasehold
and working interests and producing properties within the State of Oklahoma in violation of the Oklahoma
Antitrust Reform Act. Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of “[a]ll Oklahoma citizens and entities that, during the
relevant Class Period, provided or sold to one of more of the Defendants (a) oil and gas leasehold interests
on their property and/or (b) the producing properties or interests relating to land located in the Anadarko
Basin Region, in exchange for lease payments, including

but not limited to lease bonuses.” On May 26, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice
the Company as a defendant in this action.
On February 4, 2015, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) Enforcement
Division in Washington, D.C., notified the Company that it had commenced an informal inquiry concerning
the Company’s accounting for, and disclosure of, its carbon dioxide delivery shortfall penalties under the
terms of the Gas Treating and CO2 Delivery Agreement, dated June 29, 2008, between SandRidge
Exploration and Production, LLC, and Oxy USA Inc.
Additionally, the Company received a letter from an attorney for a former employee at the Company (the
“Former Employee”). In the letter, the attorney alleged, among other things, that the Former Employee had
been terminated because he had objected to the levels of oil and gas reserves disclosed by the Company
in its public filings. Over 85% of such reserves were calculated by an independent petroleum engineering
firm.  The Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has retained an independent law firm to
review the Former Employee’s allegations and the circumstances of the Former Employee’s termination. In
addition, the Company reported the Former Employee’s allegations to the SEC staff, which thereafter
issued two subpoenas to the Company relating to the Former Employee’s allegations.  Counsel for the
Audit Committee is responding to both of these subpoenas.
During the course of the above inquiries, the SEC issued a subpoena to the Company seeking documents
relating to employment-related agreements between the Company and certain employees. The Company
is cooperating with this inquiry and, after discussion with the staff, the Company sent corrective letters to
certain current and former employees who had entered into agreements containing language that may
have been inconsistent with SEC rules prohibiting a company from impeding an individual from
communicating directly with the SEC about possible securities law violations. The Company also updated
its Code of Conduct and other relevant policies. On June 16, 2016, the SEC filed a proof of claim in the
Company’s Chapter 11 Cases in the amount of $1.2 million as a result of the SEC staff’s inquiry
concerning employment-related agreements. Counsel for the Company is in discussions with the SEC in
an effort to resolve the Company’s liability regarding these inquiries.
The Company continues to cooperate with the above inquiries.
In addition to the litigation described above, the Company is a defendant in lawsuits from time to time in the
normal course of business.
Risks and Uncertainties
The Company’s revenue, profitability and future growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing
and future prices for oil and natural gas, which depend on numerous factors beyond the Company’s control
such as overall oil and natural gas production and inventories in relevant markets, economic conditions,
the global political environment, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil
and natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the
future. The Company enters into commodity derivative arrangements in order to mitigate a portion of the
effect of this price volatility on the Company’s cash flows. See Note 7 for the Company’s open oil and
natural gas derivative contracts.
The Company depends on cash flows from operating activities and, as necessary, borrowings under its
senior credit facility to fund its capital expenditures. Based on current cash balances, cash flows from
operating activities and net borrowings under the senior credit facility in 2016, the Company expects to be
able to fund its planned capital expenditures budget, debt service requirements and working capital needs
for 2016; however, if current depressed oil or natural gas prices persist for a prolonged period or further
decline, they would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that may be economically
produced, which would further adversely impact the Company’s ability to comply with the financial
covenants under its senior credit facility. See Note 1 and Note 6 for further discussion of the financial
covenants in the senior credit facility.

9. Equity
Chapter 11 Proceedings
If confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan of Reorganization, as discussed in Note 1, provides that the
Company’s currently authorized common stock and 7.0% and 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred stock
will be canceled and released under the Plan without receiving any recovery on account thereof.
Common Stock
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued approximately 84.4 million shares
of common stock upon the exercise of conversion options by holders of approximately $232.1 million in par
value of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes. The Company recorded the issuance of common shares
at fair value on the various dates the exchanges occurred. There were no conversions of Convertible
Senior Unsecured Notes to shares of the Company’s common stock during the three-month period ended
June 30, 2016, and all potential future conversions have been stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 petition
filings. See Note 6 for additional discussion of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes transactions.
Preferred Stock Dividends
Prior to the Chapter 11 petition filings, dividends on the Company’s 8.5% and 7.0% convertible perpetual
preferred stock could be paid in cash or with shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s
election.
In the first quarter of 2016, prior to the February semi-annual dividend payment date, the Company
announced the suspension of payment of the semi-annual dividend on its 8.5% convertible perpetual
preferred stock. The Company suspended payment of the cumulative dividend on its 7.0% convertible
perpetual preferred stock during the third quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016, the Company’s accrued
dividends in arrears of $11.3 million and $21.0 million on its 8.5% and 7.0% convertible perpetual preferred
stock, respectively, were included in liabilities subject to compromise on the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company ceased accruing dividends on its 8.5% and 7.0%
convertible perpetual preferred stock as of May 16, 2016, in conjunction with the Chapter 11 petition filings.
In the first quarter of 2015, dividends of $11.3 million on the Company’s 8.5% convertible perpetual
preferred stock were paid in cash. For the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, the Company
paid a semi-annual dividend of $3.50 per share on its 7.0% convertible perpetual preferred stock by issuing
approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock. In accordance with the terms governing the 7.0%
convertible perpetual preferred stock, for purposes of the dividend payment, the value of each share issued
was determined by multiplying (i) the average volume-weighted share price for the 15 trading day period
ending April 28, 2015 by (ii) 95%. Based upon the common stock’s closing price on May 15, 2015, the
common stock issued had a market value of approximately $6.7 million, or $2.23 per each of the 3.0 million
shares of 7.0% convertible perpetual preferred stock outstanding, that resulted in a difference between the
fixed rate semi-annual dividend and the value of shares issued of approximately $3.8 million. This
difference was recorded as a reduction to preferred stock dividends in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015.
Paid and unpaid dividends included in the calculation of loss applicable to the Company’s common
stockholders and the Company’s basic loss per share calculation for the three and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

10. Income Taxes
The Company estimates for each interim reporting period the effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal
year and uses that estimated rate in providing for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis. The
provision for income taxes consisted of the following components for the three and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The
Company’s deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance due to a determination that it
is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized based on the weight of all
available evidence. The Company continues to closely monitor and weigh all available evidence,
including both positive and negative, in making its determination whether to maintain a valuation
allowance. As a result of the significant weight placed on the Company's cumulative negative earnings
position, the Company continued to maintain the full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset
at June 30, 2016. Thus the Company’s effective tax rate and tax expense for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 continue to be low as a result of the Company not recognizing an income tax
benefit associated with its net loss from the same periods.
    
Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382 addresses company ownership changes and specifically limits
the utilization of certain deductions and other tax attributes on an annual basis following an ownership
change. The Company experienced ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 during
2008 and 2010 that subjected certain of the Company’s tax attributes, including $929.4 million of federal
net operating loss carryforwards, to the IRC Section 382 limitation. These limitations could result in all or a
portion of the remaining $484.5 million limited net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused. None of
these limitations resulted in a current federal tax liability at June 30, 2016.
The Restructuring Transactions effectuated through the Plan may have a material impact on the
Company’s tax attributes, the full extent of which is currently unknown. Cancellation of indebtedness
income resulting from the Restructuring Transactions may reduce the Company’s tax attributes, including
but not limited to net operating loss carryforwards. Further, the Company will experience an IRC Section
382 ownership change upon confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court which could subject certain
remaining tax attributes to a more restrictive IRC Section 382 limitation. However, the Company is currently
analyzing alternatives within the IRC available to taxpayers in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in order
to minimize the impact of an ownership change on such tax attributes. Additionally, the Company has
incurred significant one-time costs associated with the Plan, a material amount of which are non-deductible
under the IRC.
At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a liability of approximately $0.1 million
for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not expect a significant change in its gross
unrecognized tax benefits balance within the next twelve months.
The Company’s only taxing jurisdiction is the United States (federal and state). The Company’s tax years
2012 to present remain open for federal examination. Additionally, tax years 2005 through 2011 remain
subject to examination for the purpose of determining the amount of remaining federal net operating loss
and other carryforwards. The number of years open for state tax audits varies, depending on the state, but
are generally from three to five years.

No incremental shares of potentially dilutive restricted stock awards or units were included for the three
and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 or 2015 as their effect was antidilutive under the treasury
stock method.
Potential common shares related to the Company’s outstanding 8.5% and 7.0% convertible perpetual
preferred stock covering 71.7 million shares for the three and six-month periods ended and June 30,
2015, were excluded from the computation of loss per share because their effect would have been
antidilutive under the if-converted method.
As a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, all conversions of the Company’s convertible perpetual
preferred stock and conversions of the Company’s outstanding 8.125% and 7.5% Convertible Senior
Unsecured Notes to common stock were stayed as of the date of the bankruptcy petition filings and as
such, there were no potential common shares related to convertible perpetual preferred stock or
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes at June 30, 2016. See Note 6 for discussion of common stock issued
in exchange for Senior Unsecured Notes and issuance of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes.

12. Share-Based Compensation
The Company has issued share-based compensation awards including restricted common stock awards,
restricted stock units, performance units and performance share units under the SandRidge Energy, Inc.
2009 Incentive Plan. Total share-based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value
for equity-classified awards and using the fair value at period end for liability-classified awards.
Chapter 11 Proceedings
The Plan of Reorganization, as discussed in Note 1, provides that the Company’s current common stock
will be canceled and new common stock will be issued upon emergence from bankruptcy. If the Plan of
Reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Company's currently existing share-based
compensation awards will also be canceled upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, which will
result in recognizing any previously unamortized expense related to the canceled awards on the date of
cancellation. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, the remaining value of the Company’s liability-classified
awards (restricted stock units which could be settled in cash or stock, restricted stock units which could be
settled only in cash, performance units, and performance shares units), which totaled $0.6 million at that
time, was reclassified and included in liabilities subject to compromise on the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016.
Restricted Common Stock Awards
The Company’s restricted common stock awards generally vest over a four-year period, subject to certain
conditions, and are valued based upon the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant. The following table presents a summary of the Company’s unvested restricted stock awards.

As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock
awards was $7.8 million. The remaining weighted-average contractual period over which this
compensation cost may be recognized is 1.7 years. The Company’s restricted stock awards are equity-
classified awards.
    
Allocation of Share-Based Compensation
Equity compensation provided to employees directly involved in exploration and development activities is
capitalized to the Company’s oil and natural gas properties. Equity compensation not capitalized is
recognized in general and administrative expenses, production expenses, cost of sales and midstream and
marketing expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and
six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized share-based compensation expense of
$2.0 million and $9.4 million, net of $0.5 million and $1.2 million capitalized, respectively. Share-based
compensation expense for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, includes $5.4 million for the
accelerated vesting of 1.3 million restricted common stock awards and an insignificant amount of expense
for the accelerated vesting of 1.8 million unvested restricted stock units, which may be settled in cash or
stock, related to the Company’s reduction in workforce during the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, the
Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 1.3 million unvested restricted stock units during the
first quarter of 2016, which were granted to the Company’s management and had an original vesting date
of December 31, 2016. This resulted in an insignificant amount of stock compensation expense which was

13. Business Segment Information
During the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, the Company had two reportable segments:
exploration and production and midstream services. These segments represent the Company’s two main
business units, each offering different products and services. The exploration and production segment is
engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties and includes the Company’s
proportionate share of the activities of the Royalty Trusts. The midstream services segment coordinates the
delivery of electricity to the Company’s exploration and production operations in the Mid-Continent. During
the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, the Company operated in a third reportable
segment, drilling and oilfield services; however, due to the discontinuance of the substantial majority of
activity within the drilling and oilfield services business during the first quarter of 2016, this business no
longer constitutes a reportable segment. The All Other columns in the tables below include items not
related to the Company’s currently reportable segments, including drilling and oilfield services activity and
the Company’s corporate operations.

14. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
The Company provides condensed consolidating financial information for its subsidiaries that are
guarantors of its registered debt. As of June 30, 2016, the subsidiary guarantors, which are 100% owned
by the Company, have jointly and severally guaranteed, on a full, unconditional and unsecured basis, the
Company’s outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes. The subsidiary guarantees (i) rank equally in right of
payment with all of the existing and future senior debt of the subsidiary guarantors; (ii) rank senior to all of
the existing and future subordinated debt of the subsidiary guarantors; (iii) are effectively subordinated in
right of payment to any existing or future secured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors to the extent of
the value of the assets securing such obligations; (iv) are structurally subordinated to all debt and other
obligations of the subsidiaries of the guarantors who are not themselves subsidiary guarantors; and (v) are
only released under certain customary circumstances. The Company’s subsidiary guarantors guarantee
payments of principal and interest under the Company’s registered notes.
The following condensed consolidating financial information represents the financial information of
SandRidge Energy, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary guarantors and its non-guarantor subsidiaries, as
debtors-in-possession, prepared on the equity basis of accounting. The non-guarantor subsidiaries,
including the Company’s proportionate share of the Royalty Trusts, majority-owned subsidiaries and
certain immaterial wholly owned subsidiaries, are included in the non-guarantors column in the tables
below. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows had the subsidiary guarantors operated as independent entities.

ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Introduction
The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the Company’s business,
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. This discussion and analysis
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report, as well as the Company’s
audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in the 2015 Form 10-K.
The Company’s discussion and analysis includes the following subjects:
•Overview;
•Results by Segment;
•Consolidated Results of Operations;
•Liquidity and Capital Resources;
•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and
•Valuation Allowance.
The financial information with respect to the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
discussed below, is unaudited. In the opinion of management, this information contains all adjustments,
which consist only of normal recurring adjustments unless otherwise disclosed, necessary to state fairly the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The results of operations for the
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full fiscal year.
Presentation of Royalty Trust Activities. Under the provisions of ASU 2015-02 “Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis,” adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2016, each of the Royalty Trusts
are no longer VIEs. As a result, for the 2016 periods, the Company has proportionately consolidated the
activities of the Royalty Trusts. Under the proportionate consolidation method, the Company accounts for
only its share of each Royalty Trust’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses within the appropriate
classifications in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The
Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02 by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as
of January 1, 2016. As such, the financial information presented with respect to the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2015 has not been restated and includes 100% of the activities of the Royalty
Trusts with the portion of each Royalty Trust’s activities attributable to third-party ownership interests
presented as noncontrolling interest.
Overview
SandRidge Energy, Inc. is an oil and natural gas company with a principal focus on exploration and
production activities in the Mid-Continent and Rockies regions of the United States. The Company’s
Rockies properties were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company’s mission is to become
a high-return, growth-oriented resource conversion company in the Mid-Continent and Rockies regions,
where it has determined it has competitive advantages, such as an industry leading cost structure,
subsurface knowledge, existing infrastructure and broader infrastructure capabilities and size and scale.
The Company also operates businesses and infrastructure systems that are complementary to its primary
exploration and production activities, including a saltwater gathering and disposal system and an electrical
transmission system.
Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11
On May 16, 2016, the Debtors filed the Bankruptcy Petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code with the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors’ Chapter 11 Cases have been consolidated for
procedural purposes only and are jointly administered under the caption In re: SandRidge Energy Inc., et
al.
Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions
automatically enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of most judicial or administrative proceedings or filing of
other actions against the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the
date of the Bankruptcy Petitions. Accordingly, although the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions triggered
defaults on the Debtors’ debt obligations, creditors are stayed from taking any actions against the Debtors
as a result of such defaults, subject to certain limited exceptions permitted by the Bankruptcy Code. Absent
an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all of the Debtors’ pre-petition liabilities are subject to
settlement under the Bankruptcy Code.
52
Table of Contents
For the duration of the Company’s Chapter 11 Cases, the Company’s operations and ability to develop and
execute its business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process
as described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of the
Company’s shares of common stock and stockholders, assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be
significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the description of the Company’s
operations, properties and capital plans included in this quarterly report may not accurately reflect its
operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.
In particular, subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assign or
reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court
and certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated
as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions,
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease
but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages
caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may assert unsecured
claims in the Bankruptcy Court against the applicable Debtor’s estate for such damages. Generally, the
assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary
defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future
performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtor in
this quarterly report, including where applicable a quantification of the Company’s obligations under any
such executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtor is qualified by any overriding rejection rights
the Company has under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein is or shall be deemed an admission
with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or
unexpired lease, and the Debtors expressly preserve all of their rights with respect thereto.
The Company and the Debtors are currently operating as debtors in possession in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court has granted motions filed by the
Company that were designed primarily to mitigate the impact of the Chapter 11 proceedings on the
Company’s operations, customers and employees. As a result, the Company is able to conduct normal
business activities and pay all associated obligations for the period following its bankruptcy filing and is
authorized to pay and has paid certain pre-petition obligations, including for employee wages and benefits,
goods and services provided by certain vendors, transportation of the Company’s production, royalties and
costs incurred on the Company’s behalf by other working interest owners. During the pendency of the
Chapter 11 case, all transactions outside the ordinary course of business require the prior approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.
Restructuring Support Agreement
Prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, on May 11, 2016 the Debtors entered into the Restructuring
Support Agreement. The Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth, subject to certain conditions, the
commitments and obligations of the Debtors and the Consenting Creditors to support the Restructuring
Transactions, including a comprehensive restructuring of the Company’s long-term debt, convertible
perpetual preferred stock and common stock. The Restructuring Transactions will be effectuated through
the Plan of Reorganization filed in the Chapter 11 Cases.
The RSA commits each of the Debtors to, among other things, and subject to certain conditions: (a) support
and take all reasonably necessary and appropriate actions to obtain approval by the Bankruptcy Court of
the Plan and to effectuate the Restructuring Transactions, (b) take no action that is inconsistent or is likely
to interfere with the Restructuring Transactions, and (c) comply with certain operating covenants.
The RSA may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, including the failure to meet certain
milestones related to cash collateral and the Plan, and upon certain breaches by the Debtors and the
Consenting Creditors under the RSA. The RSA is subject to termination if the effective date of the Plan has
not occurred within 225 days of the bankruptcy filing. There can be no assurance that the Plan will be
consummated.
Plan of Reorganization
The Company filed the Plan and a related disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court on May 18,
2016. The Plan is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. On July 15, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court
approved the Company’s disclosure statement with respect to the Plan, and the Company is in the process
of soliciting votes with respect to the Plan. The Company intends to seek confirmation of the Plan at a
hearing before the Bankruptcy Court, currently scheduled to begin September 6, 2016.
53
Table of Contents
If the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors would exit Chapter 11 pursuant to the terms of
the Plan. Under the Plan, the claims against and interests in the Debtors are organized into classes based,
in part, on their respective priorities. The Plan provides that, upon emergence from bankruptcy:
•
First Lien Credit Agreement. Claims under the senior credit facility will receive their proportionate share of
(a) $35.0 million in cash and (b) participation in the $425.0 million New First Lien Exit Facility.
•
Senior Secured Note Claims. The Senior Secured Notes will receive their proportionate share of (a) the
New Mandatory Convertible Debt, and (b)  85% of the New Common Stock, as fully diluted by the New
Mandatory Convertible Debt measured through the conversion date, subject to dilution by (i) the Warrants,
(ii) a Rights Offering, if any, and (iii) the Employee Incentive Plan. Holders of Senior Secured Notes may
also be entitled to participate in the Rights Offering under specified circumstances.
•
General Unsecured Claims. The Company’s general unsecured claims, including the Unsecured Notes,
will receive their proportionate share of (a) $10.0 million in cash, (b) 15% of the New Common Stock, as
fully diluted by the New Mandatory Convertible Debt measured through the conversion date, subject to
dilution by the Employee Incentive Plan, the Rights Offering, and the Warrants, (c) the Warrants, (d) the
cash proceeds of the $35.0 million New Building Note, and (e) the Rights Offering. Holders of general
unsecured claims, including the Unsecured Notes, may also be entitled to participate in the Rights
Offering under specified circumstances.
•
Preferred and Common Stock. The Company’s existing 7.0% and 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred
stock and common stock will be canceled and released under the Plan without receiving any recovery on
account thereof.
The Plan provides for the following new debt and other instruments:
•
New First Lien Exit Facility. The New First Lien Exit Facility will have an initial borrowing base of $425.0
million with no borrowing base redeterminations to occur until October 2018 and semiannual borrowing
base redeterminations thereafter. The New First Lien Exit Facility will mature on the earlier of March 31,
2020, or 40 months from the Effective Date, with interest payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 4.75% per
annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The New First Lien Exit Facility will be secured by (i) first-priority
mortgages on at least 95% of the present value of the proved developed producing reserves and 95% of
the present value of all proved reserves included in the most recently delivered reserve report, (ii) a first-
priority perfected pledge of capital stock of each credit party and their respective wholly owned
subsidiaries and (iii) a first-priority security interest in the cash, cash equivalents, deposit, securities and
other similar accounts, and a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible (other
than the Company’s corporate buildings in Oklahoma City) and intangible assets of the credit parties
(including but not limited to as-extracted collateral, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general
intangibles, investment property, intellectual property, real property and the proceeds of the foregoing).
The New First Lien Exit Facility is subject to a variety of other terms and conditions including conditions
precedent to funding, financial covenants, and various other covenants and representations and
warranties.
New Mandatory Convertible Debt. The New Mandatory Convertible Debt will have a principal amount of
•
$300.0 million. The New Mandatory Convertible Debt will mandatorily convert to 46.5% of the New
Common Stock no later than four years after the Effective Date or upon the occurrence of certain specified
conversion events. The New Mandatory Convertible Debt is subject to being fully or partially secured by
springing liens in the same collateral as the New First Lien Exit Facility only upon the occurrence of
certain specified litigation events expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business of the
reorganized Company.
•
Warrants. The Warrants to purchase up to 12.5% of the New Common Stock will be exercisable at any
time, in whole or in part, until their expiration date for a per share price based upon a $1.625 billion
aggregate value of the New Common Stock at the trailing 30-day volume-weighted average price. The
expiration date for the Warrants will be six years from the Effective Date.
•
New Building Note. The New Building Note will have a principal amount of $35.0 million and be secured
by first priority mortgages on the Company’s headquarters facility and certain other non-oil and gas real
property located in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Interest will be payable on the New Building
Note at 6% per annum for the first year following the Effective Date, 8% per annum for the second year
following the Effective Date, and 10% thereafter through maturity. Interest will be payable in kind from the
Effective Date through the earlier of September 30, 2020, 46 months from the Effective Date or 90 days
after the refinancing or repayment of the New First Lien Exit Facility and thereafter in cash.
54
Table of Contents
The New Building Note will mature five years after the Effective Date. On July 14, 2016, the Company
conducted an auction for the New Building Note, which auction yielded a winning bid in the amount of
$27.0 million in cash.
•
Rights Offering. The Restructuring Support Agreement entitles the Debtors to implement a Rights Offering
for up to $150.0 million of the New Common Stock at a valuation of the lesser of (a) $1.215 billion or (b)
90% of the equity value under the Plan. The Consenting Creditors are exclusively entitled to purchase the
Rights Offering equity until the earlier of 30 days following approval of a disclosure statement by the
Bankruptcy Court, 15 days before the date of the confirmation hearing set forth in the disclosure statement
order or 90 days after the Chapter 11 filing.
The Plan contemplates the following additional terms, among others:
•
Consensual Cash Collateral Use. The Company intends to fund ongoing operations and other cash
needs during the Chapter 11 proceedings with cash on hand and cash from operations. Under the RSA,
the Consenting Creditors have consented to the use of cash collateral during the Chapter 11 Cases
through the effective date of the Plan, subject to certain terms, conditions, and termination events.
•
Releases. The Plan provides for releases of specified claims held by the Debtors, the Consenting
Creditors, and certain other specified parties against one another and for customary exculpations and
injunctions.
•
Employee Incentive Plan. The Employee Incentive Plan contemplates the issuance of up to 10% of pro
forma ownership interests in the reorganized Company to officers and/or other employees of the
reorganized Company. The Employee Incentive Plan will be subject to approval of the board of directors
of the reorganized Company.
Recent Events
Divestiture of WTO Properties and Release from Treating Agreement. On January 21, 2016, the Company
paid $11.0 million in cash and transferred ownership of substantially all of its oil and natural gas properties
and midstream assets located in the Piñon field in the WTO to Occidental and was released from all past,
current and future claims and obligations under an existing 30-year treating agreement between the
companies.
Operational Activities
•
•
Operational activities for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include the
following:
Total production for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 was comprised of approximately 28.3%
oil, 48.7% natural gas and 23.0% NGLs compared to 33.2% oil, 50.1% natural gas and 16.7% NGLs in the
same period of 2015. Total production for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was comprised of
approximately 29.0% oil, 49.5% natural gas and 21.5% NGLs compared to 33.4% oil, 50.1% natural gas
and 16.5% NGLs in the same period of 2015.
Mid-Continent properties contributed approximately 4.7 MMBoe, or 94.5% and 9.9 MMBoe, or 94.3% of
the Company’s total production, for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to approximately 7.2 MMBoe, or 89.1% and 14.2 MMBoe, or 88.8% for the same periods in
2015, respectively.
•Reduced total rigs drilling to two at June 30, 2016 from six at June 30, 2015.
Drilled three and ten wells, respectively, in the Mid-Continent area during the three and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016, compared to 31 and 125 wells drilled during the same periods in 2015,
respectively, and drilled seven and ten wells, respectively, in the Rockies during the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016.
Discontinued drilling and oil field services operations during the 2016 period as a result of continued low
oil prices and decreased demand for drilling and oil field services.
    
Outlook
•
•
The Company’s 2016 capital expenditures budget is approximately $285.0 million, with approximately
$262.0 million designated for exploration and production activities. These amounts reflect a decrease from
total 2015 capital expenditures of 59% and a decrease from 2015 exploration and production capital
expenditures of 60%.
    
The Company’s estimated proved reserve volumes, including volumes attributable to its proportionate
ownership in the Royalty Trusts, were 214 MMBoe at June 30, 2016 based on internal estimates using the
SEC-mandated historical twelve-month unweighted average pricing at such date, which were $39.63 per
barrel of oil and $2.24 per Mcf of natural gas. Applying the actual July 1, 2016 benchmark commodities
prices to August 1, 2016 and September 1, 2016, the twelve-month unweighted average
55
Table of Contents
prices would have been $39.40 per barrel of oil and $2.28 per Mcf of natural gas. If the Company’s second
quarter reserves estimates were made using the reduced twelve-month average prices, and without regard
to additions or other further revisions to reserves other than as a result of such pricing changes, the
Company’s internally estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2016 would have remained largely
unchanged. As a result of continued depressed commodity prices, the Company’s final capital plan for
2016, developed in March 2016, contemplates a smaller drilling program than that assumed in the
development of the December 31, 2015 reserve report. If commodity pricing falls short of the Company’s
current expectations or rebounds to a level supportive of more drilling, the Company may change its 2016
capital expenditure plans again. However, the Company’s management does not expect these short term
changes to negatively impact the Company’s ability to develop all of its December 31, 2015 proved
undeveloped locations within a five year time frame. All reserve estimates provided in this Quarterly Report
were determined by Company reservoir engineers and, accordingly, have not been fully assessed by
independent petroleum consultants.
In addition to a restructuring through the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company is also focused on cost
reductions, including the identification of non-core assets for potential sale. The Company believes that a
filing under Chapter 11 provides the most expeditious manner in which to enhance its liquidity position and
effect a substantial reduction in its debt obligations. However, there can be no assurances that the
Company will be able to successfully restructure its indebtedness, improve its financial position or
complete any strategic transactions. As a result of these uncertainties, management has concluded that
there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as it is currently
structured.

Results by Segment
During the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, the Company operated in two reportable
business segments: exploration and production and midstream services. These segments represent the
Company’s two main business units, each offering different products and services. The exploration and
production segment is engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties and
includes the activities of the Royalty Trusts, consolidated proportionately for the 2016 period and fully for
the 2015 period. The midstream services segment coordinates the delivery of electricity for the Company’s
exploration and production operations in the Mid-Continent. The Company discontinued the substantial
majority of activity within its drilling and oilfield services segment in January 2016.
Management evaluates the performance of the Company’s business segments based on income (loss)
from operations. Results of these measurements provide important information to the Company about the
activity, profitability and contributions of each of the Company’s lines of business. The results of the
Company’s business segments for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are
discussed below.
Exploration and Production Segment
The Company generates the majority of its consolidated revenues and cash flow from the production and
sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. The Company’s revenues, profitability and future growth depend
substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on the Company’s ability to find,
economically develop and produce its reserves. The primary factors affecting the financial results of the
Company’s exploration and production segment are the prices the Company receives for its oil, natural gas
and NGL production, the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs it produces and changes in the fair value of
its commodity derivative contracts. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and are difficult to
predict. To provide information on the general trend in pricing, the average New York Mercantile Exchange
(“NYMEX”) prices for oil and natural gas during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 are shown in the table below: 
 Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,

  $ 2.74
2016
 $ 39.78
 $ 2.12
2015
  $ 53.34
  $ 2.77
In order to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations, the Company historically has entered into
commodity derivative contracts for a portion of its anticipated future oil and natural gas production as
discussed in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Reducing the
Company’s exposure to price volatility helps mitigate the risk that it will not have adequate funds available
for its capital expenditure programs. However, as commodity prices have been depressed for an extended
period, the Company recently has been limited in its ability to significantly mitigate price risk through
commodity derivative transactions for future production.

Exploration and production segment revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL sales decreased $118.9, or
55.4%, and $230.2 million, or 56.1%, for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, from the
same periods in 2015, respectively. Approximately $91.5 million and $157.4 million of the total net
decreases for the three and six-month periods, respectively, were due primarily to a decline in oil and
natural gas production, largely resulting from natural declines in existing producing wells, a decrease in
wells drilled in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, and the proportionate consolidation of the
Royalty Trusts’ activities during the 2016 periods. The remaining decreases of $27.4 million and $72.8
million for the three and six-month periods, respectively, were due to a decline in the average prices
received primarily for oil, and to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGL production.
Operating Expenses
Production expense includes costs associated with the Company’s exploration and production activities,
including, but not limited to, lease operating expense and treating costs. Production expenses for the three
and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased $39.3 million, or 47.8% and $81.7 million, or 47.5%
from the same periods in 2015, respectively. Production costs per Boe decreased to $8.63 per Boe and
$8.65 per Boe for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, from $10.15 per Boe and $10.77
per Boe in the same 2015 periods, respectively, primarily as a result of a decrease in well activity as a
result of fewer new wells being brought on production and a reduction in workover activity in 2016
compared to the same periods in 2015. Additionally, the Company did not incur any CO2 delivery shortfall
penalties for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 and incurred $2.0 million in CO2 delivery
shortfall penalties during the six month-period ended June 30, 2016, compared to recording penalties of
$8.7 million and $17.2 million for the same periods in 2015, due to termination of the CO2 delivery
agreement with Occidental in January 2016.
Production taxes decreased by $2.3 million, or 51.6% and $5.1 million, or 57.0%, for the three and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to
the decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues. Production taxes as a percentage of oil, natural gas
and NGL revenue were consistent at approximately 2.2% and 2.1% for the three and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 2.0% and 2.2% for the same periods in 2015.
Depreciation and depletion for the Company’s oil and natural gas properties decreased by $66.3 million
and $140.1 million for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the
same periods in 2015, largely as a result of a decrease in the depreciation and depletion rate per Boe. The
average depreciation and depletion rates per Boe were $5.62 and $5.76 for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $11.65 and $12.53 for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in the depreciation and depletion rate is
primarily due to full cost ceiling limitation impairments recorded in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, as
well as the proportionate consolidation of the Royalty Trusts’ activities during the 2016 periods.
The Company incurred full cost ceiling limitation impairments of $251.0 million and $359.4 million for the
three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion
for the same periods in 2015, which resulted primarily from the significant decrease in oil prices, and to a
lesser extent, natural gas prices, that began in the latter half of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 and
into 2016.

Table of Contents
The Company recorded losses on commodity derivative contracts of $8.0 million and $33.0 million for the
three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which include net cash receipts upon
settlement of $32.4 million and $74.4 million, respectively. The Company recorded a loss (gain) on
commodity derivative contracts of $5.2 million and $(16.8) million for the six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes net cash receipts upon settlement of $58.0 million and $211.3
million, respectively. Included in the net cash receipts for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 are $11.5 million of cash receipts related to early settlements. Volumes hedged decreased
significantly in the 2016 periods compared to the 2015 periods, primarily due to the majority of the
Company’s open commodity derivative contracts at June 30, 2015 reaching maturity prior to June 30, 2016,
with no additional commodity derivative contracts being entered into during that time frame, and the early
settlement of certain commodity derivative contracts as a result of the ongoing restructuring transaction.
The Company’s derivative contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and, as a result, gains or
losses on commodity derivative contracts are recorded each quarter as a component of operating
expenses. Internally, management views the settlement of commodity derivative contracts at contractual
maturity as adjustments to the price received for oil and natural gas production to determine “effective
prices.” Gains or losses on early settlements and losses related to amendments of contracts are not
considered in the calculation of effective prices. In general, cash is received on settlement of contracts due
to lower oil and natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price for the
Company’s commodity derivative contracts, and cash is paid on settlement of contracts due to higher oil
and natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price for the Company’s
commodity derivative contracts.
Loss on settlement of contract for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 includes a $78.9 million loss
resulting from the termination of a gas treating and CO2 delivery agreement with Occidental as well as a
loss of $11.2 million recorded for the cease-use of transportation agreements that supported production
from the Piñon field.
See “Consolidated Results of Operations” below for a discussion of other operating expenses.
Midstream Services Segment
Subsequent to the divestiture of the Piñon field midstream assets in January 2016 as described above
under “Recent Events,” Midstream services segment revenues consist primarily of revenues generated
from the Company’s electrical transmission system that coordinates the delivery of electricity to the
Company’s exploration and production operations in the Mid-Continent area. The system, constructed by
the Company, provides electricity for use in the Company’s exploration and production operations at a
lower cost than electricity provided by on-site generation. The primary factors affecting the results of the
Company’s midstream services segment are the rates charged and volumes delivered by the electrical
transmission system. On a consolidated basis, revenues and expenses from the electrical transmission
system relate to electricity provided to third-party working interest owners in Company-operated wells in
the Mid-Continent.
Set forth in the table below is financial and operational information for the midstream services segment for
the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

in 2015, primarily due the divestiture of the Piñon field midstream assets in January 2016, subsequent to
which no third-party gas volumes were marketed and no other midstream services were provided to third
parties.
The Company recorded impairment on compressors and various other midstream services equipment
during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to the determination that their future use
was limited.

Includes $237.6 million and $369.8 million of expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests in
consolidated VIEs, after considering the effects of intercompany eliminations, for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively.

impairment under “Results by Segment—Midstream Services Segment.”
The decreases in cost of sales and depreciation and amortization—other in the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 from the comparable periods in 2015 are primarily due to discontinuing
substantially all drilling and oilfield services operations in January 2016.
General and administrative expenses decreased $7.4 million, or 19.2% for the three-month period ended
June 30, 2016 from the same period in 2015 due primarily to (i) an $8.1 million decrease in severance
costs associated with a reduction in workforce in the 2015 period, and (ii) a decrease of $2.8 million in net
salary and benefits, which also primarily resulted from reductions in workforce in the first quarters of 2015
and 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6.6 million in professional services and
consulting costs associated with the restructuring process prior to filing the Bankruptcy Petitions.
General and administrative expenses increased $30.8 million, or 41.3% for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016 from the same period in 2015 due primarily to (i) the write-off of a $16.7 million joint interest
account receivable due to the determination that its collection was doubtful at March 31, 2016, (ii) an
increase of $16.1 million in professional services costs, including consulting fees, board of directors and
legal fees largely associated with the restructuring process prior to filing the Bankruptcy Petitions, and (iii)
a $7.0 million increase in severance costs associated with the reductions in workforce that occurred in the
first quarter of 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in net salary and
benefits, which also primarily resulted from the reductions in workforce noted above.

Total interest expense decreased $32.1 million and $13.8 million for the three and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively, primarily due to recording
interest expense on the Senior Unsecured Notes only through the date of the Chapter 11 filings in the 2016
period, and a decrease in interest paid on Senior Unsecured Notes that were repurchased in 2015 and
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes that were converted into shares of the Company’s common stock in
the second half of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. Additionally, approximately $7.1 million in debt issuance
costs associated with the senior credit facility were written off in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015,
as a result of a decrease in the borrowing base in the 2015 period, with no corresponding write-offs to
interest expense in the 2016 period. These decreases were partially offset by interest expense incurred
through the date of the Chapter 11 filings and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs
associated with the Senior Secured Notes issued in June and October 2015, as well as a reduction in the
amount of interest capitalized in the 2016 periods, primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures in
2016.
The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016 in connection with the exchange of approximately $232.1 million in aggregate principal
amount ($77.8 million net of discount and including holders’ conversion feature liabilities) of the
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes for approximately 84.4 million shares of the Company’s common
stock during the first quarter of 2016. No such conversions occurred during the three-month period ended
June 30, 2016 and future conversions Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes into shares of the Company’s
common stock were stayed in conjunction with the filing of the Chapter 11 petitions.

The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2015 in connection with the exchange of $29.0 million of its Senior Notes due
2021, $21.0 million of its Senior Notes due 2022 and outstanding accrued interested thereon since the last
payment date for approximately 28.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock during the second
quarter of 2015.
See “Note 6 - Long-Term Debt” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of the Company’s long-term debt
transactions in 2016.
Reorganization items in the 2016 periods primarily consist of (i) $148.8 million in net unamortized debt
premiums and discounts, unamortized debt issuance costs and the remaining value of derivatives
associated with the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes and the PGC Senior Secured Notes that were
written-off on the date the Bankruptcy Petitions were filed, (ii) an adjustment of $20.5 million for estimated
allowable claims related to the Company’s legal proceedings, (iii) $18.1 million in amounts related to the
rejection of certain long-term contracts as approved by the Bankruptcy Court, and (iv) $10.8 million in
professional and legal fees incurred as a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings.
See “Note 1 - Chapter 11 Proceedings” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report for discussion of reorganization items and “Note 8 -
Commitments and Contingencies” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion of contractual
obligations.
No loss or income attributable to non-controlling interest was recorded in 2016 due to the proportionate
consolidation of the Royalty Trusts in 2016 as discussed in “Overview.” Net loss attributable to
noncontrolling interest in the 2015 periods represents the portion of net loss attributable to third-party
ownership in the Company’s formerly fully consolidated VIEs and subsidiaries, which primarily consisted
of the full cost ceiling impairment attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the Royalty Trusts of $226.4
million and $353.4 million for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $634.2 million, and the Company
had approximately $4.1 billion in total debt outstanding and $10.2 million in outstanding letters of credit.
Approximately $448.9 million of the total debt outstanding was drawn under the senior credit facility and
held by the Company in a securities account. The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constitutes
an event of default that accelerated its obligations under the senior credit facility. Due to the Chapter 11
proceedings, however, most acts to exercise remedies under its credit facility, including those related to
defaults of various financial covenants and ratios, were stayed as of May 16, 2016, the date of the Chapter
11 petition filing, and continue to be stayed. No further funds are available under the credit facility. As of
August 8, 2016, the Company had approximately $659.9 million in cash and cash equivalents,
approximately $448.9 million drawn under its senior credit facility and $10.2 million in outstanding letters of
credit.
The Company’s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been proceeds from the
issuance of equity and debt securities, cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the senior
credit facility, and proceeds from monetizations of assets. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 filing, the
Company’s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be limited to cash flow from operations and cash
on hand. Under the Restructuring Support Agreement entered into on May 11, 2016, the Consenting
Creditors have consented to the use of cash collateral during the Chapter 11 Cases through the Effective
Date, subject to certain terms, conditions, and termination events. In addition to the cash requirements
necessary to fund ongoing operations, the Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant
professional fees and other costs in connection with the preparation and administration of the Chapter 11
Cases.
Although management believes the Company’s cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be
adequate to meet the operating costs of its existing business, there are no assurances that cash flow from
operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to continue to fund operations or allow the Company to
continue as a going concern until a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or other
alternative restructuring transaction is approved by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated. The
Company’s long-term liquidity requirements, the adequacy of capital resources and ability to continue as a
going concern are difficult to predict at this time and ultimately cannot be determined until a Chapter 11
plan has been confirmed, if at all, by the Bankruptcy Court. If the Company’s future sources of liquidity are
insufficient, the Company could face substantial liquidity constraints and be unable to continue as a going
concern and will likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures,
implement further cost reductions, or seek other financing alternatives. The Company’s 2016 budget for
capital expenditures is approximately $285.0 million, representing a 59% reduction from the Company’s
actual capital expenditures in 2015. If the Company limits, defers or eliminates its 2016 capital expenditure
plan or is unsuccessful in developing reserves

and adding production through its capital program or its cost-cutting efforts are too overreaching, the value
of the Company’s oil and natural gas properties and its financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected.
The Company’s cash flow from operations are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future
prices for oil and natural gas, each of which depend on numerous factors beyond the Company’s control
such as overall oil and natural gas production and inventories in relevant markets, economic conditions,
the global political environment, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil
and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the
future. For example, the NYMEX month-end settled price for oil has declined from a high of $105.37 per
Bbl in June 2014 to as low as $26.21 per Bbl in February 2016. The NYMEX month-end settled price for
natural gas declined from a high of $5.56 per MMBtu in February 2014 to as low as $1.71 per MMBtu in
March 2016. Changes in market price for production directly impact the Company’s cash flow from
operations. While the Company’s derivative arrangements serve to mitigate a portion of the effect of this
price volatility on its cash flows, this extended period of depressed commodity prices has limited the
Company’s ability to add meaningful volumes to its hedge positions. If the current depressed oil or natural
gas prices persist for a prolonged period or further decline, they would have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and quantities of oil, natural gas and
NGL reserves that may be economically produced, likely resulting in further full cost pool ceiling
impairments.
Working Capital
The Company’s working capital balance fluctuates as a result of changes in the fair value of its outstanding
commodity derivative instruments and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of its collection of
receivables and payment of expenditures related to its exploration and production operations.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital surplus of $680.0 million compared to a surplus of
$236.7 million at December 31, 2015. Current assets increased by $79.8 million and current liabilities
decreased by $363.6 million at June 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in current
assets is primarily due to a $198.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, which resulted largely
from borrowings on the senior credit facility. The increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease of
$63.3 million in the net asset position of the Company’s current derivative contracts due largely to a
decrease in volumes hedged in 2016 compared to 2015, and a decrease of $45.7 million in accounts
receivable, largely resulting from fluctuations in the timing and amount of receivable billings and
collections, as well as the write-off of a $16.7 million joint interest receivable due to the determination that
its collection was doubtful at March 31, 2016. The change in current liabilities is primarily due to a
decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $363.5 million largely due to (i)
reclassifying certain items including approximately $89.7 million in accrued interest on debt and $37.9
million in accrued dividends on the Company’s preferred stock to liabilities subject to compromise
subsequent to the Chapter 11 petition filings, (ii) the settlement of $109.9 million in CO2 shortfall delivery
penalties accrued at December 31, 2015 under a contract with Occidental Petroleum which was terminated
during the first quarter of 2016, (iii) a decrease of $28.8 million in accrued payroll and benefits due primarily
to the payment of 2015 bonuses during the first quarter of 2016 and (iv) a reduction in accrued capital
expenditures resulting primarily from a decrease in the number of drilling rigs operating on the Company’s
properties.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The Company’s operating cash flow is primarily influenced by the prices the Company receives for its oil,
natural gas and NGLs, the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs it sells, and settlements of commodity
derivative contracts. The Company’s cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by changes in
working capital. The $458.0 million reduction in operating cash flows for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to a reduction in revenues from oil,
natural gas and NGLs, and a reduction in proceeds received on settlement of commodity derivative
contracts.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The Company dedicates and expects to continue to dedicate a substantial portion of its capital expenditure
program toward the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. These capital expenditures are
necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-
intensive oil and natural gas industry. During the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, cash
flows used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions.
Capital Expenditures. The Company’s capital expenditures, on an accrual basis, by segment for the six-
month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:

Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, decreased by $378.1 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016 from the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in drilling and leasehold
expenditures in the Mid-Continent area as well as a decrease in Midstream expenditures due to the
divestiture of the Piñon field assets in the WTO in the first quarter of 2016, and a decrease in other
expenditures due primarily to discontinuing drilling and services operations in January 2016. The number
of drilling rigs operating on the Company’s properties decreased to two rigs at June 30, 2016 from six rigs
at June 30, 2015. The Company has established a capital expenditures budget of $285.0 million for 2016.
    
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The Company’s financing activities provided $448.5 million of cash for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016, which primarily resulted from net borrowings under the senior credit facility, compared to
$1.1 billion provided in the same period in 2015, primarily resulting from issuance of the $1.25 billion
Senior Secured Notes in June 2015. Additionally, noncontrolling interest distributions paid by the Royalty
Trusts were proportionately consolidated for the six-months ended June 30, 2016 compared to being fully
consolidated in the 2015 period, and the semi-annual dividend payments on the Company’s 8.5% and
7.0% perpetual preferred stock were suspended during the 2016 period, while the semi-annual dividend on
the 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred stock was paid in cash during the 2015 period.
Indebtedness
The balances of outstanding debt shown in the table below have been reclassified as liabilities subject to
compromise on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016.
Additionally, on the date of the Chapter 11 filings, all unamortized debt issuance costs and associated
discounts and premiums of approximately $158.6 million and the remaining value of associated debt
derivatives of $9.8 million related to the Company’s debt were written-off through a non-cash charge and
are included in reorganization items in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, as discussed in “Note 1 - Chapter
11 Proceedings” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Chapter 11 filings constituted an event of default with respect to the Company’s existing debt
obligations. As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, the Company's pre-petition senior credit facility, Senior
Secured Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes and Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes became immediately
due and payable, but any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed as a result
of the Chapter 11 filings.
 
Maturities of Debt. As of June 30, 2016, there are no contractual maturities of debt until January 2020;
however, the Senior Secured Notes mature on June 1, 2020, provided that if on October 15, 2019, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company’s unsecured 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020
exceeds $100.0 million, the Senior Secured Notes mature on October 16, 2019. See “Plan of
Reorganization” for additional discussion of debt subsequent to Chapter 11 filings.
Senior Credit Facility. The amount the Company may borrow under its senior credit facility is limited to a
borrowing base, and is subject to periodic redeterminations. The Company’s borrowing base is generally
redetermined in April and October of each year. The borrowing base is determined based upon the
discounted present value of future cash flows attributable to the Company’s proved reserves. Because the
value of the Company’s proved reserves is a key factor in determining the amount of the borrowing base, a
decrease in such value, whether due to declining commodity prices or a reduction in the Company’s
development of reserves would likely cause a reduction in the borrowing base. On March 11, 2016, the
administrative agent of the senior credit facility notified the Company that the lenders had elected to reduce
the borrowing base to $340.0 million from $500.0 million pursuant to a special redetermination. On April
20, 2016, the Company submitted for consideration by its lenders additional properties to serve as
collateral under the senior credit facility to support a borrowing base of $500.0 million. On May 11, 2016, in
connection with the execution of the RSA and in exchange for waivers from the requisite percentage of
lenders with respect to certain specified defaults and events of defaults under the senior credit facility, the
Company permanently repaid $40.0 million of borrowings to the lenders, which payment correspondingly
reduced the lenders’ commitments. See “Overview” for additional discussion of the senior credit facility.
Quarterly, the Company pays a commitment fee assessed at an annual rate of 0.5% on any available
portion of the senior credit facility.
Prior to the Chapter 11 filing, the senior credit facility was available to be drawn on subject to limitations
based on its terms, including the Company’s ability to make representations and warranties contained
therein regarding the value of the Company’s assets versus its liabilities, and compliance with certain
financial covenants, including maintenance of agreed upon levels for the (i) ratio of total secured debt
under the senior credit facility to EBITDA of 2.00:1.00 and (ii) ratio of current assets to current liabilities,
which must be at least 1.0:1.0 at each quarter end. For the purpose of the current ratio calculation, any
amounts available to be drawn under the senior credit facility are included in current assets, and
unrealized assets and liabilities resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on the Company’s commodity
derivative contracts are disregarded. The senior credit facility contractually matures on the earlier of March
2, 2020 and 91 days prior to the earliest date of any maturity under or mandatory offer to repurchase the
Company’s currently outstanding notes.
Additionally, the First Lien Credit Agreement permits the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.75 billion, which may be
secured solely by collateral securing the senior credit facility on a junior lien basis. Any junior lien debt
shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an intercreditor agreement, the terms of which are
subject to the approval of the lenders, and shall mature no earlier than January 21, 2020. The borrowing
base under the senior credit facility was reduced by $0.25 for every $1.00 of junior debt incurred in excess
of $1.5
67
Table of Contents
billion. At June 30, 2016, the Company had incurred $1.3 billion in junior lien debt as a result of the
issuance of Senior Secured Notes in June 2015 and October 2015 and entered into an intercreditor
agreement in connection therewith.
Senior Secured Notes. The Company’s Senior Secured Notes were issued in June 2015 and October
2015 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually, with the principal due
upon maturity. The Company accrued interest on its Senior Secured Notes at the stated rate through the
date of the Chapter 11 filings, with no interest accrued subsequent to the filings.The Senior Secured Notes
are redeemable, in whole or in part, prior to their maturity at specified redemption prices and are jointly and
severally guaranteed unconditionally, in full, on a second-priority secured basis by certain of the
Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the indenture, the Senior Secured Notes mature on
June 1, 2020; provided, however, that if on October 15, 2019, the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of the Company’s unsecured 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 exceeds $100.0 million, the Senior Secured
Notes mature on October 16, 2019.
The Senior Secured Notes are secured by second-priority liens on all of the Company’s assets that secure
the senior credit facility on a first-priority basis; provided, however, the security interest in those assets that
secure the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees are contractually subordinated to liens thereon that
secure the senior credit facility and certain other permitted indebtedness. Consequently, the Senior
Secured Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to the senior credit facility and such other
indebtedness to the extent of the value of such assets.
Senior Unsecured Notes. The Company’s Senior Unsecured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate per annum,
payable semi-annually, with the principal due upon maturity. Certain of the Senior Unsecured Notes were
issued at a discount or a premium. The Company accrued interest on its Senior Unsecured Notes at a fixed
rate through the date of the Chapter 11 filings, with no interest accrued subsequent to the filings. Prior to
the Chapter 11 filings, the discount or premium was amortized to interest expense over the term of the
respective series of Senior Unsecured Notes. The unamortized portions of the discount or premium as of
the date of the Chapter 11 filings, May 16, 2016, were written off to reorganization items on the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 as noted above. The Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable, in whole or
in part, prior to their maturity at specified redemption prices and are jointly and severally guaranteed
unconditionally, in full, on an unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries. The
Senior Unsecured Notes have a variety of maturities, the first of which is in 2020 and the latest of which is
in 2023.
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes. The Company’s 8.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 and
7.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are guaranteed by the same guarantors that guarantee the
Senior Unsecured Notes and are subject to covenants and bear payment terms substantially identical to
those of the corresponding series of Senior Unsecured Notes of similar tenor, other than the conversion
features, described further below, and the extension of the final maturity by one day. The Convertible
Senior Unsecured Notes were issued at a discount that was being amortized to interest expense over the
term of the respective series of Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes prior to Chapter 11 filings. The
unamortized portions of the discounts as of the date of the Chapter 11 filings, May 16, 2016, were written
off to reorganization items on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 as noted above.
Prior to the Chapter 11 filings, the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes were convertible into shares of
Company common stock at the option of holders or, subject to compliance with certain conditions, the
Company. In addition, if a holder exercised its right to convert on or prior to the first anniversary of the
issuance of the Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes, such holder received an early conversion payment in
an amount equal to the amount of 18 months of interest payable on the applicable series of converted
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes. All such conversions were stayed as of the date of the Chapter 11
filings.
The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constitutes an event of default that accelerated the
Company’s obligations under its senior credit facility, the Senior Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under these debt agreements are stayed from taking any action
against the Company as a result of an event of default. See “Note 1 - Chapter 11 Proceedings” to the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional
details about the Company’s Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11 Cases. For more information about
the senior credit facility, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes, and the Convertible
Senior Unsecured Notes, see “Note 6 - Long-Term Debt” to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2015, the Company’s contractual obligations included long-term debt obligations,
transportation and throughput agreements, third-party drilling rig agreements, asset retirement obligations,
operating leases and other individually insignificant obligations. Effective June 6, 2016, the Bankruptcy
Court issued orders allowing the Company to reject certain long-term contracts, which had the effect of
reducing future transportation and throughput contractual obligations by approximately $35.8 million,
eliminating the remaining drilling carry commitment of approximately $8.9 million, and reducing other
contractual
68
Table of Contents
obligations by approximately $0.9 million as of the date the contracts were rejected. The total estimated
allowable claims related to these contracts of $27.5 million has been included in liabilities subject to
compromise in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Long-Term Debt Obligations. The Company’s long-term debt obligation was approximately $4.1 billion at
June 30, 2016 compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the drawdown of $488.9
million on the senior credit facility and subsequent repayment of $40.0 million in May 2016 in accordance
with the terms of the RSA. This increase was partially offset by the conversion of an aggregate $232.1
million principal amount ($77.8 million net of discount and including holders’ conversion feature) of the
Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock during the first quarter of
2016. At June 30, 2016, the principal amounts of the Company’s long-term debt are reflected in liabilities
subject to compromise in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
    
For a description of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the
2015 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see “Note 1 -
Basis of Presentation” to the Company’s accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Other than applying the guidance in ASC 852
“Reorganizations” as discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, the Company did not have any material changes in critical accounting policies,
estimates, judgments and assumptions.
Valuation Allowance
In 2008 and 2009, the Company recorded full cost ceiling impairments totaling $3.5 billion on its oil and
natural gas assets, resulting in the Company being in a net deferred tax asset position. Management
considered all available evidence and concluded that it was more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance against the Company’s
net deferred tax asset in the period ending December 31, 2008. This valuation allowance has been
maintained since 2008. See “Note 10 - Income Taxes” to the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for more discussion on the establishment of the valuation allowance
against the Company’s net deferred tax asset.
Management continues to closely monitor all available evidence in considering whether to maintain a
valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset. Factors considered are, but not limited to, the reversal
periods of existing deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, the historical earnings of the Company
and the prospects of future earnings. For purposes of the valuation allowance analysis, “earnings” is
defined as pre-tax earnings as adjusted for permanent tax adjustments.
The Company was in a cumulative negative earnings position until the 36-month period ended December
31, 2012 at which time it reached cumulative positive earnings. However, as a result of the Company
closing the sale of its oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin area of west Texas, excluding the
assets associated with the Permian Trust area of mutual interest, on February 26, 2013, the Company
reverted back to a cumulative negative earnings position for the 36-month period ended March 31, 2013.
Based on net book value, historical costs and proved reserves as of February 26, 2013, the Company
recorded a loss on the sale of $398.9 million, which caused the Company to report a loss for the year
ended December 31, 2013. The Company remains in a cumulative negative earnings position through the
36-month period ended June 30, 2016. One contributing factor to the cumulative negative earnings position
for the 36-month period ended June 30, 2016 is the combined effect of the impairments of the Company’s
assets totaling $5.1 billion. The resulting cumulative negative earnings are not a definitive factor in
determining to maintain a valuation allowance as all available evidence should be considered, but it is a
significant piece of negative evidence in management’s analysis.
The Company’s revenue, profitability and future growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing and
future prices for oil and natural gas. The markets for these commodities continue to be volatile. Relatively
modest drops in prices can significantly affect the Company’s financial results and impede its growth.
Changes in oil and natural gas prices have a significant impact on the value of the Company’s reserves
and on its cash flow. Prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor
changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas and a variety of additional factors that are
beyond the Company’s control. Due to these factors, management has placed a lower weight on the
prospects of future earnings in its overall analysis of the valuation allowance.
In determining whether to maintain the valuation allowance, management concluded that the objectively
verifiable negative evidence of cumulative negative earnings for the 36-month period ending June 30,
2016, is difficult to overcome with any forms of positive evidence that may exist. Accordingly, management
has not changed its judgment regarding the need for a
69
Table of Contents
full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance against the Company’s
net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 was $1.9 billion.
At December 31, 2015, the Company had valuation allowances totaling $92.0 million against specific
deferred tax assets for which management has determined it is more likely than not that such deferred tax
assets will not be realized for various reasons. The valuation allowance against these specific deferred tax
assets would not be impacted by the foregoing discussion.
The confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
materially different amount being reflected on the Company’s post-emergence consolidated financial
statements. Management will consider all available evidence upon emergence, including the effects of the
Restructuring Transactions, in concluding whether or not a valuation allowance should be recorded
against all or some of the newly determined deferred tax assets.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
General
This discussion provides information about the financial instruments the Company uses to manage
commodity prices. All contracts are settled in cash and do not require the actual delivery of a commodity at
settlement. Additionally, the Company’s exposure to credit risk and interest rate risk is also discussed.
Commodity Price Risk. The Company’s most significant market risk relates to the prices it receives for its
oil, natural gas and NGLs. Due to the historical price volatility of these commodities, from time to time,
depending upon management’s view of opportunities under the then-prevailing current market conditions,
the Company enters into commodity pricing derivative contracts for a portion of its anticipated production
volumes for the purpose of reducing variability of oil and natural gas prices it receives. The Company’s
senior credit facility limits its ability to enter into derivative transactions to 85% of expected production
volumes from estimated proved reserves.
The Company uses, and may continue to use, a variety of commodity-based derivative contracts, including
fixed price swaps, basis swaps and collars. At June 30, 2016, the Company’s commodity derivative
contracts consisted of fixed price swaps and basis swaps, which are described below:
Fixed price swaps
Basis swaps
The Company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to
the counterparty over a specified period for a contracted volume.
 
The Company receives a payment from the counterparty if the settled price differential is
greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the settled price
differential is less than the stated terms of the contract, which guarantees the Company a
price differential for oil or natural gas from a specified delivery point.
The Company’s oil fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon the average daily prices for the
calendar month or quarter of the contract period. The Company’s natural gas basis swap transactions are
settled based upon the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub price and Platts Inside FERC
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line price. Settlement for oil derivative contracts occurs in the succeeding month
or quarter and natural gas derivative contracts are settled in the production month or quarter.
At June 30, 2016, the Company’s open commodity derivative contracts consisted of the following:
Oil Price Swaps
July 2016 - December 2016552,000
Notional (MBbls)

Natural Gas Basis Swaps
Notional (MMcf)
July 2016 - December 20161,840,000
Weighted Average

 $ (0.38
)
Because the Company has not designated any of its derivative contracts as hedges for accounting
purposes, changes in fair values of the Company’s derivative contracts are recognized as gains and losses
in current period earnings. As a result, the Company’s current period earnings may be significantly affected
by changes in the fair value of its commodity derivative contracts. Changes in fair value are principally
measured based on a comparison of future prices as of period-end to the contract price.
The Company recorded losses on commodity derivative contracts of $8.0 million and $33.0 million for the
three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which include net cash receipts upon
settlement of $32.4 million and $74.4 million, respectively. The Company recorded a loss (gain) on
commodity derivative contracts of $5.2 million and $(16.8) million for the six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes net cash receipts upon settlement of $58.0 million and $211.3
million, respectively. Included in the net cash receipts for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 are $11.5 million of cash receipts related to early settlements.

Table of Contents
See “Note 7 - Derivatives” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding the Company’s commodity
derivatives.
Credit Risk. All of the Company’s commodity derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-
counter market. The use of commodity derivative transactions in over-the-counter markets involves the risk
that the counterparties may be unable to meet the financial terms of the transactions. The counterparties for
all of the Company’s derivative transactions have an “investment grade” credit rating. The Company
monitors on an ongoing basis the credit ratings of its commodity derivative counterparties and considers its
counterparties’ credit default risk ratings in determining the fair value of its commodity derivative contracts.
    
Both a default by the Company under its senior credit facility and a Chapter 11 filing by the Company
constitute defaults under its commodity derivative contracts. As a result, certain commodity derivative
contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2016 and prior to their contractual maturities after the
Chapter 11 filings occurred.
The Company does not require collateral or other security from counterparties to support derivative
instruments. The Company has master netting agreements with all of its remaining derivative contract
counterparties, which allow the Company to net its derivative assets and liabilities with the same
counterparty. As a result of the netting provisions, the Company’s maximum amount of loss under
derivative transactions due to credit risk is limited to the net amounts due from the counterparties under the
commodity derivative contracts. The Company’s loss is further limited as any amounts due from a
defaulting counterparty that is a lender under the senior credit facility can be offset against amounts owed,
if any, to such counterparty under the Company’s senior credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, the
counterparties to the Company’s open commodity derivative contracts consisted of two financial
institutions, which are also lenders under the Company’s senior credit facility. As a result, the Company is
not required to post additional collateral under its commodity derivative contracts.
Interest Rate Risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed rate debt and its
variable rate senior credit facility. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the
instrument, exposes the Company to (i) changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the
debt and (ii) the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate.
Variable rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates, exposes the Company to short-term changes in
market interest rates as the Company’s interest obligations on these instruments are periodically
redetermined based on prevailing market interest rates, primarily LIBOR and the federal funds rate.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company performed an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that
evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and such information is
accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. Other Information
ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
Chapter 11 Proceedings
Commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases automatically stayed many of the proceedings and actions
against the Company noted below, including actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise
control over the property of the Company’s bankruptcy estates, and the Company intends to seek authority
to pay all general claims in the ordinary course of business notwithstanding the commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases in a manner consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement. The Plan in the
Chapter 11 Cases, if confirmed as contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement, will provide for
the treatment of claims against the Company’s bankruptcy estates, including pre-petition liabilities that
have not otherwise been satisfied or addressed during the Chapter 11 Cases. See “Note 1 - Chapter 11
Proceedings” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in
this quarterly report for further discussion about the Company’s Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11
Cases.
In connection with the estimation of general unsecured claims asserted in connection with its bankruptcy,
the Company is required to establish reserves for litigation matters in amounts that it estimates will be
characterized as “allowed” in the claims administration process.  Such amounts include potential
settlements that the Company would not entertain outside of the bankruptcy process. In that regard, the
Company recorded an adjustment to adjust the reserve for the below described litigation of $20.5 million,
which is included in reorganization items in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, to bring the total
reserves for current anticipated allowed claim amounts for litigation matters to $24.5 million, which is
included in liabilities subject to compromise on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Legal Proceedings
On April 5, 2011, Wesley West Minerals, Ltd. and Longfellow Ranch Partners, LP filed suit against the
Company and SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC (collectively, the “SandRidge Entities”) in the
83rd District Court of Pecos County, Texas. The plaintiffs, who have leased mineral rights to the
SandRidge Entities in Pecos County, allege that the SandRidge Entities have not properly paid royalties
on all volumes of natural gas and CO2 produced from the acreage leased from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs
also allege that the SandRidge Entities have inappropriately failed to pay royalties on CO2 produced from
the plaintiffs’ acreage that results from the treatment of natural gas at the Century Plant. The plaintiffs seek
approximately $45.5 million in actual damages for the period of time between January 2004 and December
2011, punitive damages and a declaration that the SandRidge Entities must pay royalties on
CO2 produced from the plaintiffs’ acreage that results from treatment of natural gas at the Century Plant.
The Commissioner of the General Land Office of the State of Texas (“GLO”) is named as an additional
defendant in the lawsuit as some of the affected oil and natural gas leases described in the plaintiffs’
allegations cover mineral classified lands in which the GLO is entitled to one-half of the royalties
attributable to such leases. The GLO has filed a cross-claim against the SandRidge Entities asserting the
same claims as the plaintiffs with respect to the leases covering mineral classified lands and seeking
approximately $13.0 million in actual damages, inclusive of penalties and interest. On February 5, 2013,
the Company received a favorable summary judgment ruling that effectively removes a majority of the
plaintiffs’ and GLO’s claims. On April 29, 2013, the court entered an order allowing for an interlocutory
appeal of its summary judgment ruling.
The plaintiffs appealed the rulings to the Texas Court of Appeals in El Paso. On November 19, 2014, that
court issued its opinion, which affirmed the trial court’s summary judgment rulings in part, but reversing
them in part. The Court of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment rulings in the SandRidge Entities’ favor
against the GLO. The court also affirmed the summary judgment rulings in the SandRidge Entities’ favor
against Wesley West Minerals, Ltd., on the largest oil and gas lease involved in the case, which accounted
for much of the total damages the plaintiffs are claiming. The court reversed certain rulings on other leases,
thus deciding those matters for the plaintiffs. The parties have petitioned the Supreme Court of Texas for
review of the Court of Appeals’ decision. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining issues
in the trial court, as well as future appellate proceedings.
Between December 2012 and March 2013, seven putative shareholder derivative actions were filed in
state and federal court in Oklahoma:
•
Arthur I. Levine v. Tom L. Ward, et al., and SandRidge Energy, Inc., Nominal Defendant - filed on
December 19, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma

Oklahoma
Dale Hefner v. Tom L. Ward, et al., and SandRidge Energy, Inc., Nominal Defendant - filed on January 4,

Lisa Ezell, Jefferson L. Mangus, and Tyler D. Mangus v. Tom L. Ward, et al., and SandRidge Energy, Inc.,
Nominal Defendant - filed on March 22, 2013 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma
Each lawsuit identified above was filed derivatively on behalf of the Company and names as defendants
current and former directors of the Company. The Hefner lawsuit also names as defendants certain current
and former directors and senior executive officers of the Company. All seven lawsuits assert overlapping
claims - generally that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, mismanaged the Company, wasted
corporate assets, and engaged in, facilitated or approved self-dealing transactions in breach of their
fiduciary obligations. The Depuy lawsuit also alleges violations of federal securities laws in connection
with the Company allegedly filing and distributing certain misleading proxy statements. The lawsuits seek,
among other relief, injunctive relief related to the Company’s corporate governance and unspecified
damages.
On April 10, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma consolidated the Levine,
Depuy, Elliot, Brothers, and Ezell actions (the “Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation”) under the
caption “In re SandRidge Energy, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation,” appointed a lead plaintiff and
lead counsel, and ordered the lead plaintiff to file a consolidated complaint by May 1, 2013. On June 3,
2013, the Company and the individual defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the
consolidated complaint. On September 11, 2013, the court granted the defendants’ respective motions to
dismiss the consolidated complaint without prejudice, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended
consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint on October 9, 2013, in
which plaintiffs allege that: (i) the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Tom Ward, breached
his fiduciary duties by usurping corporate opportunities, (ii) certain of the Company’s current and former
directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, (iii) Mr. Ward and certain of the Company’s current and
former directors wasted corporate assets, (iv) certain entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Ward aided and
abetted Mr. Ward’s breaches of fiduciary duties, (v) Mr. Ward and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Ward
misappropriated the Company’s confidential and proprietary information, and (vi) entities allegedly
affiliated with Mr. Ward were unjustly enriched. On November 15, 2013, the Company and the individual
defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint. On September
22, 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss filed on behalf of the Company and the director
defendants. The court also granted in part and denied in part the respective motions to dismiss filed on
behalf of the other defendants.
On May 8, 2013, the court stayed the Romano action pending further order of the court. On October 29,
2014, the court granted plaintiff’s application to dismiss the action without prejudice.
On September 26, 2014, the Board of Directors for the Company formed a Special Litigation Committee
(“SLC”), composed of two independent and disinterested Company directors, and delegated absolute and
final authority to the SLC to review and investigate the claims alleged by the plaintiffs in the Federal
Shareholder Derivative Litigation and in the Hefner action, and to determine whether or how those claims
should be asserted on the Company’s behalf.
On November 30, 2015, the court stayed the Hefner action until further order of the court.
On October 7, 2015, the derivative plaintiffs in the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation, the SLC, and
the individual defendants in the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation (Tom Ward, Jim Brewer, Everett
Dobson, William Gilliland, Daniel Jordan, Roy Oliver Jr., and Jeffrey Serota), executed a Stipulation of
Settlement, which would result in a partial settlement of the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation by
settling all claims against the individual defendants, subject to certain terms and conditions, including the
approval of the court. Under the terms of the proposed partial settlement, the Company would implement or
agree to maintain certain corporate governance reforms, and the insurers for the individual defendants
would pay $38.0 million to an escrow fund, which would be used to pay certain expenses arising from
pending securities litigation and, to the extent funds remain after paying such expenses, would be paid to
the Company without any further restrictions on the Company’s use of such
75
Table of Contents
funds. The proposed partial settlement expressly provides, among other terms, that the settling defendants
deny all allegations of wrongdoing and are entering into the settlement solely to avoid the costs, disruption,
uncertainty, and risk of further litigation.
On October 9, 2015, the court issued an Order granting preliminary approval of the Stipulation of
Settlement and, after notice and a hearing on December 18, 2015, the court issued a Final Judgment and
Order on December 22, 2015, granting final approval of the Stipulation of Settlement. The partial settlement
did not settle any of the derivative plaintiffs’ claims against non-settling defendants WCT Resources,
L.L.C., 192 Investments, L.L.C., and TLW Land & Cattle, L.P in the Federal Shareholder Derivative
Litigation. On January 12, 2016, a shareholder who objected to the Stipulation of Settlement filed a notice
of appeal of the court’s Final Judgment and Order approving the Stipulation of Settlement.
On March 31, 2016, the derivative plaintiffs in the Federal Shareholder Derivative Litigation, the SLC, and
the remaining defendants, WCT Resources, L.L.C., 192 Investments, L.L.C., and TLW Land & Cattle, L.P.,
executed a Stipulation of Settlement, which would resolve the remaining claims in the Federal Shareholder
Derivative Litigation. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the remaining defendants would make a
payment of $500,000 to the Company, less taxes, expenses, and incentive awards. Counsel for the
derivative plaintiffs have agreed that they will not seek reimbursement of expenses in excess of $120,000.
Counsel for the derivative plaintiffs have also agreed that they will not seek incentive awards for the two
named plaintiffs in excess of $15,000 each.
On April 6, 2016, the court issued an Order granting preliminary approval of the Stipulation of Settlement
and establishing procedures for notice to shareholders and consideration of any shareholder objections to
the settlement. The court also set a hearing for final approval of the proposed settlement on June 15, 2016.
On December 5, 2012, James Glitz and Rodger A. Thornberry, on behalf of themselves and all other
similarly situated stockholders, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the
Company. On January 4, 2013, Louis Carbone, on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated
stockholders, filed a substantially similar putative class action complaint in the same court and against the
same defendants. On March 6, 2013, the court consolidated these two actions under the caption “In re
SandRidge Energy, Inc. Securities Litigation” (the “Securities Litigation”) and appointed a lead plaintiff and
lead counsel. On July 23, 2013, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, which asserts a variety
of federal securities claims against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors,
among other defendants, on behalf of a putative class of (a) purchasers of SandRidge common stock
during the period from February 24, 2011 to November 8, 2012, (b) purchasers of common units of the
Mississippian Trust I in or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April 12, 2011, and (c)
purchasers of common units of the Mississippian Trust II in or traceable to its initial public offering on or
about April 23, 2012. The claims are based on allegations that the Company, certain of its current and
former officers and directors, and the Mississippian Trusts, among other defendants, are responsible for
making false and misleading statements, and omitting material information, concerning a variety of
subjects, including oil and natural gas reserves, the Company’s capital expenditures, and certain
transactions entered into by companies allegedly affiliated with the Company’s former CEO Tom Ward.
On May 11, 2015, the court dismissed without prejudice plaintiffs’ claims against the Mississippian Trust I
and the Mississippian Trust II (together, the “Mississippian Trusts”) and the underwriter defendants. On
August 27, 2015, the court dismissed without prejudice plaintiffs’ claims against the Company and the
individual current and former officers and directors, and granted plaintiffs leave to file a second amended
consolidated complaint.
On October 23, 2015, plaintiffs filed their Second Consolidated Amended Complaint in which plaintiffs
assert federal securities claims against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and
directors on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of SandRidge common stock during the period
between February 24, 2011, and November 8, 2012. The claims are based on allegations that the
Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors are responsible for making false and
misleading statements, and omitting material information, concerning a variety of subjects, including oil
and gas reserves, the Company’s capital expenditures, and certain transactions entered into by companies
allegedly affiliated with the Company’s former CEO Tom Ward. Each of the Mississippian Trusts has
requested that the Company indemnify it for any losses it may incur in connection with the Securities
Litigation.
On July 15, 2013, James Hart and 15 other named plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas (the “Kansas District Court”) in an action undertaken
individually and on behalf of others similarly situated against SandRidge Energy, Inc., SandRidge
Operating Company, SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC, SandRidge Midstream, Inc., and Lariat
Services, Inc. In their Amended Complaint, plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to properly calculate
overtime pay for the plaintiffs and for other similarly situated current and former employees. The plaintiffs
further allege that the defendants required the plaintiffs and other similarly situated current and former
employees to engage in work-related activities without pay. The plaintiffs assert claims against the
defendants for (i) violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, (ii)
76
Table of Contents
violations of the Kansas Wage Payment Act, (iii) breach of contract, and (iv) fraud, and seek to recover
unpaid wages and overtime pay, liquidated damages, statutory penalties, economic damages,
compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and both pre- and post-judgment interest.
On October 3, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Conditional Collective Action Certification and for
Judicial Notice to the Class and a Motion to Toll the Statute of Limitations. On October 11, 2013, the
defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma (the “Oklahoma District Court”). On February 25, 2014, the Kansas
District Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue to the Oklahoma District Court.
On April 2, 2014, the Oklahoma District Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and granted
plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint by April 16, 2014, which they did on such date. On July 1,
2014, the Oklahoma District Court granted plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Collective Action Certification
and for Judicial Notice to the Class, and denied plaintiffs’ Motion to Toll the Statute of Limitations.
On May 27, 2015, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit. Pursuant to such
agreement, the Company will establish a settlement fund from which to pay participating plaintiffs’ claims
as well as plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final negotiations
between the parties and court approval. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company
established a $5.1 million reserve for this lawsuit.
On June 9, 2015, the Duane & Virginia Lanier Trust, individually and on behalf of all others similarly
situated, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among other
defendants, on behalf of a putative class of (a) purchasers of common units of the Mississippian Trust I
pursuant or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April 7, 2011, and/or at other times during the
time period between April 7, 2011, and November 8, 2012 (the “Class Period”), and (b) purchasers of
common units of the Mississippian Trust II pursuant or traceable to its initial public offering on or about April
17, 2012, and/or at other times during the Class Period. The claims are based on allegations that the
Company, certain of its current and former officers and directors, and the Mississippian Trusts, among other
defendants, are responsible for making false and misleading statements, and omitting material information,
concerning a variety of subjects, including oil and natural gas reserves and the Company’s capital
expenditures. The Company and the other defendants intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously. Each of the
Mississippian Trusts has requested that the Company indemnify it for any losses it may incur in connection
with this lawsuit.
On July 30, 2015, Barton Gernandt, Jr., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a
putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the
Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among other defendants, on behalf of
a putative class comprised of all persons, except the named defendants and their immediate family
members, who were participants in, or beneficiaries of, the SandRidge Energy, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the
“401(k) Plan”) at any time between August 2, 2012, and the present, and whose 401(k) Plan accounts
included investments in SandRidge common stock. The plaintiff purports to bring the action both
derivatively on the 401(k) Plan’s behalf pursuant to ERISA §§ 409 and 502, and as a class action pursuant
to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff’s claims are based on allegations that the
defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the 401(k) Plan and to the 401(k) Plan participants by
allowing the investment of the 401(k) Plan’s assets in SandRidge common stock when it was otherwise
allegedly imprudent to do so based on the financial condition of the Company and the fact the Company’s
common stock was artificially inflated because, among other things, the Company materially overstated the
amount of oil being produced and the ratio of oil to natural gas in one of its core holdings.
On August 19, 2015, Christina A. Cummings, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed
a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the
Company and certain of its current and former officers, among other defendants, on behalf of a putative
class comprised of all participants for whose individual accounts the Plan held shares of the Company’s
common stock from November 8, 2012, to the present, inclusive. The plaintiff purports to bring the action
both derivatively on the 401(k) Plan’s behalf pursuant to ERISA §§ 409 and 502, and as a class action
pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff’s claims are based on allegations
that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the 401(k) Plan and to the 401(k) Plan
participants by allowing the investment of the 401(k) Plan’s assets in the Company’s common stock when
it was otherwise allegedly imprudent to do so based on the financial condition of the Company. On
September 10, 2015, the Court consolidated this lawsuit with the Gernandt action.
On September 14, 2015, Richard A. McWilliams, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,
filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against
the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, among other defendants, on behalf
of a putative class comprised of all persons, except the named defendants and their immediate family
members, who were participants in, or beneficiaries of, the 401(k) Plan at any
77

time between August 2, 2012, and the present, and whose 401(k) Plan accounts included investments in
SandRidge common stock. The plaintiff purports to bring the action both derivatively on the 401(k) Plan’s
behalf pursuant to ERISA §§ 409 and 502, and as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff’s claims are based on allegations that the defendants breached their
fiduciary duties owed to the 401(k) Plan and to the 401(k) Plan participants by allowing the investment of
the 401 (k) Plan’s assets in the Company’s common stock when it was otherwise allegedly imprudent to do
so based on the financial condition of the Company and the fact the Company’s common stock was
artificially inflated because, among other things, the Company materially overstated the amount of oil being
produced and the ratio of oil to natural gas in one of its core holdings. On September 24, 2015, the Court
consolidated this lawsuit with the Gernandt action.
On November 24, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint in the consolidated
Gernandt action. The Company intends to defend this consolidated lawsuit vigorously.
On November 18, 2015, Mickey Peck, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, filed a First
Amended Collective Action Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma against SandRidge Energy, Inc., and SandRidge Operating Company for violations of the Fair
Labor Standards Act. Plaintiff alleges that the Company improperly classified certain of its consultants as
independent contractors rather than as employees and, therefore, improperly paid such consultants a day
rate without paying any overtime compensation. On January 14, 2016, the Court entered an Order
conditionally certifying the class and providing for notice.
On January 12, 2016, Lisa Griggs and April Marler, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated,
filed a putative class action petition in the District Court of Logan County, Oklahoma, against SandRidge
Exploration and Production, LLC, and certain other oil and gas exploration companies. In their petition,
plaintiffs assert various tort claims based upon purported damage and loss resulting from earthquakes
allegedly caused by the defendants’ operations of wastewater disposal wells. Plaintiffs seek to certify a
class of “all residents of Oklahoma owning real property from 2011 through the time the Class is certified.”
On February 16, 2016, the defendants filed a Notice of Removal of the lawsuit to the Oklahoma District
Court. On April 8, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Remand the action back to the District Court of Logan
County, Oklahoma. On June 30, 2016, the Oklahoma District Court denied the plaintiffs’ Motion to Remand.
On July 21, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit without prejudice.
On February 12, 2016, Brenda Lene and Jon Darryn Lene filed a petition in the District Court of Logan
County, Oklahoma, against SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC, and certain other oil and gas
exploration companies. In their petition, plaintiffs assert various tort claims based on their allegations that
their home suffered damages due to earthquakes allegedly caused by the defendants’ operations of
wastewater disposal wells. On July 20, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit without
prejudice.
On April 11, 2016, Public Justice, on behalf of the Sierra Club, filed a civil action against SandRidge
Exploration and Production, LLC, among other defendants, in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the citizen suit
provision of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) to enforce alleged violations of RCRA
relating to earthquakes allegedly induced by the defendants’ injection and disposal into the ground of oil
and gas production wastes. Plaintiff seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants
by ordering them to (i) substantially reduce the amounts of production wastes being injected into the
ground, (ii) reinforce vulnerable structures that current forecasts show could be impacted by large
magnitude earthquakes, and (iii) establishing an independent earthquake monitoring center.
On March 3, 2016, Brian Thieme, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, filed a putative class
action complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that, commencing on or around December 27, 2007, and continuing until at least March 31, 2012,
the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the market for the purchases of oil and natural gas
leasehold interests and properties containing producing oil and natural gas wells located in certain areas
of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, in violation of Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Plaintiff seeks to certify two separate and distinct classes of members.
On March 10, 2016, Don Beadles, in Trust for the Alva Synagogue Church, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma against SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L.
Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff alleges that since as early as December 2007, and continuing until
at least as late as March 2012 (the “Relevant Class Period”), the defendants conspired to rig bids and
otherwise depress the amounts they paid to property owners for the acquisition of oil and gas leasehold
interests and producing properties located in certain areas of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, in
violation of Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of “[a]ll persons
and entities that, during the Relevant Class Period,
78

provided or sold to one of more of the Defendants (a) oil and gas leasehold interests on their property
and/or (b) the producing properties, in exchange for lease payments, including but not limited to lease
bonuses.”
On March 24, 2016, Janet L. Lowry, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, filed a putative
class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that, commencing on or around December 27, 2007, and continuing until at least March 31, 2012,
the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the price of royalty and bonus payments exchanged for
purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests and interests in properties containing producing oil
and natural gas wells located in certain areas of Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, in violation of
Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Plaintiff seeks to certify two separate and distinct classes of
members.
On April 15, 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma consolidated the
Thieme, Beadles, and Lowry cases under the caption “In re Anadarko Basin Oil and Gas Lease Antitrust
Litigation,” together with nine additional subsequently filed cases, as well as with any other cases pending
in the court, alleging similar violations under the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform
Act.
On March 29, 2016, Harold Koppitz, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, filed a putative
class action petition in the District Court of Woods County, Oklahoma, against SandRidge Energy, Inc. and
the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiff alleges that, commencing on
or around February 1, 2007, and continuing until at least March 31, 2012, the defendants conspired to rig
bids and depress the market for purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests located within the
State of Oklahoma in violation of the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act. Plaintiff seeks to certify two separate
and distinct classes of members. On August 3, 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the Company from
this lawsuit without prejudice.
On April 26, 2016, the defendants filed a Notice of Removal of the lawsuit to the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. On that same date, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his petition.
On April 29, 2016, plaintiff filed a new petition in the District Court of Woods County, Oklahoma, against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants, in which
plaintiff makes allegations substantially similar to the allegations contained in his original petition.
On April 13, 2016, Wesley and Towanda Mallory, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,
filed a putative class action petition in the District Court of Stephens County, Oklahoma, against
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the Company’s former CEO, Tom L. Ward, among other defendants. Plaintiffs
allege that, commencing on or around December 27, 2007, and continuing until at least April 1, 2013 (the
“Class Period”), the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress prices for oil and natural gas leasehold
and working interests and producing properties within the State of Oklahoma in violation of the Oklahoma
Antitrust Reform Act. Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of “[a]ll Oklahoma citizens and entities that, during the
relevant Class Period, provided or sold to one of more of the Defendants (a) oil and gas leasehold interests
on their property and/or (b) the producing properties or interests relating to land located in the Anadarko
Basin Region, in exchange for lease payments, including but not limited to lease bonuses.” On May 26,
2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the Company as a defendant in this action.
On February 4, 2015, the staff of the SEC Enforcement Division in Washington, D.C., notified the Company
that it had commenced an informal inquiry concerning the Company’s accounting for, and disclosure of, its
carbon dioxide delivery shortfall penalties under the terms of the Gas Treating and CO2 Delivery
Agreement, dated June 29, 2008, between SandRidge Exploration and Production, LLC, and Oxy USA
Inc.
Additionally, the Company received a letter from an attorney for a former employee at the Company (the
“Former Employee”).  In the letter, the attorney alleged, among other things, that the Former Employee had
been terminated because he had objected to the levels of oil and gas reserves disclosed by the Company
in its public filings.  Over 85% of such reserves were calculated by an independent petroleum engineering
firm.  The Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has retained an independent law firm to
review the Former Employee’s allegations and the circumstances of the Former Employee’s termination.
 In addition, the Company reported the Former Employee’s allegations to the SEC staff, which thereafter
issued two subpoenas to the Company relating to the Former Employee’s allegations.  Counsel for the
Audit Committee is responding to both of these subpoenas.
During the course of the above inquiries, the SEC issued a subpoena to the Company seeking documents
relating to employment-related agreements between the Company and certain employees. The Company
is cooperating with this inquiry and, after discussion with staff, the Company sent corrective letters to
certain current and former employees who had entered into agreements containing language that may
have been inconsistent with SEC rules prohibiting a company from impeding an individual
79
Table of Contents
from communicating directly with the SEC about possible securities law violations. The Company also
updated its Code of Conduct and other relevant policies. On June 16, 2016, the SEC filed a proof of claim
in the Company’s Chapter 11 Cases in the amount of $1.2 million as a result of the SEC staff’s inquiry
concerning employment-related agreements. Counsel for the Company is in discussions with the SEC in
an effort to resolve the Company’s liability regarding these inquiries.
The Company continues to cooperate with the above inquiries.
        
In addition to the litigation described above, the Company is a defendant in lawsuits from time to time in the
normal course of business.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously discussed in
Item 1A—Risk Factors in the Company’s 2015 Form 10-K.
The Company is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings.
For the duration of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company’s operations and ability to develop and
execute its business plan, as well as continue as a going concern, are subject to the risks and
uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include the following:
•the ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or alternative restructuring transaction;
•the ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;
•
the ability to maintain relationships with the Company’s suppliers, service providers, customers,
employees and other third parties;
•the ability to maintain contracts that are critical to the Company’s operations;
•the ability to execute the Company’s business plan;
•the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements
with the Company;
the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period
for the Company to propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or to convert
the Chapter 11 Cases to a Chapter 7 proceeding; and
•
•
the actions and decisions of the Company’s creditors and other third parties who have interests in the
Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with the Company’s plans.
These risks and uncertainties could affect the Company’s business and operations in various ways. For
example, negative events associated with the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect the Company’s
relationships with suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn
could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial condition. Also, the Company needs the
prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may
limit the Company’s ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities.
Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company cannot
accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that will occur during the Chapter 11 Cases that
may be inconsistent with the Company’s plans.
Operating under Court protection for a long period of time may harm the Company’s business.
The Company’s future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a
plan of reorganization. A long period of operations under Court protection could have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11
Cases continue, the Company’s senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time
and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on business operations. A
prolonged period of operating under Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management
and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of the business. In addition, the longer the
Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that customers and suppliers will lose confidence in the
Company’s ability to reorganize the business successfully and will seek to establish alternative
commercial relationships.
Furthermore, so long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the Company will be required to incur substantial
costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases.
The Chapter 11 Cases may also require the Company to seek debtor-in-possession financing to fund
operations. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, chances of
successfully reorganizing the business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that the Company
instead will be required to liquidate assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, any securities in the
Company could become further devalued or become worthless.
Furthermore, the Company cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that
will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and
implemented, the Company’s operating results
81
Table of Contents
may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do
business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings.
The Restructuring Support Agreement is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be
difficult for the Company to satisfy.
There are certain material conditions the Company must satisfy under the Restructuring Support
Agreement, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 Cases, such as confirmation of
the Plan and effectiveness of the Plan. The Company’s ability to timely complete such milestones is
subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond the Company’s control.
If the Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, the Company’s ability to confirm and consummate
the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.
The Restructuring Support Agreement contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of
which certain parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement may terminate the agreement. If the
Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, each of the parties thereto will be released from their
obligations in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement. Such termination may
result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement, which could
adversely affect the Company’s ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not
consummated, there can be no assurance that any new plan would be as favorable to holders of claims as
the current Plan.
The Company may not be able to obtain confirmation of the Plan as outlined in the Restructuring Support
Agreement.
There can be no assurance that the Plan as outlined in the Restructuring Support Agreement (or any other
plan of reorganization) will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. The success of any reorganization will
depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to
agree to the exchange or modification of their interests as outlined in the plan, and there can be no
guarantee of success with respect to the Plan or any other plan of reorganization. For instance, the
Company might receive official objections to confirmation of the Plan from the various bankruptcy
committees and stakeholders in the Chapter 11 Cases. The Company cannot predict the impact that any
objection might have on the Plan or on the Bankruptcy Court’s decision to confirm the Plan. Any objection
may cause significant resources to be devoted in response which could materially and adversely affect the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
If the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether the Company would be able to
reorganize the business and what, if any, distributions holders of claims against the Company, including
holders of the Company’s secured and unsecured debt and equity, would ultimately receive with respect to
their claims. There can be no assurance as to whether the Company will successfully reorganize and
emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases or, if the Company does successfully reorganize, as to when it would
emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.
Any plan of reorganization that the Company may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions
and analyses developed by the Company. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, the
Company’s plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.
 
Any plan of reorganization that the Company may implement could affect both its capital structure and the
ownership, structure and operation of its businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on
the Company’s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future
developments, as well as other factors that it considers appropriate under the circumstances. Whether
actual future results and developments will be consistent with the Company’s expectations and
assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) its ability to change
substantially its capital structure; (ii) its ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) its
ability to maintain suppliers’ confidence in its viability as a continuing entity and to continue doing business
with them; (iv) its ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general
economic conditions of the financial and oil and gas industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The
failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of the
Company’s businesses.
In addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to
revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily
speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these
financial forecasts will not be accurate. In the Company’s case, the forecasts will be even more speculative
than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of its capital structure.
Accordingly, the Company expects that its actual financial condition and results of operations will differ,
perhaps
82
Table of Contents
materially, from what it has anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or
developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization the Company may implement will occur or, even
if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on the Company and its subsidiaries or its
businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated
could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.
 
The Company has substantial liquidity needs and may not be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to confirm a
plan of reorganization and exit bankruptcy.
 
Although the Company has lowered its capital budget and reduced the scale of its operations significantly,
its business remains capital intensive. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing
operations, the Company has incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with its
Chapter 11 proceedings and expects that it will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs
throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings. The Company does not believe that its cash on hand and its cash
flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund its operations for any significant period of time.
There are no assurances that the Company’s current liquidity is sufficient to allow it to satisfy its obligations
related to the Chapter 11 proceedings, allow the Company to proceed with the confirmation of a Chapter
11 plan of reorganization and allow it to emerge from bankruptcy. The Company can provide no assurance
that it will be able to secure additional interim financing or exit financing sufficient to meet its liquidity needs
or, if sufficient funds are available, offered to the Company on acceptable terms.
Trading in the Company’s securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The Company
expects that its existing common stock will be extinguished and the warrants proposed to be issued to
existing holders of outstanding Senior Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes under the Restructuring
Support Agreement may not have any value.
The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates that the Company’s outstanding Senior Secured
Notes and Unsecured Notes will be converted into equity of the reorganized Company and that all equity
interests of the existing equity holders of the Company will be extinguished upon the Company’s
emergence from bankruptcy. In addition, even if the Plan is confirmed as currently outlined in the
Restructuring Support Agreement, the value of any warrants that are issued is highly speculative and the
exercise prices of such warrants are based upon assumed equity values that may never be attained.
The Company’s historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial performance.
The Company’s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization
ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to the
Company upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair
values and the Company’s accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start
reporting rules apply, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations following emergence
from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in
the Company’s historical financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the
amounts and classifications reported in the Company’s consolidated historical financial statements, which
do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be
necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.
The pursuit of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of
the time and attention of the Company’s management, which may have an adverse effect on the
Company’s business and results of operations, and the Company may face increased levels of employee
attrition.
While the Chapter 11 Cases continue, management will be required to spend a significant amount of time
and effort focusing on the cases. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of
the Company’s business, and, as a result, on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations,
particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.
During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company’s employees will face considerable
distraction and uncertainty and increased levels of employee attrition may be experienced. A loss of key
personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on the
Company’s ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting the business and results of
operations. The failure to retain or attract members of the management team and other key personnel could
impair the Company’s ability to execute its strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a
material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
83
Table of Contents
In certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code.
There can be no assurance as to whether the Company will successfully reorganize and emerge from the
Chapter 11 Cases or, if the Company does successfully reorganize, as to when it would emerge from the
Chapter 11 Cases.
If the Bankruptcy Court finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or the Debtors, the
Bankruptcy Court may convert the Company’s anticipated Chapter 11 Cases to cases under chapter 7 of
the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the
Debtors’ assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. The
Debtors believe that liquidation under chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being
made to the Debtors’ creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan because of (i) the likelihood
that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of
time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner the Debtors’ businesses as a going concern,
(ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a chapter 7 trustee, and
(iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated
during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a
cessation of operations.

ITEM 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities
The Company’s filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above constitutes an event of default that
accelerated the Company’s obligations under its senior credit facility, its Senior Secured Notes and its
Unsecured Notes. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under these debt agreements are stayed from
taking any action against the Company as a result of an event of default. See “Note 6 - Debt” and “Note 1 -
Chapter 11 Proceedings” to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,
Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional details about the principal and interest amounts of debt
included in liabilities subject to compromise on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet at June 30, 2016 and the Company’s Bankruptcy Petitions and the Chapter 11 Cases.
Under the terms of the 7.0% convertible perpetual preferred stock and the 8.5% convertible perpetual
preferred stock, the Company may defer payments of its cumulative semi-annual dividends. The Company
has exercised its contractual right to defer regularly scheduled semi-annual payments of dividends on its
preferred stock beginning with the November 2015 semi-annual dividend payment for the 7.0% convertible
perpetual preferred stock and the February 2016 semi-annual dividend payment for the 8.5% convertible
perpetual preferred stock, and is therefore currently in arrears with the dividend payments. As of June 30,
2016, the Company had $21.0 million and $11.3 million of dividend payments in arrears on the 7.0%
convertible perpetual preferred stock and the 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred stock, respectively. No
dividends have been accrued on the Company’s convertible perpetual preferred stock subsequent to the
Chapter 11 petition filing date. See “Note 1 - Chapter 11 Proceedings” to the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for treatment of the
convertible perpetual preferred stock under the Plan of Reorganization and the Chapter 11 Cases.
