Certification of Interim Filings
Full Certificate
I, Clive Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer of B2Gold Corp., certify the following:
1. Review: I have reviewed the interim financial report and interim MD&A (together, the “interim
filings”) of B2Gold Corp. (the “issuer”) for the interim period ended June 30, 2015.
2. No misrepresentations: Based on my knowledge, having exercised reasonable diligence,
the  interim  filings  do  not  contain  any  untrue  statement  of  a  material  fact  or  omit  to  state  a
material fact required to be stated or that is necessary to make a statement not misleading in
light of the circumstances under which it was made, with respect to the period covered by the
interim filings.
3. Fair  presentation:  Based  on  my  knowledge,  having  exercised  reasonable  diligence,  the
interim  financial  report  together  with  the  other  financial  information  included  in  the  interim
filings fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, financial performance and
cash flows of the issuer, as of the date of and for the periods presented in the interim filings.
4. Responsibility: The issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing
and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (DC&P)  and  internal  control  over
financial  reporting  (ICFR),  as  those  terms  are  defined  in  National  Instrument  52-109
Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings, for the issuer.
5. Design: Subject to the limitations, if any, described in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3, the issuer’s
other certifying officer(s) and I have, as at the end of the period covered by the interim filings
(a) designed  DC&P,  or  caused  it  to  be  designed  under  our  supervision,  to  provide
reasonable assurance that
(i) material information relating to the issuer is made known to us by others, particularly
during the period in which the interim filings are being prepared; and
(ii)
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in its annual filings, interim filings
or  other  reports  filed  or  submitted  by  it  under  securities  legislation  is  recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities
legislation; and
(b) designed ICFR, or caused it to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with the issuer’s GAAP.
5.1 Control framework: The control framework the issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I used
to design the issuer’s ICFR is the Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by The
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
5.2 ICFR – material weakness relating to design: N/A
5.3 Limitation on scope of design: N/A.
6. Reporting changes in ICFR: The issuer has disclosed in its interim MD&A any change in
the issuer’s ICFR that occurred during the period beginning on April 1, 2015 and ended on
June  30,  2015  that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the
issuer’s ICFR.
