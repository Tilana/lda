</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>This report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102, 
contains two substantive sections.  The first signals some of the progress made by the health and 
human rights movement in the last decade and it also discusses two of the key obstacles that lie 
ahead.  
</p>
<p>As never before, civil society - especially in low- and middle-income countries - is 
engaging with health and human rights.  Some States are taking health and human rights 
seriously.  General comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
provides authoritative guidance on the scope of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (&#8220;the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health&#8221; or &#8220;the right to health&#8221;).  Since 2000, numerous reports have explored how 
the right to health can be operationalized.  Law cases, literature and courses on health and human 
rights are increasingly common.  
</p>
<p>There is a new maturity about the health and human rights movement as it endeavours to 
integrate human rights into health policies at the national and international levels.  In addition to 
the traditional human rights techniques, such as &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221;, the health and human 
rights movement is also using approaches such as indicators, benchmarks and impact 
assessments. 
</p>
<p>However, the health and human rights movement is also confronted with a range of major 
obstacles.  The present report focuses on two of them:  the inadequate engagement within the 
health and human rights movement of (i) established human rights non-governmental 
organizations and (ii) health professionals. 
</p>
<p>The report urges established human rights non-governmental organizations to work on 
health and human rights issues, such as maternal mortality, just as vigorously as they already 
campaign on disappearances, torture and prisoners of conscience.  
</p>
<p>The report also emphasizes that health and human rights not only occupy much common 
ground, but also complement and reinforce each other.  Nevertheless, many health professionals 
have never heard of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  The report argues that 
there is no chance of operationalizing the right to health without the active engagement of many 
more health professionals, and it makes some preliminary observations about steps that might be 
taken to deepen health professionals&#8217; engagement in the health and human rights movement.  
</p>
<p>In recent years, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, as well as other 
health-related rights, have generated an increasingly rich case law.  The report&#8217;s second 
substantive section explains that judicial accountability has enhanced protection for the right to 
health and other health-related rights, and also deepened understanding of what these human 
rights mean.  The section includes a sample of cases that signal how various tribunals have 
interpreted and applied health-related human rights. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, the General Assembly concluded the work of 
the Commission on Human Rights and created the Human Rights Council.  The mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health is set out in Commission resolutions 2002/31 and 2004/27.  The 
Human Rights Council, by its decision 1/102, extended all the mandates of the former 
Commission on Human Rights, including that of the Special Rapporteur.  The present report is 
submitted in accordance with that decision. 
</p>
<p>2. In October 2006, the Special Rapporteur presented a report to the General Assembly 
(see A/61/338).  The report explored two main themes:  maternal mortality and the right to 
medicines.  It also included information on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate activities during 
the period January-August 2006.  While in New York to present his report, the Special 
Rapporteur participated in a briefing on his mandate, organized for non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) by the New York Office of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights.  He also attended a meeting with staff of the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA). 
</p>
<p>3. In September 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing, Mr. Miloon Kothari, the Representative of the Secretary-General on human 
rights of internally displaced persons, Mr. Walter K&#228;lin, and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Mr. Philip Alston, visited Lebanon and Israel at 
the invitation of their Governments.  A report on the mission (A/HRC/2/7) was submitted and 
presented to the Human Rights Council the following month. 
</p>
<p>4. In October 2006, the Special Rapporteur visited Peru where he had meetings following 
up on his country mission of June 2004 (see E/CN.4/2005/51/Add.3).  He met with the 
Vice-Minister of Health, the Minister for Women, and representatives of the Ministry of Justice 
and Foreign Affairs.  He held a meeting with many congresswomen and congressmen, and also 
met with the Defensoria del Pueblo (Ombuds) and her colleagues.  He also met with 
representatives of the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), UNFPA, UNAIDS and other 
international organizations, as well as with civil society, and visited Victor Larco Herrera 
psychiatric hospital in Lima.  Following this visit, the Special Rapporteur is requesting further 
information about follow-up undertaken in response to recommendations included in the report 
on his 2004 mission. 
</p>
<p>5. In the same month, the Special Rapporteur travelled to Washington, DC, where he met 
with the Executive Directors of the Nordic-Baltic Departments in the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund (IMF).  This official visit was undertaken by way of follow-up to 
his mission to Sweden in January 2006.  A report on this visit to the World Bank and IMF will 
be presented to the Human Rights Council in 2007.<b>1</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT:  
PROGRESS AND OBSTACLES 
</b></p>
<p>6. Thanks to the work of innumerable organizations and individuals, the health and human 
rights movement has made striking progress in the last decade.  However, the movement cannot 
maintain its present momentum without confronting some major obstacles that now lie in its 
path.  The present chapter briefly outlines recent progress and focuses on two key interrelated 
challenges facing the contemporary health and human rights movement.  So long as these 
challenges are not adequately addressed, the health and human rights movement will be unable 
to realize its considerable potential. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Recent progress 
</b></p>
<p>7. With a few exceptions, the relationship between health and human rights was not subject 
to close, serious examination until the 1990s.  Of course, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Constitution of 1946 affirms the right to health and so does the Declaration of Alma-Ata of 1978.  
Both represent very significant milestones in the journey of health and human rights.  Also, some 
of those who were struggling against HIV/AIDS in the 1980s recognized the crucial importance 
of human rights.  But, for the most part, these important developments were not accompanied by 
a detailed examination of the substantive relationship between health and human rights.  That 
had to wait until the early 1990s, little more than a decade ago.<b>2</b>  A great debt is owed to the late 
Jonathan Mann and his colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health and the 
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights for their pioneering work on the 
relationship between health and human rights, especially in the context of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>8. In the 1990s, however, Dr. Mann and others suffered from a serious limitation that does 
not apply today.  At that time, although there was a widespread and detailed understanding of 
many human rights, there was no comparable understanding of what must surely be a 
cornerstone of any consideration of health and human rights:  the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health.  Inevitably, this gap placed a significant constraint on all those working in the 
field of health and human rights during this period.  It was not until 2000 that an authoritative 
understanding of the right to health emerged when the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, working in close collaboration with WHO and many others, adopted general 
comment No. 14. 
</p>
<p>9. Although neither complete, nor perfect, nor binding, general comment No. 14 is 
compelling and groundbreaking.  For the first time, here is a substantive understanding of the 
right to health that can be made operational and improved in the light of practical experience.  
The general comment makes the right to health - as set out in the WHO Constitution, affirmed in 
the Declaration of Alma-Ata and enshrined in numerous binding international human rights 
treaties - more than a slogan.  In short, it represents another important milestone in the journey of 
health and human rights. 
</p>
<p>10. Since 2000, the development of the health and human rights movement has quickened.  
Some States, such as Peru, have begun to take the right to health seriously at the domestic level.<b>3</b>  
Others, such as Sweden, are endeavouring to integrate the right to health, and other human 
rights, into their international policies.<b>4</b>  For many years, UNICEF, UNAIDS and some other </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>agencies gave careful attention to human rights and, in some cases, this deepened after 2000.  
In 2003, for example, UNAIDS buttressed its human rights work by establishing an expert 
Global Reference Group on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights.  Presently, UNFPA is developing a 
training package on a human rights-based approach with a particular focus on gender equality 
and reproductive rights.  Within WHO, the Special Rapporteur has found willing collaborators in 
some areas such as neglected diseases, mental health, child and adolescent health, essential 
medicines and sexual and reproductive health, as well as in some regional and country offices.<b>5</b>  
WHO booklets <i>25 Questions and Answers on Health and Human Rights</i> (2002) and <i>Human 
Rights, Health and Poverty Reduction Strategies</i> (2005) remain among the most accessible 
introductions to these subjects.<b>6</b>  
11. The present decade has also seen a growing number of health and human rights cases 
decided at the national, regional and international levels; a sample of this case law is provided in 
section III of this report.  Also, the academic literature on health, human rights and the right to 
health has deepened, while courses that teach these issues have proliferated.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Civil society, health and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>12. Since 2000, one of the most striking developments has been in civil society.  
Non-governmental organizations working in low- and middle-income countries have always had 
a clearer appreciation of health and human rights issues than their counterparts working in 
high-income countries.  In some countries, the Special Rapporteur has been deeply impressed by 
civil society&#8217;s commitment to, and familiarity with, the right to health.  In Peru, for example, 
some civil society groups explicitly use human rights language, run right-to-health information 
campaigns, call for grass-roots participation in health policymaking, take health and human 
rights cases, and so on.<b>8</b>  Such health and human rights activism has coincided with the 
publication of a range of relevant materials in all regions, such as <i>The Right to Health:  A 
Resource Manual for NGOs</i>.<b>9</b> 
13. The increased commitment of civil society organizations to economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to health, has extended beyond the national level to international 
NGOs.  For many years, Amnesty International was associated with a narrow range of civil and 
political rights.  More recently, its global membership decided this had to change.  According to 
its 2005 publication <i>Human Rights and Human Dignity:  A Primer on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights</i>:  &#8220;In recent years Amnesty International has broadened its mission in recognition 
that there are many more prisoners of poverty than prisoners of conscience, and that millions 
endure the torture of hunger and slow death from preventable disease.&#8221;<b>10</b>  Moreover, this broader 
mission is beginning to translate into specific right-to-health initiatives.<b>11</b>  Other international 
NGOs - Human Rights Watch, International Commission of Jurists, International Federation of 
Human Rights Leagues, International Service for Human Rights, Interights, and others - are also 
giving more attention to economic, social and cultural rights.  The commitment varies from one 
organization to another and is often contested.  Also, as argued below, much more needs to be 
done.  Nonetheless, the general trend is unmistakeable and in the right direction. 
</p>
<p>14. Another important group of human rights NGOs is those mainly consisting of health 
professionals, such as Physicians for Human Rights and the International Federation of Health 
and Human Rights Organizations.  In the 1990s, such groups tended to focus on the civil and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>political rights dimension of health, such as torture issues.  In recent years, this focus has 
widened to encompass the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  A few national 
medical associations, such as the British Medical Association, are also giving more attention to 
health and human rights.  In 2006, the American Public Health Association held its annual 
meeting on &#8220;Public Health and Human Rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, M&#233;decins du Monde, Partners in Health, Doctors for Global 
Health and similar organizations of health professionals are delivering health services to 
vulnerable individuals and communities in all regions of the world.  Their practical, life-saving 
work is inspirational.  Interestingly, their use of human rights varies a great deal.  Some use 
human rights as an advocacy tool; others also use human rights as a way of formulating equitable 
health policies and programmes; while others seldom explicitly use human rights at all.  The 
same can be said about organizations working in the field of development.  CARE, for example, 
explicitly uses human rights in its health work. 
</p>
<p>16. Providing a bridge between many of these groups, the People&#8217;s Health Movement has 
recently launched a global &#8220;Right to Health and Healthcare Campaign&#8221;.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>17. In conclusion, space constraints permit only this brief, incomplete sketch of some recent 
developments concerning civil society, health and human rights.  The civil society component of 
the health and human rights movement is much more dynamic today than it was only a few years 
ago.  Although more dynamic than before, civil society&#8217;s recognition of health issues as human 
rights issues remains uneven:  strong in some countries, tenuous in others, and non-existent in 
many.  There is an increasing recognition of the role of the right to health within the health and 
human rights movement.  Nonetheless, civil society within the health and human rights 
movement could and should be doing much more, a crucial point that this section returns to 
shortly. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Operationalizing the right to health:  the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s contribution 
</b></p>
<p>18. General comment No. 14 greatly facilitates the design of rights-based approaches to 
health.  Also, it underlines the links between the right to health and other human rights.  
However, although a ground-breaking document, the general comment was never intended to be 
a detailed guide to the operationalization of the right to health.  As its name suggests, the general 
comment talks about the right to health in general terms. 
</p>
<p>19. Since 2003, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports have tried to make the right to health more 
specific, accessible, practical and operational.  These reports have not only drawn from general 
comment No. 14, but also the work of other United Nations human rights treaty bodies,<b>13</b> as well 
as the practice of States, specialized agencies, courts and tribunals, non-governmental 
organizations and academics.  Some of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports have focused on specific 
elements of the right to health, such as access to medicines.<b>14</b>  Others have applied the right to 
health to specific issues, such as the health-related Millennium Development Goals.<b>15</b>  Others 
have looked at the right to health in relation to specific groups of people, such as those with 
mental disabilities.<b>16</b>  Also, country reports have applied the right to health to specific 
jurisdictions, such as Mozambique, Peru, Uganda, Romania and Sweden.<b>17</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. Today, one of the most important health and human rights challenges is to enhance 
enjoyment of the right to health for those living in poverty.  With this in mind, one of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports explains how consideration of the right to health would have 
strengthened Niger&#8217;s Poverty Reduction Strategy.<b>18</b>  Another sets out how policies deriving from 
the right to health can help Uganda in its struggle against &#8220;neglected&#8221; or tropical diseases, 
i.e. those diseases mostly afflicting those living in poverty.<b>19</b>  The Ugandan report identifies 
specific, practical health initiatives, such as the development of village health teams, incentives 
for health workers to serve in remote communities, accessible public health information 
campaigns, and so on.  Another report examines the migration of health professionals from 
developing to developed States; it shows that this skills drain is a perverse subsidy from poor to 
rich that further undermines the right to health of those living in poverty in the sending 
countries.<b>20</b>  Effectively, these reports - as well as others, such as the Mozambican report<b>21</b> - are 
exploring how to operationalize the right to health for those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>21. General comment No. 14 provides one paragraph on the right to health of indigenous 
peoples.<b>22</b>  Although this paragraph is highly instructive, it only contains a few sentences.  The 
Special Rapporteur has written three reports with sections on indigenous peoples.  One section 
considers indigenous peoples and the right to health generally,<b>23</b> while the other two are specific 
to the indigenous peoples of Peru and Sweden.<b>24</b>  Each chapter includes recommendations for 
State authorities and other actors.  Effectively, all three reports are helping to operationalize the 
right to health of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>22. Although trade impacts on the right to health in numerous ways, these issues receive very 
limited explicit attention in general comment No. 14.  In 2004, the Special Rapporteur devoted a 
report to the relationship between the World Trade Organization and the right to health.<b>25</b>  The 
report examines issues such as intellectual property in relation to access to medicines, and trade 
in services in relation to access to health care.  Some of these issues were examined further in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report following his country mission to Peru, specifically in relation to the 
United States-Peru trade agreement.<b>26</b>  Both reports provide recommendations.  In effect, these 
reports take the general principles outlined in general comment No. 14 and apply them to a 
number of specific trade issues, thereby helping to operationalize the right to health in relation to 
intellectual property, trade in services, and so on. 
</p>
<p>23. Many other examples could be given, but these three - on poverty, indigenous peoples 
and trade - are sufficient to signal that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports have focused on how the 
right to health can be operationalized.  They have moved from the general to the specific.  Of 
course, they do not provide detailed right-to-health programmes; this would require more space 
and contextualization than is possible in reports of this kind.  Nonetheless, the reports identify 
some of the key practical features that specific right-to-health programmes should encompass. 
</p>
<p>24. The right to health is one of the most extensive and complex human rights in the 
international lexicon.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports also provide a way of &#8220;unpacking&#8221; the 
right to health with a view to making it easier to understand.  The most detailed application of 
this &#8220;unpacking&#8221; is found in the report on mental disabilities.<b>27</b>  While this report sets out in 
some detail how the right to health can be operationalized for those with mental disabilities, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>additionally it provides a &#8220;map&#8221; to the right to health that is not confined to mental 
disabilities - it has general application.  Finally, the reports also deepen and refine our conceptual 
understanding of some elements of general comment No. 14, such as those relating to 
international assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  New skills and techniques 
</b></p>
<p>25. Over many years, the traditional human rights movement has developed a range of 
methods and techniques to further its objectives.  Typically, these techniques have included, 
inter alia, &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221;, letter-writing campaigns, taking test cases, sloganizing, and so 
on.  These methods have served the human rights community well and they continue to be of 
fundamental importance, including in relation to the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health.  But in the context of the right to health, these traditional human rights methods and 
techniques are no longer enough. 
</p>
<p>26. In his first report to the Commission on Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur 
emphasized that the right to health &#8220;should be consistently and coherently applied across all 
relevant national and international policy-making processes&#8221;.<b>28</b>  Indeed, this has been one of the 
primary aims of all his reports:  to promote the integration of the right to health in all 
health-related policies.  However, to achieve this aim, the traditional human rights methods and 
techniques are insufficient.  The right to health cannot be integrated into national and 
international policies by merely &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221;, conducting letter-writing campaigns and 
test cases, and uttering slogans.  Today, an increasing number of participants in the health and 
human rights movement understand that additional methods, techniques and skills are needed if 
the right to health is to be operationalized through health policies, programmes and projects.  
Moreover, they are already developing these new approaches. 
</p>
<p>27. It is now widely recognized, for example, that a system of indicators and benchmarks is 
needed to measure the progressive realization of the right to health.  Several specialized 
agencies, civil society organizations, academics and others are contributing to the development 
of appropriate indicators and benchmarks in the specific context of the right to health and other 
human rights.  For his part, the Special Rapporteur has written three reports on this issue, the last 
of which sets out a human rights-based approach to health indicators.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Also, a range of actors are now developing human rights - and right-to-health - impact 
assessments.  If the right to health is to be integrated into policies, a methodology is needed to 
help policymakers anticipate the likely impact of a projected policy on the enjoyment of the right 
to health, so that, if necessary, adjustments can be made to the proposed policy.  The Special 
Rapporteur has co-authored a UNESCO-funded paper that introduces some of the literature on 
this topic and sets out, for discussion, a draft methodology for right-to-health impact 
assessments.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Today, the health and human rights movement is grappling with difficult questions:  for 
example, when formulating health policies, which trade-offs are permissible and impermissible 
from the perspective of the right to health?  Given finite budgets, how should ministers of health 
prioritize, in a manner that is respectful of the right to health, amongst competing objectives?  Of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>course, human rights do not provide neat answers to these complex issues any more than does 
equity, health economics or any other body of principles and knowledge.  Nonetheless, the health 
and human rights movement is developing the techniques and skills to enable it to make a 
constructive contribution to these important and complex discussions. 
</p>
<p>30. In short, there is a new maturity about the health and human rights movement.  &#8220;Naming 
and shaming&#8221;, test cases and slogans all have a vital role to play in the promotion and protection 
of the right to health, but so do indicators, benchmarks, impact assessments, budgetary analysis, 
and the ability to take tough policy choices in a manner that is respectful of international human 
rights law and practice. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The pivotal role of established human rights civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>31. Earlier in this section, the Special Rapporteur argues that some established human rights 
NGOs are now giving more attention than before to economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to health.  While this is very encouraging, the Special Rapporteur also has the 
firm impression that some of these organizations still devote much more attention to civil and 
political rights than to economic, social and cultural rights.  Although there are numerous and 
widespread right-to-health problems that are an affront to humanity, they still seldom attract the 
sustained attention of established human rights NGOs. 
</p>
<p>32. Take maternal mortality.  Each year, there are over 500,000 maternal deaths.  That is the 
equivalent of about one maternal death every minute; 95 per cent of maternal deaths are in 
Africa and Asia.  Most could be avoided by a few well-known interventions.  While women in 
some rich countries have a 1 in 8,700 chance of dying in childbirth, women in some low-income 
countries have a 1 in 10 chance. 
</p>
<p>33. These facts are especially shocking not only because they are preventable, but also 
because they expose profound health inequalities.  First, the burden of maternal mortality falls 
disproportionately on women in developing countries.  Second, in both developing and 
developed countries, the burden of maternal mortality falls disproportionately on ethnic minority 
women, indigenous women and women living in poverty.  Third, there is no single cause of 
death and disability for men between the ages of 15 and 44 that is close to the magnitude of 
maternal mortality and morbidity.  In other words, maternal mortality and morbidity reveal sharp 
discrepancies between men and women in their enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health 
rights.  In summary, maternal mortality highlights multiple inequalities - global, ethnic and 
gender.  And recurring throughout is the entrenched disadvantage of those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>34. As the Special Rapporteur argued in his last report to the General Assembly, maternal 
mortality is not just a health issue, it is a human rights issue.<b>31</b>  Avoidable maternal mortality 
violates women&#8217;s rights to life, health, equality and non-discrimination.  Moreover, the scale of 
maternal mortality is just as large as - if not larger than - many of the extremely serious human 
rights issues that, for many years, have attracted much of the attention of established human 
rights NGOs.  For example, several of these organizations campaign against the death penalty.  
In 2005, about 2,500 people under sentence of death were executed.<b>32</b>  This is almost certainly an 
underestimate, so assume this figure might be multiplied tenfold to 25,000.  How many maternal 
deaths were there in the same period?  About 500,000. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. Since 1980, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has taken up 
about 50,000 cases.<b>33</b> How many maternal deaths were there in this 26-year period?  Well over 
10 million.  Certainly, the number of disappearances in this period far exceeds 50,000, but 
nobody suggests that the number approaches 10 million.  Despite this, disappearances have 
generated their own &#8220;special procedure&#8221; (the Working Group), various international instruments 
on this specific human rights issue,<b>34</b> and the relentless attention of many civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>36. The death penalty and disappearances are extremely serious human rights issues that 
fully deserve the human rights attention they have received.  But maternal mortality is also an 
extremely serious human rights problem and it has not received the attention from the human 
rights community that it deserves.  In fact, with a few notable exceptions, maternal mortality has 
received virtually no attention from the mainstream human rights community. 
</p>
<p>37. Last year, a number of world leaders - Bill Clinton, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 
Desmond Tutu, Mary Robinson, Gro Brundtland, Nafis Sidik and many others - adopted a 
Leaders&#8217; Call to Action on the right to health.<b>35</b>  In this spirit, the time has come for established 
human rights NGOs to recognize that maternal mortality is a human rights catastrophe on a 
massive scale.  They must campaign against maternal mortality, and other egregious health and 
human rights issues, just as vigorously as they have taken up the death penalty, disappearances, 
extrajudicial executions, torture, arbitrary detention and prisoners of conscience.  If they decline 
to do this, then profoundly important health and human rights issues will never become part of 
the human rights mainstream. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  The pivotal role of health professionals 
</b></p>
<p>38. Here the term &#8220;health professionals&#8221; is used to encompass all those working in the fields 
of medical care and public health, including health community workers, policymakers, 
economists and administrators. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur has submitted over 20 reports on the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health, and these reports repeatedly confirm the common ground shared 
between those professionals working in health and those working in human rights.  Both groups 
wish to establish effective, integrated, responsive health systems accessible to all.  Both stress 
the importance not only of access to health care, but also access to water, sanitation, health 
information and education.  Both understand that good health is not the sole responsibility of the 
Ministry of Health, but a wide range of public and private actors.  Both prioritize the struggle 
against discrimination and disadvantage and both stress cultural respect.  At root, those working 
in health and human rights are both animated by a similar concern:  the well-being of individuals 
and populations. 
</p>
<p>40. Moreover, these reports not only confirm that health and human rights occupy much 
common ground; they also show how health and human rights complement and reinforce each 
other. 
</p>
<p>41. Obviously, the realization of the right to the highest attainable standard of health depends 
upon health professionals enhancing public health and delivering medical care.  The right to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>health cannot be realized without health professionals.  Equally, the classic, traditional objectives 
of the various health professions can benefit from the new, dynamic discipline of human rights.  
Human rights can help to reinforce existing, good health programmes, and they can sometimes 
help to identify new, equitable health policies.  They can help to ensure that health policies and 
programmes are equitable, effective, evidence-based, robust, participatory, inclusive and 
meaningful to those living in poverty.  The supportive role of human rights extends to the 
provision of medical care, as well as public health.  Also, provided it is done in an appropriate 
manner, framing a pressing health concern as a human rights issue can enhance its legitimacy 
and importance.  In other words, health professionals can use human rights to help them achieve 
their professional objectives. 
</p><p>42. Health professionals run the key international health organizations, as well as ministries 
of health across the globe.  Naturally, they dominate the health sector, both public and private.  
Clearly, there is no possibility of putting the right to health - and other health-related rights - into 
practice without large numbers of well-positioned health professionals understanding and 
supporting this endeavour.  In short, there is no chance of operationalizing the right to health 
without the active engagement of many health professionals. 
</p>
<p>43. Here, however, is a very major problem.  To be blunt, most health professionals whom 
the Special Rapporteur meets have not even heard of the right to health.  If they have heard of it, 
they usually have no idea what it means, either conceptually or operationally.  If they have heard 
of it, they are likely to be worried that it is something that will get them into trouble.  The 
problem is partly one of language:  while health and human rights have much in common, the 
language used is often different.  That is one of the reasons why the Special Rapporteur is 
presently completing a short paper on the complementary relationship between equity (a term 
familiar to many health professionals) and human rights. 
</p>
<p>44. Earlier in this section, the Special Rapporteur argues that some health professionals have 
recently begun to take human rights, including the right to health, more seriously.  This is 
undoubtedly true and very encouraging.  However, if further progress is to be made towards the 
operationalization of the right to health, many more health professionals must begin to appreciate 
the human rights dimensions of their work.  The message must be conveyed much more clearly 
and widely that the right to health, and other health-related rights, are allies and assets for health 
professionals to use.  Health professionals can use health-related rights to help them devise more 
equitable policies and programmes; to place important health issues higher up national and 
international agendas; to secure better coordination across health-related sectors; to raise more 
funds from the Treasury; to leverage more funds from developed countries to developing 
countries; in some countries, to improve the terms and conditions of those working in the health 
sector; and so on.  It is crucial that many more health professionals come to appreciate that the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health is not just a rhetorical device, but also a tool that 
can save lives and reduce suffering, especially among the most disadvantaged. 
</p>
<p>45. Listening to those health professionals who disregard the potential of human rights to 
assist their work, it sometimes becomes clear that they do not understand some elementary 
features of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  Some do not appreciate that the 
right to health is subject to progressive realization (of course a State is not expected to realize the 
right immediately).  Others do not grasp that the right to health is subject to resource availability </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(of course what is required from Canada is more than what is required from Chad).<b>36</b>  Some do 
not understand that the right to health encompasses both health care and the underlying 
determinants of health, such as adequate water and sanitation.  Some misinterpret human rights 
and then argue that they are contrary to &#8220;social equity&#8221; whereas precisely the reverse is true.  
Frequently, they are only aware of the traditional human rights methods and techniques, such as 
&#8220;naming and shaming&#8221;, and they fail to appreciate that the maturing health and human rights 
movement is developing the more sophisticated techniques signalled in the previous section. 
</p>
<p>46. One of the areas where there is often a serious misunderstanding is accountability.  
Although human rights demand accountability, that does not mean everybody working in health 
and human rights has the task of holding duty-bearers to account; it does not mean that every 
health professional or specialized agency becomes a human rights enforcer.  What it means is 
that there must be accessible, transparent and effective mechanisms of accountability in relation 
to health and human rights.  The health and human rights movement needs human rights 
advisers, implementers and enablers, as well as those whose job it is to hold duty-bearers to 
account.  All these functions will rarely reside in one organization or person.  While specialized 
agencies should be human rights advisers, implementers and enablers, it is not their primary job 
to hold States to account.  The accountability function must be provided by some organization or 
person, but not by a specialized agency, unless the agency decides to establish a discreet 
independent procedure and body for this purpose.<b>37</b>  Accountability is also sometimes 
narrowly understood to mean blame and punishment, whereas it is more accurately regarded as a 
process to determine what is working (so it can be repeated) and what is not (so it can be 
adjusted). 
47. It would be unfair to reproach those health professionals who are unfamiliar with the 
right to health and other human rights.  It is not their fault if they have not been exposed to the 
potential of human rights to reinforce their work.  In most countries, health professionals can 
qualify and practice without being taught anything about human rights.  It is for this reason that 
in one of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s earliest reports he devoted a section to the importance of 
deepening human rights education for health professionals.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>48. This section briefly signals some of the progress made by the health and human rights 
movement in the last decade.  The movement has come a long way in a short time.  While there 
is still much further to travel, the key pieces are now in place for the health and human rights 
movement to flourish in the next few years. 
</p>
<p>49. However, the movement is confronted with a range of major obstacles, such as 
inadequate budget support for the health sector, as well as the continuing resistance of the 
present Government of the United States of America to economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  When a Government as 
influential as that of the United States is unsupportive of a particular human right, it is much 
more difficult for relevant United Nations agencies to advance this agenda, even when the right 
in question forms part of the organization&#8217;s constitution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. In recent years, WHO has contributed to the health and human rights movement, as 
briefly acknowledged in paragraph 10 of this report.  Unfortunately, however, neither the 
member States nor the Secretariat of WHO has provided leadership in this field.  The 2005 
World Summit urged the &#8220;mainstreaming of human rights throughout the United Nations 
system&#8221;, reaffirming a vital component of the Secretary-General&#8217;s reform package adopted in 
1997.<b>39</b>  But this has not happened within WHO, where the health and human rights agenda has 
remained marginal, contested and severely under-resourced.  This is deeply regrettable because 
human rights can reinforce, sharpen and invigorate the health policies, programmes and projects 
of WHO and its member States.  The programme of work for 2006-2015 recently adopted by 
WHO includes seven priority areas, including the promotion of health-related rights.  It will be 
interesting to monitor how this important feature of the WHO programme is implemented. 
</p>
<p>51. This section, however, focuses on two related obstacles:  the inadequate engagement of 
established human rights NGOs, as well as health professionals, in the health and human rights 
movement.  The section&#8217;s main aim is to draw attention to these twin obstacles so that collective 
consideration can be given to how they might be dismantled.  A few preliminary observations, 
however, are in order about what steps might be taken in relation to the second obstacle, 
concerning health professionals. 
</p>
<p>52. As the Special Rapporteur argues in an earlier report, States should build an environment 
that supports the adoption of rights-based approaches by the health community.<b>40</b>  All bodies 
responsible for the training of health professionals should integrate human rights education and 
training at all professional levels.  National health professional associations should raise 
awareness about human rights and stimulate demand for human rights education among their 
members.  The staff of ministries of health, as well as those working in health-related sectors, 
should become familiar with the complementary relationship between health and human rights.  
National human rights institutions should provide human rights training for health professionals.  
Human rights training institutions should include health-related rights in their curricula. 
</p>
<p>53. WHO has a critical role to play.  As a priority, the Secretariat should develop, through 
broad ranging consultations with member States and other stakeholders, a strategy setting out its 
mandate, role and priority activities in the area of health and human rights, including national 
capacity-building.  This strategy should be submitted to, and approved by, the WHO governing 
bodies.  Such a strategy will provide WHO with a solid institutional platform for its work in this 
area of increasing promise and interest.  In turn, this will lead to a more systematic application of 
a human rights-based approach in countries. 
</p>
<p>54. For their part, those already committed to health-related rights should not overstate the 
contribution of human rights; after all, human rights do not provide magic solutions to complex 
health problems.  Nonetheless, human rights have a constructive contribution to make - and this 
contribution cannot be realized without the active support and engagement of large numbers of 
health professionals. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. CASES ON THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND 
OTHER HEALTH-RELATED RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>55. Because the right to the highest attainable standard of health is so extensive and complex, 
a top priority is to clarify the scope of the right to health and other health-related rights.  There 
are several ways of doing this, including through the case law of bodies with responsibility for 
interpreting human rights.  This section includes a sample of cases that signal what various 
national, regional and international tribunals understand health-related rights to mean. 
</p>
<p>56. Some of the cases interpret the right to the highest attainable standard of health in terms 
of either the right to health care (e.g. access to emergency medical treatment), or the underlying 
determinants of health (e.g. access to uncontaminated food).  Both dimensions of the right to 
health are crucial.  Some of the cases rely upon health-related rights (e.g. the right to life) where 
interpreted by the courts to protect health.  Although the right to health is enshrined in an 
increasing number of constitutions, even more jurisdictions recognize health-related rights.  
Some of the cases rely upon both the right to health and other health-related rights.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Unless supported by some form of accountability, human rights run the risk of becoming 
mere window dressing.  There are many forms of accountability.  While some are general 
(e.g. fair elections, a free press), others are specific to human rights (e.g. inquiries by national 
human rights institutions).  While some are judicial (e.g. bills of rights enforceable in the courts), 
others are administrative (e.g. human right impact assessments).  While some are national (e.g. a 
constitutional court), others are international (e.g. a human rights treaty body).  Within each 
State there will have to be a range of accountability mechanisms.  Just as the forms of 
accountability are likely to vary from one State to another, so will the appropriate mix.  All 
mechanisms of accountability should be accessible, transparent and effective. 
</p>
<p>58. This chapter focuses on just one form of accountability:  judicial accountability.  The 
limitations of judicial processes are well known.  However, as the following cases illustrate, 
courts can clarify the meaning of health-related rights and also secure better health-related 
services for individuals and communities.  The cases are broadly grouped under some of the key 
concepts found in international human rights law.<b>42 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Progressive realization, resource availability and immediate obligations 
</b></p>
<p>59. According to international - and some national - human rights law, the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health is subject to progressive realization and resource availability.<b>43</b>  Put 
simply, progressive realization means that States are expected to do better next year than they are 
doing today, while resource availability acknowledges that what is required of a rich country is 
of a higher standard than what is required of a low - or middle-income country. 
</p>
<p>60. The Constitution of South Africa includes a Bill of Rights that recognizes the right of 
access to health-care services.<b>44</b>  According to the Bill of Rights, the State is required to take 
reasonable measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of this 
human right.  The case of <i>Minister of Health v. Treatment Action Campaign</i> concerned State </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provision of Nevirapine, an antiretroviral drug used to prevent mother-to-child-transmission 
(MTCT) of HIV.<b>45</b>  Applying the concepts of progressive realization and resource availability, 
the Constitutional Court confirmed that the Government must &#8220;act reasonably to provide access 
to the socio-economic rights identified in the Constitution on a progressive basis&#8221; and it ordered 
the authorities to &#8220;devise and implement, within its available resources<i>,</i> a comprehensive and 
co-ordinated programme to recognise progressively the rights of pregnant women and their 
new-born children to have access to health services to combat MTCT of HIV&#8221;.  This case is 
discussed in more detail in paragraph 72. 
</p>
<p>61. The South African Constitutional Court also reflected on the issue of resource availability 
in the case <i>Soobramoney v. Minister of Health KwaZulu Natal.<b></b></i><b>46</b>  The applicant suffered from 
chronic renal failure and required dialysis to survive.  His condition was diagnosed as 
irreversible.  While he was initially able to pay for private treatment, he ran out of funds and 
sought treatment in a State-funded hospital.  Due to its limited resources, the hospital was not 
able to provide dialysis to all patients.  The hospital had therefore adopted a policy and 
guidelines regarding access to dialysis.  Only patients who suffered from acute renal failure, 
which can be treated and remedied by dialysis, were automatically entitled to treatment.  For 
patients suffering from chronic renal failure, the primary requirement for admission to the 
dialysis programme was eligibility for a kidney transplant.  Patients also suffering from 
significant vascular or cardiac diseases were not eligible for a transplant.  Mr. Soobramoney 
failed to satisfy the hospital requirements for dialysis. 
</p>
<p>62. The Bill of Rights provides:  &#8220;No one may be refused emergency medical treatment.&#8221;<b>47</b>  
In Mr. Soobramoney&#8217;s case, had the hospital violated this provision of the Bill of Rights?  The 
Court held that it had not because the patient was not an &#8220;emergency&#8221; in the sense of a sudden 
catastrophe; rather, his condition was an &#8220;ongoing state of affairs&#8221;.  As already noted in the 
<i>Treatment Action Campaign </i>case, however, the Bill of Rights also includes a right of access to 
health-care services, requiring the State to take reasonable measures, within available resources, 
to achieve the progressive realization of this human right.  In <i>Soobramoney</i>, the Constitutional 
Court found that the hospital&#8217;s policy and guidelines were reasonable and fairly applied, and it 
held that the failure to provide treatment did not violate the Bill of Rights in this case. 
</p>
<p>63. While many elements of the right to the highest attainable standard of health are subject 
to progressive realization and resource availability, the right also gives rise to some obligations 
of immediate effect that are subject to neither.  Equal treatment of women and men, for example, 
is not subject to progressive realization and resource availability.  A State may not argue that 
presently it has insufficient resources to provide equal services for women and men and so, for 
the time being, it is going to focus on services for men, but it will progressively make available 
the same services for women over the next few years just as soon as the necessary funds become 
available.  As the next case shows, some courts have held that other elements of the right to 
health also give rise to immediate obligations that are subject to neither progressive realization 
nor resource availability. 
</p>
<p>64. In <i>Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of West Bengal,</i> the Supreme Court of 
India held that the Government could not escape its responsibility, on account of financial 
constraints, to provide emergency treatment.<b>48</b>  In this case, a man fell from a train and suffered 
serious head trauma.  He was taken to a number of State hospitals but none was able to provide </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>him with emergency treatment; they lacked bed space, as well as trauma and neurological 
services.  The issue before the Court was whether inadequate medical facilities for emergency 
treatment constituted a denial of the right to life. 
</p>
<p>65. The Court found that it was the duty of a State to ensure that medical facilities for 
emergency treatment were adequately available.  It required the State to ensure that primary 
health centres were equipped to provide immediate stabilizing treatment for serious injuries and 
emergencies.  In addition, the Court ordered the State to increase the number of specialist and 
regional clinics around the country available to treat serious injuries, and to create a centralized 
communication system among State hospitals so that patients could be transported immediately 
to the facilities where space is available.  The Court recognized that substantial expenditure was 
needed to ensure that medical facilities were adequate.  However, it held that &#8220;a State could not 
avoid this constitutional obligation on account of financial constraints&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>66. At the end of this section, the Special Rapporteur confines himself to two remarks.  First, 
progressive realization does not mean that a State is free to adopt any measures that are broadly 
going in the right direction.  States have a legal obligation to take &#8220;deliberate, concrete and 
targeted&#8221; steps towards the realization of the right to health for all.<b>49</b>  Health research and 
experience confirm that some measures work better than others.  States are obliged to take those 
measures that are the best available to them. 
</p>
<p>67. Second, <i>Samity</i> confirms that there are health-related rights that give rise to some 
immediate obligations that are not subject to resource availability.  More work needs to be done 
to clarify what these immediate obligations are in the health context.  However, if a Government 
of a low-income country has insufficient resources to meet its immediate health-related 
obligations, it is incumbent upon those in a position to assist to provide international assistance 
and cooperation that will enable the Government to meet its immediate obligations.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Available, accessible, acceptable and of good quality 
</b></p>
<p>68. Health facilities, goods and services must be available, accessible, acceptable and of good 
quality, as illustrated by the following cases<i>.<b></b></i><b>51</b>  The precise practical application of these 
requirements - available, accessible and so on - may vary from one country to another depending 
upon, for example, resource availability. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Available 
</b></p>
<p>69. The right to health requires functioning health facilities, goods and services to be 
available in sufficient quantity throughout a State. 
</p>
<p>70. In the case of <i>Mariela Viceconte v. Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, 
</i>Mariela Viceconte, and the National Ombudsman, asked the court to order the Government of 
Argentina to take protective measures against haemorrhagic fever which threatened 3.5 million 
people.<b>52</b>  More specifically, they asked the court to order the Government to produce a WHO 
certified vaccine (Candid-1) for Argentine haemorrhagic fever.  According to the court, it was 
the Government&#8217;s responsibility to make health care available in a situation where the existing 
health-care system, including the private sector, was not protecting individuals&#8217; health.  In light </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the Constitution&#8217;s incorporation of international treaties that recognize the right to health, the 
court found that the Government had not &#8220;fulfilled its obligations to make available the Candid-1 
vaccine&#8221;.  Because the private sector saw the production of the vaccine as unprofitable, the court 
ordered the State to produce Candid-1. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Accessible 
</b></p>
<p>71. The right to health imposes an obligation on a State to ensure that health facilities, goods 
and services are accessible to everyone within its jurisdiction.  In this context, access has four 
main dimensions:  the facilities, goods and services must be physically accessible; economically 
accessible (i.e. affordable); and accessible without discrimination; also, health information must 
be accessible.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>72. In <i>Minister of Health v. Treatment Action Campaign</i>, as well as considering the issue of 
resource availability and progressive realization (see paragraph 60), the South African 
Constitutional Court also considered whether or not Nevirapine was accessible.<b>54</b>  The 
Government provided Nevirapine at only two research and training sites per province.  The drug 
could also be obtained from private medical providers.  As a result, mothers and their babies who 
did not have access to the research and training sites, and who could not afford access to private 
health care, were unable to gain access to Nevirapine.  The Government argued that &#8220;until the 
best programme has been formulated and the necessary funds and infrastructure provided &#8230; the 
drug must be withheld from mothers and children who do not have access to the research and 
training sites&#8221;.  However, the Court held that the State&#8217;s limited provision of Nevirapine was 
unreasonable.  It ordered that the Government act without delay to provide, inter alia, the drug in 
public hospitals and clinics when medically indicated.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>73. States must take reasonable measures to enhance access to health information, including 
for people with disabilities.  In the Canadian case of <i>Eldridge v. British Columbia</i>, a group of 
deaf applicants challenged the absence of sign-language interpreters in the publicly funded 
health-care system.<b>56</b>  The Supreme Court held that provincial governments had a positive 
obligation under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to address the needs of 
disadvantaged groups, such as persons with disabilities.  The Court decided that the applicants 
had a right to publicly funded sign-language interpretation in the provision of health care and 
that the failure of the authorities to ensure that the applicants benefited equally from the 
provincial medicare scheme amounted to discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Acceptable 
</b></p>
<p>74. The right to health requires that all health facilities, goods and services must be respectful 
of medical ethics, such as the requirements of informed consent, and be culturally appropriate.  
In <i>Andrea Szijjarto v. Hungary</i>, a Hungarian woman of Roma origin alleged that she had been 
coercively sterilized.<b>57</b>  In 2000, she went into labour and was taken to hospital.  Upon 
examination, it was found that the foetus had died and a Caesarean section was urgently needed.  
On the operating table, she was asked to sign a form consenting to the Caesarean section, as well 
as a &#8220;barely legible note&#8221; handwritten by the doctor giving permission for sterilization.  The 
reference to sterilization was in a language that she did not understand.  In her application to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, she alleged that this conduct </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>constituted a violation of her right to appropriate health-care services, as well as her right to 
decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of her children.  The Committee 
decided that Hungary had failed to provide Andrea with appropriate information and advice on 
family planning and ensure that Andrea had given her fully informed consent to the operation 
and it recommended that the Government provide the applicant with appropriate compensation. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Good quality 
</b></p>
<p>75. Health facilities, goods and services must be scientifically and medically appropriate 
and of good quality.  The Supreme Court of Bangladesh considered this requirement in 
<i>Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque v. Bangladesh</i>.<b>58</b>  Dr. Farooque challenged the failure of the authorities 
to take effective measures to deal with a large consignment of imported skimmed milk powder 
that contained radioactive material.  The court found that the contaminated powder was a threat 
to health and thereby gave rise to a breach of the right to life under the Constitution.<b>59</b>  Through 
an interpretation of a constitutional provision that requires the State to improve the quality of 
health and nutrition,<b>60</b> the court interpreted the right to life to include, among others, the 
&#8220;protection of health and normal longevity of an ordinary human being&#8221;.  The court ordered the 
Government to test the consignment&#8217;s radiation level. 
</p>
<p>76. At the end of this section, the Special Rapporteur makes two observations.  First, it will 
be recalled that some of the requirements signalled in the previous paragraphs have to be 
understood in the context of resource availability.  The right to health demands better access to 
a wider range of medicines in high-income than in low-income countries.  In Canada, 
sign-language interpretation for the deaf is required (<i>Eldridge</i>), but in a low-income country less 
costly measures to enhance access for those with disabilities will be acceptable.  Second, not all 
elements of the right to health demand many resources.  The <i>Szijjarto</i> case demanded respectful 
treatment, <i>Farooque</i> required quality controls on food imports, <i>K.L. v. Peru</i> (see next section) 
could be addressed by appropriate guidelines, and so on.  Even with very limited resources, there 
is much that States can do to realize the right to the highest attainable standard of health. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The duties to respect, protect and fulfil 
</b></p>
<p>77. Human rights place duties on States to respect, protect and fulfil.  Thus, States have 
duties to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the highest attainable standard of health.<b>61</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Respect 
</b></p>
<p>78. The duty to respect requires the State to refrain from denying or limiting equal access for 
all persons, including prisoners, minorities, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, 
curative and palliative health services.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>79. The case of <i>D. v. United Kingdom</i> concerned the proposed deportation by the British 
authorities of a man dying from AIDS to St. Kitts, his country of origin.<b>63</b>  D. had been 
diagnosed with HIV while in a British prison.  He applied for permission to remain in the 
United Kingdom after the end of his prison sentence on compassionate grounds.  His deportation 
to St. Kitts would entail a loss of the medical treatment he was receiving.  The European Court 
of Human Rights found that &#8220;the abrupt withdrawal of medical treatment caused by the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>deportation of D. to St. Kitts would expose him to a real risk of dying under most distressing 
circumstances and would thus amount to inhuman treatment&#8221;.<b>64</b>  The Court ordered that D. 
should not be deported.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <i>K.L. v. Peru</i> concerned a 17-year-old Peruvian who was denied a therapeutic abortion.<b>66</b>  
When K.L. was 14 weeks pregnant, doctors at a public hospital in Lima diagnosed the foetus 
with anencephaly, a foetal abnormality that would endanger K.L.&#8217;s health if pregnancy 
continued.  Under Peru&#8217;s Criminal Code, therapeutic abortion is permissible when necessary to 
safeguard the life or health of the woman.  However, K.L. was denied a therapeutic abortion by 
the director of the hospital.  She was compelled to carry the foetus to term and forced to feed the 
baby until his inevitable death several days after birth.  According to K.L., Peru&#8217;s failure to 
respond to the reluctance of some of the medical community to comply with the legal provision 
authorizing therapeutic abortion violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  The Human Rights Committee held that, by denying the complainant&#8217;s request to 
undergo an abortion in accordance with the Peruvian Criminal Code, the Government was in 
breach of its obligations under the Covenant.<b>67</b>  The Committee decided, inter alia, that the 
Government must take steps to prevent the future occurrence of similar violations.  The Special 
Rapporteur adds that one way for the Government to conform to its existing obligations under 
the Criminal Code is to provide clear, appropriate guidance to health professionals about when a 
therapeutic abortion is lawful and should be available. 
</p>
<p>81. In <i>Yanomami</i> <i>v. Brazil</i>, the applicants claimed that the construction of a highway and 
exploitation of resources on their traditional lands, and the resulting damage to their environment 
and traditional way of life, violated the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man.<b>68</b>  
They claimed that the road building displaced them from their ancestral lands and that many of 
their people died from influenza, tuberculosis, measles, venereal diseases and other epidemics 
arising from the project.  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights established a link 
between environmental quality and the right to life, and held that the failure of the Government 
to provide the Yanomami with an alternative site to live in amounted to a violation of their rights 
to life, liberty and personal security.  The Commission recommended that &#8220;the Government of 
Brazil continue to take preventive and curative health measures to protect the lives and health of 
Indians exposed to infectious or contagious diseases&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Protect 
</b></p>
<p>82. The duty to protect requires States to take measures that prevent third parties (e.g. private 
companies) from interfering with the right to the highest attainable standard of health.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p>83. In <i>Ratlam Municipality Council v. Vardi Chand</i>, the Supreme Court of India held that 
municipalities had a duty to protect the environment in the interests of public health.<b>70</b>  The 
Court found that &#8220;pollutants being discharged by big factories &#8230; [are] a challenge to the social 
justice component of the rule of law&#8221;.  The Court found that the preservation of public health, 
premised on the decency and dignity of individuals, was a non-negotiable facet of human rights 
requiring State action. 
</p>
<p>84. Another case with an environmental dimension is <i>Social and Economic Rights Action 
Center and Center for Economic and Social Rights v. Nigeria</i>.<b>71</b> Members of the Ogoni 
community in Nigeria alleged that the military Government had violated their rights to health </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and a clean environment, as well as several other human rights, by facilitating the operations of 
oil companies in Ogoniland.  The applicants alleged that the operations of an oil consortium, 
comprising the Nigerian National Petroleum Company and Shell Petroleum Development 
Corporation, had contaminated the environment, leading to serious and widespread health problems 
among the Ogoni people.  The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights held that the 
Ogoni had suffered violations of a number of their human rights, including their rights to health 
and a clean environment, as a result of the Government&#8217;s failure to prevent pollution and 
ecological degradation.  It found that the Government had failed to adequately regulate and 
monitor the oil consortium.  The Commission issued a number of orders, for example, 
environmental and social impact assessments should be prepared in the future and health and 
environmental information should be made available. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Fulfil 
</b></p>
<p>85. The duty to fulfil requires States to adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, 
budgetary, judicial and other measures towards the full realization of the right to health.<b>72</b> 
86. In <i>Purohit and Moore v. The Gambia</i>, mental health advocates witnessed the inhuman 
treatment of mental health patients in the psychiatric unit of the Royal Victoria Hospital in the 
Gambia.<b>73</b>  They submitted a complaint to the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights on behalf of the mental health patients detained in the unit.  The principal legislation 
governing mental health in the Gambia was the Lunatics Detention Act (1917).  The complaint 
pointed out that, from the human rights perspective, this colonial legislation was seriously 
deficient in numerous respects.  The Commission held that the legislation was &#8220;lacking in terms 
of therapeutic objectives&#8221;; it was also inadequate to treat only those persons with mental 
disabilities for whom there were &#8220;matching resources and programmes&#8221;.  The Commission 
ordered the Government to replace, as soon as possible, the Lunatics Detention Act with a new 
legislative scheme for mental health that was compatible with the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, as well as more specific international standards for the protection of persons 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>87. These cases illustrate the indispensable role of accountability.  Without accountability, a 
State could use progressive realization and the scarcity of resources as an excuse to do virtually 
nothing - or to respond to whichever interest group has the loudest voice.  Independent, effective 
and accessible mechanisms of accountability compel a State to explain what it is doing and why 
and how it is moving, as expeditiously and effectively as possible, towards the realization of the 
right to health for all. 
</p>
<p>88. Courts are usually reluctant to intervene.  They tend to give the State a wide &#8220;margin of 
discretion&#8221;.  They are well practised in striking balances between competing interests in a 
principled but pragmatic way:  in the <i>Treatment Action Campaign</i> case, the Constitutional Court 
held that the Government was not doing all it reasonably could, while in <i>Soobramoney</i> the same 
Court declined to intervene because the hospital had a fair policy in place.  Supported by 
appropriate legislation, courts can ensure that the interests of the poor and disadvantaged - so 
often overlooked - are given due weight.  In appropriate cases, they have the crucial </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>responsibility of saying that the State could be doing better and requiring it to try again.  Of 
course, courts are not a panacea; for example, sometimes authorities are slow to comply with 
court orders. Nonetheless, as one form of accountability, courts have a significant role to play in 
the promotion and protection of health-related rights. 
</p>
<p>89. While this section signals only a few of the many health-related cases that have been 
decided in recent years, in early 2007 WHO, with the support of the Emory University Institute 
of Human Rights in the United States, will launch a database that will include information on 
many other national and international health-related cases concerning human rights.<b>74</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In 2006, the Special Rapporteur explained to the Human Rights Council that, 
working in close collaboration with others, he hoped to have sufficient resources to identify 
and examine the key features of a health system that were reflective of the international 
human right to health (see E/CN.4/2006/48, para. 21).  In the interactive dialogue following 
the presentation of his report, the Special Rapporteur was encouraged to take this idea 
forward.  Although the subject is extremely ambitious and his resources equally limited, 
the Special Rapporteur is trying to respond to this interest by beginning to explore this 
challenging issue. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The right to the highest attainable standard of health can be understood as a right 
to an effective and integrated health system, encompassing health care and the underlying 
determinants of health, which is responsive to national and local priorities, and accessible 
to all (see ibid., para. 4).  More specifically, however, when looking at a health system from 
the right-to-health perspective, what are the key components that need to be present?  For 
example, from a human rights perspective a health system will have to include an adequate 
system for the collection of health data; otherwise, it will be impossible for the State, or any 
other interested party, to monitor the progressive realization of the right to health.  
Moreover, the data must be disaggregated on certain grounds, such as sex, age and 
urban/rural, otherwise it will be impossible to monitor the progressive realization of the 
right to health in relation to vulnerable populations, such as women, children and those 
living in remote rural communities (see ibid., para. 49 (b)). 
</b>92. <b>Also, from the right-to-health perspective, a health system will have to include a 
national capacity to produce a sufficient number of well-trained health workers who enjoy 
good terms and conditions of employment; a process for the preparation of right-to-health 
impact assessments before major health-related policies are finalized; arrangements for 
ensuring, as much as possible, &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; participation in the formulation of health 
policies; effective, transparent and accessible mechanisms of accountability; and so on. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>These are some of the issues that the Special Rapporteur is beginning to explore 
with a view to identifying some of the key features of a health system from the 
right-to-health perspective.  He invites others to support and collaborate with him in this 
very major undertaking and he hopes to have the opportunity to report further to the 
Council as this work unfolds. </b></p>

<p>  <i>AIDS Access Foundation v. Bristol-Myers Squibb </i>is another case on economic access.  The 
AIDS Access Foundation, and two patients living with AIDS, alleged that Bristol-Myers Squibb 
and the Thai Department of Intellectual Property had &#8220;conspired to intentionally delete&#8221; the dose 
restriction in a patent application for didanosine.  They argued that this could have the effect of 
restricting access to this particular HIV treatment.  In its judgement, the Thai Central Intellectual 
Property and International Trade Court ruled that, because pharmaceutical patents may lead to 
high prices that limit access to medicines, patients may challenge their legality.  The Court 
asserted the primacy of human life in trade agreements, as recognized internationally by the 
Doha Declaration on Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health.  The 
Court held that the TRIPS agreement must be:  &#8220;interpreted and implemented so as to promote 
the rights of members to protect public health, especially the promotion and support of access to 
medicines&#8221;.  The Court also held that &#8220;lack of access to medicines due to high prices prejudices 
the human rights of patients to proper medical treatment&#8221;.  Tor Por 34/2544, full judgement

that the oil consortium was a private entity insufficiently regulated by the State, it is a &#8220;protect&#8221; 
case.  Whether &#8220;respect&#8221; or &#8220;protect&#8221;, the key point is that the Commission found that the State 
was responsible for breaches of health-related rights.
