2016 Second-Quarter Highlights
Produced a Company record 47,667 barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) per day and increased
anticipated production for full-year 2016 to a range midpoint of 17.15 million BOE, up 5.5% from the
16.25 million BOE midpoint of the Company's previous increased guidance and up approximately
11% from the original 2016 guidance midpoint of 15.5 million BOE
Completed 16 horizontal wells with an average completed lateral length of approximately 9,700
feet, 10 of which have reached their peak 30-day initial production (“IP”) rates, averaging 1,147
BOE per day, or 135% of type curve
Reduced unit lease operating expenses (“LOE”) to $4.43 per BOE, down approximately 36% from
the second-quarter 2015 rate of $6.90 per BOE
Recognized more than $6.4 million in cash benefits from Laredo Midstream Services, LLC (“LMS”)
field infrastructure investments through reduced costs and increased revenue

"Positive results of multiple catalysts from prior investments are driving record production volumes
delivered at peer-leading unit production costs and significantly improving the Company’s capital
investment efficiency," commented Randy A. Foutch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These
investments in data collection, reservoir modeling, infrastructure, product takeaway and actual well
testing provide a strong foundation for Laredo to continue to economically enhance value for
stakeholders even in challenging industry cycles. Also, our strong hedge position provides further
support to mitigate commodity price volatility and we have maintained financial flexibility with
current liquidity of approximately $760 million and no public debt maturing for more than five years."
Operational Update
In the second quarter of 2016, Laredo produced a Company record 47,667 BOE per day, of which
approximately 73% was oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”). Production during the quarter
demonstrated the positive impact of the Company’s long-term initiatives to collect data and invest in
infrastructure to improve capital efficiency. The Earth Model coupled with optimized completions
was utilized in all wells completed in second-quarter 2016, driving consistent outperformance
versus the Company’s type curves. Additionally, investments in field infrastructure and centralized
facilities along the Company’s production corridors enabled more efficient operations, resulting in
higher production uptime and reducing the time to sales for produced oil.
Laredo’s field infrastructure investments continue to drive operating costs lower as more wells are
drilled along the Company’s production corridors. In the second quarter of 2016, total LOE
decreased approximately 34% from the second quarter of 2015, even as production grew, and unit
LOE decreased approximately 36% from the prior-year quarter to a peer-leading rate of $4.43 per
BOE. In addition to benefiting from previous infrastructure investments, LOE was positively
impacted by steps taken to continuously improve field operations. Procedures to optimize and
reduce chemicals usage, an enhanced SCADA production monitoring system, optimized water
management and a proactive workover program all contributed to the approximately 42% reduction
in unit LOE since the beginning of 2015.
Continued improvement in the Company’s pacesetting drilling operations benefited Laredo’s capital
efficiency. In the second quarter of 2016, Laredo operated three horizontal rigs that drilled an
average of 990 feet per day from rig acceptance to rig release, an improvement of approximately
66% from the second quarter of 2015. These efficiencies have reduced the average number of days
to drill a well by approximately 36% from the second quarter of 2015, even as the Company has
extended the majority of its laterals to 10,000 feet and longer.
Laredo is seeing continued improvement in well costs driven by a combination of an intense focus
on drilling efficiencies and on deriving the maximum value from its service providers. On average,
the Company’s well cost for 10,000-foot laterals in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp that utilize
optimized completions are approximately $6.3 million, but the Company’s most recent costs are
trending to the mid $5 million level.
2
The Company completed 16 horizontal development wells during the second quarter of 2016, five
of which began flowback in the last half of June and had minimal impact on production during the
quarter. These 16 wells have an average lateral length of approximately 9,700 feet and a working
interest of 100%. The Company’s proprietary Earth Model was used on each of these wells to land
and steer the lateral and aid in optimizing completions. Ten of the 16 wells have achieved peak 30-
day average IP rates with the average of those 10 wells performing 35% above type curve. The
results of these 10 wells are detailed in the following table.

2Q-16 Average
(1) Adjusted for lateral length
The Company is currently operating three horizontal rigs and anticipates completing 10 horizontal
development wells during the third quarter of 2016, with an average working interest of
approximately 99%. Nine of the wells target the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp and one the Cline
shale. The wells are expected to have an average lateral length of approximately 11,000 feet,
including four that are at least 13,000 feet, as the Company continues to benefit from its contiguous
acreage position that enables the drilling of more capital efficient longer laterals.
The Company expects to move one of its three operated rigs to the Western Glasscock production
corridor position during the third quarter of 2016 and anticipates accelerating development of this
acreage in 2017.
Laredo Midstream Services Update
Laredo’s field infrastructure and production corridor assets continue to reduce operational costs and
have increasing cash benefits to the Company. Savings from transporting water by pipe, water
recycling and centralized gas lift reduced unit LOE in the second quarter of 2016 by approximately
14%, or $0.72 per BOE. As utilization of these assets has increased, the total cash benefit to Laredo
for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $6.4 million. LMS’ crude and natural gas
gathering systems transported approximately 60% of the Company’s gross operated crude oil
production during the quarter and approximately 58% of gross operated natural gas production.
LMS’ water gathering and treatment systems gathered 58% of flowback and produced water by pipe
and 22% of water used in second-quarter 2016 completions was fulfilled with recycled water from
LMS’ water recycling facility.
3
The Medallion Gathering & Processing, LLC pipeline system (“Medallion-Midland Basin”), in which
LMS owns a 49% interest, continued to grow transported volumes at a rapid pace. Transported
volumes in the second quarter of 2016 increased to an average of 99,039 BOPD, an increase of
approximately 186% from the second quarter of 2015 and up approximately 19% compared to the
first quarter of 2016. The Medallion-Midland Basin system is expected to transport an average of
approximately 120,000 BOPD in the third quarter of 2016.
2016 Capital Program
During the second quarter of 2016, Laredo invested approximately $80 million in exploration and
development activities, approximately $11 million in a previously announced bolt-on land
acquisition and approximately $15 million in infrastructure held by LMS, including the Medallion-
Midland Basin pipeline system.
Liquidity
At June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and equivalents of approximately $19 million and
undrawn capacity under the senior secured credit facility of approximately $705 million, resulting in
total liquidity of approximately $724 million. At August 2, 2016, the Company had cash and
equivalents of approximately $15 million and undrawn capacity under the senior secured credit
facility of approximately $745 million, resulting in total liquidity of approximately $760 million.
Commodity Derivatives
Laredo maintains an active hedging program to reduce the variability in its anticipated cash flow
due to fluctuations in commodity prices while retaining meaningful upside to commodity prices. At
June 30, 2016, the Company had hedges in place for the remaining two quarters of 2016 for
3,722,700 barrels of oil at a weighted-average floor price of $67.13 per barrel, representing
approximately 95% of anticipated oil production for the remainder of 2016, and 9,384,000 million
British thermal units (“MMBtu”) of natural gas at a weighted-average floor price of $3.00 per MMBtu,
representing approximately 65% of anticipated natural gas production for 2016.
At June 30, 2016, for 2017, the Company had hedged 3,677,375 barrels of oil at a weighted-
average floor price of $60.00 per barrel and 18,771,000 MMBtu of natural gas at a weighted-

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and any oral statements made regarding the subject of this release, including in
the conference call referenced herein, contains forward-looking statements as defined under
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that
address activities that Laredo assumes, plans, expects, believes, intends, projects, estimates or
anticipates (and other similar expressions) will, should or may occur in the future are forward-
looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on management’s current belief,
based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events.
General risks relating to Laredo include, but are not limited to, the decline in prices of oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas and the related impact to financial statements as a result of asset
impairments and revisions to reserve estimates, and other factors, including those and other risks
described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and those set
forth from time to time in other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These
documents are available through Laredo’s website at www.laredopetro.com under the tab “Investor
Relations” or through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System at
www.sec.gov. Any of these factors could cause Laredo’s actual results and plans to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, Laredo can give no assurance that its
future results will be as estimated. Laredo does not intend to, and disclaims any obligation to,
update or revise any forward-looking statement.
The SEC generally permits oil and natural gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose
proved reserves, which are reserve estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate
with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions and certain probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s
definitions for such terms. In this press release and the conference call, the Company may use the
terms “resource potential” and “estimated ultimate recovery,” or “EURs,” each of which the SEC
guidelines restrict from being included in filings with the SEC without strict compliance with SEC
definitions. These terms refer to the Company’s internal estimates of unbooked hydrocarbon
quantities that may be potentially added to proved reserves, largely from a specified resource play.
A resource play is a term used by the Company to describe an accumulation of hydrocarbons
known to exist over a large areal expanse and/or thick vertical section potentially supporting
numerous drilling locations, which, when compared to a conventional play, typically has a lower
geological and/or commercial development risk. EURs are based on the Company’s previous
operating experience in a given area and publicly available information relating to the operations of
producers who are conducting operations in these areas. Unbooked resource potential or EURs do
not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum
Resource Management System or SEC rules and do not include any proved reserves. Actual
quantities of reserves that may be ultimately recovered from the Company’s interests may differ
substantially from those presented herein. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of
the Company’s ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital,
decreases in oil and natural gas prices, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services
and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals,
negative revisions to reserve estimates and other factors as well as actual drilling results, including
geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Estimates of unproved reserves may
change significantly as development of the Company’s core assets provides additional data. In
addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many
assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the
undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity
price declines or drilling cost increases.

The volumes presented are based on actual results and are not calculated using the rounded
numbers presented in the table above.
Realized oil, NGL and natural gas prices are the actual prices realized at the wellhead adjusted
for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and
(3)other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The prices presented are based on
actual results and are not calculated using the rounded numbers presented in the table above.
Hedged prices reflect the after-effect of our hedging transactions on our average sales prices.
Our calculation of such after-effects includes current period settlements of matured derivatives in
accordance with GAAP and an adjustment to reflect premiums incurred previously or upon
settlement that are attributable to instruments that settled in the period. The prices presented are
based on actual results and are not calculated using the rounded numbers presented in the table
above.
General and administrative includes non-cash stock-based compensation, net of amounts
capitalized, of $6.1 million and $6.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $9.9 million and $11.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and

Supplemental reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP financial measures
The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by
us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, these
non-GAAP measures should be considered in conjunction with net income or loss and other
performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or loss or
cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted Net Income or Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as net income or loss, operating
income or loss or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.
Adjusted Net Income (Unaudited)
Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate performance, prior to
deferred income taxes, gains or losses on derivatives, cash settlements of matured derivatives,
cash settlements on early terminated derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives, impairment
expense, restructuring expenses, loss on early redemption of debt, buyout of minimum volume
commitment, gains or losses on disposal of assets, write-off of debt issuance costs and bad debt
expense and after applying adjusted income tax expense. We believe Adjusted Net Income helps
investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure and compare our performance to other oil
and natural gas companies by excluding from the calculation, items that can vary significantly from
company to company depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets and other
non-operational factors. At December 31, 2015 we changed the methodology for calculating
Adjusted Net Income by applying a tax rate of 36% to all periods. As such, the prior periods’
Adjusted Net Income has been modified for comparability.

Adjusted income tax expense is calculated by applying a tax rate of 36% for each of the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited)
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income or loss plus
adjustments for deferred income tax expense or benefit, depletion, depreciation and amortization,
bad debt expense, impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation, restructuring
expenses, gains or losses on derivatives, cash settlements received for matured derivatives, cash
settlements on early terminated derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives, interest expense, write-
off of debt issuance costs, gains or losses on disposal of assets, loss on early redemption of debt
and buyout of minimum volume commitment. Adjusted EBITDA provides no information regarding a
company's capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, working capital
movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary
use because those funds are required for debt service, capital expenditures and working capital,
income taxes, franchise taxes and other commitments and obligations. However, our management
believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because
this measure:
is widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company's operating
performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term, which can vary
•
•
•substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of
assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;
helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from
period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and
  is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of operating
performance, in presentations to our board of directors and as a basis for strategic planning and
forecasting.
There are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance,
including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that
materially affect our net income or loss, the lack of comparability of results of operations to different
companies and the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different
companies. Our measurements of Adjusted EBITDA for financial reporting as compared to
compliance under our debt agreements differ.
