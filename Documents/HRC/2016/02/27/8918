<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
visited Estonia from 20 to 24 October 2008. The present report examines the incidence of the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and highlights the international and 
national legal framework pertaining to these issues and to the child protection system of Estonia 
more generally, including the availability of specific measures designed to protect child victims 
of sale or sexual exploitation, such as rehabilitation and social reintegration. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes a significant political commitment in Estonia to prioritize the 
rights of the child. While the number of reported cases of child prostitution and child 
pornography is low, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that vigilance is required and that 
efforts should be directed towards prevention. Concrete actions to be implemented include the 
adoption of legislative amendments, efficient training of police, particularly in detecting cases of 
sexual exploitation of children and online child pornography, ensuring that programmes and 
policies are sustainable and accessible throughout the country, and strengthening of the 
non-governmental and civil society sector. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of a holistic approach to the fundamental 
rights of children, paving the way for the implementation of social policies that favour children, 
youth and the family. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
Najat M&#8217;jid Maalla. undertook a visit to Estonia from 20 to 24 October 2008 at the invitation of 
the Government of Estonia. The Special Rapporteur had meetings in Tallinn, Narva and J&#245;hvi. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur warmly thanks the Government of Estonia for its hospitality and 
collaboration in facilitating meetings with officials from various branches of the Government. 
She particularly welcomes the openness and frankness with which the authorities discussed 
issues concerning the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography and the child 
protection system more generally. She also thanks the Government for its cooperation prior to, 
during and following the visit. 
</p>
<p>3. In Tallinn, the Special Rapporteur met with the First Lady of Estonia, as well as 
representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, of the Interior, of Justice, of Education and 
Research, Population and Ethnic Affairs, of Social Affairs (Social Welfare Department and 
Gender Equality Department), as well as with the Chancellor of Justice. The Special Rapporteur 
also met with the Child Protection Division of the P&#245;hja Police Prefecture. She also met with 
representatives from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the International Organization for 
Migration. 
</p>
<p>4. In the three cities, the Special Rapporteur visited with various non-governmental 
organizations, childcare centres and crisis centres. 
</p>
<p>5. In her report to the ninth session of the Human Rights Council in September 2008 
(A/HRC/9/21), the Special Rapporteur identified the following objectives of her mandate: 
 (a) A better understanding of the situation of the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography and of contributory factors (socio-economic, cultural and environmental); 
</p>
<p> (b) Implementation of a comprehensive child protection system that ensures the best 
interest of the child and encompasses prevention and care as well as medical, psychological, 
social and legal support for child victims, rehabilitation, social reintegration of children and 
promotion of the rights of the child; 
</p>
<p> (c) Effective and concerted local, national, regional and international coordination and 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>6. With this in mind, the objective of the visit was to explore the incidence of the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography in Estonia, as well as to examine and assess 
the system of child protection more generally. More specifically, she sought information on the 
incidence of commercial sexual exploitation of children, of child pornography, particularly over 
the Internet, of the sale of children, such as illegal adoptions, and of transfer of children&#8217;s 
organs. To this end, the Special Rapporteur met with a range of government authorities and 
non-governmental organizations, which enabled her to obtain information and share her thoughts 
and ideas with representatives from various segments of the child protection system. At the close 
of the visit, the Special Rapporteur shared her preliminary thoughts with the Government. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>7. Throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur consistently sought the views of the 
representatives she met with and solicited their thoughts on what could be improved in the 
system, so that she could prepare conclusions and recommendations that were targeted and 
useful and that would be ultimately &#8220;owned&#8221; by the main stakeholders themselves. 
</p>
<p>8. In preparation of her mission and this report, the Special Rapporteur consulted material 
from United Nations sources, particularly Estonia&#8217;s first report to the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography (CRC/C/OPSC/EST/1); the latest concluding 
observations of the Committee on Estonia (CRC/C/15/Add.196); the latest (2007) concluding 
observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on Estonia 
(CEDAW/C/EST/CO/4); Estonia&#8217;s response to the questionnaire on the United Nations Study on 
Violence against Children; as well as various reports prepared by non-governmental 
organizations. The Special Rapporteur also thanks the Government of Estonia for its cooperation 
in providing information prior to, during and following the mission at the request of the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress at the outset, echoing the frequent statements 
of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the importance of adopting a holistic approach to 
addressing the root causes, such as poverty and underdevelopment, which contribute to the 
vulnerability of children to sale, prostitution and pornography, and to the development of the sex 
industry. This includes paying particular attention to the protection of children who are 
especially vulnerable to these practices, such as children living on the street, children from 
families in difficulty, children belonging to minorities, migrant children, children living in 
remote areas and those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL BACKGROUND/CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  History 
</b></p>
<p>10. Estonia regained its independence in 1991. In January 2008, its population was estimated 
at 1,340,000, 31.4 per cent of whom are ethnic minorities. About one quarter of the population is 
of Russian-speaking origin. Estonia is a parliamentary democracy, with a unicameral legislature 
(Riigikogu), and is composed of 15 counties. It joined the European Union (EU) on 1 May 2004. 
Since joining the EU, Estonia has been one of the countries advocating for a more liberal 
approach to economic policy in the Union. 
</p>
<p>11. Estonia is a member of the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS), within which it holds the 
Presidency of the Task Force on Organized Crime and is a member of the Working Group for 
Cooperation on Children at Risk. It is also a member of the CBSS Task Force against Trafficking 
in Human Beings. 
</p>
<p>12. The majority of interlocutors indicated that the global financial crisis was having an impact 
on governmental programmes and policies, including those relating to human rights and to the 
rights of the child. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International and regional framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Estonia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; as well as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (the Optional Protocol). 
</p>
<p>14. It has signed but not ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. It has not ratified the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families, or the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>15. Estonia ratified the Optional Protocol in 2004, ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the 
Prohibition and Immediate Action on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, ILO 
Convention No. 132 concerning the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, and the 1993 
Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry 
Adoption. Estonia is party to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the Convention (Palermo Protocol). 
</p>
<p>16. At the regional level, Estonia ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and 
signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual 
Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. It has not signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings, but the Special Rapporteur was informed that it was 
planning to do so in the near future. In 2003, Estonia ratified the Council of Europe Convention 
on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol in 2003. 
</p>
<p>17. Estonia adopted the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action adopted at the World 
Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in 1996 and reaffirmed its 
commitment at the Yokohama conference in 2001. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SITUATION ANALYSIS 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur observed and was informed of a confluence of 
various issues that have an impact on the situation of children and their protection. She received 
information of high unemployment rates, increasing poverty and regional disparities, which 
affect the welfare and living standards of vulnerable families with children. 
</p>
<p>19. NGOs and government authorities alike noted that the issues affecting children the most 
are drug and alcohol abuse, increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS, and abuse and violence in the 
home and in schools. Almost all interlocutors were of the view that drug use among children has 
risen in recent years and that the types of drugs used have also changed. The incidence of 
HIV/AIDS as a result of sexual contact among children has also increased. Interlocutors stated </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>that the causes underlying these issues are, on the one hand, struggling families who are unable 
to protect their children and, on the other hand, increasing consumerism among the youth. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that in Estonia children without parental care or with 
insufficient parental care constitute the main risk group. As will be detailed further on in this 
report, the Special Rapporteur noted a significant number of children placed in alternative care 
institutions, and observed the need for Estonia to adopt norms and standards for follow-up of 
children placed in, and later released from, such institutions. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes information received from the Government about the participation of 
representatives in a training course organized in 2009 by the CBSS Working Group for 
Cooperation on Children at Risk. In this context, guidelines are being prepared concerning the 
levels of supervision of alternative care institutions. The Government also reported that most 
alternative care institutions have rearranged their work and organized children to live in small 
family-like groups. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue to monitor 
this issue. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also received reports of parents leaving Estonia for other countries 
with the hope of better wages in jobs abroad. This often results in children under 18 being left 
alone, and while the Government does not have official data on this phenomenon, it would seem 
that while children in such cases are often left in the care of older siblings or other close 
relatives, many parents are not aware of the need to officially appoint a custodian or legal 
representative for their children. 
</p>
<p>21. The global financial crisis was also cited as having an impact on funding available for 
programmes and policies, including those related to child protection. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur notes that the number of cases of sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, as reported by Government authorities and NGOs, is low. 
</p>
<p>23. The following chart from the Register of Criminal Proceedings, Ministry of Justice 
provides statistics on certain offences from 2006 to 2008:

</p>
<p>24. Nevertheless, all interlocutors were of the view that the true incidence of such phenomena 
is difficult to record. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by reports of children (girls and boys) 
providing sexual services in return for some form of consideration, such as money, shoes or 
mobile telephones. The Child Protection Division of the P&#245;hja Police Prefecture, which deals 
with cases of child abuse and child pornography, informed the Special Rapporteur of cases of 
boys as young as 7 or 8 who have traded sexual acts for consumer goods. 
</p>
<p>25. The Child Protection Division described such cases as sporadic events rather than regular 
activities, and thus they are not categorized as cases of &#8220;child prostitution&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur is therefore of the view that increased training of police officers in relevant child 
protection legislation and policies is required to enable them to properly identify and, as a 
consequence, adequately address cases of sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p>26. In its report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the Optional Protocol, Estonia 
reported that child prostitution in the country has two outlets: 
</p>
<p> First, it is possible that minors see providing sexual services (temporarily) as an 
opportunity to earn money. The LICHR [Legal Information Centre for Human Rights] is of 
the opinion that &#8230; the only solution would be educational means, including activities of 
school psychologists and social workers, and measures related to the social insurance 
system. On the other hand, the LICHR points out the provision of sexual services by 
minors with the help of intermediaries, which is prohibited by Estonian legislation. The 
LICHR recognizes the activities of the police in fighting mediation of prostitution but 
believes that the problem is persistent and particularly relevant among non-Estonians.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>27. A representative from a non-governmental organization was of the view that there is a need 
to &#8220;study the face&#8221; of prostitution in Estonia. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not 
have the opportunity to meet with the Superintendant of the Division of Offences against the 
Person, which deals with cases of prostitution and trafficking, as his schedule did not permit him 
to meet with the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Initial report of the Republic of Estonia to the Committee on the Rights of the Child under the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol, 13 May 2008. As of the time of writing, this report is awaiting consideration 
by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur insists that, while the scale of these issues in Estonia is not large, 
the risks are real and apparent and vigorous and targeted prevention mechanisms should be 
implemented. Children are increasingly exposed to the risk of commercial sexual exploitation 
due to the increase in tourism, easier access by children to new information technologies, 
increasing demand in the sex industry and the proliferation of more structured trafficking 
networks. 
</p>
<p>29. The Government reported that by 2006 there were no children in Estonia who could be 
categorized as street children, as children belonging to that risk group quickly came to the notice 
of the police or child protection services. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a troubling trend in the eastern part of Estonia of 
cases of children not being registered at birth. The Government reported that the Ministry of 
Social Affairs had received information from an NGO that the parents of 10 children in Narva 
had not registered either their births or their names. Further to its inquiry, the Ministry 
discovered from the Narva Social Welfare Board that all 10 children in question were registered, 
had been issued identification documents, and their parents or custodians were receiving social 
welfare support and other support as provided by legislation. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that birth registration be guaranteed for all children. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legislation, institutional framework, policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government has undertaken a process of 
harmonizing its national legislation with its international obligations. A variety of laws deal with 
various aspects of child protection, including the Child Protection Act, the Juvenile Sanctions 
Act, the Family Law Act, the Social Welfare Act, the Act to Regulate Dissemination of Works 
containing Pornography or Promoting Violence and Cruelty, and the Victim Support Act. 
Reform, including adoption, of legislation dealing with the rights of the child is often undertaken 
by the Ministry of Social Affairs, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, as is the case 
with reforms to the Child Protection Act. The Ministry of Social Affairs is also preparing the 
Law on Social Protection, which should be sent to the Government by mid-2009. 
</p>
<p>32. Article 16 of the Child Protection Act requires that a child&#8217;s opinion be sought when 
making decisions concerning the child. Children may participate in preparing child protection 
programmes directly or through representatives chosen by the children themselves. 
</p>
<p>33. While significant efforts have been made to harmonize national legislation with 
international obligations, current legislation could still benefit from further revision in order to 
bring provisions into full conformity, as discussed below. 
</p>
<p>34. The Child Protection Act defines a &#8220;child&#8221; as a human being below the age of 18 years. 
The age of sexual consent is 14 years of age. An adult who engages in sexual intercourse with a 
person of less than 14 years of age shall be punished by up to five years&#8217; imprisonment. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>35. The Penal Code provides that the sale or purchase of children is punishable by one to 
five years&#8217; imprisonment (sect. 173). Regarding the definition of &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220;purchase&#8221; of 
children, the Government reported that the acts of selling and purchasing are defined in 
accordance with general legal principles of Estonian law. For example, the definition of &#8220;sale of 
a child&#8221; is specified in the commentary to the Penal Code as an act of giving away a child to 
another person in exchange for a fee (such as money, item of value, service, etc.). 
</p>
<p>36. The Child Protection Act provides that the child will be protected from economic, physical 
and psychological exploitation (art. 14). The child shall be protected from all forms of sexual 
exploitation, and an adult is prohibited from inducing a child to engage in sexual activity and 
exploitatively using children in prostitution or for pornographic purposes (art. 33). 
</p>
<p>37. The Penal Code provides that a person who by inducement, threat or any other act 
influences a child in order to cause him or her to commence or continue prostitution shall be 
punished by a pecuniary punishment or up to five years&#8217; imprisonment (sect. 175). The court 
may also apply an additional property-related measure or confiscation of the proceeds of crime. 
The Optional Protocol provides that each State party shall make the offences punishable by 
appropriate penalties that take into account their grave nature. While the Optional Protocol does 
not define &#8220;appropriate penalties&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that providing for the 
possibility of a pecuniary punishment in the case of inducing, threatening or influencing a child 
to engage in prostitution is an insufficient and thus inappropriate penalty. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the law be amended accordingly. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes information received from the Government that the legal commission of the 
Parliament has initiated new legislation to strengthen the punishment for sexual crimes against 
children, foreseeing, for example, longer imprisonment for sexual violence against children and 
sexually soliciting children. 
</p>
<p>38. Aiding prostitution involving a minor (mediation, providing of premises, or in any other 
manner) is criminalized and punishable by 3 to 12 years&#8217; imprisonment (sect. 268<b>1</b> Penal Code). 
Section 176 of the Penal Code specifically addresses aiding prostitution involving minors.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Section 176. Aiding prostitution involving minors 
</p>
<p> (1) Aiding prostitution involving a person of less than 18 years of age by mediation, 
provision of premises or in any other manner is punishable by a pecuniary punishment or up to 
five years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p> (2) The same act, if committed: 
</p>
<p>  (1) By a group or a criminal organization; 
</p>
<p>  (2) By a person who has previously committed a criminal offence provided in this 
section or aiding prostitution - is punishable by up to 3 to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p> (3) An act provided for in subsection (1) of this section, if committed by a legal person, 
is punishable by a pecuniary punishment. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>39. While certain provisions in the Penal Code can be linked to human trafficking (e.g. 
enslavement, abduction, provision of opportunity to engage in unlawful activities, pimping, 
illegal donation of organs), Estonia does not have legislation that specifically defines and 
criminalizes trafficking of children for sexual purposes and the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the law be amended accordingly. 
</p>
<p>40. Section 133 of the Penal Code prohibits &#8220;enslaving&#8221;, stating that placing a human being in 
a situation where he/she is forced to work or perform other duties against his/her will for the 
benefit of another person, or keeping a person in such situation, if such act is performed through 
violence or deceit or by taking advantage of the helpless situation of the person, is punishable 
by 3 to 12 years&#8217; imprisonment if committed against a child. 
</p>
<p>41. Section 177 of the Penal Code criminalizes the use of a person younger than 18 years of 
age as a model or actor in the manufacture of a pornographic work and the use of a person 
under 14 years of age in pornographic or erotic work or<b> </b>erotic<b> </b>picture, film, writings or other 
works or reproductions. This is punishable by a fine or up to five years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>42. A person who manufactures, stores, hands over, displays or makes available in any other 
manner pictures, writings or other works or reproductions of works depicting a person of less 
than 18 years of age in a pornographic situation, or a person of less than 14 years of age in a 
pornographic or erotic situation shall be punished by a pecuniary punishment or up to 
three years&#8217; imprisonment (sect. 178 Penal Code<b>3</b>). 
</p>
<p>43. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that Estonian law does not provide a complete 
definition of &#8220;child pornography&#8221;, as it refers to works &#8220;depicting a person of less than 18 years 
in a pornographic situation&#8221; or &#8220;a person of less than 14 years in an erotic situation&#8221; without 
further defining &#8220;pornographic situation&#8221; or &#8220;erotic situation&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the definition be amended in accordance with the Optional Protocol, and 
that there be no distinction between pornographic or erotic works; the age referred to should 
be 18 years in either case. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the Optional Protocol in its 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p> (4) An act provided for in clause (2) (2) of this section, if committed by a legal person, is 
punishable by a pecuniary punishment or compulsory dissolution. 
</p>
<p> (5) For a criminal offence provided in this section: 
</p>
<p>  (1) The court may impose, as supplementary punishment, a pecuniary punishment 
pursuant to the provisions of section 53 of this Code; or 
</p>
<p>  (2) The court imposes, pursuant to the provisions of section 83<b>2</b> of this Code, 
extended confiscation of the property obtained by the criminal offence. 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Section 178 (2). The same act, if committed by a legal person, is punishable by a pecuniary 
</p>
<p>punishment. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>article 2 (c) states: &#8220;Child pornography means any representation, by whatever means, of a child 
engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of 
a child for primarily sexual purposes.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur strongly insists that child victims of the offences covered by the 
Optional Protocol should not, as such, be either criminalized or penalized. The consent of a 
person under 18 years of age to such activities (pornograph<b>y</b> or prostitution) is irrelevant. As the 
age of sexual consent is 14 years of age, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Estonian law 
clearly stipulate that a child under 18 years of age is unable to consent to any form of sexual 
exploitation, including child pornography and child prostitution. Furthermore, all possible 
measures should be taken to avoid the stigmatization and social marginalization of such children. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has clearly and consistently maintained this position. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also received reports that penal sanctions, while sometimes 
imposed upon persons convicted of pimping, are rarely strong enough. 
</p>
<p>46. Article 9, paragraph 3, of the Optional Protocol deals with the obligation incumbent on 
States parties to take measures to ensure appropriate assistance to child victims, including their 
full social reintegration and their full physical and psychological recovery. The provisions of 
section IX of the Child Protection Act and Part III of the Family Law Act deal with child 
assistance, and set out the conditions for guardianship and curatorship. More specifically, 
article 59 of the Child Protection Act provides that every person is required to immediately 
notify the social services department, police or some other body providing assistance if the 
person knows of a child who is in need of protection or assistance. The social services 
departments have the right and are required to act immediately, regardless of the region or group 
to which the child belongs. The Child Protection Act also provides that temporary assistance, 
support and protection shall be provided to the child by shelters (safe houses), the activities of 
which are regulated by corresponding statute (art. 62). Finally, the Act states that after 
termination of guardianship, the social services departments shall provide the child with 
continued care to assist and provide advice to the child in organizing his or her life. Continued 
care shall be provided to all children who are released from detention or special care (art. 65). 
</p>
<p>47. Article 3, paragraph 5, of the Optional Protocol imposes the obligation on States parties to 
take all appropriate legal and administrative measures to ensure that all persons involved in the 
adoption of a child act in conformity with applicable international legal instruments. The Special 
Rapporteur did not receive any reports of illegal adoptions. In Estonia, international adoption is 
arranged and coordinated by the Ministry of Social Affairs. National adoptions fall within the 
competence of the county governors and local authorities. The Government informed the Special 
Rapporteur that coordination of national adoptions will be passed over to the Ministry of Social 
Affairs under the new Family Law Act, which is currently being discussed in Parliament and 
which provides the legal framework governing adoption. The draft law is expected to enter into 
force in 2010. The Special Rapporteur invites the Government to keep her informed on the 
progress of this draft law. Certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and of the Law on 
Social Welfare also govern adoption. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>48. The following chart tracks the number of adopted children in Estonia between 2003 
and 2008: 
</p>
<p> 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 
Adopted children 130 165 152 158 142 181 
</p>
<p>49. International adoptions of Estonian children are permitted only to the United States, 
Finland and Sweden. The Special Rapporteur was informed that approximately 20 children a 
year are adopted from Estonia by people in foreign countries. The consent of the Ministry of 
Social Affairs is required for international adoptions.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur notes the efforts made by the Government to regulate national and 
international adoptions, but reiterates the need to ensure the prevention of illegal adoptions as 
well as to guarantee the best interests of the child. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government of Estonia to have in place adequate review procedures of all 
adoption decisions, as well as follow-up procedures once a child has been placed with an 
adoptive family. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by information provided that the 
Ministry of Social Affairs, in cooperation with child protection officers, NGO representatives 
and a court, have presented proposals for inclusion in the draft Family Law Act with regard to 
adoptions. 
</p>
<p>51. Estonian law also prohibits inducing a person to donate organs or tissue for the purposes of 
transplantation or genetic research by offering material remuneration or causing or threatening to 
cause damage to the person. This offence is punishable by a monetary penalty or up to one year 
of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur observes that the Child Protection Act is currently being revised. 
One proposed amendment by the Ministry of Social Welfare is the inclusion of an article 
explicitly prohibiting corporal punishment at school and in the home. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>53. During the visit the Special Rapporteur enquired about the institutional structure regarding 
the rights of the child and child protection in Estonia. 
</p>
<p>54. The Child Protection Act states that child protection is provided through State and local 
government bodies and non-governmental organizations. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
that the Ministry of Social Affairs elaborates State policies on the issue, taking into account the 
views and observations of the various local authorities and citizens&#8217; groups. There are 162 child 
protection officers who operate in the 227 local authorities in Estonia; 129 of those officers have 
higher education in the field of social work. 
</p>
<p>55. The Law on Social Welfare provides that services are distributed among the Ministry of 
Social Affairs, regional authorities and the local authorities. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed of discrepancies between local authorities, as their revenue base varies from one to 
another. The Government reported that in several areas there are minimum standards of social 
services established by the Government, and the discrepancies do not extend below those 
minimum requirements. Funds that are to be allocated by the State to the local authorities are </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>negotiated annually between the State and the local authorities. Local authorities exercise a great 
deal of independence regarding the use of their funds, but in this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
observed the lack of a mechanism to ensure that local authorities adequately carry out their 
obligations. She was informed that the draft Law on Social Protection provides that in the event a 
local authority cannot fulfil its obligations, it has the duty to cooperate with other local 
authorities. The aim of this law is thus to bridge the disparities between local authorities. 
</p>
<p>56. Implementing the Optional Protocol falls within the area of competence and responsibility 
of the Ministries of Justice, of the Interior and of Social Affairs. The Ministry of Justice and the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs are responsible for implementing aspects relating to criminal law and 
criminal procedure. 
</p>
<p>57. The Ministry of Education and Research coordinates regularly with the Ministry of Social 
Affairs on issues related to the protection of the rights of the child, including initiating the 
periodic reports of Estonia to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The Ministry provides 
statistics on education, including dropout levels, and prepares relevant studies. Child rights are 
also integrated into the school curriculum. The Special Rapporteur was informed that one of the 
objectives of the new curriculum is the prevention of HIV/AIDS, and awareness-raising on this 
issue is often provided by youth for other youth. There is also a special counsellor dedicated to 
the north-eastern part of Estonia who addresses particular questions raised in the region, such as 
access to social security and general issues related to the family. 
</p>
<p>58. The Social Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs organizes and prepares 
training courses, orientation programmes and manuals on the rights of the child. It also acts as 
the Estonian focal point for the CBSS Working Group on Cooperation for Children at Risk. In 
elaborating child rights policies, the Ministry cooperates with regions, local authorities and 
citizens&#8217; groups. 
</p>
<p>59. A central task of the Social Welfare Department is the coordination of the alternative 
childcare system of Estonia. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there is a preference for 
placing children in adoptive or foster families rather than in alternative care centres. Once 
children are placed in such centres, responsibility for their care is conferred on the local 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>60. Article 8 of the Optional Protocol deals with the protection of child victims of the practices 
prohibited under the Protocol throughout the entire criminal justice process. In particular, it 
requires that States parties, taking into account the principles of child participation and best 
interests, take measures which recognize both the special vulnerability of children who have 
been exposed to these crimes and their special needs as victims/witnesses. These measures may 
include the use of child-sensitive procedures, including interview rooms designed for children. 
The Special Rapporteur observed that there are child-friendly spaces in police stations and 
courtrooms in Estonia. 
</p>
<p>61. The Ministry of Justice informed the Special Rapporteur that since 2008, there is a 
deadline for pretrial prosecution of adolescents of four months from the first interrogation until 
the case is brought to court. Twice a year, the Ministry of Justice monitors whether this criterion 
has been followed. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>62. According to the Constitution, the Chancellor of Justice is independent in his/her activities 
and reviews the legislation of general application of the State&#8217;s legislative and executive 
branches and of local governments to verify its conformity with the Constitution and the laws. 
The Chancellor also assumes the function of ombudsman and monitors whether State agencies 
comply with people&#8217;s fundamental rights and freedoms and with the principles of good 
governance. An amendment to the Act that entered into force on 1 January 2004 further 
expanded the functions of the Chancellor as an ombudsman: now the Chancellor of Justice also 
supervises local governments, legal persons in public law and private persons who exercise 
public functions. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur was informed that children have access to the Chancellor, even if 
the law establishing the office does not explicitly provide for this. The Chancellor has received 
very few complaints from children, so he has taken the initiative to visit, sometimes without 
notice, various establishments dealing with children such as schools, alternative care institutions 
and crisis centres. Each such visit results in a report containing recommendations to all 
stakeholders, including the institution itself and the municipal and State authorities. The 
Chancellor admitted that while he has received some complaints from children, his Office is still 
not a very visible institution to children. 
</p>
<p>64. The Chancellor informed the Special Rapporteur that he is considering the possibility that 
the mandate of his Office could be extended to function officially as a monitoring and follow-up 
mechanism for the rights of the child, and has given consent in principle to take over the 
functions of an Ombudsman for Children. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this initiative, and 
urges that any such institution be in conformity with the Paris Principles, with all guarantees of 
independence and impartiality in carrying out its functions. The Office, together with the NGO 
Estonian Union for Child Welfare, has initiated an open discussion in this regard. The Union has 
set as one of its priorities for 2009 the coordination of the discussion, in order to call 
decision makers&#8217; attention to the need to create a more efficient system to supervise the rights of 
children. So far informative newsletters have been sent out to institutions, politicians and interest 
groups. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that as a second step the Estonian Union for 
Child Welfare organized a round table in March 2009. The objective was to present the content 
of the functions attached to supervising children&#8217;s rights and to provide an overview of the 
current situation. 
</p>
<p>66. The availability to victims of complaints procedure mechanisms that are accessible and 
child friendly is one of the main ways of protecting child victims and, in some instances, to 
prevent violations. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the Children&#8217;s Helpline that 
is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, financed by the Ministry of Social Affairs (the 
number is 116111, which is uniform throughout Europe). Representatives of the Child Protection 
Division of the P&#245;hja Police Prefecture informed the Special Rapporteur that they follow a file 
from the beginning to the end. The Tallinn Family Centre (Tallinna Perekeskus), a city 
institution administered by the Social Welfare Department, provides counselling and daily 
activities to children and their families. This organization also provides a children&#8217;s helpline 
(6556 088), which reportedly receives about 600 calls a day. The main issues raised by 
adolescents are questions about the changes occurring to their bodies, their sexual life, 
relationships between girls and boys, violence in schools and depression. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>67. While welcoming such programmes, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government 
of Estonia to ensure that complaints procedure mechanisms are available to all children 
throughout the whole territory of Estonia. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>68. Estonia has a range of policies and programmes that address issues related to child 
protection. The Strategy to Guarantee the Rights of the Child (2004-2008) was designed to 
implement the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child &#8220;in such a manner that the 
basic and special needs of all children living in Estonia would be ensured with the help of their 
family, the community and the environment&#8221;. The Strategy is coordinated by the Ministry of 
Social Affairs. An inter-ministerial working group, composed of the Ministries of Social Affairs, 
Education and Research, Culture, Justice, Internal Affairs and Finance, and the Office of the 
Minister for Ethnic Affairs and Population, as well as the Estonian Union for Child Welfare, was 
set up to implement the Strategy. The Ministry of Social Affairs drafts the plans of action 
designed to implement the Strategy and reports annually on progress. 
</p>
<p>69. The Ministry of Justice stated that combating human trafficking has been a priority for 
Estonia since 2006. The Development Plan for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings 
(2006-2009) sets out the strategic objectives for combating trafficking in human beings and 
determines the main measures and activities for achieving those goals. This plan is guided by the 
definition of human trafficking as determined by the Palermo Protocol and Council of Europe 
Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings. 
In preparing the Development Plan, the EU Action Plan for Combating Trafficking in Human 
Beings of the European Commission was also taken into consideration. The Ministry of Justice 
coordinated the preparation of the Development Plan, taking into consideration the proposals of 
the Ministry of Education and Research, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, non-profit associations and the International Organization for Migration. This plan 
targets the issue of trafficking in human beings, and thus includes, but does not focus, on 
children. In evaluating the Plan, the Ministry of Justice reported that one benefit has been the 
creation of a real network of stakeholders working on the issue, including NGOs, prosecutors, 
police, migration officials and the Ministry of Education and Research. The plan also foresees 
several other activities related to trafficking in children, including awareness studies, a CBSS 
mapping project, lectures, seminars, training of specialists, promotion of international 
cooperation, paying special attention to minors who cross the EU external borders, and studies to 
improve control over the border crossings of minors. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to ensure effective follow-up to these envisaged activities at the end of 2009 and 
keep her informed of all progress. 
</p>
<p>70. One activity entailed the organization of a seminar by the Ministry of Social Affairs in the 
field of trafficking, prostitution and pornography involving children in March 2007. A training 
course was conducted in Russian by the Tartu Child Support Centre for 12 employees of 
children&#8217;s homes of Ida-Virumaa on the topic of assisting trafficked children; it took place in 
Toila in October 2007. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur observed several drop-in services and shelters for children in need. 
There are youth day centres which provide activities for children who drop in at different times 
of the day. The children who attend these centres do so for a variety of reasons, including </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>difficulties faced by family members, such as health problems, alcoholism, drug addiction, or 
unemployment. One centre in Tallinn visited by the Special Rapporteur offers services for the 
whole family. In Narva, she received information about a municipal shelter that is available for 
children if violence at home becomes too serious, but one NGO representative in the city stated 
that they try to avoid sending children there as violence can easily break out in the shelter as 
well. Some NGOs provide information, orientation and ambulatory services, as well as, in some 
instances, free legal, medical, social and psychological advice, along with rehabilitation services. 
</p>
<p>72. While some NGOs reported efficient cooperation between organizations, others were of 
the view that there is insufficient adequate cooperation between the various NGOs and 
organizations working on child protection. A main concern that was raised by virtually all NGO 
representatives was limited funding and the need for an increase in the number of qualified 
personnel. The Special Rapporteur recommends that funding continue to be ensured for 
programmes and services implemented by NGOs, including through exploring opportunities for 
obtaining funding from the private sector, and that securing qualified personnel be made a 
priority. 
</p>
<p>73. Most interlocutors were of the view that the main weakness in the system in Estonia lies 
with the limited capacities and resources at the level of the local authorities. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the police often fulfil their duties effectively when it comes to 
child protection, but that discrepancies in the resources (both qualitatively and quantitatively) 
available to the local authorities render certain activities difficult, such as adequate rehabilitation 
and follow-up of children in need. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur notes a variety of programmes and projects designed to prevent the 
sexual exploitation of children and other violations of the rights of the child. For instance, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes awareness-raising programmes on the rights of the child, drug 
abuse, HIV/AIDS, trafficking, reproductive health and violence that have been disseminated in 
schools and to the public more generally. However, she urges that such programmes be 
continued over the longer term in order to promote attitudes and behaviour based on respect for 
dignity and physical and moral integrity. The Special Rapporteur also urges that sexual 
education programmes be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur also received reports that parental education programmes were 
being initiated and would be strengthened, with a view to preserving the unity of the family and 
family values. 
</p>
<p>76. More particularly, a major concern that was brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteur is the limited funds available for technical training of human resources in detecting 
cases of cybercrime (particularly online pornography) and of trafficking victims. Such human 
resources range from police officers working with children to social, legal and psychological 
workers who work in schools and in crisis centres, as well as lawyers, prosecutors and judges. 
The Ministry of the Interior reported that in 2007, there were 128 training sessions for police as 
well as NGOs, and that there are special investigators for issues relating to human trafficking and 
prostitution. The Special Rapporteur recommends that such training be strengthened and be 
specialized in the rights of the child in particular. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information provided by the Ministry of Justice 
about an ongoing initiative to establish an electronic database to store information related to all 
cases that have been referred to the justice system, including the type of crime, the age of the 
accused and of the victim(s), gender and other elements. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur observes that Estonia&#8217;s initiatives in the areas of the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography exist within a regional and transnational 
dimension. For instance, as already mentioned, Estonia is a member of the CBSS Working 
Group for Children at Risk and of the CBSS Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
Since 2004, the contact point for unaccompanied and trafficked children is the Ministry of Social 
Affairs. The Ministry should be notified of unaccompanied or trafficked children by phone 
(+372 626 9220) or by e-mail (kontaktpunkt@sm.ee) to coordinate the activities to help the child 
concerned. The Ministry also coordinates the exchange of information with other contact points 
in the Baltic Sea States (see also www.childcentre.info). Guidelines for identifying and helping a 
victim of trafficking, including guidelines for helping child victims, have been prepared in 2009 
and distributed to partners in Estonia. 
</p>
<p>79. The Ministry of the Interior reported that its police cooperate regularly with Europol, 
Interpol, as well as with neighbouring countries such as Finland, Sweden and Latvia. Estonia 
also exchanges good practices with the other members of the Nordic Council of Ministers. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the vast majority of cases identified through 
such cooperation relate to adult victims of trafficking, and not children. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes a significant political commitment in Estonia to 
prioritize the rights of the child. While the number of reported cases of child prostitution 
and child pornography is low, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that vigilance is 
required and efforts should be directed towards prevention. In this regard, concrete 
actions must be implemented, including the adoption of amended legislation on the rights 
of the child, efficient training of police, particularly in detecting cases of sexual exploitation 
of children and online child pornography, training of judges in the rights of the child, and 
strengthening of the non-governmental and civil society sector. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that preventing and combating these phenomena are 
directly linked to the capacity of a society to adopt a holistic approach to the fundamental 
rights of children, paving the way for the implementation of social policies which favour 
children, youth and the family and the elaboration of creative and innovative responses 
from the public and the private sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations to the 
Government of Estonia. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Regarding legislation, the Special Rapporteur recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) That the definition of &#8220;child pornography&#8221; be amended in accordance with the 
Optional Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) That there be no distinction based on the age of the person depicted in either 
pornographic or erotic works; the age should be 18 years in either case; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) That child victims of the offences covered by the Optional Protocol should not, 
as such, be either criminalized or penalized and that all possible measures should be taken 
to avoid their stigmatization and social marginalization, consistent with various 
recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Such action may decrease 
the level of shame/fear in children reporting cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) That Estonian law clearly stipulate that a child under 18 years of age, 
irrespective of the legal age of consent to sexual activity, is unable to consent to any form of 
sexual exploitation, including child pornography and child prostitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) That the law be amended to specifically define and criminalize trafficking in 
children for sexual purposes in accordance with the Palermo Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) That pending amendments to the Child Protection Act and the Social Welfare 
Act be adopted, and that the process of adoption of the Law on Social Protection and the 
Family Law Act be prioritized; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) That Estonia ensure effective awareness-raising about legislation on the rights 
of the child, including training; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) That there be prompt investigations and judicial procedures in all matters 
related to children. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the participation of children be 
strengthened on all issues concerning them, and that their views be given due weight. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Adequate training should be provided for combating cybercrime, particularly online 
child pornography, to the relevant authorities, in order to effectively detect violations. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Internet service providers and 
telecommunications companies be encouraged to become involved in initiatives to combat 
and prevent online child pornography. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>All programmes and policies related to child protection should be available 
throughout the territory of Estonia in an equitable manner. Human and financial resources 
available to such programmes should also be strengthened. Birth registration should also 
be guaranteed for all children. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the strengthening of complaints mechanisms 
for children, including the establishment of an ombudsman for children in accordance with 
the Paris Principles, and that such mechanisms be available to children throughout the 
territory of Estonia. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Non-governmental organizations should be strengthened with qualified human 
resources as well as sufficient funding, including through exploring opportunities for 
obtaining funding from the private sector. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>In cases where the Government tasks non-governmental organizations with 
implementing child protection programmes at the local level, detailed partnership 
agreements should be undertaken between the Government and non-governmental 
organizations which recall the respective undertakings of the parties, detailed actions, 
expected outcomes, follow-up and evaluation modalities, as well as the allocated budget. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Estonia to consider engaging 
the private sector for fundraising and programmatic support on issues related to the 
protection of the rights of the child. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes awareness-raising and prevention programmes 
already in place. She urges that they be continued over the longer term, and that they be 
targeted not only at children, but also at parents and the general public in order to 
promote attitudes and behaviour based on respect for dignity and physical and moral 
integrity. The Special Rapporteur also urges that sexual education programmes be 
strengthened. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Control and supervision of structures and programmes should be strengthened so 
that the quality of services provided as well as the sustainability of these projects are 
ensured. Proper follow-up of the results of such structures and programmes must also be 
provided for and ensured. A child-rights approach must be integral to all implemented 
programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Standardized and centralized information-gathering should be strengthened, 
including by increasing efforts in terms of disaggregating data by sex, age, type of violation 
and measures taken, as well as by harmonizing methods of gathering and processing data. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government of Estonia to undertake 
analyses and studies on the forms, factors and trends in abuse, violence against and 
exploitation of children. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Estonia should continue to strengthen and increase the efficiency of and cooperation 
between the various institutional mechanisms and entities in monitoring implementation of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol, including between the 
national and local levels. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that relevant Government departments, in 
cooperation with the non-governmental sector, prepare annual reports on the situation of 
children for distribution and discussion. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.2 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>99. <b>The media should be trained in the ethical treatment of cases of the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography, and in their role in awareness-raising on the 
issue. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>International and regional cooperation should be continued and strengthened where 
necessary in order to effectively combat and prevent child sex tourism and online child 
pornography. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>In the light of the current financial crisis, the Government of Estonia should make all 
possible efforts to ensure that financing of child protection policies and programmes is 
prioritized.
