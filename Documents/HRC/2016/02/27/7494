<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the first Independent Expert on the enjoyment of 
all human rights by older persons, Rosa Kornfeld-Matte, to the Human Rights Council 
pursuant to its resolution 24/20 of 27 September 2013. In the report, the Independent Expert 
describes the activities undertaken from 2 June to 28 July 2014, and provides her 
preliminary considerations concerning the foundation and context of the mandate, as well 
as some considerations that will inform her work during the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate-related activities  
</b></p>
<p>2. Since assuming her functions on 2 June 2014, the Independent Expert has engaged 
in consultations with a large number of experts and civil society organizations, exchanging 
views about priorities and strategies for fulfilling the mandate, including HelpAge and the 
Centro Latinoamericano de Pol&#237;ticas Econ&#243;micas y Sociales of the Pontifical Catholic 
University of Chile<i>.  
</i></p>
<p>3<i>. </i>On 2 and 3 June 2014, the Independent Expert addressed the International 
Association of Universities of the elderly in Toulouse, France. She furthermore accepted an 
invitation, on 10 July 2014, to share her views and expertise on pension reform in Chile 
with the Presidential Commission for the Study of Social Security Reform.   
</p>
<p>4. As part of the mandate, the Independent Expert was requested to work in close 
coordination, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with the Open-ended Working 
Group on Ageing. At the time of submission, the Independent Expert had confirmed her 
participation in the upcoming fifth session of the Working Group, scheduled for 30 July to 
1 August 2014 in New York. The Working Group will, inter alia, discuss measures to 
strengthen the promotion and protection of the rights of older persons, which are currently 
not addressed sufficiently, in particular in the areas of care for older persons, violence and 
abuse against older persons, and legal and financial issues in relation to the planning for 
end-of-life care. The Independent Expert will moderate a panel on recent developments. 
The Working Group will also hold a dialogue on how to strengthen the rights of older 
persons through enhanced implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on 
Ageing, and discuss the post-2015 development agenda and older persons. 
</p>
<p>5. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/25, the 2014 Social Forum focused 
on the rights of older persons, including best practices in this regard. While the Forum, 
which was held from 1 to 3 April 2014, was held before the appointment of the Independent 
Expert, the importance of the mandate and the future activities of the mandate holder 
permeated the deliberations. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) participated in a number of panel discussions, in particular in the 
discussion on the theme &#8220;the universal human rights system: new opportunities for 
participation&#8221;, at which it informed the participants that the Independent Expert could help 
to advance international standards on older persons, and would aim to (a) assess existing 
laws; (b) investigate the views of stakeholders; and (c) take a gender/disability perspective. </p>


<p><b> III. Foundations of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. The world is undergoing an unprecedented demographic transformation towards an 
ageing population. Estimates indicate that the number of elderly persons will increase from 
600 million to 1.2 billion by 2025. By 2050, this age group is expected to reach 2 billion, 
approximately equivalent to the global population youth. 
</p>
<p>7. In the light of these projections, several international organizations have stressed the 
need to address the significant challenges posed by global ageing. In this context, the 
different situations imposed by the heterogeneity of ageing and specific problems in 
different cultures of the world should be borne in mind, including those associated with 
healthy, ill, terminal, non-disabled and elderly persons with disabilities, whether physical or 
cognitive, as well as the care needs and ethical issues posed for each of these groups. In 
addition, this sociodemographic scenario demands the protection of the rights of older 
persons at the national, regional and global levels, the development of public institutions, 
the visibility of the issue of old age and ageing, the inclusion of seniors, their health care, 
and strengthening social services, among others. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Scope of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>8. In its resolution 24/20, the Human Rights Council established the mandate of the 
Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons, to assess the 
implementation of existing international instruments with regard to older persons while 
identifying both best practices in the implementation of existing law related to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of older persons and gaps in the implementation of 
existing law.  
</p>
<p>9. As part of the mandate, the Independent Expert has also been tasked to assess the 
human rights implications of the implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action 
on Ageing.  
</p>
<p>10. Operationally, in its resolution 24/20, the Human Rights Council specified that the 
Independent Expert should discharge the mandate by taking into account the views of 
stakeholders, including States, relevant regional human rights mechanisms, national human 
rights institutions, civil society organizations and academic institutions, and by integrating a 
gender and disability perspective into her work, and to pay particular attention to older 
women, persons with disabilities, persons of African descent, individuals belonging to 
indigenous peoples, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities, rural persons, persons living on the streets, and refugees, among other groups.  
</p>
<p>11. The Council also requested the Independent Expert to raise awareness of the 
challenges faced in the realization of all human rights by older persons, and to ensure that 
older persons receive information about those rights, as well as to work in cooperation with 
States in order to foster the implementation of measures that contribute to the promotion 
and protection of the rights of older persons. The Council also called upon the Independent 
Expert to work in close coordination, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with the 
Open-ended Working Group on Ageing, other special procedures and subsidiary organs of 
the Council, relevant United Nations bodies and the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>12. The Human Rights Council further requested the Independent Expert to report 
annually to the Council with a view to presenting a comprehensive report at its thirty-third 
session. </p>


<p><b>C. Legislative context 
</b></p>
<p>13. In 2010, the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme 
poverty dedicated her annual report to the role that social protection systems play in 
reducing extreme poverty and in contributing to the realization of human rights of older 
persons.1  
</p>
<p>14. In its resolution 15/22, the Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur 
on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health to prepare a thematic study on the realization of the right to health of older 
persons. On the basis of that study,2 a panel discussion was held by the Council at its 
eighteenth session, in September 2011, on the right to health of older persons, focusing on 
increasing challenges that older persons face and on an opportunity to identify good 
practices and possible measures.  
</p>
<p>15. Also in 2011, OHCHR contributed to the report of the Secretary-General submitted 
to the General Assembly on the follow-up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing.3 A 
questionnaire was sent to States and stakeholders soliciting observations and information on 
existing legislation, policies and programmes related to various human rights issues related 
to older persons. The report contains an overview of some of the challenges faced by older 
persons in the enjoyment of their rights and outlines examples of government responses to 
those challenges, including through an illustrative collection of legislation, policies and 
programmes. It also underlines four critical human rights issues for older persons: 
discrimination; poverty; lack of special measures, services and facilities; and violence and 
abuse. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2012, in her annual report to the Economic and Social Council, the High 
Commissioner focused on the human rights of older persons.4 In the report, she provided an 
overview of existing international instruments and the gaps in the international protection 
regime, particularly focusing on areas such as age discrimination, legal capacity and equal 
recognition before the law, long-term care, violence and abuse, access to productive 
resources, work and food, social protection and the right to social security, the right to 
health and end-of-life care, disabilities, older persons in prison, and access to justice. The 
High Commissioner recommended, inter alia, the creation of a new special procedures 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>17. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 21/23, OHCHR organized a public 
consultation on the promotion and protection of the human rights of older persons in April 
2013, in order to receive information and to share good practices on the matter. A summary 
report was prepared thereon and submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
fourth session. 5  The conclusion reached at the consultation was that, while most 
international human rights instruments were applicable to all age groups, including older 
persons, a number of human rights issues particularly relevant to older persons had not been 
given sufficient attention either in the wording of existing human rights instruments or in 
the practice of human rights bodies and mechanisms<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Council subsequently adopted resolution 24/20, in September 
2013, thereby establishing the mandate of the Independent Expert.

<p><b>D. Global context 
</b></p>
<p>19. In 2002, the Second World Assembly on Ageing adopted the Madrid International 
Plan of Action on Ageing to respond to the opportunities and challenges of population 
ageing in the twenty-first century. The Plan of Action was preceded by the Vienna 
International Plan of Action on Ageing, which was adopted at the First World Assembly on 
Ageing, held in Vienna in 1982 and which was subsequently endorsed by the General 
Assembly. 
</p>
<p>20. The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing requires States to take measures 
to address ageing in order to achieve a society for all ages. It also calls for the 
mainstreaming of ageing into national and global development agendas, and contains 
recommendations for action focused on three priority areas, namely development, health 
and well-being, and enabling and supportive environments, which are divided into specific 
issues, objectives and actions.  
</p><p>21. The Independent Expert has been mandated to assess the human rights implications 
of its implementation. In this context, she notes that the Secretary-General, in his report on 
further Implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, outlined 
impediments to its implementation, including the lack of financial and human resources, 
lack of political focus and will, and differing national and regional perceptions of old age 
issues, which translate into different policy approaches, as well as emerging views and 
approaches.6  
</p>
<p>22. In its resolution 65/182 on the follow-up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing, 
the General Assembly established the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing for the 
purpose of strengthening the protection of the human rights of older persons by considering 
the existing international framework of the human rights of older persons and identifying 
possible gaps and how best to address them, including by considering, as appropriate, the 
feasibility of further instruments and measures. 
</p>
<p>23. As mentioned above, the Independent Expert will work in close coordination with 
the Open-ended Working Group, while avoiding unnecessary duplication. In this regard, it 
is important to note the difference in the mandates of the Independent Expert and the Open-
ended Working Group. While the latter is mandated to consider the existing international 
framework of the human rights of older persons to identify possible gaps and to assess how 
best to address them, including by considering, as appropriate, the feasibility of further 
instruments and measures, the Independent Expert is entrusted to assess the implementation 
of the existing law and to identify best practices and gaps. The comprehensive report that 
the Independent Expert has been requested to prepare for the Human Rights Council at its 
thirty-third session will be brought to the attention of the Working Group, in accordance 
with Council resolution 24/20. 
</p>
<p><b>E. International standards and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>24. At the international level, there are policies, standards and mechanisms aimed at 
protecting and promoting the rights of older persons, either in the form of generic or 
specific provisions, especially in the field of international labour law, as well as 
international and human rights law. This leads to a context of regulatory dispersion (rather 
than &#8220;legal gap&#8221; or &#8220;lack of regulation&#8221;), whereby the rights of older persons lack 
systematic protection. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6 
 E/CN.5/2014/4. </p>


<p>25. Although there is no specific international human rights instrument devoted to older 
persons, most human rights treaties contain implicit obligations towards them. Explicit 
references to age as a ground of discrimination, though rare, can be found in more recent 
human rights treaties, such as article 7 of the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities contains various references to older persons (in article 
13.1, on access to justice, article 16 on age-sensitive protection services, article 25 (b) on 
health, and article 28.2 (b) on an adequate standard of living and social protection). The 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women includes a 
reference to old age in relation to discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to social 
security (article 11.1 (e)).   
</p><p>26. The treaty bodies have considered the application of their respective treaties to older 
persons. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued general comment 
No. 6 on the economic, social and cultural rights of older persons, while the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women made general recommendation No. 27 on 
the issue of older women and the protection of their human rights. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also referred to the rights of older persons in its 
general comment No. 19 on the right to social security (considering old age one of the 
branches to be covered by social security systems), and general comment No. 20, on non-
discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights (which prohibits age as a ground for 
discrimination). 
27. A number of regional human rights treaties also contain provisions on the rights of 
older people, namely article 17 of the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on 
Human Rights in the Area of Economic Social and Cultural Rights (Protocol of San 
Salvador); articles 46 and 47 of the Andean Charter for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights; article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; 
article 12 of the revised European Social Charter; and article 18 of the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>28. At the international level, a number of non-binding instruments recognize older 
persons as a group, such as the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing of 2002 and 
the Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing of 1982, as well as the United Nations 
Principles for Older Persons, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/91. In 
the latter text, the Assembly encouraged Governments to incorporate the 18 principles into 
their national programmes in order to promote the independence, participation, care, self-
fulfilment and dignity of older persons.  
</p>
<p>29. The International Labour Organization has developed a number of recommendations 
addressing the situation of older workers, including Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivor&#8217;s 
Benefits Recommendation No. 131 (1967), Older Workers Recommendation No. 162 
(1980) and Termination of Employment Recommendation No. 166 (1982). 
</p><p>30. A comprehensive overview of existing international instruments relating to the 
human rights of older persons can be found in the compilation of the Open-ended Working 
Group on Ageing of 11 July 2013, prepared by OHCHR,7 and in the OHCHR analytical 
outcome paper on normative standards in international human rights law in relation to older 
persons of August 2012. 
</p>
<p>31. The lack of a comprehensive and integrated international legal instrument to 
promote and protect the rights and dignity of the elderly has significant practical 
implications, given that:  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7 
 Available at http://social.un.org/ageing-working-group/documents/fourth/compilation.pdf. </p>


<p>(a) Existing regulations do not cohere, let alone conceptualize, regulatory principles 
to guide public action and policies of Governments;  
</p>
<p>(b) General human rights standards do not consider the recognition of third-
generation specific rights in favour of elderly adults;  
</p>
<p>(c) It is difficult to clarify the obligations of States with respect to older persons;  
(d) Procedures for monitoring human rights treaties generally ignore older persons;  
(e) Current instruments do not make the issues of ageing visible enough, which 
</p>
<p>precludes the education of the population and with it, the effective integration of the 
elderly. 
</p>
<p>32. In this sense, there is a difference in the historical treatment of the elderly by the 
international human rights system in relation to other vulnerable populations. For boys,girls 
and adolescents, women, indigenous communities and persons with disabilities, the binding 
instrument have been driven by the international legislator in a vertically descending order; 
in the case of the elderly, however, it seems that the awareness of the need for international 
regulation and a regulatory framework base has rather been ascending, from the motivation 
of the bases or regional human rights systems, which are an entirely new concept in their 
identity and development. 
</p>
<p>33. Moreover, as noted by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/139, the efforts of 
Governments, relevant bodies of the United Nations system and civil society, including 
non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to enhance cooperation and 
integration and increase awareness of issues of the elderly since the adoption of the Plans of 
Action of Vienna (1982) and Madrid (2002) have not been sufficient to promote 
opportunities for elderly persons or their full and effective participation in economic, social, 
cultural and political life. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Preliminary considerations of the Independent Expert 
</b></p>
<p>34. To fulfil the mandate entrusted to her, the Independent Expert has chosen a 
comprehensive approach to ageing, encompassing work in the international legal and policy 
areas. As a precondition to assessing implementation gaps and best practices, the 
Independent Expert contemplates outlining the specific rights of older persons, whereby she 
relies on the traditional classification of human rights. 
</p>
<p>35. The civil rights of older persons include the right to equality and non-discrimination 
on grounds of age, which requires adopting special measures of positive reinforcement to 
promote awareness. Deriving from the rights to life and to a dignified death is the 
prohibition of imprisonment for older persons and of death penalty for the elderly. 
Moreover, the rights to physical, mental and emotional integrity require the implementation 
of legislative measures to ensure proper treatment for older persons and penalties for 
physical, psychological and patrimonial abuse and neglect. 
</p>
<p>36. The right to legal personality and capacity involves the recognition of autonomy; the 
ability to exercise rights and civil obligations; the need to grant the necessary authorizations 
to act on their behalf; and to distinguish between decision-making capacity and competence 
in health, and that only a court order may limit their legal capacity. 
</p>
<p>37.  With regard to elderly women, in addition to the elimination of all forms of 
discrimination on grounds of age, there is a need to ensure the full recognition of and 
respect for their rights, including the prevention of all forms of violence, the abolition of 
widowhood rites and other harmful traditional practices that may affect the integrity of </p>


<p>elderly women, the protection of elderly women living in rural areas, social security, and 
the protection of property and possession rights of widows. 
</p>
<p>38. The right to proper (non-violent) treatment, the protection of the extended family 
systems, and gender and generational equality are central aspects to the protection of the 
rights of indigenous elderly persons. 
</p>
<p>39. The political rights of older persons include the right to participate in the social, 
cultural and political life of the community, which entails the right to actively participate in 
the formulation and implementation of legislative measures and public policies that directly 
affect their rights, including policies on ageing, social development and strategies for 
poverty reduction, as well as the right to association and the right to receive government 
support through legal or economic measures. There is also a need to promote 
intergenerational volunteering. 
</p>
<p>40. The social rights of older persons can be classified into three groups, allowing for a 
system of integrated social protection in order to promote quality of life and well-being. 
</p>
<p>41. First, the right to income security contemplates the inclusion of minimum standards 
for the areas covered by the right to an adequate standard of living; fundamental principles 
that should guide social policies with an age and welfare perspective in the context of 
ageing. It also involves prescribing the right to benefit from social security and other forms 
of social protection during old age and in the event of retirement, widowhood, disability or 
other situations of involuntary loss of livelihood, as well as equal conditions of retirement 
for men and women and the prohibition that government laws reduce retirement benefits. 
</p>
<p>42.  Second, the right to improve functional health entails the exercise of the right to 
health and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, without 
discrimination and with full respect for the dignity and autonomy of older persons. It 
requires considering preventive and restorative health (primary care and rehabilitation 
services); the right to provide informed and free consent prior to any medical treatment; 
sheltered accommodation; the promotion of preferential access to medicines in the case of 
age-related diseases; and financial and technical support for home care and alternative care 
in the families, as well as palliative care for terminal patients. 
</p>
<p>43. Third, Governments should furthermore promote active policies to eradicate 
illiteracy (with emphasis on women), and to facilitate the active participation of elderly 
persons in cultural activities and education programmes that allow them to pass on their 
knowledge, culture and spiritual values as part of the right of older persons to a continuous 
and multi-specialty education in public and private institutions from the standpoint of 
lifelong learning. 
</p>
<p>44.  Another important factor regarding the independence and health of the elderly 
population, in particular during crisis situations, emergency evacuations or displacement 
arising from development, is the right to housing and to a healthy environment. Priority is 
assumed in the allocation of housing or land to older persons in the above-mentioned 
situations, and entails the right to live in a safe and healthy environment, with access to 
water, clean air and a pollution-free environment, and to remain in their own home for as 
long as possible, according to their needs and will. 
</p>
<p>45. The right to work includes the right of older persons to work and have access to 
income-generating activities; equal treatment and opportunities in salaries, working 
conditions, vocational guidance and training, and job placement; and freedom of 
association without discrimination on grounds of age. It also requires the establishment of 
employment policies that promote the participation or return to the labour market of elderly 
workers, as well as legal reforms and economic incentives that allow the employment of 
older persons after retirement age, according to their ability, experience and preferences, </p>


<p>including such measures as the gradual reduction of working hours, part-time work and 
flexible schedules, and the dissemination of information on the rights and benefits of 
retirement. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to procedural guarantees for older persons, access to justice is central, 
as its absence results in various forms of discrimination and everyday obstacles. In 
particular, exceptional care must be taken when responding to legal complaints relating to 
the provision of benefits to older persons or in the event of widowhood. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b>47.<b> The Independent Expert aims to respond to the expectations of numerous 
individuals and organizations with regard to her work on the human rights of older 
persons, as outlined by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 24/20. To that end, 
she looks forward to engaging in constructive and fruitful cooperation with diverse 
stakeholders in all regions. She emphasizes her desire for constructive engagement 
with the States Members of the United Nations, and reiterates the importance of an 
inclusive and all-encompassing approach in the discharge of her mandate. She 
particularly notes the central role of non-governmental organizations, including in 
providing her with information and engaging with and assisting her as she fulfils her 
mandate.
