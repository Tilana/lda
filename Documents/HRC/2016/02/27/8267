<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Government of Bulgaria must be commended for its numerous laws, policies 
and programmes aimed at promoting anti-discrimination and equality and the rights of 
minorities, including the Roma minority. The Government consistently highlighted to the 
independent expert its commitment to desegregation and the inclusion of Roma with 
respect to education, employment, housing and health care, and shared numerous policy 
documents outlining those commitments, including those under the framework of the 
European Union (EU). Nevertheless, although some policies have been in place for many 
years, the Roma remain at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder. They experience 
discrimination and exclusion in all walks of life, which leaves them totally marginalized 
and in persistent poverty. 
</p>
<p> The Government must match the policies on Roma integration, inspired by the EU 
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with Government-led implementation and 
the financial resources necessary to improve the living conditions of the Roma. To date, 
implementation remains woefully inadequate, with initiatives that have little more than 
superficial impact and which inevitably fail to meet expectations.

<p> Muslim and other religious minorities, including Jewish and Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses 
emphasized their generally positive experiences with regard to religious freedoms. They 
voiced concerns, however, regarding an increase in incidents of violence, intimidation, 
vandalism of places of worship and hate speech targeted at religious minorities, including 
by nationalist politicians. In 2011, nationalist political parties instigated and organized

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert conducted an official visit to Bulgaria between 4 and 11 July 
</p><p>2011. She thanks the Government for its invitation, its cooperation and the assistance it 
provided in the preparation and conduct of her visit. She also thanks the numerous non-
governmental organizations, both national and international, academic institutions, and 
others working in the field of minority issues, in particular the Bulgarian Helsinki 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert consulted with senior Government representatives, including 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior (who is also Deputy Prime 
Minister and Chairman of the National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration 
Issues) and the Minister of Culture. She consulted the Director of the Directorate of 
Religious Denominations at the Council of Ministers, a magistrate of the Constitutional 
Court, senior staff of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sciences and the Ministry of 
Labour and Social Policy, the President of the National Statistical Institute; and the Director 
of the Demographic and Social Statistics Department. She met with the Deputy Mayor of 
Sofia, the Mayors of Blagoevgrad and Kurdjali, the Regional Governor of Pazardzhik 
District, as well as senior representatives of the regional administration. She consulted the 
Chairman and members of the Commission for Protection against Discrimination, the 
Ombudsman of the Republic, as well as their representatives in the Kurdjali region. 
</p>
<p>3. According to the 2011 census results, ethnic Bulgarians make up 84.8 per cent of the 
7,364,570 population, ethnic Turkish Bulgarians 8.8 per cent and Roma 4.9 per cent. 
Orthodox Christians are 76 per cent of the population, Muslims 10 per cent. About 5.6 
million people listed Bulgarian as their mother tongue; other mother tongue languages 
listed include Turkish, Romani, Russian and Macedonian.1 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert visited Sofia and different regions in which minority 
communities live, including the cities of Blagoevgrad, Pazardzhik, Plovdiv and Kurdjali. 
She consulted community members in the Roma communities of Fakulteta, Sofia, and 
Stolopinovo, Plovdiv. She met Roma women to hear their issues and concerns, 
representatives of the Turkish Muslim and other Muslim communities, and leaders of the 
Jewish community and the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. She also consulted with representatives of 
ethnic Macedonian and Pomak communities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Non-discrimination and equality: legal and institutional 
framework 
</b></p>
<p>5. The 1991 Constitution states that &#8220;all persons are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.&#8221; Additionally, &#8220;all citizens shall be equal before the law. There shall be no privileges 
or restriction of rights on the grounds of race, national or social origin, ethnic self-identity, 
sex, religion, education, opinion, political affiliation, personal or social status or property 
status.&#8221; Bulgaria has ratified international treaties relevant to anti-discrimination and 
minority rights, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination. Bulgaria has also ratified the Council of Europe's Framework 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Some NGOs expressed concerns that an estimated 700,000 people were discouraged from declaring 
</p>
<p>their identity as Roma, Macedonian or Pomak by a policy of the National Statistical Institute. The 
Government stated to the independent expert that the census was conducted in full conformity with 
international standards and that extensive consultations were conducted with representatives of the 
Roma in particular. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5</b> 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in May 1999 and falls under its 
monitoring procedures.2 
</p>
<p>6. Prior to Bulgaria&#8217;s accession to the European Union in 2007, the European 
Commission had highlighted the situation of the Roma as an ongoing human rights 
concern. Following accession, Bulgaria was required to conform to EU Anti-Discrimination 
Directives, including the Racial Equality Directive (2000/43/EC) and the Employment 
Equality Directive (2000/78/EC) which set out the minimum standards of racial equality.3 
</p>
<p>7. The National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues (NCCEII, 
previously the National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Demographic Issues)<b> </b>was 
established in 1997 by the Council of Ministers and is headed by the Deputy Prime 
Minister. Its mandate is to coordinate State programmes and policies related to ethnic 
minorities and monitor the implementation of integration policies, in consultation with 
government bodies, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.4 NGOs representing 
ethnic minorities, including Roma, are members. 
</p>
<p>8. In 2003, Bulgaria adopted the Protection against Discrimination Act. Article 4 (1) of 
the Act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, extraction, ethnicity, 
nationality, origin, religion or faith, or any other ground. Article 7 authorizes affirmative 
action or special measures benefiting disadvantaged persons or groups identified in article 4 
(1). 
</p>
<p>9. The Act established the Commission for Protection against Discrimination, an 
independent specialized institution for prevention of and protection against discrimination 
and for ensuring equal opportunities. Nine members (five elected by the National Assembly 
and four appointed by the President) sit for five-year terms. Currently, four members are of 
non-Bulgarian ethnic background. The mandate of the Commission is to monitor 
compliance with and implementation of the Act and other laws regulating equality of 
treatment. It can receive and investigate complaints by victims and third parties and initiate 
proceedings. In 2010, it initiated 268 cases, organized 388 public hearings and ruled on 293 
cases. In April 2010, the Council of Ministers decided to reduce the number of Commission 
members to seven citing budgetary grounds; this drew criticism from NGOs which consider 
the body under-resourced. To date, the decision has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>10. Bulgarian is the official language, however article 36 (2) of the Constitution states 
that &#8220;citizens whose mother tongue is not Bulgarian shall have the right to study and use 
their own language alongside the compulsory study of the Bulgarian language.&#8221; However, 
</p>
<p>this is not interpreted as providing the right for minorities to receive education in their 
mother tongue as the language of instruction. Minority languages can be studied as 
&#8220;selected subjects&#8221; where a sufficient minimum number of students make the choice. 
Bulgaria has not signed or ratified the European Charter for Regional and Minority 
Languages which requires the provision of education in regional or minority languages and 
the provision of judicial administrative and public services in minority languages. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The situation of the Roma minority 
</b></p>
<p>11. Bulgaria has the largest Roma population in the EU in proportion to total population. 
Roma rights organizations consider that the true Roma population is as much as 10 per cent 
of the total population, considerably higher than official statistics (4.9 per cent or 325,343 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Bulgaria has not authorized the publication of the last report of the Advisory Committee. 
 3 Bulgaria was required to transpose the Racial Equality Directive into domestic law by 1 January 
</p>
<p>2007.

</p>
<p>people) suggest. Low census figures may be due to factors such as individuals being 
reluctant to identify as Roma because of discrimination and social stigma associated with 
this ethnic group and census policies and methodologies relating to minority self-
identification, which NGOs consider flawed. Muslim Roma may identify themselves as 
Turks, while high illiteracy rates among the Roma may be a factor in producing low census 
figures. 
</p>
<p>12. The independent expert consulted with representatives of the Roma communities of 
Fakulteta in Sofia, and Stolipinovo in Plovdiv. She also met with NGO staff working with 
Roma communities. The Roma in Bulgaria are not homogenous but rather made up of 
distinctly different groups and sub-groups which differ in religion, mother tongue, cultural 
and traditional practices and lifestyles.5 
</p>
<p>13. Several NGO and community representatives, social researchers and journalists 
highlighted that discrimination, strongly negative attitudes and hostility towards Roma 
persist in Bulgarian society. Derogatory stereotypes and prejudices are commonplace and 
portray the Roma as criminal and untrustworthy, dirty, lazy and a societal problem. Such 
stereotypes are commonly repeated in the media and in political discourse. Although 
Bulgaria&#8217;s Code of Ethics for the media limits mention of a perpetrator&#8217;s ethnic 
background, surveys reveal that some 50 per cent of references to Roma in the press relate 
to crime or illicit activities.6 One senior politician stated that Roma settlements were &#8220;an 
incubator for generating crime&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>14. The Government responded to these criticisms by noting that the Penal Code was 
strengthened in 2009 with the addition of &#8220;incitement to ethnic hostility or hatred, in 
speech, print or other mass media or through electronic information systems&#8221; and the 
prohibition of hate speech. The penalties were also increased. Additionally, the 
Government undertook, in conjunction with the Roma community and international NGOs, 
a number of public education programmes aimed at countering hate speech. 
</p>
<p>15. Roma experience the highest levels of poverty. According to a World Bank study,8 
in March 2010, nearly 9 out of 10 Bulgarian Roma had per capita incomes equal to the 
incomes experienced by the poorest four-tenths of the population, with 67 per cent of Roma 
being among the poorest 20 per cent of all people in Bulgaria. The Government pointed out 
that national strategies and programmes exist for reducing poverty and promoting social 
inclusion of persons belonging to vulnerable groups; it highlighted the Convergence 
Programme (2011&#8211;2014) and the National Reform Programme (2011&#8211;2015). Bulgaria is 
currently in the process of drafting a National Strategy for Poverty Reduction and 
Promotion of Social Inclusion. 
</p>
<p>16. The Roma remain extremely poorly represented in national Government, and 
inadequately represented within municipal authorities. Consequently, the Roma lack a level 
of political participation that would enable them to influence national and local policy and 
decision-making on issues that affect Roma communities.

</p>
<p>17. Roma women face particular challenges. Foundation ROMA, an NGO in 
Stolopinovo, discussed with the independent expert the disproportionate lack of education 
among Roma women, persistent incidences of early marriage and pregnancy, high levels of 
domestic violence and prostitution. NGO workers noted a disturbing trend of young Roma 
women travelling to locations outside the country and ending up in prostitution. Some 400 
women from Stolopinovo alone had reportedly gone to Dortmund, Germany. The 
independent expert was concerned about the implication that Roma women were falling 
prey to traffickers. Declining employment opportunities was cited as a factor increasing the 
numbers who leave. The Government acknowledged concerns regarding trafficking and 
pointed to the activities of the National Anti-Trafficking Commission and local 
commissions, including information campaigns and training on prevention of trafficking.9 
</p>
<p>18. The Government has adopted numerous strategic documents on Roma integration. A 
new Framework Programme for the Integration of Roma in Bulgarian Society (2010-2020) 
was approved by the Council of Ministers in May 2010. The Government stated that this 
new initiative approaches the Roma as a population with large economic and social 
potential which can contribute to the development of society and is in compliance with the 
political framework of the EU for observing the principle of equal opportunities and non-
discrimination for all citizens.10 The programme coordinates the activities of all State bodies 
for Roma integration as part of the overall national policy aimed at increasing the standard 
of living and guaranteeing equal opportunities for all.11 
</p>
<p>19. The Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 was launched in Sofia in 2005 and 
requires participating States to prepare and implement National Action Plans. Bulgaria&#8217;s 
Action Plan was adopted in 2005 as a long-term strategy for action towards integration of 
Roma communities. Four priority areas &#8211; education, health, employment and improving 
housing conditions &#8211; are required for all States; Bulgaria has also added culture, protection 
against discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities as additional national priorities. 
</p>
<p>20. As part of the European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies put 
forward by the European Commission in April 2011, the European Union has called for 
member States to develop a meaningful National Roma Integration Strategy by the end of 
2011, focusing in particular on education, employment, health and housing. These plans 
emphasize the full involvement and consultation with Roma themselves, and the 
Government notes that a genuine process of large-scale Roma participation has taken place. 
The draft National Strategy incorporates all programmes developed by the Government 
with focus on the Roma and will replace the package of documents that currently exist in 
this area with the aim of achieving a more comprehensive approach in line with European 
Commission requirements. The National Strategy is supplemented by an action plan. 
</p>
<p>21. In July 2011, 17 Roma representatives were elected together with Government 
officials to the working group that prepared the Bulgarian Roma Strategy. Roma 
representatives emphasized the need for the strategy to be concrete, grounded in reality and 
to take into account local conditions and the views of local and regional stakeholders. Some 
expressed scepticism on the grounds that numerous similar schemes have failed to deliver 
results. 
</p>
<p>22. Despite the numerous Government plans and initiatives, Roma representatives and 
NGOs consistently stated that implementation is limited and sporadic at best and that 
</p>
<p>  
 9 See also Bulgaria&#8217;s National Programme for Prevention and Counteracting the Illegal Trafficking of 
</p>
<p>People and Protection of its Victims, adopted in 2010, which lists Roma women as a high-risk group. 
 10 A World Bank Report published in 2010 focused on the benefits of educating Roma so they can 
</p>
<p>secure work, estimating Bulgaria would be at least &#8364;526 million better off per annum (see footnote 8, 
p. 17).

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2

</p>
<p>resource allocation is inadequate to meet the expectations and stated objectives. Some 
analysis of funding directed towards Roma integration suggests that out of &#8364;1.4 billion 
available to Bulgaria between 2007 to 2013 under the European Social Fund, only one per 
cent has been earmarked for Roma integration projects and only &#8364;2.5 million for Roma 
education initiatives.12 The Government maintained that the financial resources allocated to 
Roma integration were significantly higher, but explained that it &#8220;does not allocate any 
specific amount to Roma integration initiatives, as its strategic approach acknowledges 
Roma integration as a horizontal priority which has to be mainstreamed in all priority areas 
of intervention &#8211; employment, education and training, social inclusion, etc. That is why, in 
order to register progress with regard to Roma integration, the operational programme 
contains a specific chapter describing the various measures in the individual sectors, the 
types of interventions and quantitative indicators, including also the targets, which have to 
be reached. This approach has been accepted as expedient and adequate by the European 
Commission which endorsed the operational programme.&#8221;13 
</p>
<p>23. Roma representatives highlighted the &#8220;myth&#8221; that vast resources are directed 
towards Roma programmes, a myth that helps to perpetuate negative attitudes towards 
Roma. Based on Ministry of Finance figures, journalists and Roma rights activists pointed 
out that the Government spent only approximately &#8364;0.47 per Roma per month during the 
first five years of the Roma Decade.14 Some expressed their perceptions that integration 
initiatives largely remain on paper and respond to requirements of external and donor 
audiences, rather than internal realities. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Education 
</b></p>
<p>24. Roma children consistently underperform in educational outcomes, compared to 
other children; they have high drop-out rates and high levels of illiteracy.15 De facto 
segregated Roma schools remain a significant barrier to improving the educational 
outcomes of Roma children. Article 29 (1) of the 2004 Protection against Discrimination 
Act requires the Minister of Education, Youth and Sciences and local Government bodies 
to take such measures as are necessary to exclude racial segregation in educational 
institutions. However, the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and the European Roma Rights 
Centre reported that between 44 to 70 per cent of Roma students attend residentially 
segregated schools, either in rural Roma settlements or in segregated inner-city ghettos.16 
Relative to mainstream Bulgarian schools, such segregated schools have poor infrastructure 
and facilities and provide a generally lower quality of education. 
</p>
<p>25. Many Roma start school without a proper grasp of Bulgarian since they commonly 
speak Romany or Turkish in their community interactions; this leaves them disadvantaged 
from the early years of education. The 2011 census data revealed that 85 per cent of Roma 
identified Roma as their mother tongue. One Roma person referred to a &#8220;lost generation&#8221; of 
those who failed in education partly due to a lack of facility with the Bulgarian language.

</p>
<p>Roma girls frequently drop out of school at a young age because of early marriage and the 
priority given to the education of boys. Consequently, they often have particularly poor 
educational outcomes at post-primary levels compared to boys and men in Roma 
communities. 
</p>
<p>26. Enrolment levels for Roma children are much lower than the average at all levels of 
education. According to the World Bank,17 at least four out of five working-age men in the 
majority population completed secondary education compared to less than one in five 
Roma men. Education levels among women are even lower. While at least seven out of ten 
women in the majority population completed secondary or tertiary education, no more than 
one in ten Roma women did. Education enrolment rates are improving, but remain far from 
encouraging. In 2010, among 15-18 year olds, only approximately half of Roma men and 
one third of Roma women were still enrolled in school (compared with nine out of ten in 
the majority population). 
</p>
<p>27. According to research quoted by the European Commissioner for Employment, 
Social Affairs and Inclusion, Bulgaria&#8217;s early school-leaving rate, which was 14.7 per cent 
in 2009, is close to the EU average, but is particularly high among Roma. The Open Society 
Institute put it at 43 per cent in 2008.18 The results of the 2011 census reveal that among 
those identifying as belonging to the Roma ethnic group, 23.2 per cent do not attend school, 
compared to 5.6 per cent of ethnic Bulgarians; 11.8 per cent of Roma are illiterate, 
compared to 0.5 per cent of ethnic Bulgarians.19 
</p>
<p>28. The Government pointed out to the independent expert that there has never been a 
policy of school segregation, de jure or de facto, of Roma children in the national education 
system, therefore the term &#8220;segregation&#8221; is inaccurate. Furthermore it considers assertions 
that infrastructure and facilities in predominantly Roma schools are inferior to be 
questionable. It asserted that poor school attendance by Roma children and high drop-out 
rates are due mainly to traditions and strong pressure from within the community. It 
considers that the role of parents is crucial and that change must come from within the 
Roma communities. 
</p>
<p>29. Article 9 (1) of the Public Education Act gives parents or guardians the right to 
choose the school that their child(ren) will attend. Previously, children were restricted to 
attending the school in their locality, which was an important driver for segregation in 
education. However, in practice, significant obstacles remain to achieving desegregation, 
including schools that defiantly refuse to register Roma children; lack of transport to 
schools outside Roma ghettos; resistance from Roma parents to send their children to mixed 
schools where they fear they will face discrimination or will not receive an education 
appropriate to their culture; and failure to enforce the desegregation policy or penalize 
municipal authorities that fail to meet commitments. 
</p>
<p>30. The Strategy for Educational Integration of Children and Pupils from Ethnic 
Minorities was approved in 2004 and updated in 2010 as part of reforms to the national 
educational system to improve the quality of education for all children. Council of 
Ministers Order No. 4 of 11 January 2005 established the Centre for Educational 
Integration of Children and Young People from the Minorities (COIDUEM) to support the 
implementation of the Government policy regarding the educational needs of minority 
children. Three main strategic objectives form the focus of the Centre&#8217;s activities: (1) 
ensuring equal access to quality education of children and young people from the ethnic

<p>minorities and their effective integration in normative documents and educational practice; 
(2) preservation and development of the cultural identity of children from ethnic minorities; 
and (3) creation of prerequisites for successful socialization of children and young people 
from ethnic minorities and a favourable social and psychological climate. 
</p>
<p>31. Under Bulgaria&#8217;s National Action Plan for Roma Inclusion (2005-2015), education 
is the first priority area addressed; the stated goal being to guarantee the right to equal 
access to quality education to children and pupils from the Roma minority. Among stated 
targets is the &#8220;desegregation of schools and kindergartens in the detached Roma quarters.&#8221; 
Activities projected over the period include &#8220;moving the children out of the Roma quarters 
and closing the segregated schools and kindergartens. The necessary transportation will be 
provided taking into consideration the parents&#8217; preferences; adequate integration and 
</p>
<p>inclusion of Roma children in a multi-ethnic environment.&#8221;20 
</p>
<p>32. Consultations with municipal authorities in Pazardzhik District revealed the 
institutional belief that a tipping point exists with regard to the number of Roma children in 
each classroom. One regional official noted that when the number rises above four or five, 
tensions arise and non-Roma parents begin to remove their children from school. 
Nevertheless, another school principal highlighted that his school was successfully 
achieving a 50-50 student body of Roma and non-Roma pupils, which indicates that 
institutional perceptions about tensions caused by Roma pupils may be overstated and 
potentially hampering integration efforts. It was noted that Roma parents are more likely to 
send their children to mixed schools with a higher percentage of Roma children. 
</p>
<p>33. Most children who attend special schools for those with learning difficulties and 
residential care institutions for orphans are Roma,21 although many reportedly have no 
learning impairment and have living parents. The percentage of Roma children in the 
children&#8217;s homes visited by researchers was 63 per cent.22 Some parents living in poverty 
reportedly abandon or give up their children to such institutions for either domestic or 
international adoption. If the mother cannot be found or parents do not visit a child for six 
months the child becomes eligible for adoption. In 2010, the Government adopted a 
national strategy, &#8220;Vision of Deinstitutionalization of Children in Bulgaria,&#8221; and an action 
plan which were seen as an important step towards improving the situation.23 Roma boys 
form the majority of those detained in juvenile detention facilities. Regulation No. 6 (2002) 
of the Minister of Education, Youth and Sciences explicitly forbids the enrolment of pupils 
with normal intellectual capabilities in establishments for children with disabilities and its 
implementation is monitored by the Commission for Protection against Discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>34. According to the World Bank, the vast majority of working-age Roma lack 
sufficient education to participate successfully in the labour market.24 Unemployment rates 
in Roma communities are disproportionately high. Those with jobs are frequently in low-
skilled, low-income labour sectors &#8211; the only means of making a living for many Roma

<p>who are commonly excluded from other labour markets. Contrary to stereotypes, many 
Roma do not receive public benefits to support their households, but instead may have two 
or three low-skilled, low-paid jobs. Some 56.2 per cent of Roma were unemployed in 2004, 
while in 2007, the figure was 48.3 per cent. The unemployment rate for ethnic Bulgarians 
was 12.1 per cent in 2004 and 7.6 per cent in 2007.25 The NGOs consulted estimate that in 
some communities, the number of those unemployed is significantly higher. 
</p>
<p>35. Men in Roma communities who work commonly find jobs in construction, manual 
work for municipalities and as security guards, reportedly often making less than their non-
Roma counterparts. Employed Roma men earn nearly one third less than men from the 
majority population. One NGO representative stated that of all the low-paid trash cleaners 
and street sweepers, nearly 95 per cent were Roma. According to the World Bank, high 
poverty levels among the Roma are &#8220;rooted in extraordinarily poor labour market 
outcomes. Few Roma have jobs, and even when they do, earnings are often low.&#8221;26 The 
Roma consider that little action has been taken to enforce domestic or international anti-
discrimination legislation with respect to employment. 
</p>
<p>36. A Roma woman explained to the independent expert that if someone looks white 
they can &#8220;pass as Bulgarian&#8221; and get a job in a hospital or cleaning for a private company, 
</p>
<p>but if they are visibly &#8220;gypsy&#8221; their options are limited to outdoor work for extremely low 
wages. A private-sector cleaning job pays twice as much as municipal cleaners. One Roma 
woman stated that she was the only Roma cleaner at a hospital in Sofia, because they did 
not know that she was Roma due to her light skin; she said that she would lose her job if it 
was known that she was Roma. According to World Bank statistics, only 22 per cent of 
Roma women are employed in Bulgaria.  
</p>
<p>37. The Government highlighted a number of projects and programmes implemented by 
the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy to help the unemployed and disadvantaged 
communities, including the Roma, to find employment and to provide them with training. 
In its 2010 Progress Report on the Decade of Roma Inclusion, the Government stated that 
5,767 persons were included in activities to raise the employability and skills of 
unemployed Roma and 17,958 persons were covered by measures to increase the 
competitiveness of Roma in the labour market. Employment was provided to 12,159 people 
through their involvement in various programmes. Under the national programme, 
&#8220;Activate the Inactive,&#8221; some BGN 325,000 were spent to provide employment to Roma. A 
further BGN 908,000 were allocated to another national programme, &#8220;From Social 
Assistance to Employment,&#8221; which does not target Roma specifically, but rather everyone 
who receives social assistance. 27 
</p>
<p>38. Under the Activate the Inactive programme, a labour mediator model was used. By 
the end of 2010, some 91 labour mediators of Roma origin were working at 69 local labour 
directorates. As a result, some 10,098 inactive persons reportedly registered as job seekers 
in the labour offices. The Government highlighted the additional activities of the 
Employment Agency, including running job fairs targeting Roma to facilitate their access to 
information and their employment chances. Job fairs were reportedly attended by 1,104 
Roma job seekers and 71 employers. Some 460 job vacancies were available and 411 
persons were subsequently employed. A 2010 initiative, &#8220;Take Your Life Into Your Own 
Hands,&#8221; with a budget of BGN 11 million, aims to reach long-term unemployed with little 
education as well as the unskilled and inactive.

</p>
<p>39. Roma representatives noted that such initiatives are inefficient and insufficient to 
adequately address the extent of the problem of Roma unemployment. They pointed out the 
impact of the economic crisis on the Roma as municipal budgets and manual jobs are cut; 
the credit crunch has also reduced the possibility for Roma to access small business loans. 
With economic stability and increasing foreign investments, labour markets turned to the 
Roma to expand work forces; however, unskilled, manual workers were the first to lose 
their jobs as the economy stalled.28 The construction sector accounts for the largest share of 
employed Roma, and this sector has reportedly shrunk by some 30 per cent since 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Health 
</b></p>
<p>40. Roma life expectancy rates are over 10 years less than the average.29 According to 
2001 census data, just 5.4 per cent of Roma were between 60 and 100 years of age, while 
the national average was 22.3 per cent. The highest peak of mortality among Roma occurs 
around age 40-49, with the main reasons reportedly being cardiac-vascular and cerebral-
vascular diseases. According to data by the National Statistics Institute for 2003, child 
mortality is 9.9/1000 among Bulgarians; 17/1000 among those of Turkish background, and 
28/1000 among the Roma. According to data by Fact Marketing (2004), 68 per cent of 
Roma households have a member suffering from a chronic disease; 58 per cent of Roma 
have no access to dental care; 55 per cent indicate that difficult access to physicians 
because of geographical distance is detrimental to their health; and 46 per cent of Roma 
have no health insurance.30 
</p>
<p>41. The number of mentally or physically disabled Roma is reportedly six times higher 
than the rest of the Bulgarian population. According to members of the NCCEII, health care 
reform revealed alarming tendencies in Roma health conditions, including the prevalence of 
infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. According to hospital data from 
Sliven, 60 per cent of tuberculosis patients were Roma.31  
</p>
<p>42. The persistent impact of poverty and sub-standard living conditions on health is 
evident. The NCCEII acknowledged that such &#8220;tendencies have been observed for more 
than a decade due to overwhelming poverty, poor nutrition, permanently poor living 
conditions and lack of proper sanitary conditions.&#8221;32 It includes in factors contributing to 
Roma health problems, bureaucracy of the medical system and direct or indirect 
discrimination; mass unemployment resulting in low levels of health insurance; low 
educational levels and awareness of health information and education; and medical 
practitioners working in Roma neighbourhoods who are not familiar with cultural 
differences and traditions of the Roma. 
</p>
<p>43. The Health Strategy for Disadvantaged Persons Belonging to Ethnic Minorities was 
adopted in September 2005. Its main objectives are overcoming negative tendencies in the 
health status of disadvantaged ethnic minorities; ensuring equal access to health care 
services; increasing health insurance of ethnic communities; and reducing infant and

<p>maternal mortality.33 Building on experiences in other European countries, the Health 
Mediators programme was established in 2001 to work particularly with the Roma. Health 
mediators act as a bridge between Roma communities and the health and social services. 
Largely supported and funded by NGOs since 2001, the health mediators model was 
adopted by the Government as part of its health strategy, with established indicators 
relating to the number of mediators employed. 
</p>
<p>44. The National Network of Health Mediators was founded in 2007. In 2008-2011, 105 
mediators were appointed in 57 municipalities through delegated budgets. Health mediators 
work with and in communities and build relationships which allow them to assess and 
respond to needs. They provide services, including accompanying Roma requiring medical 
services; providing information and assisting in contacts with general practitioners and 
health experts; assisting with communications with the Health Insurance Fund; child 
protection; providing health education and information for preventative care in such areas 
as family planning, reproductive health, vaccinations and the principles of hygiene. Health 
mediators play a role in the prevention of drug abuse, which is widespread in some Roma 
communities. 
</p>
<p>45. In the period 2004-2011, the Ministry of Health allocated financial resources, 
through grants from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to a 
network of NGOs based in Roma communities. They provide services for the prevention of 
HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in 10 regions, and tuberculosis care and 
support services in all 28 regions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>46. The poor living conditions in Roma &#8220;ghettos&#8221; is an issue of high priority for Roma 
organizations and communities. According to NGOs, including the Bulgarian Helsinki 
Committee, an estimated 50 to 70 per cent of Roma housing is considered illegal and 
therefore falls outside the Municipal Master Plans. As such they are ineligible for 
infrastructure services or improvements provided by local authorities. Consequently, they 
commonly have limited access to potable running water, lack sewage and sanitation works, 
paved streets, waste collection or street lights. Problems have been exacerbated by a steady 
inflow of Roma from poor rural areas to urban settlements, which has increased 
overcrowding and pressure on already inadequate service provision, and added significantly 
to the number of illegal dwellings. 
</p>
<p>47. Roma and NGO representatives described to the independent expert the physical and 
social barriers and isolation experienced in segregated communities which commonly have 
no public transport links. Non-Roma taxi drivers will frequently not enter Roma 
communities. The elderly, disabled or those with young children face particularly severe 
difficulties to leave the ghetto. The transportation difficulties have created profound 
problems, for example, for Roma children to attend mixed schools in non-Roma localities 
without the provision of regular, free bus services. 
</p>
<p>48. Fakulteta, a Roma neighbourhood on the outskirts of Sofia, has existed since the 
1930s. Most homes are illegal and built on municipal land without permits. A local Roma 
NGO noted that electricity was provided by private utility companies charging relatively 
high rates. The community has, on occasion, been left without electricity in mid-winter 
because of termination of service due to non-payment by some households, even though 
others regularly paid bills. Despite efforts by Roma organizations to lobby for the 
legalization of the settlement and its incorporation into the Municipal Master Plan, no 
</p>
<p>  
 33 A/HRC/WG.6/9/BGR/1, para. 170.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>progress has been made. Roma organizations assist Roma with legalizing their properties 
on an individual basis; however, the process is complex and costly, and homes must 
conform to building regulations which they rarely meet.  
</p>
<p>49. Roma believe that municipal authorities oppose legalization of ghettos because it 
would restrict the ability to evict communities occupying prime land close to city centres. 
While the Government and international donors continue to fund the construction of 
apartments for Roma in cities, including Sofia and Plovdiv, Roma representatives 
highlighted problems related to the remote geographical location of construction projects 
and stated that the communities&#8217; priorities and wishes were not taken into account in their 
planning and location. The independent expert was informed by Sofia municipal authorities 
that plans were in place to build a new borough with social housing for Roma and others, 
including many currently residing in Fakulteta. Some believe this is a step towards eviction.  
</p>
<p>50. The threat of eviction remains constant for those occupying illegal homes in 
Fakulteta and other Roma settlements, including Stolopinovo. Indeed, numerous evictions 
have taken place.34 On 8 September 2009, Bourgas municipal authorities forcibly evicted 
27 Romani households from the Gorno Ezerova community and demolished their homes. 
Some residents were allegedly beaten by the police.35 The community had reportedly been 
in existence for over 50 years, was recognized by public authorities and provided with some 
services and utilities. The community of Meden Rudnik, also in Bourgas, was also evicted 
on 25 September 2009.36  
</p>
<p>51. Bulgaria&#8217;s National Action Plan for Roma Inclusion includes, as a priority, housing 
for the Roma. A key stated activity is the implementation of programmes to improve Roma 
living conditions. Also highlighted is finding solutions to the land ownership and illegal 
construction issues in areas with high concentrations of Roma populations, based on the 
amendments in the respective legislation. An indicator of success for this programme is the 
number of legalized Roma houses which conform to the respective technical and legal 
standards. Roma representatives stated that little progress had been achieved to legalize 
Roma homes even where properties came close to meeting building regulations. 
</p>
<p>52. Infrastructure provision is also stated as an activity in the Action Plan, calling for the 
reconstruction and further building of existing technical and social infrastructure, and 
building of new infrastructure in areas inhabited by Roma. Roma representatives again 
highlighted the lack of significant progress in those areas deemed illegal. Roma leaders and 
Roma local officials voiced frustration at the Government&#8217;s failure to constructively 
</p>
<p>address the legal status and infrastructure problems of Roma neighbourhoods, including 
Stolipinovo and Fakulteta which have over 40,000 residents each, parts of which have 
existed for generations. They urged review of legislation, including the Territorial Planning 
Act, and flexible approaches to allow incorporation of settlements into the Municipal 
Master Plans. 
</p>
<p>53. The Government pointed out that problems relating to Roma housing have been 
aggravated by confusion regarding ownership and continuing illegal construction. It 
maintained that it was seeking sustainable solutions, including provision of municipal 
social housing. It emphasized that social housing and other alternatives could not be offered 
by municipal authorities to illegal inhabitants who have an address registration in other

</p>
<p> 36 The Government states that all evictions were carried out in full compliance with national legislation 
and following lengthy legal proceedings. </p>

</p>
<p>municipalities. To do so would contradict &#8220;the principle that no one shall profit from his/her 
illegal behaviour.&#8221; Regarding legalization of settlements, the Government stated that its 
efforts were not utilized by Roma, and a large part of the buildings occupied by Roma are 
under a &#8220;regime of tolerability&#8221; as long as they meet certain technical requirements. The 
</p>
<p>Bulgarian authorities stated that they were not aware of any cases of eviction of Roma from 
their own property. 
</p>
<p>54. The Government noted that a National Programme for Improving the Housing 
Conditions of Roma (2005&#8211;2015) was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 2006 
and is implemented according to action plans. The programme is aimed at improving living 
conditions by upgrading existing public technical and social infrastructure in Roma 
neighbourhoods and supporting new housing. The programme directly engages local 
communities and applies a partnership principle with various stakeholders &#8211; local and 
national administration, communities, civic and business organizations, etc.37 
</p>
<p>55. Opposition to Roma settlements and new social housing for Roma is publicly 
voiced, even by municipal authorities. Regarding proposals to use vacant land for housing 
for the Roma, one District Mayor in Sofia stated publicly that a waste disposal site or cows 
grazing on the land would be preferable and would constitute less of a problem than a 
gypsy neighbourhood in the district. The Mayor allegedly stated that the Roma were 
incompatible with the rest of the population. The Mayor was found guilty by Bulgaria&#8217;s 
Commission for Protection against Discrimination (CPD) of discrimination on the basis of 
racist speech and causing offence and humiliation.38 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Religious minorities in Bulgaria 
</b></p>
<p>56. During her visit to Sofia and the Kurdjali region, the independent expert met with 
numerous representatives of the Turkish Muslim minority, including Muftis and the Chair 
of the Supreme Muslim Council. Community representatives consistently emphasized the 
generally good and harmonious relations with the majority population, and significantly 
improved relations with the Government over recent years and since democratic reforms 
after 1989. There was general satisfaction with the extent to which Muslims could enjoy 
their religious freedoms and minority rights.  
</p>
<p>57. The Penal Code (art. 164) establishes penalties of up to three years imprisonment for 
&#8220;whoever propagates hatred on religious grounds through speeches, publication, activities 
or in any other way,&#8221; as well as punishment (art. 165) for &#8220;acts committed against groups or 
individuals or their property in connection with their religious affiliation, including taking 
part in a crowd for the purpose of attacking groups, individuals or their property.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>58. Nonetheless, the independent expert was informed of incidents of violence and 
damage targeted at the Muslim minority and its places of worship, and concerns were 
expressed regarding the activities of nationalist political parties. Perceptions exist that some 
political leaders are engaged in efforts to inflame tension among the communities. 
Religious leaders mentioned a list of 110 incidents, catalogued over 10 years, ranging from 
broken windows to arson attacks and physical assaults; however, few prosecutions have 
been brought. Those consulted felt that prejudice exists and may be increasing against 
ethnic Turks and Muslims in the wider society.

</b></p>

</p>
<p>59. In May 2011, nationalist protestors and supporters of the Ataka party staged a rally 
outside the Banya Bashi Mosque in Central Sofia to protest against the Muslim 
community&#8217;s use of loudspeakers for the call to prayers, and worshippers praying in public 
spaces outside the Mosque. Ataka leaders claimed that the protest was not anti-Muslim, 
however, slogans such as &#8220;Turks get out&#8221; were chanted. The rally turned violent and 
injuries were sustained by members of the Muslim community and some protesters. To 
date, a criminal investigation is at the pre-trial phase. Ataka has also led demands for the 
removal from national television of a 10-minute Turkish language news programme, and 
called for a referendum on the issue. Such actions are seen as blatantly anti-Turkish by that 
community. 
</p>
<p>60. Turkish Muslim leaders have sought permission to construct a second mosque in 
Sofia and applied for land for construction in order to resolve issues of lack of space; they 
reportedly have not received a response. Having eventually purchased land themselves, 
they reported that they were not granted a permit to construct a second mosque. They also 
requested land and permission to build an Islamic Education Centre to allow the formal 
study of Islam in Bulgaria, which was allegedly denied. While formal study of Islam is 
possible at the High Islamic Institute in Sofia, leaders noted that some people travel to 
Turkey or other Muslim countries to study, and subsequently fall under suspicion of 
&#8220;extremism.&#8221;  The Government stated that construction of a second mosque was suspended 
pending review of the status of the Studentski Grad district and that permission was not 
refused. 
</p>
<p>61. Some ethnic Turkish representatives expressed frustration that their children do not 
have the option to study in their mother tongue (i.e., Turkish as the language of instruction) 
and can only study Turkish as an elective. The Government highlighted that Turkish is 
taught as a selected subject for four hours a week up to Grade 8. Experts in Turkish are 
employed by regional Inspectorates in regions that have a high number of Turkish pupils.  
</p>
<p>62. Turkish Muslim representatives noted general satisfaction with their level of 
political representation and participation, particularly at the district level where they 
constitute a majority in some localities and there are several Turkish Mayors. The 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms is the largest party with a support base among ethnic 
Turks and has been part of a coalition government in previous administrations. There is 
currently one ethnic Turkish Minister (Culture). Nevertheless, some community and 
political representatives expressed concerns about central government oversight and 
inspection of Turkish-administered local authorities, stating that it appears excessive and 
inconsistent with the treatment of ethnic Bulgarian-administered authorities. 
</p>
<p>63. The independent expert met with Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses leaders who state that they 
number up to 4,000 in Bulgaria; they expressed general satisfaction with their religious 
freedoms. However, representatives also expressed concerns regarding incidents of violent 
attacks against worshipers, notably in Burgas in April 2011, when some 60 protesters, 
aligned with the VMRO nationalist political party, reportedly calling for Jehovah&#8217;s 
Witnesses to be banned from Bulgaria, and staged a protest at the Kingdom Hall. Five 
worshipers were injured in attacks by protesters. Representatives noted that, while they  
receive excellent police protection during their public events in other locations, on this 
occasion, police arrived late and were slow to respond to the violence.  
</p>
<p>64. Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses leaders have called for an investigation into the incident in 
Burgas and prosecution of perpetrators of violence and religious hatred. They expressed 
concern regarding the apparent rise in hostility, including acts of vandalism, disruption of 
worship, defamatory publicity against them in the media, and comments by some municipal 
mayors describing them as a &#8220;sect&#8221; and a threat to Bulgarian values. The Mayor of Varna 
has reportedly opposed the building of a Kingdom Hall in media statements, although 
leaders noted that in more than ten other localities they had established premises for 
Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses without problems. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2

</p>
<p>65. Representatives of the Jewish community welcomed the generally positive 
experience of the Jewish people with respect to religious and cultural rights and relations 
with the authorities. Nevertheless, they echoed the concerns of other religious minorities 
regarding a growing intolerance of different religious and ethnic minorities evident among 
some sectors of society, manifested in attacks on places of worship, cemeteries and 
individuals. They noted that anti-Semitic literature and propaganda, including allegedly by 
a leader of the Ataka political party, goes unchallenged by the authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recognition and rights of Macedonian and Pomak 
communities 
</b></p>
<p>66. Article 54 of the Bulgarian Constitution states that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to 
avail himself of the national and universal human cultural values and to develop his own 
culture in accordance with his ethnic self-identification, which shall be recognized and 
guaranteed by the law.&#8221; However, the Government denies the existence of an ethnic 
Macedonian minority, and does not recognize the Pomaks (considered as Bulgarian-
speaking Muslims by the Government) as a distinct minority &#8211; claiming that both groups 
are in fact ethnic Bulgarians. Representatives of those who self-identify as ethnic 
Macedonians and as Pomaks claim that their minority rights are consequently violated. 
</p>
<p>67. Ethnic Macedonians consider it of crucial importance that their ethnic identity and 
distinctiveness be officially recognized. Community representatives strongly dispute census 
findings reflecting very low and declining numbers of Macedonians,39 and claim that the 
true population is many times higher. The Macedonian language is not recognized or taught 
in schools and Macedonians are not represented on the National Council for Cooperation on 
Ethnic and Integration Issues. 
</p>
<p>68. Representatives of Pomak communities, many of whom live in the Rhodope 
Mountains region, described the historic lack of recognition of Pomaks as a distinct ethnic 
and religious minority. The history of the Pomaks is disputed, and different groups who 
identify as Pomak may also identify as being of Turkish origin. Representatives described 
historic attempts to assimilate them into Bulgarian society through the requirement to 
change their Turkish-Arabic names to Bulgarian names, and forced conversion to the 
Christian Eastern Orthodox Church. 
</p>
<p>69. While noting that excesses of former Governments had ceased, community 
representatives described a continuing climate of suspicion against them manifested in acts 
of discrimination and harassment, restriction on enjoyment of cultural life, detention of 
Imams and raids of houses or religious premises by State security services on the grounds 
of alleged links to religious extremism, which they reject as unfounded. 
</p>
<p>70. Religious and community leaders in the city of Blagoevgrad showed the independent 
expert anti-Muslim and anti-Turkish graffiti and swastikas painted on the walls of the city 
mosque despite the fact that Muslims in the region do not identify as Turkish nor do they  
speak Turkish. The Mufti complained that the graffiti was consistently replaced each time it 
was removed by the community. Leaders expressed concerns over the positions and 
statements of political parties, notably Ataka, that they consider to be fueling Islamophobic 
sentiments against them.

</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Government must be commended for the numerous laws, policies and 
programmes that have the objective of promoting anti-discrimination and equality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the rights of minorities, including the Roma. In meetings, including with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior and the National Council of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues, the Government consistently 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlighted its commitment to Roma inclusion with respect to education, employment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing and health care. It shared numerous policy documents outlining its 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> However, in key areas such as education, employment, health care and housing, 
the Roma remain at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder. They experience 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination and exclusion in all walks of life, which leaves them highly 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized and in persistent poverty. Current Government initiatives and financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments have little more than superficial impact and fail to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>entrenched discrimination, exclusion, and poverty faced by many Roma. There is 
</b></p>
<p><b>minimal evidence of a strong Government commitment to Roma equality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring such equality does not seem to be a high priority. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Government must match the EU- and NGO-inspired policies on Roma 
integration with Government-led implementation, concrete actions on the ground and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the financial resources necessary to improve the living conditions of the Roma. To 
</b></p>
<p><b>date, implementation remains largely absent or inadequate. Many policies seem to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>largely rhetorical undertakings aimed at external audiences. Notwithstanding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>evident effects of the current financial crisis on the wider Bulgarian economy, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>message sent is discouraging. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The small, inconsistent pilot-project-based approach that has characterized 
Government activities to date will never reach the transformative tipping point 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary to confront the vast socio-economic challenges faced by the Roma. A new, 
</b></p>
<p><b>holistic and incisive approach to Roma integration, designed and implemented in full 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with Roma organizations, is required to break the vicious circle of social 
</b></p>
<p><b>exclusion and poverty. Furthermore, Roma themselves must make efforts to engage 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully with Government initiatives, not as passive recipients, but as pro-active 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders in immediate and longer-term Roma integration strategies. It is essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>that Roma have a role in decision-making and are fully consulted in decisions that 
</b></p>
<p><b>affect them. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> Discussions with Ministries concerned revealed a shallow commitment with 
little strategic vision or focused attention, evidence-based programming, 
</b></p>
<p><b>benchmarking, monitoring or evaluation. There was clear resistance to the use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnicity-based disaggregated data and the notion of using special measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address long-standing inequalities faced by disadvantaged communities. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government is urged to systematically collect data disaggregated along ethnic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious as well as gender lines that would assist efforts to fully identify the challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>faced by the Roma and help shape necessary policy and programme responses 
</b></p>
<p><b>tailored to specific population groups. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The level of racial prejudice against Roma was evident in numerous 
interactions, including with Government officials. Journalists and NGOs also noted 
</b></p>
<p><b>the overwhelmingly negative media coverage and discriminatory stereotyping of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma by the media and in some political discourse. Comments, including from some 
</b></p>
<p><b>high-level Government officials, strongly indicated that their view of Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities is that they are predominately a problematic and criminal element in 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. As a priority, the Government should robustly enforce its anti-discrimination </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>and equality laws and ensure appropriate penalties are applied for acts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The efforts of many committed people working at the local-authorities level 
should be supported. Mayors, local councillors and experts, including those from 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority communities, need greater support, financial resources and commitment 
</b></p>
<p><b>from the national Government. In some instances, national legislation should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>reviewed and amended to facilitate their efforts to promote and protect the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities at the local level. Furthermore, where local authorities fail to meet their 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations or to implement national legislation or policies, particularly with regard to 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority rights, anti-discrimination and Roma integration, they should face effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctions. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The independent expert expressed concern that shortly after her visit, in 
September 2011, anti-Roma demonstrations took place in many major cities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including Sofia. Nearly 300 people were arrested after the two nights of rallies that 
</b></p>
<p><b>unfortunately involved what has been perceived as ethnic hatred. Some media 
</b></p>
<p><b>reported attempted pogroms on Roma quarters by far-right groups, and all-out 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence prevented only by mobilization of the riot police. The police should remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>highly vigilant in order to ensure the security of Roma neighbourhoods in light of 
</b></p>
<p><b>recent events.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Equal access to quality education 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> </b>The Government&#8217;s obligation to guarantee equal access to quality education <b>for 
Roma children remains overwhelmingly unfulfilled. Evidence suggests that Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>children attending mixed schools achieve significantly better educational outcomes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, the vast majority of Roma children remain in sub-standard de facto 
</b></p>
<p><b>segregated schools in Roma neighbourhoods. While current law and policy is that 
</b></p>
<p><b>students are free to attend any school preferred by their parents, this option is largely 
</b></p>
<p><b>illusory for Roma children who are locked in segregated residential areas, not 
</b></p>
<p><b>serviced by municipal transportation systems and whose parents fear racist treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their children in distant majority schools. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Ministr</b>y of Education&#8217;s Centr<b>e for Educational Integration of Children 
and Students of Ethnic Minorities serves as the primary funnel for international 
</b></p>
<p><b>funding. Some emphasis has been placed on pre-school education and some funds 
</b></p>
<p><b>have gone to municipalities to refurbish physically decrepit segregated Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>neighbourhood schools. While the Constitution, the National Education Act and a 
</b></p>
<p><b>strong Protection against Discrimination Act all make discrimination in education 
</b></p>
<p><b>unlawful, no court has ordered the Government to comply with its obligation to de-
</b></p>
<p><b>segregate schools. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Government should undertake research and collect data on the extent of 
segregation of Roma with regard to education, and use that data to set measurable 
</b></p>
<p><b>targets to evaluate its programmatic initiatives against actual results. The initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken to transport children daily to attend mixed schools outside Roma ghettos 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to provide school meals and support services have been implemented largely by a 
</b></p>
<p><b>small number of poorly resourced Roma NGOs. T</b>he lion&#8217;s share of <b>their funding 
</b></p>
<p><b>comes from international sources together with a small percentage of Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributions. NGOs bear much of the burden of implementing the desegregation 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies endorsed by the Government, but which it fails to fully lead or fund in 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Government must play a greater leadership role in school desegregation 
and intensify State-supported desegregation efforts. Existing policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be consistently and systematically implemented, and the results monitored </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>against clearly established targets for desegregation. Binding legislation should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed to ensure public and municipal authorities take action to meet targets for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma desegregation. Appropriate penalties should be imposed for non-compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>and local-level resistance to Roma integration. Outreach to Roma communities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>wider society should be an important element of a desegregation strategy so as to 
</b></p>
<p><b>build trust, confidence and understanding on the part of all communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Discrimination experienced by Roma seeking work in both the private and 
public sector is a reality and must be vigorously and publicly addressed. High levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unemployment, poor access to labour markets and low levels of skills and training 
</b></p>
<p><b>represent significant contributing factors to the cycle of social exclusion and poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b>experienced by many Roma. The majority of Roma who are employed, work in low-
</b></p>
<p><b>skilled, low-wage and low-status jobs. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Government should robustly enforce its anti-discrimination and equality 
laws with respect to discrimination in employment. Prosecutions should be brought 
</b></p>
<p><b>and appropriately harsh penalties imposed against private-sector employers or service 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers found to be discriminating against Roma or other minorities on the basis of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their ethnicity, religion or other grounds, as set out in law. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Low employment opportunities and expectations reduce incentives for Roma to 
achieve strong educational outcomes, and impact on their access to services and health 
</b></p>
<p><b>insurance, for example. Furthermore, </b>the Government&#8217;s <b>employment policies with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the Roma are predominantly geared towards initiatives in low-status 
</b></p>
<p><b>sectors. Employment initiatives should include activities to train and prepare Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>for recruitment into professional and skilled sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Government should lead by example by ensuring that public-sector offices, 
the civil service and State institutions, including the police and judiciary, fully reflect 
</b></p>
<p><b>the diversity in society, including the Roma. Robust anti-discrimination measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be complemented with time-bound and monitored affirmative action 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes to assist disadvantaged or excluded groups to overcome historic 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantage and gain public-sector employment, including through consideration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>such measures as training and recruitment initiatives in Roma communities, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recruitment quotas for Roma. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Housing 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The lives of many Roma are blighted by living conditions that frequently fall 
below standards that are adequate for individuals, families and communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communities remain de facto segregated and largely neglected, including in terms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts to improve infrastructure and the provision of services, water and sanitation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the general attention on the part of municipal authorities to the issues and 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns of the population. Poor housing conditions, lack of service provision and 
</b></p>
<p><b>segregation impact considerably on the life experiences and opportunities available to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Roma, as well as on their health and ability to integrate successfully into society. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Some communities live in a situation of legal limbo with regard to housing. 
Despite the fact that they have existed for decades and are home to many thousands, 
</b></p>
<p><b>some Roma communities have no prospect of resolving their illegal status; they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>left outside of Municipal Master Plans and face the prospect of eviction. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government remains intransigent to proposals to review the (il)legal status of Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlements. Review of the (il)legal status of Roma settlements and the initiation of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>process of legalization would constitute an important first step towards improving 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing and living conditions and should be considered. The moratorium on adverse </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>possession of public land, which has been extended twice, should be terminated so as 
</b></p>
<p><b>to allow Roma to legalize the houses built on public land and to become owners of 
</b></p>
<p><b>dwellings that they have inhabited for decades.</b>40<b> This would allow settlements to fall 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the Municipal Master Plans and policy frameworks for infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p><b>improvement and housing renewal. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Programmes should be initiated to engage, train and supply the necessary 
materials to unemployed and inactive Roma so as to enable them to undertake 
</b></p>
<p><b>renovation and renewal projects within their own communities in line with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>building code regulations. This would provide Roma with valuable skills and 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment opportunities, while also improving the built environment within Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities towards meeting criteria for legalization. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Muslim and other religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Muslim and other religious minorities, including representatives of the Jewish 
</b>minority and Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses emphasized their generally positive experiences 
</p>
<p><b>with regard to religious freedoms, cultural rights, relations with other communities,  
</b></p>
<p><b>national and local authorities and the police. Nevertheless the Government is urged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure on-going dialogue with representatives of religious minorities that would help 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure and maintain positive relations. This is particularly important since 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidence suggests an increase in incidents of violence, intimidation, vandalism of 
</b></p>
<p><b>places of worship and religious sites and hate speech. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The independent expert is concerned about testimony received regarding 
attacks on mosques and religious buildings; attempts to manipulate public sentiment 
</b></p>
<p><b>against minority religious and ethnic groups for political gain; the inhospitable 
</b></p>
<p><b>climate for the free expression of minority ethnic identities; and poor enforcement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>anti-discrimination and hate speech legislation. The inflammatory actions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comments of some nationalist politicians and political parties, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>organization of protests outside places of worship in 2011, have led to violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of religious minorities and are a particular cause for concern. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Independent Expert commends the Government and civil society leaders 
who immediately condemned the attack on the mosque in Sofia and the Kingdom Hall 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Burgas in 2011. However, despite the identification and arrest of individuals who 
</b></p>
<p><b>participated in violent attacks, few prosecutions have resulted and only small fines 
</b></p>
<p><b>applied to those convicted. Consequently the message that is understood is that such 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions are acceptable and tolerated in Bulgarian society. Political leaders and parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>that associate themselves with hate-motivated speech or acts of violence should have 
</b></p>
<p><b>no place in Government and their culpable members must be promptly prosecuted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recognition and rights of Macedonians and Pomaks 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> In accordance with its Constitutional provisions to respect the right to ethnic 
self-identification, the Government should ensure and protect this right, as well as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association of members of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Macedonian and Pomak minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> Policies relating to the recognition and rights of minority groups must be 
assessed in relation to </b>the State&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states </b>that &#8220;<b>in 
</b></p>
<p><b>those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging 
</b></p>

 40 One such case, as well as the legal situation in general, is described in the admissibility decision of 
</p>
<p>the ECHR in the case of <i>Yordanova and Others v. Bulgaria</i>, application no. 25446/06. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>or to use the</b>ir own language.&#8221; The question of the existence of minorities is addressed 
</p>
<p><b>by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 23 (1994) on the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities. Article 5.2 states that </b>&#8220;the existence of an ethnic, religious or linguistic 
</p>
<p><b>minority in a given State party does not depend upon a decision by that State party 
</b></p>
<p><b>but requires to be established by objective criteria.</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> With regard to identification with a particular racial or ethnic group, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has established in its general 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendation No. 8 (1990) </b>on article 1 of the Convention that &#8220;such identification 
</p>
<p><b>shall, if no justification exists to the contrary, be based upon self-identification by the 
</b></p>
<p>individual concerned.&#8221; The right of ind<b>ividuals to freely identify as belonging to an 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic, religious or linguistic group is therefore established in international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Domestic law should recognize such rights and ensure that no individual or group 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffers from any disadvantage or discriminatory treatment on the basis of their freely 
</b></p>
<p><b>chosen identity as belonging (or not) to an ethnic, religious, linguistic or any other 
</b></p>
<p><b>group. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Bulgaria should comply fully with the judgements of the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR) relating to persons belonging to such communities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement its rulings without further delay. Associations should be allowed to register 
</b></p>
<p><b>and function without impediment, use their chosen names and express their ethnic 
</b></p>
<p><b>identities freely. Associations that have been denied in the past should promptly be 
</b></p>
<p><b>given official registration. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Linguistic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> T</b>he Government&#8217;s position not to allow the use of mother<b> tongue languages as 
the language of instruction in schools, particularly in regions where minorities are a 
</b></p>
<p><b>majority or constitute a large percentage of the population, is a concern for minorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the Roma, Turkish Muslims and Macedonians. Bilingual education 
</b></p>
<p><b>commencing in the early years of schooling would enable children to become 
</b></p>
<p><b>proficient in their mother tongue as well as in Bulgarian. Furthermore, it would 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable them to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity and help minority pupils 
</b></p>
<p><b>to achieve positive educational outcomes. The Government is urged to consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>introducing bilingual education and to ratify the European Charter for Regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minority Languages. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National Human Rights Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The independent expert commends the establishment of the Commission for 
Protection against Discrimination and the Ombudsman. The resources available to 
</b></p>
<p><b>these essential institutions, that play an important role in the protection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of the rights of minorities, should be increased and their capacities 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthened to enable them to fulfil their potential to promote equality and minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. Both institutions should endeavour to strengthen the representation of Roma

<p><b>within their institutional structures and establish strong channels of communication

<p><b>with Roma organizations and communities.
