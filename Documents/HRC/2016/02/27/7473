<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the fifth periodic report on the human rights situation in Yemen 
submitted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 18/19, 21/22 and 24/32. It 
provides an updated assessment of the overall human rights situation in Yemen from 1 July 
2013 to 30 June 2014, particularly against the backdrop of the recommendations contained 
in previous High Commissioner&#8217;s reports and Council resolutions 18/19 and 21/22. The 
information contained in this report is based primarily on human rights monitoring carried 
out by the OHCHR office in Yemen (OHCHR&#8211;Yemen). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>2. Yemen is party to eight of the nine core international human rights treaties, as well 
as to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
communications procedure. On 11 June 2013, the Cabinet approved the ratification of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
and endorsed the accession of Yemen to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court. However, the Parliament has yet to approve the ratification of those conventions as 
well as the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. In April 2014, the Cabinet approved the ratification of the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime.  
</p>
<p>3. Yemen is party to all four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, as well as to 
Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the Convention on 
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be 
Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, and it is also bound 
by the customary rules of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>4. As a State party to the above-mentioned treaties, Yemen is legally bound to respect, 
protect and fulfil the human rights of those within its jurisdiction. During the reporting 
period, in reviewing the implementation by Yemen of its treaty obligations, the relevant 
human rights treaty bodies have noted that violations of civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights persist on a considerable scale. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Political developments 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Gulf Cooperation Council and the Agreement on the implementation 
mechanism for the transition period in accordance with the initiative of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (Transition Agreement) signed on 23 November 2011, brought an end 
to the 2011 popular uprising and brokered a political settlement in Yemen. The Transition 
Agreement envisaged a two-phase transition. The first phase included early presidential 
elections, which took place on 21 February 2012 and saw the election of President Abd 
Rabu Mansur Hadi. The second phase commenced with the broad National Dialogue 
Conference, which concluded on 25 January 2014. The remaining key milestones expected 
to bring the transition period to its closure include the constitutional drafting process, a 
constitutional referendum, parliamentary and local council elections, as well as presidential 
elections.  </p>


<p>6. Five-hundred and sixty-five participants took part in the National Dialogue 
Conference representing a wide spectrum of constituencies including women, youth, and 
civil society. Also participating were some factions of the Southern movement, and 
representatives of the Al Houthi movement. This dialogue process was supported and 
facilitated by the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen. The Conference 
provided a forum for a wide range of political negotiations, social concerns, rule of law and 
human rights. It divided into nine working groups, each addressing a thematic area such as 
the Southern question, the Sa&#8217;ada question, rights and freedoms, good governance, 
transitional justice, and State-building among others. Constructive discussions aimed at 
building consensus around proposed solutions resulted in a series of agreed principles to 
form the basis of the new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>7. Transitional justice was one of the most contentious issues, specifically the question 
of immunity and political isolation of those obstructing change. Through negotiations and a 
framework to reach consensus, as well the intervention of the President, an agreement was 
reached to adopt a more forward-looking approach. That included setting forth strict criteria 
for holding office.  
</p>
<p>8. The National Dialogue Conference concluded on 25 January 2014 with the adoption 
of the outcomes of the nine working groups, totalling some 1,800 recommendations. At its 
conclusion, the Conference also adopted a so-called &#8220;guarantee document&#8221;, which 
established that the political transition be linked to the completion of tasks originally 
outlined in the Transition Agreement, including the drafting and adoption of a new 
Constitution and general elections. The &#8220;guarantee document&#8221; also extended the deadlines 
originally envisioned in the Transition Agreement for at least one more year. Furthermore, 
the mandate of President Hadi was extended until the election of a new President. 
</p>
<p>9. On the proposed federal restructuring of the State, the National Dialogue Conference 
recommended the establishment of a committee tasked with determining the number and 
geographic delineation of regions. President Hadi established this committee on 3 February 
2014, after the Conference had ended. At the end of February, the committee announced 
that an agreement had been reached on the new federal division of the State: two regions in 
the south and four in the north. Some key leaders from the south rejected the proposal, 
while the conflict escalated in the north and the Houthis continued to express their fear that 
the federalization as proposed would only divide the country between rich and poor 
regions.  
</p>
<p>10. On 8 March 2014, Presidential Decrees Nos. 26/2014 and 27/2014 established the 
Constitutional Drafting Commission and named its 17 members, including four women. 
According to the Decrees, the drafting of the Constitution would be followed by public 
consultations and a referendum within one year.  
</p>
<p>11. On 24 April 2014, Presidential Decrees Nos. 30/2014 and 31/2014 established the 
National Body for Monitoring the Implementation of the NDC Outcomes, defining its 
mandate and procedures, and named its 82 members. All constituencies that participated in 
the National Dialogue Conference are represented in the National Body.1 The National 
Body is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Conference outcomes, as well as 
ensuring that the draft Constitution is in conformity with those outcomes. The National 
Body has yet to convene, as a new group of leading Hirak representatives, who had not 
participated in the Conference, are expected to join. However, at the time of writing the 
present report, it had not yet met.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The National Body includes, inter alia, 23 women, youth, and representatives of political parties from 
</p>
<p>the Southern movement and the north. </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 26 February 2014, the Security Council adopted resolution 2140 (2014) 
reaffirming the need for full and timely implementation of the political transition following 
the National Dialogue Conference. The resolution encourages all constituencies to continue 
their engagement in the political transition to implement the recommendations of the 
Conference. In addition, it calls upon the Hirak Southern movement, the Houthi movement 
and others to partake constructively in the process and to reject the use of violence to 
achieve political aims. The resolution also introduced targeted sanctions measures against 
individuals or entities engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the peace, 
security or stability of Yemen. More specifically, the resolution established a panel of 
experts to investigate those who engaged in or provided support for acts that threaten the 
peace, security or stability of Yemen, including committing acts that violate applicable 
international human rights law or international humanitarian law or acts that constitute 
human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>13. Fighting in the north, between Houthi supporters and pro-Islah/Salafist armed 
groups, resulted in hundreds of civilians killed and thousands displaced. Confrontations 
started in October 2013, when the Houthis established armed checkpoints all around 
Dammaj in the northern Sa&#8217;ada Governorate and accused Salafist groups of recruiting 
foreign fighters to attack the Houthis. On 30 October 2013, Houthi armed groups shelled 
Dammaj, killing at least 20 persons and injuring 100. While the Houthis besieged Dammaj, 
pro-Islah/Salafist armed tribesmen tried to open different battlefronts in Amran and Al Jawf 
Governorates. Tribesmen in Arhab, north of Sana&#8217;a, blocked the roads leading to Sa&#8217;ada 
preventing the entrance of goods and services toward Houthi groups into Sa&#8217;ada. Clashes 
between Houthis and northern tribesmen in northern governorates continued until 
12 January 2014 when the two conflicting sides signed a ceasefire agreement, brokered by a 
presidential delegation.  
</p>
<p>14. Despite the ceasefire agreement, there has been intermittent fighting between the 
Houthis and pro-Islah/Salafist armed groups. On 20 May 2014, the fighting renewed in 
Amran Governorate and reached the outskirts of the capital Sana&#8217;a. This time, the 
tribesmen fighting against the Houthis were reportedly backed by the &#8220;310th Military 
Brigade&#8221; and left dozens dead and injured. There has been a patchwork of ceasefire 
agreements over the past months throughout the north, many of which have not held for any 
length of time. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported 
that, between October 2013 and May 2014, an estimated 20,000 people had been displaced 
in the conflict in Amran Governorate. The conflict also caused destruction of private and 
public properties.  
</p>
<p>15. In April 2014, the Yemeni Armed Forces launched a military operation in the south 
aiming at reclaiming the Governorates of Abyan and Shabwa from the control of Al-Qaida 
in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). In early May 2014, President Hadi noted that the country 
was in an &#8220;open war&#8221; with AQAP, and that the military operation would expand to track all 
Al-Qaida members in Yemen. On 23 May, AQAP raided government buildings in Seiyun 
and Hadramout. The raid resulted in the killing of at least 27 individuals including 
12 government troops and 11 attackers. The Government regained control of the cities on 
24 May 2014.  
</p>
<p>16. The United States of America supported the military operation in the south of 
Yemen by using drone strikes that, according to local non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), killed some 55 AQAP militants in Abyan and Shabwa Governorates. According to 
the same sources, the United States-supported drone operations intensified during the 
reporting period, with a total of 26 reported strikes, bringing the total death toll to at least </p>


<p>94 people killed in Abyan, Al-Jawf, Hadramout, Mareb, Sana&#8217;a and Shabwah 
Governorates. On 15 December 2013, the Parliament adopted a declaration calling for an 
end to the use of drones. Lack of transparency surrounding the use of armed drones for 
targeted killings in Yemen continued, creating an accountability vacuum, in which victims 
were unable to seek redress. 
</p>
<p>17. Attacks against oil and infrastructure escalated in the wake of the Government&#8217;s 
military operation against AQAP. The main oil export pipeline was frequently attacked 
resulting in long electricity cuts in the capital. The attacks led to increases in diesel prices 
by as much as 200 per cent in unregulated markets. Extreme price volatility resulted in 
increased food prices by as much as 30 per cent, decreased access to already scarce water 
resources (pumped by generators), and a doubling of transportation costs. As a result, 
health care and other basic services were even more difficult to access.2 On 11 June 2014, 
President Hadi replaced several ministers as a step to solve the power cuts and fuel crisis.3 
</p>
<p>18. During the reporting period, killings and kidnappings of government and high-
ranking military officials, foreigners and other individuals were recorded. On 22 November 
2013, Abdulkareem Jadban, Al Houthi Member of Parliament, was assassinated in Sana&#8217;a, 
while on 21 January 2014, one of the most prominent Houthi leaders, Ahmed Sharaf el-Din, 
was assassinated on his way to the National Dialogue Conference on the day of the final 
plenary session. On 19 January 2014, unknown assailants reportedly killed a diplomat from 
the Islamic Republic of Iran in Sana&#8217;a and on 6 October 2013, an international staff 
member of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) was kidnapped on the way to 
Sana&#8217;a airport and remains in captivity. Although unconfirmed, several sources reported 
that on 9 May 2014, the Minister of Defence and two senior security officers survived an 
ambush while travelling from Abyan to Shabwa Governorate.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>19. One of the poorest countries in the Arab world, Yemen has witnessed a decline in 
humanitarian conditions following the sociopolitical unrest that erupted in 2011. According 
to OCHA, during 2014 14.7 million people &#8212; about 60 per cent of the population &#8212; will 
require some form of humanitarian assistance. About 10.5 million people are food insecure, 
4.5 million of them severely and an estimated 1,080,000 children under 5 years suffer from 
acute malnutrition. Over half the total population, 13.1 million people, have no access to 
improved water sources or to adequate sanitation facilities. About 8.6 million people have 
insufficient access to health services. This scale of humanitarian needs makes the country 
one of the largest global humanitarian emergencies.

 According to Decree No. 95/2014, the following ministers were changed: Minister for 
</p>
<p>Communications and Information Technology; Minister of Electricity; Minister for Media; Minister 
for Oil and Minerals; Minister of Finance; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </p>

<p><b> III. Situation of human rights and implementation of 
recommendations of OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Accountability and transitional justice 
</b>20. Delays in addressing the issue of accountability continued to hamper progress in 
redress for serious human rights violations committed in 2011. During the reporting period, 
there were persistent demands to bring perpetrators from all sides to justice and to provide 
redress for victims and their families. Concerns over the credibility of judicial 
investigations into human rights violations, committed in the wake of the unrest in 2011, 
have been highlighted in the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous reports.4 The High 
Commissioner recommended that the Government of Yemen launch transparent and 
independent investigations, compliant with international standards, into any allegations of 
serious human rights violations committed by government security forces during the events 
of 2011.5 In September 2012, a presidential decree was passed establishing a commission to 
investigate allegations of human rights violations that occurred in 2011. However, no 
commissioners had been appointed as of 1 July 2014.  
</p>
<p>21. Little progress was recorded with regard to the draft Law on Transitional Justice and 
National Reconciliation. As mentioned in the previous report, President Hadi submitted a 
draft transitional justice law to the Parliament in January 2013. In April 2014, the Ministry 
of Legal Affairs recalled the draft and revised it in order to align it with the outcomes of the 
National Dialogue Conference. In cooperation with the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), in May 2014 OHCHR organized a national consultation involving 
approximately 300 participants to discuss the revised version of the law. Based on the 
consultation, concrete recommendations were provided to the Ministry, which, in May 
2014, submitted the new draft to the Cabinet for further consideration.  
</p>
<p>22. The Commission to Consider and Address Land Issues and the Commission on 
Forcibly Dismissed Employees for southern Yemen were established in January 2013 as 
confidence-building measures to address the root causes of southern grievances. The Land 
Commission, consisting of five judges, started its work on 10 March 2013 and has 
established seven field offices across south Yemen. It has so far received more than 
100,000 claims from individuals maintaining that their lands were illegally confiscated by 
the northern Government following the 1994 war. At the time of reporting none of the 
claims filed with the Land Commission had been resolved. The Dismissals Commission, 
which consists of five judges and four military officers, started its work on 13 March 2013 
and until May 2014, had received approximately 93,000 applications.6  
</p>
<p>23. Both the Land and the Dismissals Commissions suffer chronic challenges relating to 
insufficient staffing, inadequate resources and weak administrative and management 
structures. The establishment of the two Commissions, and the amount of cases received, 
saw increased demand for reparations and compensation by the claimants. On the basis of 
the cases received, the two Commissions made recommendations to the President. These 
were adopted, but they have not been implemented.

 According to information received from the Commission, 56,789 claims were received from former 
</p>
<p>military personnel, 28,000 from former civil employees and 18,000 from the security sector. </p>


<p><b> B. Extrajudicial killings 
</b>24. In December 2013, in south Yemen, the thirty-third brigade of the Yemeni Armed 
Forces mounted a military operation against different targets in Al Dhale&#8217;a Governorate. A 
major incident occurred on 27 December 2013, when the brigade carried out a strike on the 
funeral procession of an alleged member of the southern separatist movement Al Hirak in 
the city of Sanah. The attack resulted in 21 civilians killed, including four children, and 
approximately 30 injured.  
25. On 28 December 2013, President Hadi set up an investigation commission, 
composed of security and military officials, to investigate the events in Al Dhale&#8217;a and to 
report to the Supreme Security Council. On 29 December 2013, the commission was 
deployed to the incident&#8217;s location. At the time of reporting, the commission had not made 
any of its findings public. 
</p>
<p>26. On 16 January 2014, indiscriminate attacks and shelling by government forces 
against civilian targets resumed in many parts of Al Dhale&#8217;a, including Al Dhale&#8217;a city, 
Al Houd, Al Kabar, Al Jaleelah and Al Wa&#8217;erah. The operation resulted in 10 civilians 
killed, including two children, and 20 civilians injured. According to the information 
available, shelling began when armed men affiliated with Al Hirak attacked a checkpoint 
manned by the thirty-third brigade and crossfire between the two groups led to a number of 
casualties.  
</p>
<p>27. According to local NGOs, between December 2013 and February 2014, at least 
43 individuals were killed, including eight children, and 70 civilians were injured as part of 
the military operations in Al Dhale&#8217;a. At the time of reporting, no report from the 
investigation commission had been issued and no individuals connected to the incidents had 
been prosecuted. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>28. Yemen has not ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. National 
legislation in Yemen imposes death penalty sentences for a very wide range of offences,7 
including for financial crimes, blasphemy, offences committed under Hodoud (religiously 
ordained crimes) and Qisas (death in retribution), drug-related offences as well as crimes 
that appear to have a political dimension. The Penal Law maintains death by stoning for 
extramarital heterosexual and homosexual intercourse.8 The Law also prescribes death by 
stoning for extramarital heterosexual and consensual adult homosexual conduct. 
</p>
<p>29. Yemen has not established a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and it 
continues to impose capital punishment. According to official figures provided by the 
General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, between 1 July 2013 and April 2014, authorities executed 
15 adults. At the time of writing the present report, there were 52 persons on death row 
believed to have been under 18 years of age when they committed offences. UNICEF 
submitted the list of 52 death row prisoners to the Office of the President of Yemen with a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 A total of 315 types of offence are punishable by the death penalty. In Yemen the death penalty is 
</p>
<p>provided for in four main laws: the 1994 Penal Law, the 1998 Law on combating kidnappings, the 
1998 military Penal Code; and the 1993 Law on combating trafficking and illicit use of drugs and 
psychotropic substances. The draft Law on combating human trafficking proposes to introduce a new 
sentence punishable by death. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 In accordance with international human rights jurisprudence, these crimes do not meet the threshold 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; and must not be punishable by death (A/HRC/27/23, paras. 28&#8211;39). </p>


<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>request to suspend all executions in those cases. The Office instructed the relevant bodies to 
suspend all executions and also asked the Supreme Court to form a committee to review 
those cases and to make recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. While the Penal Law prohibits the death penalty for minors, courts still sentence to 
death minors or adults who committed crimes while under 18 years old. The practice is 
attributed, among other factors, to the difficulty in determining the age of offenders in the 
absence of birth certificates. 
</p>
<p>31. The death penalty was addressed during the National Dialogue Conference: the 
Working Group on Rights and Freedoms recommended that: &#8220;No laws shall authorize the 
imposition of the death penalty, with the exception of the offences under the categories of 
Hodoud (religiously ordained crimes) and Qisas (death in retribution).&#8221; This 
recommendation will be taken into consideration by the Constitution Drafting Commission 
when amending the relevant laws.9  
</p>
<p><b> D. Enforced disappearances, fair trial and prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>32. Despite Cabinet decision No. 180 (2012) to release all those detained in relation to 
their participation in the 2011 events, 16 individuals have remained in custody.10 At the 
time of drafting the present report, the detainees&#8217; families did not have any information on 
the whereabouts of their relatives.  
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the case of the Presidential Mosque bombing,11 in which several 
people including former President Saleh, were injured or died, President Hadi issued a 
decree on 4 June 2013 to release 19 of the 22 detainees held in connection with the case. 
The Attorney General decided to release 17 of them, who were freed on 6 June 2013, and 
undertook to speedily conclude the investigation of the remaining five detainees. In January 
2014, the five detainees started a hunger strike protesting against the length of their 
detention without trial. OHCHR visited the five detainees in the Central Prison of Sana&#8217;a on 
5 January 2014. They affirmed that the last court session on their case had been held on 
5 March 2013, when the chief of the Criminal Specialized Court referred the case to the 
Supreme Judiciary Council and assigned a new judge to the case. 
</p><p>34. In April 2014, OHCHR visited the Al Dhale&#8217;a Central Prison, where it received 
14 complaints from detainees whose trial had been overdue since November 2013. The 
prison management stated that the cases had not been processed owing to various security 
challenges and the fact that judges had gone on strike.  
35. During the reporting period, OHCHR received complaints regarding arbitrary 
detentions by the National Security Office and the Political Security Office. OHCHR also 
received several reports of detention by the National Security Office of nationals of Yemen 
returning from Saudi Arabia upon their arrival at Sana&#8217;a airport. 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR conducted several visits to prisons12 and found that conditions remained 
very poor, particularly with regard to hygiene and sanitation facilities. Detainees, most of

 During its 2013 review, Yemen accepted the universal periodic review recommendation on a review

<p>of its death penalty legislation, to bring it into compliance with the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, particularly to ensure that the death penalty did not apply to minors. The review 
also recommended reducing the number of crimes that are punishable by the death penalty, excluding 
the death penalty for crimes concerning drugs (A/HRC/WG.6/18/L.6, paras. 115.54&#8211;55).

<p><b> E. Rights to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association  
</b></p>
<p>37. The situation of media freedoms and the safety and security of journalists 
deteriorated during the reporting period. OHCHR interviewed and documented cases of 
journalists as well as media who had been subjected to threats and physical attacks by 
security forces and unknown armed men. On 11 June 2014, the Presidential Guard stormed 
the offices of the satellite TV channel <i>Yemen Today</i> stopping its broadcast and confiscating 
equipment. On the same day, the <i>Yemen Today</i> newspaper was also closed by the 
Presidential Guard. As reported in the media, the Presidential Guard did not present any 
written orders from the Public Prosecution.  
</p>
<p>38. According to local sources, more than 197 cases of violations against journalists 
were reported. These included threats, physical attacks and attempted assassinations. For 
instance, on 28 November 2013, the Chief Editor of <i>Masa Press</i> survived an assassination 
attempt. According to local NGOs, 62 court cases were brought against individual 
journalists on different charges. As widely reported in the press, some international 
correspondents were denied entry or expelled from Yemen.14 
</p>
<p>39. The draft Law on Press and Publications15 was reviewed by the Parliamentary Media 
Committee, which submitted its comments to the Parliament in September 2013. No further 
development on the draft law has been recorded. A draft Media Law, prepared by an expert 
committee, was submitted to the Parliament on 2 July 2013. The Parliamentary Media 
Committee submitted its comments in February 2014. Members of Parliament suggested 
that the draft should include press, publication, audiovisual and electronic media.  
</p>
<p>40. Peaceful demonstrations and sit-ins by various groups continued to take place 
throughout Yemen. In southern Yemen, some demonstrations have been repressed with 
force by Government security forces. According to local NGOs, on 21 February 2014, one 
person was killed during demonstrations in Aden, while another 20 were injured as anti-riot 
forces attempted to disperse the protesters. In this context, during a protest in Al Mukallah 
city, one person was killed by Government forces. At the same event, national authorities 
reportedly detained seven protesters. The protests were organized by the pro-separatist 
southern movement Al Hirak to express dissatisfaction with the National Dialogue 
Conference outcomes and to mark the events that had left 10 people dead on 21 February 
2013 during a pro-south demonstration in Aden.16

<p>Council from the executive power, was amended moving some of the competencies 
traditionally under the Minister of Justice to the Supreme Judicial Council.17  
</p>
<p>42. On 28 March 2014, a nationwide strike of judges was initiated. Judges continue to 
lament poor working conditions and fear for their personal safety. The strike was triggered 
by the kidnapping on 26 March 2014 of a judge inside the court premises in Hajjah 
Governorate. The strike ended on 27 May 2014 following an agreement between the 
Supreme Judicial Council and the Judges&#8217; Club to undertake comprehensive reforms in the 
judicial system. The Club recorded a total of 63 attacks against judges during 2013, and 
58 attacks in the first quarter of 2014, including death threats, armed attacks inside 
courtrooms, kidnappings and physical and verbal harassment. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Children&#8217;s rights  
</b></p>
<p>43. The National Dialogue Conference Outcome Document introduced important 
recommendations on children&#8217;s rights and proposed guidelines and standards to be adopted 
in the new Constitution. Those included establishing adulthood at 18 years and setting the 
minimum age for marriage at 18 years. The Outcome Document called for the prohibition 
of recruitment and use of children in military groups. It also highlighted other child rights 
issues including their right to education, the rights of disabled children, the prohibition of 
the juvenile death penalty, the prohibition and criminalization of female genital mutilation, 
stressing the best interests of the child in all actions and decisions relating to children. 
Following the adoption of the Outcome Document, a draft Child Rights Law was prepared 
by a committee chaired by the Ministry of Legal Affairs and presented on 14 May 2014 to 
the Cabinet for approval. 
</p>
<p>44. On 14 May 2014, the Government of Yemen signed an Action Plan to end and 
prevent the recruitment and use of children by the Yemeni Armed Forces.18 The Action 
Plan set out concrete steps to release all children recruited by government security forces, 
reintegrate them into their communities and prevent further recruitment. Currently, follow-
up mechanisms are being established as defined in the provisions of the Action Plan. These 
include a Joint Technical Committee composed of relevant ministries, the Higher Council 
for Motherhood and Childhood and the civil registration authorities, together with United 
Nations representatives. The main objective of the Committee is to facilitate the 
implementation and monitoring of the Action Plan. Military and civilian focal points have 
been appointed to supervise the Committee. Additionally, an interministerial task force for 
children will be set up to address core issues around children and armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>45. Despite some progress made, children continue to be recruited by various armed 
forces and armed groups. Four parties in Yemen, particularly Al Houthi/Ansar Allah, pro-
Government militias, Government forces and Ansar al-Sharia have reportedly been 
recruiting children.19 According to UNICEF, during the reporting period, 122 boys were

<p>17
 According to the new amendments, the following authorities were transferred from the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice to the Supreme Judicial Council: nomination of Supreme Court judges; appointment and 
transfer of judges; control over the Judicial Inspection Body. In addition, the Minister of Justice no 
longer retains the right to send warnings to judges.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 The Action Plan was signed by the co-chairs of the United Nations country task force on monitoring 
</p>
<p>and reporting grave violations of children&#8217;s rights in situations of armed conflict, the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator in Yemen and the UNICEF Representative; and on part of the Government, the 
Minister of Defence, Chief of General Staff, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Ali Al-Ashwal. The signing was 
witnessed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict 
and the Prime Minister of Yemen. 
</p>

<p>reported as recruited and used by armed forces, which represented an increase of 15 per 
cent from the previous reporting period.  
</p>
<p>46. Children continued to be victims of killing and maiming due to the conflicts in the 
north and the south of the country. According to UNICEF, there was a 29 per cent increase 
in children affected by armed conflicts, with a total 229 children (190 boys, 39 girls) killed 
and 188 maimed. A significant increase in child casualties was recorded in Al Dhale&#8217;a 
Governorate due to armed clashes and attacks by Yemeni Armed Forces.  
</p>
<p>47. Throughout 2013, over 560 unaccompanied children from Yemen were caught at the 
borders crossing illegally into or being returned from Saudi Arabia or were stranded in 
Haradh while attempting to reach Saudi Arabia.20 In addition, many children escaped the 
famine and drought in the Horn of Africa and undertook the hazardous journey with the 
help of smugglers across the Gulf of Aden to reach the shores of Yemen. According to 
UNICEF, out of 271 unaccompanied children from Ethiopia assisted in Haradh, the vast 
majority ended up in the hands of traffickers and experienced terrible ordeals. A significant 
number of them, mostly boys between 13 and 15 years of age, were detained in adult 
prisons because they did not possess any identification confirming their age.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>48. At the National Dialogue Conference, among the participants of which 30 per cent 
were women, the Working Group on Rights and Freedoms recommended that the principle 
of equality be at the core of the Constitution. Other recommendations set the minimum age 
of marriage at 18 years, addressed violence against women and set a 30 per cent quota for 
women&#8217;s participation in public service as well as in State-elected bodies. Following the 
finalization of the Conference, four women were elected on the Constitutional Drafting 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>49. As a result of conflict and displacement, gender-based violence was increasingly 
reported. This particularly affected internally displaced persons, migrants and other 
communities touched by conflict. Sexual violence, domestic violence and cases of early 
marriage were also recorded by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).21 Despite 
the informal reports, survivors often did not report the violence committed against them, 
fearing retribution from the assailants. Women were often denied access to services due to 
traditional practices, such as that male spouses or relatives should provide authorization for 
women to seek health care and/or other forms of aid. In general, women refrained from 
disclosing gender-based violence because of stigma, fear of reprisals or honour killings. 
</p>
<p>50. There is a major gap with regard to prosecution of sexual violence. The Penal Code 
does not include a basic definition of sexual violence compliant with international human 
rights standards and does not incorporate any sections on war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. This translates into a complete absence of provisions regarding sexual-violence 
related to conflict. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 According to UNICEF, 377 unaccompanied children were expelled from Saudi Arabia in 2013; 
</p>
<p>85 were caught by general security officers; 13 by border guards; one by central security and seven 
children went voluntarily to the centre. In the first half of 2014, 290 unaccompanied children were 
expelled from Saudi Arabia; 82 were caught by general security officers; one by border guards and 
three children went voluntarily to the centre.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 Between January and May 2014, UNFPA recorded 752 cases of violence against women in conflict-
</p>
<p>affected areas including rape, sexual and physical assault, psychological abuse, denial of resources as 
well as early and forced marriages. </p>


<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p>51. A legislative amendment to the nationality law of Yemen was introduced in 201022 
allowing a child born to a Yemeni mother to gain Yemeni nationality when the father is a 
foreigner, unknown or when descent is not sure. However, it was not clear what the status 
of this law was and the degree to which it was being implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Refugees, migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>52. While a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Yemen 
has not incorporated the Convention into national refugee-specific legislation or established 
a refugee status determination procedure. In the absence of such legislation, the legal status 
of asylum seekers and refugees has been governed by a mix of decrees and provisions, inter 
alia, Republican Decree No. 47/1991 on the entry and residence of foreigners. That gap in 
the legislation has led to different approaches, for example between nationals of Somalia 
and non-Somali individuals in need of international protection. In this regard, the 
Government accorded refugee status on a prima facie basis to Somali refugees, whereas the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) conducted 
refugee status determination for all other asylum seekers. 
</p>
<p>53. During the reporting period, Yemen dealt with a mixed flow of refugees, asylum 
seekers and migrants seeking safety, protection or economic opportunities. Transit centres 
and reception centres were fully managed by UNHCR and its implementing partners 
without an active role by the Government. Refugee women and children were particularly 
vulnerable as they were often kidnapped and held hostage by smugglers or traffickers.  
</p>
<p>54. As of July 2014, over 200 asylum seekers from Eritrea had been detained in Hodeida 
Detention Centre, some since 2011, allegedly for security reasons. In February 2014, as a 
result of UNHCR intervention, 161 Eritrean individuals were released and moved to 
Sana&#8217;a. 
</p>
<p>55. According to OCHA, during the last week of May 2014, heavy fighting between 
militants and government forces in Amran Governorate, northern Yemen, triggered the 
displacement of up to 20,000 people. It was unclear if some of those people included those 
who had been displaced in earlier clashes from October 2013 to March 2014. In the south 
of the country, another 20,000 people were displaced during military operations against 
AQAP, which began on 29 April 2014. The Deputy Governor in Shabwah reported to 
OCHA that 80 per cent of the displaced people in the Governorate had later returned home. 
The majority of the displaced in Abyan were also reported to be returning home. An 
unknown number continued to live in public facilities because their homes had been 
destroyed, and they needed humanitarian assistance.23 
</p>
<p>56. During the reporting period, hundreds of men, women and children were reported as 
trafficked, primarily for the purpose of forced labour, forced begging, domestic servitude 
and sexual exploitation. Included were individuals trafficked from abroad, but there were 
also cases of internally displaced children recruited by traffickers in camps and trafficked to 
Saudi Arabia.  
</p>
<p>57. Progress was recorded in the Government&#8217;s efforts to establish institutional 
mechanisms to counter human trafficking. A functioning National Technical Committee to 
Counter Human Trafficking, chaired by the Minister of Human Rights, was established in 
February 2013. Comprehensive legislation criminalizing all forms of human trafficking was

Parliament.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Muhamasheen community has been successful in advocating its rights in the 
National Dialogue Conference, especially in the area of participation in the public sphere. 
The Conference&#8217;s Working Group on Rights and Freedoms recommended a 10 per cent 
participation in employment in public services, as well as equal access in leadership and 
decision-making positions. The Conference outcomes also focused on the development of a 
specialized national body to ensure Muhamasheen integration into society, particularly in 
accessing justice, education and training as well as military service. Other outcomes called 
for the drafting of national plans for the Muhamasheen community to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>59. Despite this progress, Yemen&#8217;s marginalized communities continue to be victims of 
attacks or neglect by the authorities. The National Muhamasheen Union reported several 
attacks against communities across the country, which resulted in their displacement from 
temporary built homes. OHCHR&#8211;Yemen recorded two cases of forced displacement in the 
Ta&#8217;izz Governorate.24  
</p>
<p><b> K. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>60. On 26 September 2012, OHCHR and the Government of Yemen signed a host 
country agreement formally establishing an OHCHR field presence in Yemen. Its premises 
were officially inaugurated on 30 September 2013, under the auspices of the United 
Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>61. During the reporting period, OHCHR continued to provide support towards the 
development of the draft transitional justice law. As part of the OHCHR-UNDP transitional 
justice programme, countrywide consultations on transitional justice were organized 
between government representatives and civil society. These consultations enabled the 
parties to reach consensus about human rights violations and sensitive political issues, with 
the aim of overcoming the sectarian divide. The consultative process included sections of 
society that had previously been excluded, such as Houthi representatives, citizens from 
southern governorates, victims&#8217; associations and tribesmen. More than 700 Yemenis were 
involved in the events. 
</p>
<p>62. Parallel consultations on the draft law on Transitional Justice and National 
Reconciliation were organized by OHCHR. Subsequently, comments on the law were 
submitted to the Minister of Legal Affairs, who in turn submitted the revised law in May 
2014 to the Cabinet for further elaboration. In the context of the transitional justice 
programme, OHCHR and UNDP supported the Ministry in establishing a transitional 
justice office and trained Ministry staff on transitional justice.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>24
 In an incident in the village of Jabal Habash, clashes between the Muhamasheen and the resident 
</p>
<p>communities resulted in 25 households being displaced, with local authorities not intervening to 
protect the Al-Muhamasheen community. In the second incident, in the Al Jomalh area, a temporary 
Muhamasheen settlement, consisting of 62 households and approximately 300 members, who had 
been living on the land for 30 years, was threatened with eviction when a businessman purchased the 
land. The Governor of Ta&#8217;izz promised the community a new piece of land. However, at the time of 
reporting, no land had been identified. </p>


<p><b> 15 
</b></p>
<p>63. OHCHR and UNDP provided support to the Land and Dismissals Commissions 
through the creation of a database and succeeded in enabling the commissions to properly 
aggregate and disaggregate cases, issue reports and analysis regarding specific case and 
patterns of crime, protect documentation and register new claims electronically. The 
programme also supported the Land Commission in designing a plan to deal with mass 
claims. It is expected that both the Land and Dismissals Commissions will issue 
recommendations for at least 20 per cent of cases until the end of 2014.  
</p>
<p>64. In cooperation with the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on 
Yemen and other United Nations agencies, OHCHR supported the Constitutional Drafting 
Commission to integrate international human rights standards into the new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>65. In cooperation with UNDP, OHCHR supported the national consultations on the 
first National Human Rights Plan of Yemen, which adopted a framework for the 
development of the Plan. 
</p>
<p>66. OHCHR and UNDP provided technical support and expertise to the Ministry of 
Human Rights in preparing the law establishing the National Human Rights Institution. 
They also carried out broad consultations with civil society on the draft law and supported 
advocacy with parliamentarians. The draft law was referred to the Parliament in January 
</p><p>2014.  
</p>
<p>67. OHCHR together with other United Nations entities provided technical support to 
the parliamentary committees working on the law to combat trafficking. This included 
advice on international human rights standards on prevention and combating trafficking as 
well as on protection and reintegration of victims.  
</p>
<p>68. OHCHR provided capacity-building to human rights NGOs on human rights 
monitoring and reporting; integrating a bill of rights into the Constitution; non-
discrimination of marginalized groups; as well as a national human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>69. In the framework of the Peacebuilding Fund, OHCHR signed a technical assistance 
agreement with the Ministry of the Interior to provide technical assistance to the reform of 
the security sector and incorporate human rights standards into legislation, codes of conduct 
and training programmes for the police.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The High Commissioner notes the progress achieved so far to strengthen 
promotion and protection of human rights in Yemen, particularly the process that 
ended in the National Dialogue Conference. She remains mindful of the significant 
security, political, and humanitarian challenges faced by the country. In line with her 
previous recommendations and based on the observations of her Office in Yemen, the 
High Commissioner: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Welcomes the conclusion of the National Dialogue Conference and the 
inclusiveness of the process. She notes with appreciation the consensus reached over 
the outcomes of the Conference pertaining to human rights especially with regard to 
the rights of women, children and marginalized communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Regrets that the overall security situation has escalated into intermittent 
conflict since October 2013, and urges all parties involved to end the conflict and 
respect their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law and 
contribute to the peaceful transition process;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Deplores that no independent and effective investigations have been 
conducted in relation to allegations of the excessive use of force and grave human </b></p>


<p><b>rights violations committed in Al-Dhale&#8217;a, Amran and other regions, in particular in 
cases resulting in deaths and attacks against civilian targets such as schools and 
hospitals. Regrets that no immediate safe access was provided for humanitarian 
organizations to assist the affected population;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Calls for the swift approval by the Parliament to ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the 
accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; she also calls for 
the Parliament to endorse the Law on Enforced Disappearances and the draft law 
establishing the national human rights institution;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Notes the progress made in receiving individual claims by the 
Commission to Consider and Address Land Issues and the Commission on Forcibly 
Dismissed Employees for Southern Yemen as a demonstration of the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to addressing long-standing grievances and to create confidence and 
strongly encourages the Government to act upon the Commissions&#8217; recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Regrets that, since September 2012, no appointments have been made of 
the commissioners on the national commission of inquiry into allegations of human 
rights violations that occurred in 2011. This delay hampers the credibility of any 
investigation and points to a lack of solid commitment by the Government towards 
redress and justice for victims of past human rights violations;  
 (g) Regrets that a decision on the Law on Transitional Justice and National 
Reconciliation has yet to be adopted, despite repeated requests by the Security 
Council and the Human Rights Council among others. Encourages the Government to 
cooperate with OHCHR in order to fully align the law with international human 
rights norms, standards and best practices;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Expresses her concern over the continued detention of individuals 
arrested in connection with the 2011 events, despite formal commitments towards 
their release; notes the frequent practice of prolonged detention without trial or 
without proper arrest warrants and documentation; and is further concerned that 
peaceful protests, particularly in southern Yemen, are often suppressed, at times with 
force, with reported arrests, injuries or deaths of protesters; 
 (i) Encourages the Government to cooperate with the United Nations 
human rights mechanisms, particularly by extending a standing invitation to special 
procedures.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Yemen take the 
following measures, some of them reiterated from her previous reports: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Expedite the establishment of the national commission of inquiry by 
naming its members and providing it with all facilities to carry out its task 
immediately; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Repeal Amnesty Law No. 1 (2012) and comply with international human 
rights law prohibiting immunity for those responsible for serious human rights 
violations, including war crimes and crimes against humanity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Cooperate with OHCHR to revise the draft Law on Transitional Justice 
and National Reconciliation to be in conformity with international norms, standards 
and best practices; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Release all individuals imprisoned for their peaceful participation in the 
2011 events and, according to due process and fair trial standards, verify the names of 
missing persons and inform their families of their whereabouts; and put an end to the </b></p>


<p><b> 17 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice of arbitrary detentions conducted by National Security Forces and Political 
Security Offices; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure independent and effective investigations in relation to allegations 
of the excessive use of force and grave human rights violations in Al-Dhale&#8217;a, Amran 
and other regions, in particular in cases resulting in the death of individuals and 
attacks against civilian targets such as schools and hospitals. The investigations should 
be conducted by independent and non-military bodies, the results of the investigations 
should be made public and those proved to be guilty should be held accountable;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure immediate, safe and unimpeded access of humanitarian 
organizations into all areas affected by armed conflicts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure the safety and security of foreign and local journalists and ensure 
that they have access to all sources of information without fear of retaliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that women&#8217;s participation and women&#8217;s rights are taken into 
due consideration in the Constitution drafting process; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Ensure implementation of the Action Plan to end and prevent the 
recruitment and use of children by the Yemeni Armed Forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Ensure that the National Dialogue Conference outcomes regarding 
Muhamasheen and other minorities are incorporated into the new Constitution and 
implemented into practice; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Enact the law to criminalize human trafficking and develop official 
standard operating procedures that operationalize the law and help to identify and 
assist victims of trafficking, and investigate and prosecute perpetrators; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty pursuant to 
moratorium resolutions of the General Assembly. Until then, the Government should 
ensure scrupulous respect of due process-related rights, including fair trial guarantees 
in cases involving the death penalty, and ensure that the death penalty is not applied 
to minors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Ensure that counter-terrorism policies and strategies comply fully with 
international law, including human rights law. In this regard, ensure that any use of 
lethal force, including through the use of armed drones, complies fully with relevant 
international law, including the obligations of Yemen under international human 
rights law. Where violations of the law occur, conduct independent, impartial, prompt 
and effective investigations, and provide victims or their relatives with an effective 
remedy. Similarly, ensure transparency and public reporting over the use of armed 
drones.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Encourage prompt, independent and impartial investigations into 
serious human rights violations that have resulted in loss of life and/or serious injury. 
Once they have been conducted, extend the necessary and appropriate support to the 
Government of Yemen in order to ensure accountability and appropriate remedy for 
any human rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Encourage the establishment, in consultation with the Government of 
Yemen, of an independent, international mechanism to investigate violations of 
human rights that took place in 2011; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Cooperate with the panel of experts charged with investigating 
individuals or entities engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the 
peace, security or stability of Yemen pursuant to Security Council resolution 2140 </b></p>


<p><b>(2014). In this regard, submit relevant information that meets the designation criteria 
for sanctions against spoilers, including planning, directing or committing acts that 
violate applicable international human rights law or international humanitarian law, 
or acts that constitute human rights abuses in Yemen;
