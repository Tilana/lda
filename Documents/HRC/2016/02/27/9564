<p><b>INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
(A/HRC/4/21) gives an account of communications transmitted by the Special Rapporteur 
between 1 December 2005 and 30 November 2006. It also contains the replies received from 
Governments to her communications by 30 January 2007, as well as observations of the Special 
Rapporteur where considered appropriate. Many of these observations refer to the framework for 
communications which has been annexed to her last report to the Commission on Human Rights 
(see E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 28-35 and Annex). The various categories are as follows:  
</p>
<p><b>I. Freedom of religion or belief 
</b>1. Freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or belief 
2. Freedom from coercion 
3. The right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief 
</p>
<p>a) Freedom to worship 
b) Places of worship 
c) Religious symbols 
d) Observance of holidays and days of rest 
e) Appointing clergy 
f) Teaching and disseminating materials (including missionary activity) 
g) The right of parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their 
children 
h) Registration 
i) Communicate with individuals and communities on religious matters at the 
national and international level 
j) Establish and maintain charitable and humanitarian institutions/solicit and 
receive funding 
k) Conscientious objection 
</p>
<p><b>II. Discrimination 
</b>1. Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief/inter-religious discrimination/tolerance 
2. State religion 
</p>
<p><b>III. Vulnerable groups 
</b>1. Women 
2. Persons deprived of their liberty 
3. Refugees 
4. Children 
5. Minorities 
6. Migrant workers 
</p>
<p><b>IV. Intersection of freedom of religion or belief with other human rights 
</b>1. Freedom of expression including questions related to religious conflicts, religious 
intolerance and extremism 
2. Right to life, right to liberty 
3. Prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p><b>V. Cross-cutting issues 
</b>1. Derogation 
2. Limitation 
3. Legislative issues 
4. Defenders of freedom of religion or belief and non-governmental organizations. </p>

</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur is currently developing this framework for communications into 
an online digest, which is intended to illustrate the international standards with pertinent excerpts 
of the mandate-holders&#8217; findings since 1986 according to the categories of the framework for 
communications. The online digest will be available on the website of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/standards.htm). 
The Special Rapporteur hopes that uploading the framework for communications onto the 
OHCHR website will make the legal basis of freedom of religion or belief as well as the mandate 
practice more readily accessible for Governments and for civil society worldwide. 
</p>
<p>3.  Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been 
obliged to summarize the communications sent and received. As a result, replies from 
Governments could not be published in their entirety. The names of alleged victims are reflected 
in this report, although exceptions may be made in relation to children and other victims of 
violence in relation to whom publication would be problematic. </p>

</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Afghanistan</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 March 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information received 
according to which on February 2006 <b>Mr. Abdul Rahman</b> was arrested after the police received 
information that he was a convert. He was found carrying a Bible at the time of his arrest. Mr. 
Rahman is currently being tried on the criminal charge of conversion from Islam to Christianity 
in a Kabul court. Mr. Rahman has acknowledged that sixteen years ago he converted to 
Christianity. He was informed by the Prosecutor of the Court that his charges would be dropped 
in case he reconverted to Islam. Mr. Rahman is unwilling to do so. According to the national law 
of Afghanistan, the penalty for conversion from Islam is the death sentence.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to ensure compliance with article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
which clearly states that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion &#8220;includes 
freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others, 
and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practise, worship and 
observance&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>6. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or belief&#8221; (see above para. 
1, category I. 1.). The Special Rapporteur considers situations where people are arrested, tried or 
otherwise challenged because they had converted to another religion as unacceptable forms of 
violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief because, in essence, they limit or tend to 
limit the freedom of thought or conscience itself. This is sometimes called the &#8220;forum internum&#8221;, 
which, according to the main international instruments, forms the part of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief that is not susceptible to any limitation. The Special Rapporteur has already 
covered the question of conversion in detail in her 2005 report to the General Assembly (see 
A/60/399, paras. 40-68). She would like to reiterate that &#8220;[s]ince the choice of religion or belief is 
part of the forum internum, which allows for no limitations, a general prohibition of conversion 
by a State necessarily enters into conflict with applicable international standards. A law 
prohibiting conversion would constitute a State policy aiming at influencing individual&#8217;s desire to 
have or adopt a religion or belief and is therefore not acceptable under human rights law. A State 
also has the positive obligation of ensuring the freedom of religion or belief of the persons on its 
territory and under its jurisdiction.&#8221; (see A/60/399, para. 52).

<b>Communication sent on 31 July 2006 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the re-establishment of the <i>Department for the 
Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice</i>. The cabinet of Afghanistan has approved a draft 
plan to re-establish it and this draft will be submitted for parliamentary approval when the 
Afghan National Assembly reconvenes later in 2006. According to the information received, a 
similar department existed under the Taliban, which imposed and enforced a number of practices 
requiring men to grow beards and women to wear <i>burkas</i>. That department was also responsible 
for banning girl schools. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She urges the Government to ensure 
compliance with article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which 
states that each State Party &#8220;undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its 
territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without 
distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion [&#8230;]&#8221;. Para. 13 of Human 
Rights Committee general comment 28 states that &#8220;States parties should provide information on 
any specific regulation of clothing to be worn by women in public. The Committee stresses that 
such regulations may involve a violation of a number of rights guaranteed by the Covenant, such 
as: article 26, on non-discrimination; article 7, if corporal punishment is imposed in order to 
enforce such a regulation; article 9, when failure to comply with the regulation is punished by 
arrest; article 12, if liberty of movement is subject to such a constraint; article 17, which 
guarantees all persons the right to privacy without arbitrary or unlawful interference; articles 18 
and 19, when women are subjected to clothing requirements that are not in keeping with their 
religion or their right of self-expression; and, lastly, article 27, when the clothing requirements 
conflict with the culture to which the woman can lay a claim.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for communications, more 
specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning 
&#8220;Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief/inter-religious discrimination/tolerance&#8221; (see 
above para. 1, category III. 1.). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has already covered the 
question of religious symbols in detail in her 2006 report to the Commission on Human Rights 
(see E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 36-60). She would like to reiterate that &#8220;[t]he fundamental objective 
should be to safeguard both the positive freedom of religion or belief as manifested in observance 
and practice by voluntarily wearing or displaying religious symbols, and also the negative 
freedom from being forced to wear or display religious symbols.&#8221; (see E/CN.4/2006/5, para. 60).

<p><b>Communication envoy&#233;e le 22 Juin 2006 
</b></p>
<p>10. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale a attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement alg&#233;rien sur l&#8217;information 
concernant l&#8217;ordonnance n&#176; 06-03 du 28 f&#233;vrier 2006, qui fixe les <b>conditions et r&#232;gles 
d&#8217;exercice des cultes autres que musulmans</b>. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le Pr&#233;sident de 
l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a approuv&#233; cette ordonnance parlementaire par une loi du 17 avril 2006. Selon l&#8217;article </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 8 
 
16 (1) &#171; les personnes exer&#231;ant un culte autre que musulman, dans un cadre collectif, sont tenues 
de se conformer aux dispositions de la pr&#233;sente ordonnance &#187;.  
</p>
<p>11. En plus, l&#8217;ordonnance contient des conditions concernant les lieux o&#249; doivent &#234;tre 
exerc&#233;es traditions et manifestations religieuses. En outre, l&#8217;article 11 criminalise le fait pour 
toute personne de tenter de convertir un musulman &#224; une autre religion. La peine relative &#224; cette 
infraction est un emprisonnement de deux &#224; cinq ans et une amende de 500,000 &#224; 1 000,000 
dirham (7,045 &#224; 14,091 Dollars US). L&#8217;article 11 &#233;rige &#233;galement en infraction p&#233;nale le fait pour 
une personne de fabriquer, entreposer, ou distribuer des documents imprim&#233;s ou m&#233;trages 
audiovisuels ou tout autre support ou moyen &#171; qui visent &#224; &#233;branler la foi d&#8217;un musulman &#187;. 
</p>
<p>12. En outre, selon l&#8217;article 13 (3) la personne qui &#171; pr&#234;che &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur des &#233;difices destin&#233;s &#224; 
l&#8217;exercice du culte &#187; sans autorisation de l&#8217;autorit&#233; religieuse comp&#233;tente de sa confession et des 
autorit&#233;s alg&#233;riennes comp&#233;tentes est susceptible d&#8217;&#234;tre punie d&#8217;un emprisonnement d&#8217;un &#224; trois 
ans et d&#8217;une amende de 100,000 &#224; 300,000 Dirham (environ 1,409 &#224; 4,227 dollars des Etats-Unis 
d&#8217;Am&#233;rique). Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es que cette ordonnance soit susceptible de violer le 
droit &#224; la libert&#233; de religion ou de conviction.  
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse dat&#233;e du 14 d&#8217;ao&#251;t 2006 
</b></p>
<p>13. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien a r&#233;pondu, d&#8217;abord, que l&#8217;ordonnance n&#176; 06-03 du 28 f&#233;vrier 
2006 est conforme aux instruments internationaux ratifi&#233;s par l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie. En particulier, il a 
remarqu&#233; la conformit&#233; de l&#8217;ordonnance avec l&#8217;article 18.3 du Pacte international relatif aux 
droits civils et politiques, qui dispose &#171; La libert&#233; de manifester sa religion ou ses convictions ne 
peut faire l&#8217;objet que des seules restrictions pr&#233;vues par la loi et qui sont n&#233;cessaires &#224; la 
protection de la s&#233;curit&#233;, de l&#8217;ordre et de la sant&#233; publique, ou de la morale ou des libert&#233;s et 
droits fondamentaux d&#8217;autrui &#187;. 
</p>
<p>14. En plus, l&#8217;article 36 de la Constitution alg&#233;rienne garantie la libert&#233; de conscience. Par 
ailleurs, les principes fondamentaux sur lesquels s&#8217;appuie l&#8217;ordonnance n&#176; 06-03 du 28 f&#233;vrier 
2006 sont inspir&#233;s des pr&#233;ceptes de l&#8217;islam, qui rejettent la contrainte dans l&#8217;exercice du culte. 
L&#8217;article 2 de l&#8217;ordonnance sp&#233;cifie que la religion de l&#8217;&#201;tat alg&#233;rien est l&#8217;islam, mais il garantit 
le libre exercice du culte, toujours &#171; dans le cadre du respect des lois et r&#232;glements en vigueur, de 
l&#8217;ordre public, des bonnes m&#339;urs et des droits et libert&#233;s fondamentaux des tiers &#187;. En plus, 
l&#8217;ordonnance propose la cr&#233;ation d&#8217;une commission nationale du culte, dont la mission principale 
serait de garantir la libert&#233; d&#8217;exercice du culte. Elle pr&#233;voit &#233;galement que les associations 
religieuses des cultes autres que le musulman b&#233;n&#233;ficieront de l&#8217;assistance et de la protection de 
l&#8217;Etat, et elle interdit &#233;galement de consid&#233;rer l&#8217;appartenance religieuse comme un crit&#232;re de 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>15. Les faits incrimin&#233;s par l&#8217;ordonnance sont les suivants : &#171; l&#8217;utilisation des &#233;difices 
religieux &#224; d&#8217;autres fins &#187;; &#171; l&#8217;utilisation de moyens de s&#233;duction ou des &#233;tablissements 
d&#8217;enseignement, d&#8217;&#233;ducation ou de sant&#233; ou toute autre institution pour convertir un citoyen &#224; une 
religion &#187;; et &#171; pr&#234;cher &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur des &#233;difices destin&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;exercice du culte, sans &#234;tre d&#233;sign&#233;, 
agr&#233;&#233; ou autoris&#233; par l&#8217;autorit&#233; religieuse de sa confession et par les autorit&#233;s alg&#233;riennes 
comp&#233;tentes &#187; (cette derni&#232;re disposition est aussi pr&#233;vue d&#8217;une fa&#231;on similaire dans le Code 
p&#233;nal alg&#233;rien). Le mot &#171; s&#233;duction &#187; est d&#233;crit &#224; l&#8217;article 11 comme tout moyen utilis&#233; pour 
convertir un citoyen, en exploitant ses faiblesses ou ses conditions sociables difficiles. </p>

<p> 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>16. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale remercie le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien pour cette r&#233;ponse. 
Elle voudrait faire r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; &#171; la libert&#233; d&#8217;adopter, de changer et de renoncer une 
religion ou une conviction &#187; (selon le <i>framework for communications</i>, voir ci-dessus para. 
1, cat&#233;gorie I. 1.). Dans son chapitre sur la question des conversions, elle note, quant aux 
restrictions selon paragraphe 3 de l&#8217;article 18 du Pacte (A/60/399, para. 62), &#171; que cet 
article ne pr&#233;voit des restrictions que dans des cas tr&#232;s exceptionnels. Le fait notamment 
qu&#8217;il invoque la protection des libert&#233;s et droits <i>fondamentaux</i> (les italiques sont de 
l&#8217;auteur) d&#8217;autrui pour justifier de telles restrictions d&#233;note une volont&#233; plus ferme de 
garantir ce droit que pour d&#8217;autres droits dont les clauses restrictives ne font &#233;tat que des &#171; 
droits et libert&#233;s d&#8217;autrui &#187; (par exemple, art. 12, 21 et 22). On pourrait du reste faire 
valoir que la libert&#233; de religion ou de conviction d&#8217;autrui peut &#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233;e comme 
faisant partie de ces libert&#233;s et droits fondamentaux et que, de ce fait, l&#8217;imposition de 
restrictions aux activit&#233;s missionnaires se justifie; mais comme la libert&#233; de religion et de 
conviction des adultes est intrins&#232;quement une question de choix personnel, toute 
restriction g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e impos&#233;e par l&#8217;&#201;tat (par exemple par le biais de la loi) pour prot&#233;ger 
la libert&#233; de religion et de conviction d&#8217;&#171; autrui &#187; en restreignant le droit de chacun de 
mener des activit&#233;s missionnaires est &#224; &#233;viter. &#187; 
</p>
<p>17. Enfin, quant aux activit&#233;s missionnaires (A/60/399, para. 65) la Rapporteuse 
sp&#233;ciale estime qu&#8217; &#171; il serait d&#233;conseill&#233; d&#8217;&#233;riger en infraction des actes non violents 
commis par quelqu&#8217;un dans le cadre de la manifestation de sa religion, et surtout de sa 
propagation, et ce pour &#233;viter de criminaliser des actes qui, dans un contexte diff&#233;rent, ne 
rel&#232;veraient pas du droit p&#233;nal et d&#8217;ouvrir ainsi la voie &#224; la pers&#233;cution des minorit&#233;s 
religieuses. En outre, puisque le droit de changer ou non de religion est par essence un 
droit subjectif, toute crainte &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard de certaines conversions ou des moyens utilis&#233;s pour 
les susciter devrait &#234;tre exprim&#233;e avant tout par la victime pr&#233;sum&#233;e. &#187; En guise de 
conclusion (A/60/399, para. 68) &#171; [e]lle recommande que les cas pr&#233;sum&#233;s de conversion

<p><b><i>Angola</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 19 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government of Angola information 
she had received concerning the <b>Muslim Community in Angola</b>. According to these allegations, 
the Muslim community there is encountering difficulties in obtaining the necessary registration in 
order to operate as a legal religious community. The current law on registration, passed in 2004, 
requires 100,000 signatures in order to legalize a religious community. The Muslim community 
in Angola has been waiting for a response to their registration request since early 2005. 
Furthermore, five of the six mosques in Luanda were closed earlier this year. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 10 
 
<b>Response from the Government dated 6 October 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>19. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the situation of the Muslim 
community in Angola is due to not having completed all the legal requirements needed to be 
registered as a legal institution. All religious entities must fulfil a set of requirements in order to 
be granted legal status. The Muslim Community was informed by the Ministry of Justice that 
their application did not meet the necessary requirements and therefore they had two options, 
which were either the fulfilment of the outstanding requirements or to appeal the decision. 
Moreover, the Government notes that freedom of religion or belief is recognized and protected by 
the Angolan constitution in Article 8.   
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. She would like to refer 
to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms 
and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Registration&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. h). In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the right to freedom of religion is not 
limited to members of registered religious communities. As she noted in her 2005 report to the 
Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;registration should not be compulsory, i.e. it should not be a 
precondition for practicing one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal personality and 
related benefits&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58). The Special Rapporteur wishes to be advised as to 
why it is necessary to require 100,000 signatures in order to legalize a religious community 
according to the current law on registration in Angola. She also would be grateful to receive, as 
indicated in the response from the Government of Angola, a copy of the decision of the Ministry 
of Justice which informs the Muslim Community that their application did not meet the 
requirements.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Australia</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 15 August 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government of Australia 
information regarding <b>Amer Haddara, Shane Kent, Fadal Sayadi, Abdullah Merhi, Ahmed 
Raad, Ezzit Raad, Hany Taha, Aimen Joud</b>, <b>Abdul Nacer Benbrika</b>, held in Barwon Prison 
since November 2005, <b>Bassam Raad, Majed Raad, Shoue Hammoud</b>, held in Barwon Prison 
since March 2006 and <b>Izzydeen Attik</b>, arrested and remanded in Sydney in November 2005 and 
transferred to Barwon Prison prior to March 2006.  
</p>
<p>22. The above mentioned men are all being held at the maximum security Acacia Unit of 
Barwon Prison in Victoria, a facility originally designed for convicted prisoners only. They have 
been charged with various offences under the anti-terror provisions of the Criminal Code Act 
1995 relating mostly to membership and support of a terrorist organization. None of the above 
mentioned persons has been charged with committing a terrorist act as such. Most of them were 
at some point or are still held in solitary confinement, some for up to 10 weeks. During this 
period they did not have access to exercise yards or recreational facilities. The others are 
confined to their cells between 23 and 18 hours, and during the remaining period, the possibility 
for contacts is severely restricted. Family visits are limited and the monthly contact visits are </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 11 
</p>
<p> 
permitted only to children and not to spouses, partners or other family members. Some of the 
detainees were held together with convicted prisoners for some time.  
</p>
<p>23. Access by the detainees to their legal representatives is restricted and all communications 
between them are audio and videotaped. All materials provided to and received by the detainees 
are scanned by the prison authorities. The diet of the detainees includes pork, which some of 
them consider offensive to their religious feelings. The mental health of some detainees has been 
adversely affected by the detention conditions and the prolonged isolation.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 30 November 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>24. Pursuant to section 120 of the Australian Constitution, housing of federal offenders 
(including those on remand) is the responsibility of the States and Territories (in this case, 
Victoria). The Commonwealth does not become involved in operational decisions of State 
Departments of Corrective Services in terms of security levels and custodial arrangements. The 
Government Department responsible for corrective services in the State of Victoria has assisted 
the Commonwealth by providing information in response to the sent letters. 
</p>
<p>25. Concerning the charges of the alleged offenders, each one of them has been charged with 
one count of being a member of a terrorist organisation, contrary to section 102.3 of the Criminal 
Code. Various additional charges have also been laid against some of the men, including charges 
of intentionally recruiting a person to join a terrorist organisation, intentionally making funds 
available to a terrorist organisation, and possessing a thing connected with the preparation for a 
terrorist act. 
</p>
<p>26. Barwon Prison houses remand prisoners. Within Barwon Prison is the Acacia High 
Security Unit, in which the alleged offenders are being held. The Acacia Unit houses both 
remand and convicted prisoners, however they do not mix, consistent with Guideline 1.11 of 
the Standard Guidelines for Prisons under the Revised Standard Guidelines for Corrections in 
Australia 2004 (Standard Guidelines). This is also consistent with Rule 8(b) of the Standard 
Minimum Rules on the Treatment of Prisoners (Standard Minimum Rules), which, while not a 
binding document, may be persuasive, and article 10(2) (a) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (Covenant). Australia has a reservation to article 10(2) (a), which 
states that the obligation under article 10(2) (a) is to be achieved progressively. However, in 
ensuring that remand and convicted prisoners do not mix in Barwon Prison, Australia is 
satisfied that it implements article 10(2) (a) notwithstanding Australia&#8217;s reservation. 
</p>
<p>27. As to the confinement in cells, the Government indicates that the alleged offenders have 
never been held in solitary confinement. Rather, each prisoner has an individual cell. They 
spend approximately six hours out of their cells each day. They may choose to reduce that time 
by returning to their cell earlier. Remand prisoners normally exercise with one other prisoner. 
All prisoners are rotated as to who they may exercise with, but security concerns are 
paramount in deciding the mix of people. Victorian legislation provides that the minimum 
number of hours out of cell is one hour per day (paragraph 47(1) (a) of the Corrections Act 
1986 (Vic) (the Act)), which is consistent with Rule 21 of the Standard Minimum Rules and 
Guideline 2.47 of the Standard Guidelines. All detainees are able to make applications for any 
special arrangements they may require to assist them in the preparation of their defence, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 12 
 
consistent with article 14(3) (b) of the Covenant and with Guidelines 1.15, 1.17 and 2.4 of the 
Standard Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>28. Concerning personal visits, remand prisoners are permitted one non-contact visit per 
week of one hours&#8217; duration and one contact visit per month with any children they may have 
under the age of 16 years. They remain shackled and manacled during a contact visit with 
children for security reasons. Such restrictions on the basis of security are permissible under 
Rule 92 of the Standard Minimum Rules. They have also telephone access and are permitted to 
make 25 personal telephone calls per week. 
</p>
<p>29. With regards to the legal visits, remand prisoners do not have limits on the number of 
visits from professionals, except by the conflicting demands of other prisoners to have access 
to the contact rooms available for professional visits, in accordance with article 14(3) (b) of the 
Covenant. Accordingly, there is a system of booking the contact room to guarantee access. 
Lawyers may visit their clients in the Acacia Unit between 8.45 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. Visits are 
video monitored for security purposes, but there is no audio sound or recording. Remand 
prisoners may make an unlimited number of legal professional calls, and are able to make these 
legal professional calls between 8.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. each day. These restrictions are 
consistent with Principle 8 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, Rule 93 of the 
Standard Minimum Rules and Guideline 1.17 of the Standard Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>30. Concerning the diet of the detainees, section 47 of the Act stipulates that prisoners have 
the right to be provided with special dietary food where the Governor of the prison is satisfied 
that such food is necessary for medical reasons or on account of the prisoners religious beliefs 
or because the prisoner is a vegetarian. Section 47 conforms to Guideline 2.13 of the Standard 
Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>31. In this context, Halal food is provided to Muslim prisoners and they have the choice of 
selecting any item off the prison menu. During Ramadan, Muslim prisoners have the option of 
a special food pack. While pork is included in the general Barwon Prison menu, it is not 
included in the special food pack; however, prisoners may select a food item which specifically 
includes pork. Allegations that the remand prisoners were served pork meals have been 
referred to the Corrections Inspectorate for investigation.  
</p>
<p>32. Regarding mental health, all prisoners are medically assessed, including psychiatric 
assessment, on entering prison, which accords with Rule 24 of the Standard Minimum Rules. 
As to the question of complaints being lodged or not, the Corrections Department of the State 
of Victoria has advised that complaints have been lodged by the alleged offenders and are 
being investigated. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government of the State of Victoria indicated that whilst the group has been in 
custody, there have been a number of registered incidents, complaints and allegations. 
Allegations of threats made by remand prisoners towards corrections staff have been 
investigated and formally resolved at the Prison Governor&#8217;s Disciplinary Hearings. Allegations 
of assault and threats made towards the remand prisoners have been referred to Victoria Police 
for investigation. Under Australia&#8217;s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the Government is unable to 
provide any details of medical examinations without the express written consent of the 
individual affected by them. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p><p>34. As regards prosecutions undertaken, Messrs Benbrika, Atik, Haddara, Joud, Kent, 
Merhi, A Raad, E Raad, Sayadi and Taha were arrested and charged in November 2005. In late 
March 2006, Messrs B Raad, M Raad and Hammoud were also arrested and charged. All the 
alleged of offenders have been through committal proceedings, at which a Magistrate found 
that there was a case against each on which a reasonable jury could convict. On 1 September 
2006, 11 of the alleged offenders were committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of 
Victoria on the charges under the Criminal Code. On 20 September 2006, the remaining two 
alleged offenders were committed to the Supreme Court to stand trial. All matters have been 
listed for a directions hearing in the Supreme Court on 1 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>35. With the exception of Messrs Hammoud, Kent and M Raad, each remand prisoner has 
been formally disciplined for breaches of prison rules following a guilty plea or a finding of 
guilt at the Prison Governor&#8217;s Disciplinary Hearings. Recorded breaches have included failure 
to comply with directions, verbal abuse directed at prison staff and verbal threats towards prison 
staff. Penalties have included monetary fines and restrictions on contact visits for periods of time not 
exceeding 28 days. 
</p>
<p>36. Regarding the legislation which regulates the communications between the detainees and 
their lawyers in prison, they mention the Act and the <i>Corrections Regulations 1998 </i>(Vic), which 
regulates communications between remand prisoners and their lawyers. They mention 
particularly sections 44, 47 (1) (m), 47 A and 47 B. 
</p>
<p>37. Given the above information, the Government affirms that the detention of the alleged 
offenders has not been arbitrary, has been necessary, proportionate and justifiable in the 
circumstances. The alleged offenders are also being treated, while on remand, with humanity 
and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s comprehensive response. She 
would be appreciative to receive, as indicated in the response from the Government of Australia, 
information on any results of the investigation by the Corrections Inspectorate concerning the 
allegations that the remand prisoners were served pork meals. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to take the opportunity to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to 
the international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Persons deprived 
of their liberty&#8221; (see above para. 1, category III. 2.). As she noted in her 2005 report to the 
General Assembly, &#8220;[a] person in custody finds him or herself in a situation of enhanced 
vulnerability and can therefore be an easy target for persecution. Prison authorities are given total 
control over the most basic activities of the inmates, from the time they will sleep to what they 
will eat, and how they will be able to exercise their right to freedom of religion or belief.&#8221;

<p><b><i>Bangladesh</i></b>  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent allegation sent on 20 January 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteurs received information about a <b>14 year old Hindu girl</b> from the 
town of Thakurgaon Bangladesh according to which, on 10 November 2005 at about 4 p.m., the 
girl was abducted at gunpoint on her way home from school. The two abductors are alleged to be 
two neighbouring young Muslims. There are concerns that the purpose of the abduction is in 
order to force her to convert to Islam. On 11 November 2005, the girl&#8217;s parents lodged a formal 
complaint at Thakurgaon Sadar Police Station and appealed to the Home Minister. However, the 
police reportedly did not act upon the complaint, arrest the abductors or attempt to recover the 
girl. Twenty three days after the abduction, the girl called her parents from a mobile phone and 
informed them that she was under the custody of a police officer from Dinajpur. This information 
was transmitted to Thakurgaon Sadar Police Station but no action was reportedly taken to 
apprehend the alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 9 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Government informed that this case was investigated and that the following 
information was established. The person in question voluntarily left her father&#8217;s place with her 
fianc&#233;e on 10 November 2005. On the same day, she converted into Islam and declared her 
marriage with her fianc&#233;e. This was stated by affidavit before the learned Notary Public. As per 
the affidavit, her age was claimed to be 21 years. The medical board certified that her age was 
about 18 years and consequently she is not a minor. Her father lodged a legal action accusing the 
fianc&#233;e and others of abducting her. The case is pending before the learned Court. At present, she 
is staying at the residence of her husband. The Court will decide whether there was abduction or 
not. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. She would be grateful 
to receive information on any results of the court case which was lodged by the father of the 
alleged victim. The Special Rapporteur would like to take the opportunity to remind the 
Government of article 18(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
states that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to 
adopt a religion or belief of his choice.&#8221; Furthermore, according to article 5(1) of the 1981 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
Religion or Belief, &#8220;[t]he parents or, as the case may be, the legal guardians of the child have the 
right to organize the life within the family in accordance with their religion or belief and bearing 
in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be brought up.&#8221; Article 14(2) 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that &#8220;States Parties shall respect the rights 
and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child 
in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>42. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Freedom from coercion&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 2.) and &#8220;The right </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 15 
</p>
<p> 
of parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children&#8221; (category I. 3. g). As she 
noted in her 2005 report to the General Assembly, &#8220;with regard to children, the choice of religion 
is restricted by the parents&#8217; rights to determine their child&#8217;s religion up to an age where the child 
is capable of doing so on his/her own, in accordance with article 18, paragraph 4, of the 
Covenant.&#8221; (A/60/399, para. 54).  
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 2 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the information she 
had received concerning the attack on <b>Hindu worshippers in Chandpur. </b>According to what has 
been alleged, on 31 October 2005 a group of Hindus held a religious meeting in the house of 
Pradip Chandra in Hijlakandi village, Chandpur district, when they were attacked by a group of 
Muslims from the same village. The attackers threatened and assaulted the worshippers and 
demanded money from them. They also ransacked the materials and musical instruments of the 
Hindus and snatched a gold chain belonging to one of the women in the group. The victims 
lodged a case with the Matlab North police station after which police officials visited the spot. No 
formal police investigation has been undertaken. Leaders from both communities have initiated a 
reconciliation programme.    
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 7 June 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The Permanent Mission of Bangladesh assures that the contents of the communication 
have been duly noted and forwarded to the concerned authorities of Bangladesh in order to take 
further action as deemed appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Permanent Mission for acknowledging receipt of the 
communication. She would be grateful to receive information about any police investigation 
launched and on the results of any such investigation, together with the outcome of the 
reconciliation programme which had been initiated by leaders from both communities. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to take the opportunity to remind the Government of article 6 of 
the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based 
on Religion or Belief, according to which the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or 
belief includes the freedom, &#8220;(a) To worship or assemble in connection with a religion or belief 
[&#8230;]; (c) To make, acquire and use the necessary articles and materials related to the rites or 
customs of a religion or belief&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>46. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to worship&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. a) and &#8220;Places of 
worship&#8221; (category I. 3. b). As she noted in her 2005 report to the Commission on Human Rights, 
&#8220;members of religious communities or communities of belief, whenever they find themselves in 
places of worship, are in a situation of special vulnerability given the nature of their activity. The 
Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States should pay increased attention to attacks 
on places of worship and ensure that all perpetrators of such attacks are properly prosecuted and 
tried.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 49).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 26 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received regarding new threats made against the <b>Ahmaddiyya community.</b> According to the 
information received, on 22 June 2006, an anti Ahmadiyya outfit, Khatme Nabuwwat Andolon, 
published an advertisement in the Daily Inqilab under the headline &#8220;An open letter to the 
Honourable Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Speaker of the National Parliament and 
Members of Parliament&#8221;. The article allegedly threatened the Government to declare Ahmadis 
&#8220;non-Muslims&#8221; and stated, inter alia, &#8220;<i>Though the activists of Khatme Nabuwwat have taken 
strong measures like imposing sieges but due to the peace-loving and law-abiding mentality of 
their leadership no untoward incident like loss of life or other lawlessness has occurred so far. 
Even after showing this much of restrain, the failure and negligence on the part of the 
Government in this regard, the Prophet-lovers are now ready to sacrifice their lives for this just 
and logical demand. But once loss of lives occurs in this sensitive issue related to the honour of 
our Holy Prophet, there is a possibility for the ongoing anti Qadianee movement to turn into a 
Qadianee-eliminating movement. Therefore, it is urged that you declare the Qadianees as non-
Muslim and pass a law preserving the honour of the Holy Prophet in the current Parliament 
session before the siege programme of the Qadianee Den at Ashkona on the 23rd of June, 2006. 
We are ready to cooperate with Government in this regard.</i>&#8221; 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also recalled that previous communications in relation to this 
issue have been sent to the Government of Bangladesh in 2004 and 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from Government dated 29 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Permanent Mission of the People&#8217;s Republic of Bangladesh reported to the OHCHR 
that it has forwarded the case to the concerned authorities of Bangladesh for necessary inquiry 
and action. It assured that the request will be carefully considered as it deserves. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Permanent Mission for acknowledging the 
communication. However, taking into account the serious character of the situation faced by the 
Ahmadiyya community in Bangladesh, she regrets that she has neither received a substantive 
reply to the urgent appeal of 26 June 2006 nor to her previous communication dated 10 March 
2005 (see E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, paras. 27-29). The Special Rapporteur therefore continues to 
urge the Government to take concrete measures to eliminate acts of religious intolerance towards 
the Ahmadiyya community in accordance with article 8(a) of the 2005/40 Resolution of the 
Commission on Human Rights, which urges States to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance 
and discrimination based on religion or belief, notably by &#8220;[t]aking all necessary and appropriate 
action, in conformity with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance 
and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or 
belief, with particular regard to religious minorities, and also to devote particular attention to 
practices that violate the human rights of women and discriminate against women, including in 
the exercise of their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief&#8221;. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to receive detailed information about the content of any relevant 
measures taken by the authorities. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her </p>

<p> 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to 
the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Minorities&#8221; (see above para. 1, category III. 5.). 
</p>
<p><b><i>Belarus</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 9 March 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in Belarus 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning the refusal to register the Christ&#8217;s Covenant Reformed Baptist Church and 
the Belarusian Evangelical Church.  
</p>
<p>52. According to what has been alleged, <b>the Christ&#8217;s Covenant Reformed Baptist Church</b> 
has unsuccessfully been seeking re-registration under the 2002 religious law. Pastor Georgi 
Vyazovsky is facing administrative charges for leading an unregistered congregation and carrying 
out services at his home. The hearing is scheduled to take place on 3 March 2006.  
</p>
<p>53.<b> The Belarusian Evangelical Church</b> has been unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain re-
registration under the 2002 religious law. On 20 September 2005, the Church was liquidated. The 
attempts to re-register were unsuccessful because the Church does not have state-approved non-
residential worship premises.  
</p>
<p>54.  There are concerns that the two churches are among many religious groups unable to gain 
registration in Belarus. This inability to register renders it difficult to obtain suitable premises, 
meaning that many religious groups are forced to use private residential premises for worship, for 
which they then face administrative charges.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to take the opportunity 
to remind the Government of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/40 which urges 
States, &#8220;[t]o review, whenever relevant, existing registration practices in order to ensure the right 
of all persons to manifest their religion or belief, alone or in community with others and in public 
or in private&#8221; (para. 4 c) and &#8220;[t]o ensure that, in accordance with appropriate national legislation 
and in conformity with international human rights law, the freedom for all persons and members 
of groups to establish and maintain religious, charitable or humanitarian institutions is fully 
respected and protected.&#8221; (para. 4 c).  
</p>
<p>56. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Registration&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. h). In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the right to freedom of religion is not limited to members of 
registered religious communities. As she noted in her 2005 report to the Commission on Human 
Rights, &#8220;registration should not be compulsory, i.e. it should not be a precondition for practicing 
one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal personality and related benefits&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58). Referring to the OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines for Review of 
Legislation pertaining to Religion or Belief, the Special Rapporteur would like to underline that </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 18 
 
high minimum membership requirements should not be allowed with respect to obtaining legal

<p><b>Communication envoy&#233;e le 9 octobre 2006 simultan&#233;ment au Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur le 
droit de toute personne de jouir du meilleur &#233;tat de sant&#233; physique et mentale susceptible 
d&#8217;&#234;tre atteint 
</b></p>
<p>57. Les Rapporteurs ont attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du gouvernement belge sur l&#8217;information selon 
laquelle, le 31 mai 2006, <b>Govind Prasad Srivastava</b>, &#233;tait arr&#234;t&#233; &#224; l&#8217;a&#233;roport de Bruxelles 
National &#224; la suite d&#8217;une demande d&#8217;Interpol, &#233;mise par les autorit&#233;s indiennes. Il est 
actuellement d&#233;tenu &#224; la prison de Forest dans l&#8217;attente de son extradition vers l&#8217;Inde. Govind 
Prasad Srivastava a soumis une requ&#234;te &#233;crite aux autorit&#233;s p&#233;nitentiaires pour rencontrer un 
conseiller religieux hindou, en particulier parce qu&#8217;il dit souffrir de d&#233;pression. Cette requ&#234;te 
aurait &#233;t&#233; rejet&#233;e. 
</p>
<p>58. En tant qu&#8217;adh&#233;rent &#224; la foi hindoue, il a des besoins alimentaires sp&#233;ciaux. Il ne mange 
pas de viande, de poisson ou d&#8217;&#339;ufs. De plus, il souffre du diab&#232;te, ce qui limite &#233;galement le 
type de nourriture qu&#8217;il peut recevoir. Apparemment, plusieurs demandes pour une alimentation 
appropri&#233;e &#224; son &#233;tat de sant&#233; ont &#233;t&#233; refus&#233;es par l&#8217;administration p&#233;nitentiaire. Depuis qu&#8217;il est 
d&#233;tenu, il n&#8217;a pas re&#231;u de nourriture qui convient &#224; ses croyances religieuses ou &#224; son diab&#232;te. Il 
aurait, en cons&#233;quence perdu 10 kg et souffrirait de d&#233;pression. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, ses 
parents avaient demand&#233; qu&#8217;il re&#231;oive une alimentation appropri&#233;e. Cependant, les autorit&#233;s 
p&#233;nitentiaires auraient refus&#233; ces requ&#234;tes en raison des r&#232;gles p&#233;nitentiaires. 
</p>
<p>59. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, l&#8217;administration p&#233;nitentiaire belge fournit un repas chaud 
par jour &#224; tous les prisonniers. Le repas est compos&#233; de viande, de l&#233;gumes et de pommes de terre 
ou de frites. Govind Prasad Srivastova ne mange pas de viande et n&#8217;est r&#233;guli&#232;rement pas en 
mesure de manger des l&#233;gumes car ils sont couverts par la sauce de la viande. 
</p>
<p>60. En vertu des r&#232;gles p&#233;nitentiaires, les alimentations sp&#233;ciales ne sont pas fournies aux 
prisonniers, sauf si le service m&#233;dical de la prison indique qu&#8217;un d&#233;tenu en particulier a besoin 
d&#8217;une alimentation sp&#233;ciale pour raisons m&#233;dicales. Selon les r&#232;gles de la prison, des d&#233;tenus qui 
ont une alimentation sp&#233;ciale en raison de leur croyances religieuses on autres convictions 
peuvent acheter d&#8217;autres types de nourriture &#224; la cantine, &#224; leurs frais, ou se la faire livrer par des 
communaut&#233;s religieuses locales. Cependant, Govind Prasad Srivastava pr&#233;tend que la nourriture 
disponible &#224; la cantine et convenant &#224; ses besoins, est limit&#233;e &#224; des &#171; snacks &#187; froids et qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y a 
pas de communaut&#233; hindoue locale qui livre de la nourriture aux d&#233;tenus hindous. 
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse dat&#233;e du 5 d&#233;cembre 2006 
</b></p>
<p>61. Le Gouvernement belge a r&#233;pondu que, selon le directeur principal de la prison de Forest, 
M. Govind Prasad Srivastana n&#8217;avait personnellement pas introduit de demande visant &#224; 
rencontrer un conseiller religieux hindou. Par contre, une demande de visite sign&#233;e par un certain 
&#171; Martin Gurvich &#187; est bien parvenue &#224; la prison de Forest. La requ&#234;te portait l&#8217;en-t&#234;te de 
&#171; Radhadesh, ch&#226;teau de petite Somme, association internationale pour la conscience de </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 19 
</p>
<p> 
Krishna &#187;. L&#8217;organisation &#233;tant consid&#233;r&#233;e comme une secte, la demande de visite a et&#233; refus&#233;e. 
Cette personne ne rentrant pas dans le champ d&#8217;application de l&#8217;article 72 de la loi de principes 
du 12 janvier 2005, elle ressortit donc au r&#233;gime ordinaire des visites. Ce r&#233;gime est toujours 
r&#233;gl&#233; par l&#8217;arr&#234;t&#233; royal du 21 mai 1965 portant r&#232;glement g&#233;n&#233;ral des &#233;tablissements 
p&#233;nitentiaires. Le gouvernement belge a &#233;galement fait r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; l&#8217;article 32 de cet arr&#234;t&#233; royal. 
</p>
<p>62. De plus, la loi 2 juin 1998, portant cr&#233;ation d&#8217;un centre d&#8217;information et d&#8217;avis sur les 
organisations sectaires nuisibles et d&#8217;une cellule administrative de coordination de la lutte contre 
les organisations sectaires nuisibles, d&#233;finit ce qu&#8217;il faut entendre par organisation sectaire 
nuisible et a cr&#233;e le Centre d&#8217;information et d&#8217;avis sur les organisations nuisibles (CIAOSN) 
</p>
<p>63. En ce qui concerne l&#8217;affirmation selon laquelle le d&#233;tenu n&#8217;aurait pas re&#231;u une nourriture 
appropri&#233;e en fonction de ses croyances religieuses, il faut remarquer que, d&#8217;une part, les d&#233;tenus 
qui ne d&#233;sirent pas manger de viande re&#231;oivent le repas normal sans viande, et, d&#8217;autre part, que 
la cantine offre une s&#233;rie d&#8217;articles alimentaires dont des fruits frais mais, effectivement, elle ne 
livre pas des repas chauds. 
</p>
<p>64. En ce qui concerne son &#233;tat de sant&#233; au cours de son incarc&#233;ration, le patient &#224; &#233;t&#233; vu neuf 
fois par le m&#233;decin g&#233;n&#233;raliste pour des probl&#232;mes de diab&#232;te et de tension art&#233;rielle. Une prise 
de sang a &#233;t&#233; effectu&#233;e, sa glyc&#233;mie contr&#244;l&#233;e en d&#233;but d&#8217;incarc&#233;ration tous les jours (parfois 
plusieurs fois par jour), et ce pendant un mois; ensuite, elle l&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; &#224; raison de deux fois par 
semaine, compte tenu de la stabilisation de son diab&#232;te. Il a aussi &#233;t&#233; vu deux fois par un 
cardiologue, pour des probl&#232;mes de tension, et une fois par un psychiatre, parce qu&#8217;il se sentait 
d&#233;prim&#233; et demandait du travail. Il n&#8217;est pas fait mention de perte de poids dans le dossier 
m&#233;dical ni de difficult&#233;s en ce qui concerne les repas. 
</p>
<p>65. Il importe de souligner que, l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; ayant &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233; en vue de son extradition le 10 
octobre 2006, l&#8217;enqu&#234;te men&#233;e n&#8217;a pas &#234;tre compl&#233;t&#233;e par une audition du d&#233;tenu, ce qui aurait 
permis de recouper les informations et d&#8217;apporter des pr&#233;cisions utiles. 
</p>
<p>66. Quant &#224; la l&#233;gislation applicable en mati&#232;re de d&#233;livrance d&#8217;une alimentation r&#233;pondant &#224; 
des besoins religieux ou m&#233;dicaux, le gouvernement belge a remarqu&#233; les suivantes dispositions 
l&#233;gales : les articles 87 et 107 de l&#8217;arr&#234;t&#233; minist&#233;riel du 12 juillet 1979, portant sur les instructions 
g&#233;n&#233;rales pour les &#233;tablissements p&#233;nitentiaires, la loi de principes concernant l&#8217;administration 
des &#233;tablissements p&#233;nitentiaires, sp&#233;cialement l&#8217;article 72, ainsi que le statut juridique des 
d&#233;tenus du 12 janvier 2005. 
</p>
<p>67. En r&#233;sum&#233;, selon la l&#233;gislation applicable, le d&#233;tenu aurait le droit de se faire livrer un 
repas &#171; convenant &#224; sa pratique religieuse &#187; pour autant que cela ne contrevienne pas &#224; l&#8217;une des 
trois conditions suivantes : 
</p>
<p>a) Le conseiller moral ou religieux d&#8217;un culte non reconnu ou d&#8217;une organisation non 
reconnue par la loi doit recevoir l&#8217;autorisation du directeur de livrer les repas; 
</p>
<p>b) Les repas d&#233;livr&#233;s doivent &#234;tre &#171; du m&#234;me type que ceux fournis aux autres 
d&#233;tenus &#187;; 
</p>
<p>c) L&#8217;intervention financi&#232;re dans ce type de repas ne peut pas d&#233;passer l&#8217;intervention 
maximale pr&#233;vue pour les repas livr&#233;s aux d&#233;tenus. </p>

<p>68. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale remercie le Gouvernement belge pour cette r&#233;ponse d&#233;taill&#233;e et 
pour avoir annex&#233; une synth&#232;se des bases juridiques sur lesquelles se fondent les organes 
repr&#233;sentatifs des diff&#233;rents cultes reconnus et de la la&#239;cit&#233; pour leurs rapports avec l&#8217;&#201;tat. La

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 12 July 2006 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they 
had received regarding two Christians <b>John Tamang alias Purna Bahadur Tamang</b> and 
<b>Benjamin Sharma alias Budhu Mani Dhungana</b> in the town of Paro, Western Bhutan. 
According to the information received, on 7 January 2006, John Tamang, alias Purna Bahadur 
Tamang, and Benjamin Sharma, alias Budhu Mani Dhungana, were arrested for screening the 
film &#8216;Jesus&#8217; in the town of Paro. The arrest was carried out by a Lt. Col. of the Crime and 
Investigation Department of Royal Bhutan Police (RBP) in Thimphu who punched and hit the 
two men during the arrest. They are thought to be held incommunicado in Thimphu. They have 
reportedly been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in detention.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 27 July 2006 
</b></p>
<p>70. Mr. Dhungana and Mr. Tamang are civil servants. Mr. Dhungana is a Chief Nurse in the 
Surgical Ward at Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital (JDWNRH), Thimphu, 
while Mr. Tamang is an Auditor at the Royal Audit Authority, also in Thimphu. According to the 
investigation carried out by the Government, the above mentioned two persons travelled from 
Thimphu to Nago village in Naja block under Paro district. On their way they gave a lift to Ms. 
Wangmo, who was returning to her village. On 7 January 2006, they stayed at Ms. Wangmo&#8217;s 
house. Posing as if they were on official duty, they instructed Ms. Wangmo&#8217;s daughter to call all 
the villagers to assemble at their house in order to have official discussions on faith. The villagers 
from 17 households went to Ms. Wangmo&#8217;s place. 
</p>
<p>71. They started the discussion with lectures and a film. During their discourse, Mr. 
Dhungana made derogatory remarks against the Spiritual Head of Bhutan, His Holiness the Je 
Khenpo. The villagers were deeply disturbed by these remarks and by the film, and made Mr. 
Dhungana and Mr. Tamang stop the discussion. The matter was reported to the nearest Royal </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 21 
</p>
<p> 
Bhutan Police station the same night by the village elder. Both Mr. Dhungana and Mr. Tamang 
were handed over to the Royal Bhutan Police on 8 January 2006. The next day, they were 
brought before the Court. They were charged for and found guilty of an offence of official 
misconduct under Section 294 of the Bhutan Penal Code, having violated also Article 9 of the 
National Security Act, an offence of deceptive practice under Section 309 of the Bhutan Penal 
Code, and an offence of breach of trust and criminal misappropriation of Government property 
under Sections 265 and 267 of the Bhutan Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>72. The above mentioned persons have not appealed the judgement. They are currently 
serving their sentences in Thimphu District Jail. They are allowed to receive visitors in 
accordance with the prison rules and they have actually been receiving visits from their family 
and friends on a daily basis. Moreover, they have not been detained incommunicado, as said in 
the urgent appeal sent to the Government; and medical attention is provided to all detainees if 
required by the individual concerned. 
</p>
<p>73. Regarding the arrest itself, it is incorrect what is alleged concerning the above mentioned 
Lt. Col., due to the fact that he was not present during the arrest. It is also untrue that both 
detainees have been subjected to torture and ill treatment. Torture is prohibited by law in Bhutan. 
Concerning the existing policies of the Government, people are free to practice any religion of 
their choice, but proselytism of any religion is prohibited in order to maintain and preserve 
society&#8217;s harmony. The right to freedom of religion or belief is guaranteed in the draft 
Constitution of Bhutan. To conclude, the Government also indicated that Bhutan has not faced 
sectarian or religious violence and that there is no social tension between people of different 
faiths. The Government continues to promote peaceful coexistence between the different 
religious groups in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response and she encourages the 
Government to reply also to her request to visit the country. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international 
human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Teaching and disseminating 
materials, including missionary activity&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. f). In her 2005 report 
to the General Assembly, she noted the following (see A/60/399, para. 62): &#8220;Whereas the scope 
of freedom afforded to persons for the practice of their religion or belief by producing and 
distributing information about their religion or belief is wide, certain limitations can be imposed 
in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. However, it should be noted that this 
article allows for restrictions only in very exceptional cases. In particular the fact that it mentions 
the protection of &#8220;<i>fundamental</i> rights and freedoms&#8221; (emphasis added) of others as a ground for 
restriction indicates a stronger protection than for some other rights whose limitation clauses refer 
simply to the &#8220;rights and freedoms of others&#8221; (e.g. article 12, 21 and 22). It could indeed be 
argued that the freedom of religion or belief of others can be regarded as such a fundamental right 
and freedom and would justify limitations to missionary activities, but the freedom of religion 
and belief of adults basically is a question of individual choice, so any generalized State 
limitation (e.g. by law) conceived to protect &#8220;others&#8217;&#8221; freedom of religion and belief by limiting 
the right of individuals to conduct missionary activities should be avoided.&#8221;  </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 December 2004 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteurs were informed that <b>Zhang Rongliang</b>, an underground church 
leader, was detained by police on 1 December 2004 in Xuzhai village. It was alleged that he was 
at risk of being tortured. Moreover, since he was diabetic, concern was expressed that he would 
not have access to the medication or treatment he needed. It was reported that his wife and child 
were in hiding. According to witnesses, police searched every household in the above mentioned 
village and confiscated DVDs about Christianity, other materials and photos revealing Zhang&#8217;s 
connections with foreigners. Reports indicated that Zhang Rongliang was the leader of the China 
for Christ Church and of the Protestant Fangcheng Mother Church. He was the co-author of 
<i>House Churches of China - Confession of Faith and Declaration</i>. Zhang Rongliang had already 
been imprisoned five times for his beliefs, for a total of 12 years, during which time he was 
allegedly tortured. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 12 May 2005 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Government informs that Zhang Rongliang is a male aged 52, from Fangcheng 
County, Henan Province. In the beginning of 2003, he inveigled people&#8217;s police officers at the 
Zhengzhou Xinmi public security bureau Chengguan (outlying areas) police station, in Henan 
Province, into forging residence and identity documents for himself and family members (10 
people in all), and used the forged identity documents at the Xinmi public security bureau in 
2004 to apply for and obtain passports. The public security authorities found out in time and 
annulled the residence documents and passports. Zhang&#8217;s conduct was a contravention of article 
319 of the Criminal Code and he was suspected of using or possessing fraudulent travel 
documents. On 1 December 2004, acting under article 61 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the 
Henan Province public security authorities took Zhang into criminal custody. Investigations into 
the case are in progress. 
</p>
<p>77. The Government highlights that China&#8217;s Constitution and laws clearly stipulate that 
citizens have the right to freedom of religion and belief. Article 36 of the Constitution stipulates 
that &#8220;citizens of the People&#8217;s Republic of China have freedom of religion and belief&#8221;. But the 
article goes on by saying that &#8220;no one shall make use of religion to disturb public order, damage 
citizens&#8217; health or obstruct the operation of the national education system.&#8221; The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, while acknowledging the various rights that people have, also 
clearly states that, in exercising their rights and liberties, people are subject to the limits laid 
down by law. The present case is one of a breach of the criminal law, and the action taken by the 
Chinese law-enforcement authorities against Zhang Rongliang was entirely based on his criminal 
conduct and unrelated to issues of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>78. The Government informs that accusations made in the communication are groundless. 
The Chinese law-enforcement authorities acted strictly in accordance with the Criminal Code, 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, etc.; the question of arbitrary detention does not arise. China </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 23 
</p>
<p> 
was one of the first States to become party to the Convention against Torture. It upholds the 
prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and has 
adopted many specific measures under domestic law. In handling the case in question, the 
relevant Chinese Government departments abided strictly by their treaty obligations and 
proceeded in accordance with domestic law. There was no instance of torture or ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>79. The Chinese Government has always taken great care to safeguard the legitimate rights of 
convicts and detainees. The Prisons Act and the Remand Facility Regulations cover all aspects of 
the protection of offenders&#8217; and detainees&#8217; rights including their right to security of the person, 
lawful possessions, health protection and education, and their rights to a defence, to appeal, to 
lodge complaints and report matters to the authorities, and such other rights as have not been 
restricted or taken from them by law. All legitimate rights of Zhang Rongliang have been 
safeguarded, and it is not true that when he fell ill he was refused medical treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. She would like to make 
reference to the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak, of his mission to China from 20 November to 2 
December 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, para. 81): &#8220;In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the 
combination of deprivation of liberty as a sanction for the peaceful exercise of freedom of 
expression, assembly and religion, with measures of re-education through coercion, humiliation 
and punishment aimed at admission of culpability and altering the personality of detainees up to 
the point of even breaking their will, strike at the very core of the human right to personal 
integrity, dignity and humanity. It constitutes a form of inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment leading to submissiveness and a &#8216;culture of fear&#8217;, which is incompatible with the core 
values of any democratic society based upon a culture of human rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 13 September 2005 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences  
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteurs brought the two following cases to the attention of the 
Government: On 21 May 2002, police officers from the Zhonggong police station arrested Ms. 
<b>Ren Shujie</b>, aged 42, living in the Tiexi District, Shengyang City, Liaoning Province, for 
practicing Falun Gong. She was later sentenced to three years of forced labour and was detained 
at the Longshan Labour Camp. No charges were brought against her and she was provided no 
hearing before a court of law. She went on hunger strike for 64 days, during which time she was 
subjected to torture and harsh labour for fifteen hours daily. After bringing an end to her hunger 
strike she continued to be tortured by the prison guards, including Tang Yubao, who subjected her 
to electric shocks. On 22 March 2004, she was transferred to Masanjia Labour Camp where she 
was forced to sleep on cement floors for three months. She was released on 24 December 2004, 
due to her extremely weak conditions, weighing less than 40 kg, whereas at the time of her arrest 
she weighed 80 kg. The several complaints that Ren Shujie made to the prison guards, who were 
the only authorities she had access to, provided no response or amelioration to her conditions of 
detention.  
</p>
<p>82. On 21 January 2000, Ms. <b>Liu Yunxiang</b>, aged 32, living in Yangjiazhuang village in 
Junbukou Township was arrested by police officers belonging to the Junbukou Township of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 24 
 
Weifang City in Shandong province, for practicing Falun Gong. No charges were brought against 
her and she was provided no hearing before a court of law. She was subjected to severe beatings, 
and the men who were also arrested with her were forced to beat her and the other arrested 
women on their hips. During her detention, she was forced to curse the founder of Falun Gong, 
drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, which is against Falun Gong principles. As a result of this 
treatment, Ms. Liu Yunxiang miscarried. She was released after having paid for her release. In the 
Summer of 2001, she was arrested again for practicing Falun Gong and was once again subjected 
to torture including electric shocks, as a result of which she miscarried a second time. After 
twenty days of torture, she was sent to a detention centre for another month, after which she was 
released.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 12 December 2005 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Government informed that Ren Shujie, female, was born in February 1964 in Han 
Chinese. She was educated to lower middle-school level, from Shengyang City, Liaoning 
Province; formerly on the kitchen staff at the Shengyang New Model Building Materials 
Corporation. She was assigned to three years&#8217; re-education through labour (21 May 2002 to 20 
May 2005) in April 2002 for disrupting public order and committed to the Longshan Re-
education through Labour Facility in Shengyang on 21 May 2002. On 22 March 2004 she was 
moved to the provincial Masanjia Facility. During her assignment she resisted education and 
often refused to eat, but under careful, patient coaxing from the wardens she resumed eating 
normally. There was no question of ill-treatment during her period of re-education. Upon the 
completion of her term she was released in high spirits and good health.  
</p>
<p>84. Liu Yunxiang, female, aged 38, is from Weifang City in Shandong Province. She was 
taken into criminal custody by the local public security authorities in October 2000 for disturbing 
the peace, but released after being taught a lesson. On 30 August 2001, with the approval of the 
local Re-education through Labour Management Committee, she was assigned to three years re-
education for repeatedly distributing, putting up and spray-painting Falun Gong cult material. 
She was granted early release from re-education on 1 December 2003. Throughout their handling 
of this case the public security authorities acted rigorously, properly and in a civilized manner. 
They did not cause Ms. Liu to have a miscarriage. The claims of beatings and electric shocks are 
sheer rumour mongering.  
</p>
<p>85. The Government wants to clarify that respect and upholding freedom of religion and 
belief is one of the Chinese Government&#8217;s basic national policies. China has over 100 million 
religious adherents and about 300,000 clerics. The rule of law prevails, and the Constitution 
guarantees citizens&#8217; freedom of religion. No one can be attacked for their religious beliefs. In the 
cases at issue, Ren and Liu were subjected to re-education through labour for activities that 
disrupted public order; their treatment had nothing to do with freedom of religion.  
</p>
<p>86. China was one of the first States to become party to the Convention against Torture, and 
strictly prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment. Its 
laws clearly establish that detainees have extensive rights. The Penal Code, Code of Criminal 
Procedure, Prisons Act and much other legislation strictly prohibit beatings, abuse, corporal 
punishment and ill-treatment. When violations of detainees&#8217; rights come to light, those 
responsible are punished in accordance with the law. In dealing with the cases above, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 25 
</p>
<p> 
Chinese Government departments concerned complied strictly with their treaty obligations and 
acted within national law. There was no ill-treatment or use of torture. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. She would like to make 
reference to her predecessor&#8217;s conclusions after his country visit to China from 19 to 30 
November 1994 (E/CN.4/1995/91, para. 189): &#8220;The Special Rapporteur considers that there must 
be no interference with religious activity falling within the scope of the 1981 Declaration. At all 
events, there must not be any surveillance of a kind to infringe the right to freedom of belief and 
to manifest one&#8217;s belief. With regard to sects, the Special Rapporteur particularly wishes to point 
out that the 1981 Declaration protects not only religion, but also theist beliefs and that article 1, 
paragraph 3, of that Declaration states that freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief may be 
subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public 
safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur continues to be very concerned by the continued violations of 
freedom of religion or belief suffered by members of the Falun Gong. In her previous reports to 
the Commission on Human Rights, she explicitly mentioned members of the Falun Gong as 
targets of various human rights violations because of their beliefs and she strongly condemns the 
continued lack of freedom of belief of members of Falun Gong (see E/CN.4/2005/61, paras. 37-
38 and E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, para. 109). 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for the invitation it has 
extended in 2004 for a follow-up visit and she hopes to receive a reply from the Government 
further to her last letter of September 2006 requesting dates for this visit.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 6 December 2005 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China information they had received regarding five Buddhist monks from Drepung 
Monastery in Lhasa. Their names are <b>Ngawang Namdrol</b> of Tsotod Township, Phenpo 
Lhundrup County, Lhasa Municipality; <b>Ngawang Nyingpo</b> of Khartse Township, Phenpo 
Lhundrup Country, Lhasa Municipality; <b>Ngawang Thupen a.k.a. Shogbu Metok</b> of Lhasa Inner 
City, Lhasa Municipality; <b>Khenpo Ngawang Phelgyal</b> of Rinpung County, Shigatse Prefecture 
and <b>Phuntsok Thupwang</b> of Gongkar County, Lhoka Prefecture. According to the allegations 
received, on 23 November 2005, the five monks were arrested following a patriotic re-education 
ceremony that had been taking place at Drepung Monastery in Lhasa since October 2005. They 
were handed over to the Public Security Bureau of their respective places of origin after they 
refused to sign a statement denouncing the Dalai Lama and recognizing Tibet as a part of China. 
They are currently being held in Public Security Bureau places of detention. There are concerns 
that they may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>91. On 25 November 2005, approximately <b>400 monks</b> held a silent sit-down protest in the 
monastery courtyard. There is concern that members of the army and officers from the People&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 26 
 
Armed Police and the Public Security Bureau beat a number of the monks in thier efforts to 
disperse them.  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteurs also brought to the attention of the Government information 
they received concerning <b>Tsering Dhondup</b>, aged 30, a monk at Sera Monastery, near Lhasa and 
<b>Changchup Gyaltsen</b>, a disciplinarian at Sera Monastery. According to the information 
received, in July 2005, the authorities expelled Changchup Gyaltsen from Sera Monastery after 
he read out a request for prayer, which referred to the Dalai Lama. He was placed under 
surveillance for a year. Tsering Dhondup, who is alleged to have drafted the prayer, disappeared 
on the same day. He is thought to be held incommunicado at Gutsa prison in northern Lhasa. He 
is alleged to have possessed and distributed documents criticizing China and supporting Tibetan 
independence.   
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 12 January 2006 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Government indicated that, recently, five monks at the Drepung monastery in the 
Tibet Autonomous Region were expelled from the monastery by the monastery&#8217;s management 
committee, for having breached the monastery regulations. After announcement of this 
administrative decision, a number of monks from the monastery came to the management 
committee to demand an explanation. After hearing the explanation provided by the committee, 
the assembled monks all dispersed and the five monks who had been expelled also expressed 
their acceptance of the decision and returned to their places of origin. Drepung monastery 
remains open to the public and its religious activities are continuing as normal. Throughout this 
entire process, there has been no instance of any monk being physically or verbally assaulted or 
detained, nor has any monastery been shut down. 
</p>
<p>94. The Government also explained that article 36 of the Chinese Constitution stipulates that 
&#8220;Citizens of the People&#8217;s Republic of China enjoy freedom of religion and belief.&#8221; In accordance 
with the law, the Chinese Government protects the conduct of normal religious activities by the 
congregation of Buddhist clergy and laity. Currently, there are more than 40,000 monks and nuns 
living in more than 1,700 Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
other religious centres, engaging freely in the study of Buddhist scriptures and conducting all 
kinds of religious activities. The right to freedom of religious assembly and religious belief is 
fully respected and their religious needs are fully satisfied. The Government affirms that any 
person going to Tibet and gaining an understanding of the real situation will reach this same 
conclusion. 
</p>
<p>95. In the Tibet Autonomous Region, the monks of every monastery elect their own 
monastery management committees through a democratic process, enact democratic management 
rules for each monastery and carry out its routine work. Each monastery, acting in accordance 
with the relevant management rules, carries out an assessment at regular intervals of the monks 
under its responsibility, the content of which includes such topics as religious regulations and 
precepts, monastic rules and general knowledge of the law.  
</p>
<p>96. The five monks from Drepung monastery were expelled by the monastery&#8217;s management 
committee because they had breached the monastery rules and had failed the relevant assessment: 
this demonstrates that the monastery&#8217;s management committee was carrying out its routine 
duties, according to the internal running of the monastery, acting in accordance with the relevant </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 27 
</p>
<p> 
provisions of Chinese law and the democratic management rules of the monastery, and it has 
nothing whatsoever to do with freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>97. The case of Tsering Dhondupo and Changchup Gyaltsen, monks at Sera monastery in the 
Tibet Autonomous Region and also mentioned in the communication, is in the process of being 
investigated by the Chinese Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Additional response from the Government dated 18 April 2006 
</b></p>
<p>98. The Chinese Government has carefully examined the circumstances of the two monks 
from Sera Monastery, Tsering Dhondup and Changchup Gyaltsen.  
</p>
<p>99. Mi Ma, which is the dharma name of Changchup Gyaltsen (male, ethnic Tibetan, born in 
1963, resident of Phenpo Lundup, county of Lhasa, Tibet) was expelled from the monastery for 
engaging in activities within Sera monastery calling for the division of Chinese territory and has 
currently returned to his place of origin. 
</p>
<p>100. Tsering Dhondup, which is the dharma name of Ngawang Y&#246;nten (male, ethnic Tibetan, 
born 1976, resident of Phenpo Lundup, county of Lhasa, Tibet) was detained on 26 August 2005 
by the Tibetan public security authorities, in accordance with the law, for preparing propaganda 
materials calling for &#8220;Tibetan independence&#8221; and advocating division of the State. On 25 October 
2005, proceedings were instituted against him, in accordance with the law, by the Lhasa people&#8217;s 
procurator&#8217;s office on suspicion of the offence of fomenting division of the State. 
</p>
<p>101. Article 52 of the Chinese Constitution stipulates that &#8220;It is the duty of citizens of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China to safeguard the unity of the country and the unity of all its 
nationalities.&#8221; China is a country run by the rule of law and its people - regardless of whether or 
not they are religious believers - are all obliged to respect Chinese law and may not conduct 
activities in the name of religion which are in breach of the law. 
</p>
<p>102. The two men referred to above, on repeated occasions, prepared propaganda materials 
which advocated division of the Chinese State and conducted activities calling for the division of 
Chinese territory, violated Chinese law and the relevant provisions of the monastery regulations 
and received the appropriate penalty. The Government states that all this has nothing to do with 
freedom of religious belief. 
</p>
<p>103.  The Chinese judicial authorities acted in strict accordance with laws and regulations under 
the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure and other instruments, and 
there was no question of any &#8220;arbitrary detention&#8221; or &#8220;torture&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s responses. She would also like 
to thank the Government for the invitation it has extended in 2004 for a follow-up visit and she 
hopes to receive a reply from the Government further to her last letter of September 2006 
requesting dates for this visit.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>105. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning <b>two female Falun Gong practitioners</b>. According to the information 
received, on the night of 24 November 2005, one woman aged 51 was abducted by an estimated 
seven policemen. Her home was ransacked and all Falun Gong materials were seized. She was 
taken to Dongchengfang Town Police Station in Tunzhou City, Hebei Province, where she was 
interrogated, beaten with rubber clubs and shocked with stun batons. At approximately 2 p.m. on 
25 November 2005, a police officer took her to a room, where he lifted her shirt and touched her 
breasts. He then shocked her breasts with a stun baton. Another police officer came into the room 
and raped her. During the rape, he repeatedly slapped her in the face. He then brought another 
woman aged 42 into the same room and raped her too. The two rapes took place in the presence 
of another police officer, who made no attempt to intervene or prevent the incidents.      
</p>

<p><b>Communication sent on 11 August 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in 
women and children 
</b></p>
<p>107.  The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning <b>organ harvesting</b>. According to the allegations received, organ harvesting 
has been inflicted on a large number of unwilling Falun Gong practitioners at a wide variety of 
locations, for the purpose of making available organs for transplant operations. Vital organs 
including hearts, kidneys, livers and corneas were systematically harvested from Falun Gong 
practitioners at Sujiatan Hospital, Shenyang, Liaoning province, beginning in 2001. The 
practitioners were given injections to induce heart failure, and therefore were killed in the course 
of the organ harvesting operations or immediately thereafter. 
</p>
<p>108. It is reported that employees of several transplant centres have indicated that they have 
used organs from live Falun Gong practitioners for transplants. After the organs were removed, 
the bodies were cremated, and no corpse is left to examine for identification as the source of an 
organ transplant. Once the organs were removed they were shipped to transplant centres to be 
used for transplants for both domestic and foreign patients. Officials from several detention 
facilities have indicated that courts have been involved in the administering the use of organs 
from Falun Gong detainees.   
</p>
<p>109. It is reported that there are many more organ transplants than identifiable sources of 
organs, even taking into account figures for identifiable sources, namely: estimates of executed 
prisoners annually, of which a high percentage of organs are donated by, according to the 
statement in 2005 of the Vice Minister of Health Mr. Huang Jiefu; willing donor family members, 
who for cultural reasons, are often reluctant to donate their organs after death; and brain-dead 
donors. Moreover, the reportedly short waiting times that have been advertised for perfectly-</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 29 
</p>
<p> 
matched organs would suggest the existence of a computerized matching system for transplants 
and a large bank of live prospective donors. 
</p>
<p>110. It is alleged that the discrepancy between available organs and numbers from identifiable 
sources is explained by organs harvested from Falun Gong practitioners, and that the rise in 
transplants from 2000 coincides and correlates with the beginning of the persecution of these 
persons. 
</p>
<p>111.  On organ transplants, in general, it has been reported that in March 2006, legislation was 
introduced which bans the sale of human organs and requires the donor to give written 
permission. The legislation also limits transplants to certain institutions, which must verify the 
source of the organs. This law came in force on 1 July 2006. Contrary to the Government 
assertion that human organs have been prohibited from sale, in accordance with the 1991 WHO 
guiding principles, it has been reported that up to this time Chinese law has allowed the buying 
and selling of organs, has not required that donors give written permission for their organs to be 
transplanted, there has been no restriction on the institutions which could engage in organ 
harvesting or transplants, there was no requirement that the institutions engaged in transplants 
had to verify that the organs being transplanted were from legal sources, and there was no 
obligation to have transplant ethics committees approve all transplants in advance. Moreover, 
evidence exists, for example, that at least up until April 2006 price lists for organ transplants in 
China were published on the Internet.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 November 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>112. The Government replied that in March 2006, Falun Gong began fabricating the so-called 
&#8220;Sujiatun Concentration Camp&#8221; issue, saying that 6,000 Falun Gong practitioners had been 
incarcerated in Sujiatun Hospital in Shenyang, Liaoyang Province and that two thirds of them had 
had organs removed from their living bodies and the corpses cremated to destroy the evidence. In 
order to clarify the facts, the Sujiatun District Government carried out an investigation at the 
hospital; domestic and foreign media including Japan&#8217;s NHK and Hong Kong&#8217;s Phoenix Satellite 
Network and Ta Kung Pao conducted on-the-scene interviews; and two visits were paid by 
consular personnel from the US embassy. Based on the results of these investigations it was 
discovered that the hospital only had 300 beds and was completely incapable of housing more 
than 6,000 persons. There was no such basement for incarcerating Falun Gong practitioners, as 
alleged by Falun Gong. The so-called &#8220;cremation oven&#8221; announced by Falun Gong is in fact a 
boiler/furnace room, whose primary function is to provide heat and disinfect medical instruments. 
This boiler room has several transparent glass windows and a lawn outside that is open to the 
public where nearby residents come daily to stroll. In such a place, with such a physical setting, 
there is simply no way to cremate corpses in secret, continuously, and in large volume. The 
rumors fabricated by Falun Gong collapse on their own. Everyone recognizes that Sujiatun 
Hospital is nothing but a simple hospital and that there is no evidence to show that it is being 
used for any purpose other than as a public hospital. This once again proves that the &#8220;Sujiatun 
Concentration Camp&#8221; fabricated by Falun Gong is nothing more than a rumor. 
</p>
<p>113. As a WHO member-state, the Chinese Government resolutely abides by the WHO&#8217;s 1991 
Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplants and strictly forbids the sale of human organs. 
Human organ donation must be done voluntarily and with the written consent of the donor. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 30 
</p><p> 
114. The human organ transplant regulations that took effect on 1 July 2006 reiterate that 
human organs must not be sold, that human organs used for transplant by medical facilities must 
have the written consent of the donor, that a donor has the right to refuse to donate before the 
organ transplant takes place, and that medical facilities carrying out human organ transplants 
must have the capacity to ensure medical quality and safety in accordance with ethical principles. 
The goal of these regulations is to standardize and improve the management of clinical practice 
of human organ transplant operations in order to safeguard medical quality and safety. 
</p>
<p>115. Presently, the relevant Chinese Government agencies are drafting Human Organ 
Transplant Regulations in order to create the necessary regulation of human organ donation, 
registration, matching, and transplant. 
</p>
<p>116. China absolutely does not allow forced donation or trafficking in the corpses or organs of 
executed criminals, which are used in strict accordance with the relevant regulations. Notably: (1) 
Written consent must be received from the criminal to be executed and his family; (2) Approval 
must be received from the provincial-level health authority and the provincial-level higher 
people&#8217;s court; (3) The unit using the organs must have the approval of the health authorities at 
the provincial level or higher and must have the authority/capacity to conduct medical science 
research or transplant operations. 
</p>
<p>117. The question of organ donation is not part of the inquiries made at the time of execution. 
Those death-row criminals who wish to donate their corpse or organs after they are executed 
must express this voluntarily in writing. Mobile Execution Vehicles are used solely by the courts 
to carry out execution by lethal injection. They do not, and are strictly forbidden to, transport 
organs. According to Chinese laws and regulations, individuals who are sentenced to death are 
those criminals who have committed extremely serious crimes and who should be sentenced to 
death and executed immediately, not whether they are Falun Gong practitioners. For this reason, 
there are no statistical data for Falun Gong practitioners who have been executed. 
</p>
<p>118. In order to deal with the problem of organ supply, each country typically uses two 
methods: firstly, to increase social awareness and mobilize the population to donate organs; and 
secondly, to facilitate live organ donation and transplant between relatives. China&#8217;s methods are 
not exceptions, but it has placed serious restrictions: citizens who donate live organs must be at 
least 18 years old and be in possession of full civil capacities; the live organ recipient must be the 
spouse, direct blood relative, or within three generations of collateral blood relatives. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

of torture 
</b></p>
<p>120. The Special Rapporteurs received information concerning <b>Bu Dongwei (also known as 
David Bu)</b>, aged 38, and Falun Gong practitioner. According to the allegations received, on 19 
May 2006, he was detained by around seven police officers at his home in the Haidian district of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 31 
</p>
<p> 
Beijing. On 19 June 2006, he was assigned to two and a half years re-education through labour in 
connection with his activities as a member of the Falun Gong spiritual movement by Beijing&#8217;s 
Re-education through Labour Committee, which has the power to impose periods of arbitrary 
detention without charge or trial. He was accused of &#8220;resisting the implementation of national 
laws&#8221; and &#8220;disturbing social order&#8221; on the basis of evidence including a verbal confession he 
made to the police and 80 copies of Falun Gong literature discovered in his home. He is due to be 
released on 18 November 2008. 
</p>
<p>121. Despite repeated requests to the authorities, his family has not been told where he is being 
detained although unconfirmed reports have been received that he may have been transferred to 
Tuanhe Re-education through Labour facility in Beijing on 21 August 2006. There are concerns 
that he is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Bu Dongwei had previously served a term of ten 
months re-education through labour from August 2000 to May 2001 in Tuanhe for &#8216;using a 
heretical organization to disrupt the implementation of the law&#8217; after he petitioned the authorities 
asking them to review their ban on Falun Gong. During this period, he was reportedly beaten and 
made to sit all day in a small chair. He was also subjected to sleep deprivation aimed at forcing 
him to renounce his belief in Falun Gong.

<p>123. The Special Rapporteurs were informed that cartoons representing the prophet 
Muhammad in a defamatory and derogatory manner were published in the newspaper Jyllands-
Posten in the course of September 2005. It was reported that the series of cartoons were 
published after a writer complained that nobody dared illustrate his book about Muhammad. 
Following the publication, two cartoons illustrators allegedly received death threats.  
</p>
<p>124. The Special Rapporteurs, while believing that limitations to the freedom of expression 
have to be applied in a restrictive manner, expressed their concern regarding actions that seem to 
reveal intolerance and absence of respect for the religion of others, particularly in the aftermath 
of 11 September 2001. Such actions may also constitute threats to the religious harmony of a 
society, and the source of incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence on the basis of 
religion which are prohibited by article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>125. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide them with information as 
to whether the facts alleged in the summary of the case were accurate, whether a complaint had 
been lodged by or on behalf of the persons affected by the consequences of these publications 
and whether any judicial or administrative decision had been taken so far. The Special 
Rapporteurs also requested information about the existing policy measures to promote religious 
tolerance and the ones to closely monitor that kind of developments. </p>

<b>Additional responses from the Government dated 31 January 2006, 3 February 2006 and 
16 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>126. Subsequent to its response dated 24 January 2006, which has already been reflected in 
the previous communications report (see E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, paras. 113-115), the 
Government informed the Special Rapporteurs in further letters dated 31 January 2006, 3 
February 2006 and 16 March 2006 of recent developments concerning this issue. On 31 January 
2006, the Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, made a statement where he informed 
that the Danish Daily, Jyllands-Posten, had apologized for the indisputable offence to the Muslim 
world. He hopes that the apology made will contribute to comfort those who have been hurt. The 
Prime Minister also informs that the mentioned apology has been positively received by Muslim 
communities in Denmark and that these have pledged support for the efforts made. He also calls 
on all parties to abstain from any statement or action that will create further tension. In an 
interview on the TV news channel Al-Arabyia on 2 February 2006, the Danish Prime Minister 
stressed the value he attached to the close relationship based on mutual respect and friendship 
between Denmark and the Muslim world.  
</p>
<p>127. On 16 March 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that the Danish 
Director of Public Prosecutions had decided not to institute criminal proceeding in the case of the 
article &#8220;The Face of Muhammed&#8221;, which was published on 30 September 2005. The Danish 
Director of Public Prosecutions explained that in his opinion there was neither violation of 
section 140 of the Danish Criminal Code (mockery or scorn of religious doctrines or acts of 
worship of any lawfully existing religious community in Denmark) nor of section 266b of the 
Danish Criminal Code (public statement or imparting other information by which a group of 
people are threatened, scorned or degraded on account of their race, colour, national or ethnic 
origin, religion or sexual inclination). The decision of the Danish Director of Public Prosecutions 
cannot be appealed to a higher administrative authority, as stipulated in Section 99(3) of the 
Danish Administration of Justice Act. Furthermore he stressed that although there was no basis 
for instituting criminal proceedings in this case, it should be noted that both provisions of the 
Danish Criminal Code contain a restriction of the freedom of expression. To the extent publicly 
made expressions fall within the scope of these rules there is, therefore, no free and unrestricted 
right to express opinions about religious subjects. It is thus not a correct description of existing 
law when the article in Jyllands-Posten states that it is incompatible with the right to freedom of 
expression to demand special consideration for religious feelings and one has to be ready to put 
up with &#8220;scorn, mockery and ridicule&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>128. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s additional responses and she

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 December 2005 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture  
</b></p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding <b>Helen Berhane</b>, aged 30, a prominent Christian singer. According to the 
allegations, on 13 May 2004, she was arrested during an operation led by the Ministry of 
Defence. She is allegedly being detained in a shipping container at the Mai Serwa military base, 
north of Asmara. The reasons for her detention are thought to be linked to her activities as a 
prominent Christian singer. She is being held incommunicado and has not been brought before a 
judge, despite the fact that the Eritrean Constitution requires that detainees be brought before a 
judge within 48 hours of being arrested. According to the information received, the Ministry of 
Defence has been placing pressure on her to sign a statement renouncing her faith and promising 
to cease her participation in any Christian activities in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>130. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to take the opportunity 
to remind the Government of article 18(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his 
freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.&#8221; Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the 
international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom from 
coercion&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 2). In her 2005 report to the General Assembly 
(A/60/399, para. 50) she states that &#8220;[t]he fact that the prohibition of coercion was made explicit 
shows that the drafters of the Covenant found the freedom provided by paragraph 1 to be so 
significant that any form of coercion by the State was impermissible, independently of whether 
the coercion was physical or in the form of State-sponsored incentives. According to the Human 
Rights Committee: &#8216;Article 18.2 bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a 
religion or belief, including the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel 
believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs and congregations, to recant their 
religion or belief or to convert. Policies or practices having the same intention or effect, such as, 
for example, those restricting access to education, medical care, employment or the rights 
guaranteed by article 25 and other provisions of the Covenant, are similarly inconsistent with 
article 18.2&#8217; (general comment No. 22, para. 5).&#8221;

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 November 2006 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture  
</b></p>
<p>131. The Special Rapporteurs and the Chairperson-Rapporteur received information 
concerning <b>Immanuel Andegergesh</b> and <b>Kibrom Firemichael,</b> ten other unidentified members 
of the Rema Church in Adi-Quala town, and one hundred and sixty unidentified members of 
banned Christian churches, including Kale Hiwot (Word of God) Church, the Full Gospel 
Church, the Church of the Living God and the Rema church in Mendefera town. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 34 
</p><p> 
132. According to the allegations received, on 15 October 2006, 12 members of the Rema 
church were arrested in Adi-Quala town, south of Mendefera, for taking part in Christian worship 
in a private home. Two of them, Immanuel Andegergesh and Kibrom Firemichael, died in a 
nearby army camp as a result of torture to make them abandon their faith. 
</p>
<p>133. On 15 and 16 October 2006, one hundred and sixty members of banned Christian 
churches were arrested at their homes in Mendefera town, 50 km south of the capital Asmara. 
The individuals are members of the Kale Hiwot (Word of God) Church, the Full Gospel Church, 
the Church of the Living God and the Rema Church. It is not known where they are detained and 
there are concerns that they may be subjected to torture and ill-treatment in an effort to force 
them to sign a document agreeing to stop worshipping.   
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>134. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to take the opportunity 
to remind the Government of article 6 of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, according to which the right to 
freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief includes the freedom, &#8220;(a) To worship or 
assemble in connection with a religion or belief&#8221;. She also refers to her above mentioned 
observations concerning the urgent appeal sent on 7 December 2005. 
</p>
<p>135. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to make reference to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to worship&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. a). As she noted in 
her 2005 report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;members of religious communities or 
communities of belief, whenever they find themselves in places of worship, are in a situation of 
special vulnerability given the nature of their activity. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the 
opinion that States should pay increased attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that 
all perpetrators of such attacks are properly prosecuted and tried.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 49). 
</p>
<p>136. Finally, the Special Rapporteur hopes to receive a reply from the Government further to 
her letter sent in 2004 asking for an invitation to visit Eritrea to assess the situation of freedom of 
religion or belief.

</b></p>
<p>137. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale a attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement fran&#231;ais sur l&#8217;information 
re&#231;ue concernant le rapport de la MIVILUDES (Mission interminist&#233;rielle de vigilance et de lutte 
contre les d&#233;rives sectaires) pour l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2005, qui aurait cit&#233;, pour la premi&#232;re fois depuis sa

de la publication dudit rapport, le pr&#233;sident de la MIVILUDES aurait d&#233;clar&#233; le 26 avril 2006, sur 
les ondes d&#8217;une station radiophonique publique nationale, que &#171; <i>Des contacts ont pu &#234;tre pris, et

</p>
<p>138. Or, les Fr&#232;res de Plymouth auraient d&#233;j&#224; rencontr&#233;, sur leur propre initiative, les 8 octobre 
2003 et 12 mai 2004, les responsables de la MIVILUDES et &#233;chang&#233; des correspondances &#224; 
plusieurs reprises. De plus, selon les d&#233;clarations publiques pr&#233;cit&#233;es, le travail de v&#233;rification 
concernant ce mouvement protestant n&#8217;aurait pas &#233;t&#233; entrepris avant la publication du rapport les 
mettant en cause. Du fait d&#8217;une large diffusion de ce rapport officiel, les Fr&#232;res de Plymouth 
feraient face &#224; un certain nombre de difficult&#233;s, telles que le refus de contrat d&#8217;assurance 
concernant leurs biens et des articles de presse diffusant des mises en cause infamantes non 
v&#233;rifi&#233;es de la MIVILUDES. 
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse dat&#233;e du 20 novembre 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>139. Le Gouvernement fran&#231;ais a r&#233;pondu que les objectifs de la MIVILUDES sont 
d&#8217;observer et d&#8217;analyser le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne des mouvements &#224; caract&#232;re sectaire, dont les agissements 
sont attentatoires aux droits de l&#8217;homme et aux libert&#233;s fondamentales ou constituent une menace 
&#224; l&#8217;ordre public ou sont contraires aux lois et r&#232;glements. 
</p>
<p>140. Dans se cadre, la MIVILUDES a restreint sa mission de vigilance &#224; la seule Union 
nationale des Fr&#232;res de Plymouth de France (UNFPF) et &#224; ses composants. Les extraits du 
rapport de 2005 de la MIVILUDES, sur lesquels la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale a attir&#233; l&#8217;attention, ne 
concernent que les Fr&#232;res de Plymouth n&#176;4 (FP n&#176;4), appel&#233;s &#233;galement les Fr&#232;res exclusifs, 
Fr&#232;res de Plymouth de la Voie &#233;troite ou &#171; les Purs &#187;. La MIVILUDES &#233;tait pr&#233;occup&#233;e par les 
pratiques de scolarisation des enfants des familles membres de l&#8217;UNFPF. D&#8217;abord, 
l&#8217;enseignement public &#233;tait la r&#232;gle pour la majorit&#233; des enfants des familles des FP n&#176;4, ensuite 
un nombre croissant d&#8217;entre eux ont &#233;t&#233; inscrits au Centre national d&#8217;enseignement &#224; distance. 
Ult&#233;rieurement, les <i>FP n&#176;4</i> ont d&#233;cid&#233;, en 2005, de cr&#233;er une association priv&#233;e d&#8217;enseignement &#224; 
distance, apparemment exclusivement compos&#233;e de leurs enfants, puis, enfin, d&#8217;ouvrir des locaux 
qu&#8217;ils ont acquis pour les d&#233;dier &#224; l&#8217;activit&#233; d&#8217;enseignement. 
</p>
<p>141. C&#8217;&#233;tait le statut d&#8217;un local situ&#233; &#224; Chambon-sur-Lignon (Haute-Loire) qui posait le 
principal probl&#232;me &#224; l&#8217;&#233;poque. Ce local fonctionnait sur la base d&#8217;un enseignement par 
correspondance incomplet : non-enseignement de la biologie et non-pratique du sport, mati&#232;res 
obligatoires dans l&#8217;enseignement fran&#231;ais, ne respectant pas en cela les d&#233;crets d&#8217;application de 
la loi du 18 d&#233;cembre 1998 tendant &#224; renforcer le contr&#244;le de l&#8217;obligation scolaire. 
</p>
<p>142. Les interrogations de la MIVILUDES sont n&#233;es d&#8217;&#233;changes entre administrations, 
notamment des signalements provenant des responsables de l&#8217;&#201;ducation nationale, dans le cadre 
de plusieurs &#171; cellules d&#233;partementales de vigilance de lutte contre les d&#233;rives sectaires &#187; en 
2003, 2004 et 2005. Ces observations ont &#233;t&#233; communiqu&#233;es aux dirigeants de l&#8217;Union nationales 
des Fr&#232;res de Plymouth de France &#224; l&#8217;occasion de rendez-vous avec la MIVILUDES. Ils ont &#233;t&#233; 
re&#231;us par l&#8217;ancien Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral et des conseillers de la Mission interminist&#233;rielle, en 2003 et </p>

MIVILUDES. 
</p>
<p>143. Depuis la publication du rapport de 2005, le Minist&#232;re de l&#8217;&#233;ducation nationale a reconnu 
l&#8217;&#233;cole de Haute-Loire comme &#171; un centre de regroupement &#187; d&#8217;enseignement par 
correspondance, et une inspection a permis de constater que tous les enseignements &#233;taient 
d&#233;sormais dispens&#233;s. Le Gouvernement fran&#231;ais remarque, toutefois, qu&#8217;il existe des 
interrogations similaires &#224; celles sur l&#8217;&#233;cole de Haute-Loire portant sur les acquisitions de 
nouveaux locaux tr&#232;s vastes et destin&#233;s &#224; la m&#234;me vocation de scolarisation. Lors de l&#8217;entretien 
de 2006, les repr&#233;sentants de cette communaut&#233; sont rest&#233;s tr&#232;s &#233;vasifs sur leurs projets en cours. 
La MIVILUDES n&#8217;a pas eu connaissance de d&#233;p&#244;t de plainte.

<p><b><i>Georgia</i></b>  
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 2 December 2005 
</b></p>
<p>146. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government of Georgia 
information she had received according to which state schools are carrying out mandatory 
instruction in the Georgian Orthodox faith and requiring children to pray in Georgian Orthodox 
churches. There is concern that parents have been unable to gain exemption for their children. 
Although the amendment to the Education Law in April 2005, which banned such practices, has </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 37 
</p>
<p> 
led to some improvement in this regard, there have been reports of children being baptised by 
Orthodox priests without the prior permission of their parents.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government sent on 16 March 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>147. The Government of Georgia informed that their Law on Education prohibits mandatory 
religious instruction. Nevertheless, the practice of compulsory teaching of Orthodox Christianity 
takes place at some state-financed schools. It has sometimes been alleged that children have been 
baptized by Orthodox priests without parental consent, but it should be stressed that the Ministry 
of Education and Sciences of Georgia has no official information about that. 
</p>
<p>148. According to the National Education Plan of Georgia, the subject &#8220;Religion and Culture&#8221; 
is taught as an optional one at schools and it is not designed to teach a specific religion, but aims 
to introduce different religions and beliefs to the children. The Ministry of Education and 
Sciences of Georgia has no official data on studying a particular religion, but there is unofficial 
and indirect information about the existence of such practice at several schools. 
</p>
<p>149. Regarding to legal measures, the Law on General Education of Georgia, adopted in April 
2005, protects the freedom of religion and belief among schoolchildren and restricts the 
propagation of any concrete religion, inter alia, by prohibiting classes aimed at learning religious 
rites and related items, as well as studying a specific religion at school time. 
</p>
<p>150. With respect to the question concerning the registration requirement in order to be able to 
worship the Government informed that the legal background for that may be found in article 
1510 of the Civil Code of Georgia. That article provides the criteria for registration, which has to 
be done for all non-commercial and non-partisan legal persons. The documents to be presented 
are administrative documents. There is a fee to be paid after the presentation of the mentioned 
documents in the Georgian Civil Code. All religious groups in Georgia have to meet, on an equal 
basis, all the criteria provided in the Civil Code. It is the Ministry of Justice which responds to 
the applications. Article 31 of the Georgian Civil Code stipulates that a refusal from the Ministry 
of Justice must be well-grounded and can be appealed before the court. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>151. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s detailed response. She would 
also like to take the opportunity to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically 
to the international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;The right of 
parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children&#8221; (see above para. 1, category 
I. 3. g). Furthermore, the previous mandate holder, Abdelfattah Amor, prepared a thematic study 
on &#8220;The role of religious education in the pursuit of tolerance and non-discrimination&#8221; (available 
online at http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/7/b/cfedu-basicdoc.htm). In November 2001, the 
International Consultative Conference on School Education in Relation to Freedom of Religion 
or Belief, Tolerance and Non-Discrimination by consensus adopted a Final Document 
(E/CN.4/2002/73, Appendix). This Madrid Final Document may serve as useful guidance for 
educational policies aimed at strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights, 
eradicating prejudices and conceptions incompatible with freedom of religion or belief, and 
ensuring respect for and acceptance of pluralism and diversity in the field of religion or belief as 
well as the right not to receive religious instruction inconsistent with his or her conviction.  </p>

<p><b><i>Germany</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 February 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>152. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received relating to a <b>questionnaire introduced in the state of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg</b>. The 
questionnaire is to be answered by citizens of the 57 member states of the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC) who apply for German citizenship. According to the information 
received, on 1 January 2006, the Ministry of the Interior of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg introduced a 
questionnaire directed principally at Muslims who want to obtain German citizenship. They are 
required to fill out a 30-question questionnaire, concerning a number of issues including attitudes 
to equality between men and women, homosexuality and freedom of religion.  
</p>
<p>153. The Special Rapporteurs were concerned that an obligation imposed only on the citizens 
of the 57 OIC member states could be discriminatory, especially considering the large Turkish 
community living in Germany. It was further reported that under the new legislation, those who 
pass the test can have their citizenship revoked if they are found guilty of acting in conflict with 
their responses to the questions. 
</p>
<p><b>Response form the Government sent on 28 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>154. The following information was provided by the Government regarding the questionnaire 
introduced in the state of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg. The naturalization of foreigners in Germany is 
carried out by the L&#228;nder as their own affair, as the Nationality Act (effective from 1 January 
2006) provides. One requirement of that Act is that persons who wish to become naturalized 
citizens must declare their allegiance to the principles of freedom and democracy enshrined in 
the Basic Law and that they are not and have not ever engaged in activities opposed to these 
principles or to the existence or security of the state. 
</p>
<p>155. The Interior Ministry of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg adopted a so-called &#8220;guide for conducting 
interviews&#8221; to examine applicants&#8217; compliance with this requirement. The naturalization 
authorities are supposed to use this guide only in case of doubt of an individual applicant&#8217;s 
allegiance to the constitutional principles of freedom and democracy. There is no intent to make 
applicants answer all 30 questions provided in the mentioned guide. The authorities are free to 
choose the questions. 
</p>
<p>156. The Interior Ministry clarified in a decree of 17 January 2006 that the questions from the 
interview guide were not intended only for use with Muslim applicants, but were to be used with 
all applicants for naturalization in case of doubts regarding their allegiance to the constitutional 
principles of freedom and democracy. Muslim applicants are, therefore, not treated differently 
from other applicants. The Ministry also stated that the naturalization authorities as a rule were 
not aware of the religious affiliation of applicants, due to the fact that the application form did 
not ask for this information. As a result, it would be impossible to target Muslim applicants for 
questioning. Although 60% of naturalized immigrants in Baden-W&#252;rttemberg came from the 
OIC nations, in the majority of the cases, the authorities had no doubts about their allegiance to 
the freedom and democracy principles and did not ask them the questions using the interview </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 39 
</p>
<p> 
guide. Furthermore, the Interior Ministry of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg has announced that it will 
evaluate the use of the interview guide after six months and assess its practical effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>157. So far, there has only been one complaint from an applicant for naturalization regarding 
the interview guide. This applicant refused to answer the questions posed by the naturalization 
authorities and according to the Interior Ministry of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg this person&#8217;s 
application for naturalization is to be rejected. The Ministry is not aware of any other complaints 
or rejected applications. Once a person has become a naturalized citizen, his or her citizenship 
may be revoked only if he or she wilfully deceived the authorities with regard to matters relevant 
for naturalization. The possibility of this type of fraud is limited, as most of the questions taken 
from the interview guide are intended to elicit applicants&#8217; attitudes and opinions. In any case, 
under Article 16 (1) of the Basic Law, no German may be deprived of his or her citizenship.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>158. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s detailed response and she notes 
that Muslim applicants are not treated differently from other applicants for naturalization. The 
Special Rapporteur would also like to refer to her framework for communications, more 
specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning 
&#8220;Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief/inter-religious discrimination/tolerance&#8221; (see 
above para. 1, category II. 1.).

municipio de Mixto evitar la construcci&#243;n, la cual, si contin&#250;a, podr&#237;a traer como consecuencia la 
destrucci&#243;n (parcial o total) de este lugar sagrado maya.   
</p>
<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno enviada el 4 de abril de 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>160. El gobierno informa de que la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de la Rep&#250;blica de Guatemala 
reconoce el ejercicio de todas las religiones o creencias, tanto en p&#250;blico como en privado, por 
medio de la ense&#241;anza o culto, sin m&#225;s l&#237;mites que el orden p&#250;blico. Asimismo, Guatemala ha 
ratificado el Convenio N.&#186; 169 de la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) sobre pueblos 
ind&#237;genas y tribales en pa&#237;ses independientes, de 1989, por decreto legislativo de 5 de junio de 
1996, en el cual el Estado se compromete a reconocer y proteger los valores y pr&#225;cticas sociales, 
culturales y espirituales propias de los pueblos mayas y dem&#225;s pueblos. 
</p>
<p>161. Durante los a&#241;os 1989, 1991, 1997 y 2000 los pueblos ind&#237;genas solicitaron ante el 
Instituto de Antropolog&#237;a la no construcci&#243;n en el sitio sagrado Tulam Tzu. En 1997 se logr&#243; </p>

detener la construcci&#243;n. Con fecha de 27 de diciembre de 2005 se iniciaron de nuevo los trabajos 
de construcci&#243;n en la zona mencionada. 
</p>
<p>162. Anteriormente, con fecha de 12 de febrero de 1990, la Direcci&#243;n del Instituto de 
Antropolog&#237;a emiti&#243; una resoluci&#243;n ministerial en la que decidi&#243; dos cosas: establecer una zona 
(mont&#237;culos I, II y III) como &#225;rea de protecci&#243;n de reserva e intocable, bajo la supervisi&#243;n del 
Instituto de Antropolog&#237;a e Historia de Guatemala, y liberar el resto del terreno ubicado en el 
sitio conocido como Rosario Naranjo a la familia Aycinena Ochoa. En 1995 se anot&#243; en el 
Registro General de la Propiedad la delimitaci&#243;n de los mont&#237;culos. En junio y en julio de 2005 
se solicit&#243; y realiz&#243; la delimitaci&#243;n de dichos mont&#237;culos. El 6 de febrero de 2006 estos tres 
mont&#237;culos fueron declarados Patrimonio Cultural de la Naci&#243;n y lugar sagrado, a trav&#233;s del 
Acuerdo Ministerial 48-2006. 
</p>
<p>163. El 30 de diciembre de 2005 la Conferencia Nacional de Ministros de la Espiritualidad 
Maya de Guatemala denuncia p&#250;blicamente a la empresa LEXUSA S.A., que hab&#237;a iniciado, en 
fecha de 25 de diciembre de 2005, actividades de construcci&#243;n en el &#225;rea Tulam Tzu, reconocida 
como lugar arqueol&#243;gico. La misma Conferencia present&#243; varias quejas al Gobierno. Sin 
embargo, el Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes no pudo admitir a tr&#225;mite la solicitud de la 
Conferencia Nacional de Ministros de la Espiritualidad Maya por tres razones: <i>a</i>) porque nunca 
se hab&#237;a dado autorizaci&#243;n para la realizaci&#243;n de los trabajos de construcci&#243;n, <i>b</i>) porque la 
resoluci&#243;n que ampara la autorizaci&#243;n y liberalizaci&#243;n del &#225;rea es del a&#241;o 1990 y a d&#237;a de hoy es 
firme, puesto que no cabe recurso administrativo alguno, y <i>c</i>) porque el inmueble en que se 
encuentra el lugar sagrado y arqueol&#243;gico denominado &#8220;Tulam Tzu&#8221; es propiedad privada, como 
consta en los registros respectivos. 
</p>
<p>164. El Ministro de Cultura solicit&#243; apoyo de la Defensor&#237;a Legal Ind&#237;gena de la Procuradur&#237;a 
de los Derechos Humanos con tal de buscar una soluci&#243;n al problema por otras v&#237;as. 
Lamentablemente, no hubo resultados positivos. 
</p>
<p>165. Actualmente, el conflicto se est&#225; intentado solucionar en la Fiscal&#237;a de Delitos contra el 
Patrimonio Cultural de la Naci&#243;n, del Ministerio P&#250;blico. A su vez, la Comisi&#243;n Nacional Contra 
la Discriminaci&#243;n y Racismo, y el Consejo Asesor de Pueblos Ind&#237;genas de la Presidencia de la 
Rep&#250;blica tambi&#233;n est&#225;n tratando el caso. Otras instancias como la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los 
Acuerdos de Paz, el Congreso de la Rep&#250;blica y la Secretar&#237;a de la Paz se encuentran tambi&#233;n 
analizando la problem&#225;tica. 
</p>
<p>166. El Gobierno de Guatemala desea manifestar que las debidas diligencias con respecto al 
caso ya se est&#225;n tramitando ante las autoridades competentes e informan de que pondr&#225;n al 
alcance de la Relatora Especial cualquier avance en los procesos mencionados anteriormente.

<p>168. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du gouvernement de la Guin&#233;e-Bissau sur la 
question de la communaut&#233; ahmadiyya, qui est un groupe religieux. Selon les informations 
re&#231;ues, le 14 octobre 2005, Aladje Abdu Baio, pr&#233;sident du Conseil national islamique, aurait fait 
appel aux autorit&#233;s de la Guin&#233;e-Bissau afin qu&#8217;elles expulsent la communaut&#233; ahmadiyya du 
pays. En ao&#251;t 2001, les missionnaires pakistanais de la communaut&#233; ahmadiyya avaient d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; 
expuls&#233;s par le pr&#233;sident Kumba Yala, lequel avait accus&#233; la communaut&#233; d&#8217;interf&#233;rer dans les 
affaires politiques et de provoquer la division au sein des musulmans. Cette expulsion fut suivie 
d&#8217;une d&#233;cision du minist&#232;re public de confisquer l&#8217;ensemble des biens de la communaut&#233; et d&#8217;un 
ordre de fermeture de leurs mosqu&#233;es. Le 7 janvier 2005, le minist&#232;re public d&#233;clara les deux 
pr&#233;c&#233;dentes d&#233;cisions ill&#233;gales et donna la permission &#224; la communaut&#233; de recommencer ses

<p>169. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale regrette que le Gouvernement de la Guin&#233;e-Bissau n&#8217;ait pas 
r&#233;pondu &#224; sa communication, envoy&#233;e le 19 d&#233;cembre 2005. Elle voudrait faire r&#233;f&#233;rence aux 
&#171; minorit&#233;s religieuses &#187; (selon le <i>framework for communications</i>, voir ci-dessus para. 1, 
cat&#233;gorie III. 5.) et &#224; son dernier rapport d&#8217;activit&#233; transmis au Conseil des droits de l&#8217;homme 
(A/HRC/4/21, para. 43) : &#171; Comme cela a &#233;t&#233; not&#233; dans les rapports pr&#233;c&#233;dents, les minorit&#233;s 
religieuses et les nouveaux mouvements religieux sont en butte &#224; diverses formes de 
discrimination et d&#8217;intol&#233;rance imputables &#224; la fois aux politiques suivies, &#224; la l&#233;gislation en

d&#8217;&#233;l&#233;ments non &#233;tatiques et de menaces contre leur propre existence en tant que communaut&#233;

<p><b><i>India</i></b>  
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 13 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>170. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received concerning the <b>Freedom of Religion bill in Rajasthan</b>. According to the allegations, 
the Rajasthan Parliament has recently approved the &#8216;Rajasthan Dharma Swatantraya Bill&#8217; 
(Rajasthan Freedom of Religion Bill). The aim of this bill, according to the &#8216;Statement of Objects </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 42 
 
and Reasons&#8217;, is to prevent &#8220;unlawful conversion&#8221; which &#8220;at times has caused annoyance in the 
community belonging to other religions&#8221;. Additionally such &#8220;unlawful conversions&#8221; would cause 
a &#8220;law and order problem for the law enforcing machinery of the State.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>171. The new legislation specifies that those found guilty of converting or attempting to 
convert someone through allurement or forceful or fraudulent means, could face a minimum 
prison term of two years or a fine which may extend to 50,000 Indian rupees (approximately US 
$ 1,125). The Governor of Rajasthan has refused to sign the bill on 18 May 2006.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>172. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to ensure compliance with article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
which clearly states that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion &#8220;includes 
freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others, 
and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practise, worship and 
observance&#8221;. Moreover, she reminds the Government that she is still awaiting a reply to her 
request to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>173. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Teaching and disseminating materials, including missionary activity&#8221; (see 
above para. 1, category I. 3. f). In her 2005 report to the General Assembly, she noted the 
following (see A/60/399, para. 62): &#8220;Whereas the scope of freedom afforded to persons for the 
practice of their religion or belief by producing and distributing information about their religion 
or belief is wide, certain limitations can be imposed in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3, of 
the Covenant. However, it should be noted that this article allows for restrictions only in very 
exceptional cases. In particular the fact that it mentions the protection of &#8220;<i>fundamental</i> rights and 
freedoms&#8221; (emphasis added) of others as a ground for restriction indicates a stronger protection 
than for some other rights whose limitation clauses refer simply to the &#8220;rights and freedoms of 
others&#8221; (e.g. article 12, 21 and 22). It could indeed be argued that the freedom of religion or 
belief of others can be regarded as such a fundamental right and freedom and would justify 
limitations to missionary activities, but the freedom of religion and belief of adults basically is a 
question of individual choice, so any generalized State limitation (e.g. by law) conceived to 
protect &#8220;others&#8217;&#8221; freedom of religion and belief by limiting the right of individuals to conduct 
missionary activities should be avoided.&#8221;

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 19 January 2006 </b> 
</p>
<p>174. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about Ms. <b>Lia Aminuddin</b>, leader of the Eden 
Community. According to the allegations, on 28 December 2005, a group of Muslims surrounded 
the Eden Community&#8217;s premises on Jl. Mahoni, Jakarta, and threatened to burn it down. In 
response, the Jakarta police took Ms. Aminuddin and her followers into custody under the pretext 
of protecting them. Ms. Aminuddin was later formally charged with blasphemy. The other </p>

</p>
<p> 
members of the Eden Community were released. Ms. Aminuddin is reportedly still detained at 
Jakarta police station. The Eden community has been forced to stop its religious activities.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>175. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to refer to her 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to 
the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to worship&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. a) and 
&#8220;Places of worship&#8221; (category I. 3. b). As she noted in her 2005 report to the Commission on 
Human Rights, &#8220;members of religious communities or communities of belief, whenever they find 
themselves in places of worship, are in a situation of special vulnerability given the nature of 
their activity. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States should pay increased 
attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that all perpetrators of such attacks are 
properly prosecuted and tried.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 49).  
</p>
<p>176. The Special Rapporteur would also like to take this opportunity to insist on receiving an 
invitation from the Government to visit Indonesia to assess the situation of freedom of religion or 
belief. As she underlined in her previous reports, the Government has been reminded of this 
request for an invitation on many occasions since 1996. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Islamic Republic of Iran</i></b> </p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 7 December 2005 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression</b> 
</p>
<p>177. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning the statement made by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati about<b> non-Muslims</b> and 
<b>Kurosh Niknam</b>, a parliamentarian and member of the Zoroastrian religious minority. According 
to the allegations, on 20 November 2005, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati was reported as describing 
non-Muslims as sinful animals at a ceremony in north-eastern Iran. In response to the comments, 
Kurosh Niknam described the remarks as &#8220;an unprecedented slur against religious minorities.&#8221; 
As a result, he has been charged with slander and summoned to appear before the Revolutionary 
Tribunal. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 4 January 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>178. The Government informed that article 4 of the Law on Establishment of Public and 
Revolutionary Courts stipulates that Revolutionary Courts have no jurisdiction in legal cases 
involving members of the Parliament. These cases fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the 
Criminal Courts. The allegation on summoning Mr. Nikman has been put forward to the Office 
of Public Prosecutor of Government employees and they have found no legal record of the 
alleged case. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>179. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. She would like to 
make reference to her predecessor&#8217;s report on his visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran in 
December 1995 (E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.2, para. 96): &#8220;Concerning religious publications and, in </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 44 
 
general, all publications issued by minorities, the Special Rapporteur endorses the 
recommendations of Mr. Abid Hussain, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and 
expression, who considers that: &#8220;Any prior restraint on freedom of expression carries with it a 
heavy presumption of invalidity under international human rights law. Any institutionalization of 
such restraint adds further weight to this presumption. In his opinion, the protection of the right 
of freedom of opinion and expression and the right to seek, receive and impart information would 
be better served, not by routinely submitting specific types of expression to prior scrutiny, as is 
currently the case, but rather by initiating action after publication, if and when required&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/1996/39/Add.1, para. 40).&#8221; 
</p>
<p>180. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that she would like to visit the country 
to analyze the progress that has been made further to her predecessor&#8217;s visit and 
recommendations. Bearing in mind that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
issued a standing invitation to the Special Procedures assumed by the Human Rights Council and 
that it had extended an invitation to her predecessor, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that she 
would be grateful to receive dates on which she could conduct a follow-up visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 February 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>181. The Special Rapporteur received information that on 29 October 2005, the Chairman of 
the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces addressed a letter to a number of Governmental 
agencies, including the Ministry of Information, the Commander of the Revolutionary Guard, the 
Commander of the Basij Resistance Forces of the Revolutionary Guard, the Commander of the 
Police Force and the Deputy of its Intelligence Branch and the Chief Commander of the Army. 
The letter, which is stamped &#8220;highly confidential&#8221; and &#8220;urgent/immediate&#8221;, states that on the 
basis of the instructions of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, the Command 
Headquarters of the Armed Forces &#8220;has been given the mission to acquire a comprehensive and 
complete report of all the activities of members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Faith [&#8230;] for the purpose of 
identifying all the individuals&#8221;. The letter asks the recipients &#8220;to, in a highly confidential manner, 
collect any and all information about the above-mentioned activities of these individuals&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>182. There is particular concern as this letter comes at a time of an increasing media campaign 
against members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith, with a series of radio programmes and articles reportedly 
provoking mistrust of, and hostility towards, members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur has received reports that Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; households have begun to receive notes, 
CDs, tracts and text messages on their mobile phones, all of which are aimed at refuting the 
claims of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Faith. The Special Rapporteur has also received reports that the Iranian 
Association of Chambers of Commerce (<i>Ettehadiyeye Asnaf</i>) is compiling a list of Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s in 
every type of trade and employment. All these events coincide with the re-emergence of the 
<i>Hojjatieh </i>society, which has the explicit goal of eradicating the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Faith. 
</p>
<p>183. On 20 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued a press release concerning these 
allegations. The Special Rapporteur indicated that she is &#8220;apprehensive about the initiative to 
monitor the activities of individuals merely because they adhere to a religion that differs from the 
state religion. She considers that such monitoring constitutes an impermissible and unacceptable 
interference with the rights of members of religious minorities. She also expresses concern that 
the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 45 
</p>
<p> 
persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bah&#225;'&#237; faith, in violation of 
international standards.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 March 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>184. The third chapter of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is entitled 
&#8220;Rights of the people&#8221;, assures equal rights to all the people of Iran and equal protection in front 
of the law. There are many religions that have been recognized as &#8220;official religions&#8221; of the state. 
However, Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;sm is not an official religion in Iran. The Government maintains that its 
authorities provide assistance to the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; followers to perform their religious 19-days-apart 
worship, that &#8220;they enjoy their normal social rights to a large extent&#8221;, and that they have their 
own cemeteries as well as schools based on their belief.  
</p>
<p>185. With respect to the press release dated 20 March 2006, the Government deeply regrets 
&#8220;that the Special Rapporteur has downgraded her mandate to that of an irresponsible NGO, 
stripped off the status of a highly respectful and accountable official of the United Nations. It 
would have been fairer and much reasonable for the Special Rapporteur if she had waited for a 
reply from the Iranian officials on the issue. That would have made her judgment more reliable. 
Illegal activities of some members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in Iran resulting in legal cases in the 
courts has motivated extremists Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; associations in Iran to resort to unfounded, 
unsubstantiated and politically motivated allegations on the situation of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in 
Iran. So called &#8216;highly classified&#8217; letter is a clear manifestation of this approach.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>186. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. However, she firmly 
rejects the Government&#8217;s reproaches concerning her press release and the Special Rapporteur 
would have preferred to receive a more substantiated response concerning the concrete 
allegations in question. The Special Rapporteur carries out a close and detailed assessment of the 
information in order to ensure that the situations or cases that are transmitted to Governments 
have a very high level of reliability. Furthermore, she would like to ask the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran for clarification of its statement quoted above that Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; followers 
&#8220;enjoy their <i>normal</i> social rights <i>to a large extent</i>&#8221; (emphasis added). The Special Rapporteur 
would like to emphasize again that the fact that a religion is recognized as a state religion must 
not result in any discrimination against adherents to other religions. The Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government of Iran to refrain from categorizing individuals according to their religion and 
to ensure that members of all religious minorities are free to hold and practise their religious 
beliefs, without discrimination or fear.

forces and members of the Hojatieh and Fatemiyon pro-Government groups. The protest was 
being held against an order by the security forces to evacuate the community&#8217;s place of worship, 
known as Hosseiniye. The 173 individuals are reportedly being interrogated at Fajr prison in 
Qom and there are concerns that they are being tortured in order to force them to sign pre-
prepared false confessions, stating that the protest had political motivations and was linked to 
anti-Government groups. The relatives of the detainees have been unable to obtain official 
information about their whereabouts and the detainees have not had access to lawyers. According 
to the information received, lawyer Bahman Nazari was arrested when he approached officials in 
an attempt to represent the detainees.   
</p>
<p>188. The protest began on 9 February 2006. On 13 February 2006, there were hundreds of 
protesters present in and around the Hosseiniye. At about 3 p.m. the security forces set a deadline 
for the protesters to evacuate the Hosseiniye. Members of the Fatemiyon and Hojatieh groups 
also reportedly surrounded the place of worship, shouting slogans such as &#8220;Death to Sufis&#8221; and 
&#8220;Sufi-ism is a British plot&#8221;, and distributed leaflets alleging that Sufis are enemies of Islam. The 
security forces moved in at about 4 p.m. and stormed the building using tear gas and explosives. 
They beat many of the protesters. The next day the Hosseiniye was demolished using bulldozers. 
Approximately 1,200 protesters were arrested and taken away on buses to unknown locations. 
The detainees were interrogated and according to the information received, many were subjected 
to torture or ill-treatment. Most of them were subsequently released. However, 173 are still being 
held. According to the information received, those that were released were required to sign 
papers as a condition of their release agreeing not to attend any Sufi gatherings in Qom. Some 
were reportedly required to sign documents renouncing Sufism.  
</p>
<p>189. Arrest warrants have reportedly been issued for the main Sufi preacher in Qom, Seyed 
Ahmadi Shariati and the four lawyers who had previously been acting on behalf of the group. 
This incident occurs amid concerns about an increasing demonisation of the Sufi Muslim group. 
In September 2005, a religious jurist in Qom called for a crackdown on Sufi groups in Qom. 
Some people were reportedly required to sign documents renouncing Sufism.

<p>191. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning fifty-two members of the Nematollahi Sufi community and two lawyers who 
represent the group. They have been sentenced to one year&#8217;s imprisonment, a fine, and are to be </p>

flogged. They were among the 173 members of the community arrested on 13 February 2006 
after police and organized pro-Government groups broke up their peaceful protest.  
</p>
<p>192. On 3 May, the General Criminal Court in Qom convicted 52 members of the Nematollahi 
Sufi community and their lawyers Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi, on the charges of 
&#8216;disobeying the orders of Government officials&#8217; and &#8216;disturbing public order&#8217;. For the first 
charge, 25 individuals deemed to have a more &#8220;active&#8221; role in the incident were fined 10 million 
Iranian Rials (more than US$ 1,000), and the remaining individuals were fined 5 million Iranian 
Rials (more than US$ 500). For conviction on the second charge they were sentenced to one 
year&#8217;s imprisonment and to 74 lashes. After their release from prison they will be required to 
present themselves to local security officials every month for two years. In addition, lawyers 
Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi were disqualified from the legal profession for 5 years.  
</p>
<p>193. According to the court verdict, some of those detained &#8216;confessed&#8217; to the charges against 
them. It is not known under what circumstances these confessions were made. All were given 20 
days to appeal the judgement and are currently free on bail.  By the beginning of March, almost 
all of the other members of the group who were arrested at the protest had been released. It is not 
known whether any of these will face formal charges at a later stage. It is believed that many 
have had cases opened against them.  In April, the main preacher for the Nematollahi Sufi group 
in Qom, Seyed Ahmadi Shariat, was detained and charged with &#8216;disobeying the orders of 
Government officials&#8217; and &#8216;disturbing public order&#8217;. He was released on bail pending trial.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 9 June 2006 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the

</b></p>
<p>195. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they received regarding the arrest and continued detention of<b> three members of the 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community</b> in the city of Shiraz. According to the allegations, on 19 May 2006, Ms. 
<b>Haleh Roohi</b>, Ms. <b>Raha Sabet</b> and Mr. <b>Sassan Taqva</b> were arrested together with 51 other 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; in the city of Shiraz. The arrested Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; were involved in community work, with a local 
non-Governmental organization, at the time of their arrest. They were in possession of a letter of 
permission of the Islamic Council in Shiraz for this work. 
</p>
<p>196. On 20 May 2006, the judge in charge of all cases stated that most of the detainees would 
be released soon. This was confirmed by an official at the Ministry of Information in Shiraz who 
informed a family-member that the detainees would be released within 48 hours. None of the 
persons arrested have been formally charged with an offence. 51 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; have since been released 
but Ms. Haleh Roohi, Ms. Raha Sabet and Mr. Sassan Taqva remain detained. </p>

<b>Communication sent on 13 June 2006 jointly with the Independent Expert on Minority

</b></p>
<p>197. The Special Rapporteur and the Independent expert received information concerning the 
arrest of <b>54 members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community</b> in the city of Shiraz and other incidents 
concerning the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community.  
</p>
<p>198. On 19 May 2006, 54 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; were arrested in Shiraz. The arrested Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; were involved in 
community work, with a local non-Governmental organisation, at the time of their arrest. They 
were in possession of a letter of permission of the Islamic Council in Shiraz for this work. A 
number of non-Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; volunteers who were involved in the community service were also arrested 
but released on the same day, without having to post bail. A 15-year old Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; was released 
immediately too.  
</p>
<p>199. On 20 May 2006 the judge in charge of all these cases, stated that most of the detainees 
would be released soon. This was confirmed by an official by the Ministry of Information in 
Shiraz, who informed a family-member that the detainees would be released within 48 hours. 
Afterwards, on 24 May 2006, 14 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; were released but only after they posted the deed of 
property of their house as bail to meet the amount of 10 million tuman (approximately US $ 
11,000) set as bail. On 25 May 2006, a further 36 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; were released after they personally 
guaranteed they would appear in Court when summoned or deposited work licenses as a surety. 
Three Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; remain detained and there is no indication when they will be released. None of the 
detainees were formally charged. The houses of 6 of the 52 detainees were also raided and 
notebooks, computers and (in one case) books and documents were confiscated.  
</p>
<p>200. In addition, on 15 January 2006, 3 members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community were arrested in 
Kermanshah. One of them was told that he attracted &#8220;non-Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; to the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith&#8221;. On the 
same day the rooms of these individuals were raided during which books, documents and various 
other items were taken. Mr. G.&#8217; place of work was also searched. The homes of four other Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; 
were searched on the same day and books, documents and other items were taken.  
</p>
<p>201. In one of the Court documents pertaining to Ms. H. it is stated that she is charged with 
&#8220;teaching the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;sm sect and acting in an insulting manner towards all that is holy in Islam&#8221;. 
Mr. G. was told in Court that his crime was apostasy, which is punishable by death, but had been 
reduced to involvement in Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; activities and insulting Islam. They were released on 21 
January 2006 and are awaiting trial at the Revolutionary Court.  
</p>
<p>202. It is reported that Ms. H. wrote a letter to a family member regarding her arrest, in which 
she informs that her interrogations lasted eight hours and focused on the religious instruction she 
was involved in and her role as a coordinator of this teaching programme. She was allegedly also 
asked to give information about the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith and its administrative order, as well as to give 
details about her father and six other Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; who had been killed in 1981.  
</p>
<p>203. On 5 February 2006, three active members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in Isfahan were 
allegedly arrested. They have since been released. Finally, from 9 to 11 May 2006, 11 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; 
homes were allegedly raided in Villashahr, Shahinshahr, Najafabad and Kashan. Books and 
computers were confiscated, but no one was arrested.  </p>

<b>Response from the Government dated 20 July 2006 to both the urgent appeal dated 9 June 
2006 and the communication dated 13 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>204. The Government indicated that, according to information received from the Judiciary of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, a group of 64 individuals had attempted to pass as representatives of 
Governmental cultural organizations such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of 
Islamic Guidance, or even as people from different NGOs, such as Nonahalan Emrooz (NGO for 
children), Koodakan Donya (Association of Protection of the Rights of the Child) and people 
from Shiraz Municipality Council. 
</p>
<p>205. Legal action was taken by a number of these organizations against this group. A large 
number of these 64 individuals are not Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, so the action based on belief has been denied. 
After legal investigations, 61 persons have released 51 of them based on bail. The three 
remaining were eventually in custody for further investigations and finally released on bail. It has 
been claimed that their activities were done in the context of UNICEF&#8217;s training programmes in 
Shiraz. This was denied by the UNICEF Office in Teheran. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>206. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response and she would like to

<p><b><i>Kazakhstan</i></b>  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 9 December 2005 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question 
of torture</b> 
</p>
<p>207. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding an unknown number of Uzbek asylum seekers, including <b>Abdurakhman 
Ibragimov</b>, <b>Tohirjon Abdusamatov</b>, <b>Shoimat Shorakhmedov</b>, who were registered asylum-
seekers, <b>Alisher Mirzakholov</b>, <b>Abdurauf Kholmuratov</b>, <b>Alijon Mirganiev</b>, <b>Farkhod Islamov</b> 
and possibly <b>Rukhiddin Fakhrutdinov</b>, a former imam from Tashkent. According to the 
information received, they were arrested in southern Kazakhstan starting from 23 November 
2005. Their whereabouts are not known. All of them are wanted by Uzbek authorities on charges 
of &#8220;religious extremism.&#8221; Concern is expressed that these persons may be at risk of torture or ill-
treatment if they are returned to Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>208. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur on torture received information concerning <b>10 
persons</b>, including <b>Nozim Rakhmonov</b>, an asylum-seeker who had registered his application 
with UNHCR, <b>Azomodin Kosimjonov </b>and <b>Sharafutdin Latipov</b>. According to the information 
received, they were arrested by Kazakhstani authorities on 28 November 2005 in Shymkent, and 
handed over to the Uzbek authorities at the border between the two countries later that same 
night. They are now in the custody of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tashkent. No judicial 
review of the cases had taken place before the return.  </p>

<b>Response from the Government dated 15 December 2005</b> 
</p>
<p>209. The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Kazakhstan informed that the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is not in a position to confirm the accuracy of the alleged facts, due to the 
absence of the initial information about the presence of the mentioned citizens of Uzbekistan in 
the territory of Kazakhstan seeking asylum in the UNHCR Office in Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, 
the Ministry, in cooperation with law enforcement bodies of Kazakhstan, will undertake 
measures to verify the facts. Furthermore, the Government mentions that the Ministry has not 
received any complaints of the alleged victims. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>210. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response and she would like to

related to religious conflicts, religious intolerance and extremism&#8221; (see above para. 1, category 
IV. 1.).  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 4 July 2006 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</b></p>
<p>211. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding Mr. <b>Temirbaev Gabdurafih</b>, a citizen of Uzbekistan 
living in Kazakhstan as a refugee under the 1951 Refugee Convention, who is reportedly at risk 
of being returned to Uzbekistan. According to the information received, Mr. Gabdurafih fled 
Uzbekistan in 1999 and has been living in Kazakhstan with his family for seven years. In June 
2006, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recognized that Mr. 
Gabdurafih was at risk of persecution in his home country because of his practice of Islam 
outside of the state-run mosque system in Uzbekistan. This procedure included a confirmation 
from the Government of Kazakhstan that no criminal charges had been filed against him.  
</p>
<p>212. On 24 June 2006, however, security forces arrested Mr. Gabdurafih in Almaty, and he is 
currently in the custody of the Government of Kazakhstan. The arrest took place upon request of 
the Government of Uzbekistan. UNHCR has asked for access to Mr. Gabdurafih, but so far it has 
not been granted, nor has UNHCR been provided with any information on the reasons for the 
arrest and further procedure, apart from being told that an &#8220;internal investigation&#8221; of the case was 
in course. Mr. Gabdurafih appears to have been told that the Government of Kazakhstan would 
decide on whether to deport him within 10 days.

<p>214. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
concerning the case of Mr.<b> Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin, </b>imam of a mosque in the city of 
Kara-Suu, Mr. <b>Ayubkhodja Shahobidinov</b> and Mr. <b>Fathullo Rahimov</b>. According to 
information received, on 6 August 2006, the above-mentioned individuals were killed in the city 
of Osh as the result of an alleged counter-terrorism operation, led by the National Security 
Service of Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation with the security forces of Uzbekistan. It has been reported 
that these individuals were suspected members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and were 
planning to carry out a terrorist attack on the territory of the State of Uzbekistan. Other reports 
highlight that it was not alleged that Mr. Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin was a member of the 
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or that he was involved in the commission of terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>215. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a response from the 
Government and she would be grateful if the Government indicated the legal basis for 
designating an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; as well as the consequences of such 
qualification under the law of Kyrgyzstan. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
refer to her most recent annual report to the Human Rights Council where she also covers the 
issue of &#8220;Violations linked to counter-terrorism measures&#8221; (A/HRC/4/21, para. 40): &#8220;The Special 
Rapporteur is conscious of the fact that the States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote human 
rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism. However, she would like to 
underline that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their 
obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law.&#8221; 
</p>

of religion or belief.

received regarding Mr. <b>Everest Moorthy</b>. According to the allegation received, Mr. Everest 
Moorthy is scheduled to be buried on 23 December 2005 according to Islamic religious rites 
because he allegedly converted to Islam a few weeks before he died. However, it is also reported 
that the family of the deceased is opposing such funerals because they contest the genuineness of 
the conversion. They, inter alia, claim that they were not informed of the conversion by the 
deceased himself although they had been continually in contact with him before he died. 
Moreover, the conversion of Mr. Everest Moorthy did allegedly not take place under the usual 
procedure. It is also reported that while the case has been brought to the High Court of Malaysia </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 52 
 
to determine the genuineness of the conversion, its first hearing would only take place on 29 
December 2005 without having stayed the funerals.

other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 18 July 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>219. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
concerning the allegation that the Internal Security Ministry of Malaysia has banned over the last 
month eighteen books, mainly devoted to the study of inter-religious matters, on the grounds that 
they could have &#8216;disrupted peace and harmony&#8217;. Twelve of these books were printed in English 
and the rest in Malay. The books have been banned under the Printing Presses and Publications 
Act 1984 section 9(1), by which the Internal Security Ministry of Malaysia may forbid any 
publication, article, caricature, photograph, report, notes, writing, sound, music, statement or any 
other expression which it considers: 
</p>
<p> (a) To be prejudicial to public order, morality, security, the relationship with any other 
country; 
</p>
<p> (b) To alarm public opinion or be contrary to any law; or 
</p>
<p> (c) Is otherwise prejudicial to public interest or national interest. 
</p>
<p>220. The ban was enforced despite the recent approval, by the Malaysian Government, of the 
Media Council Bill (2006) which seeks to ameliorate the most restrictive provisions included in 
the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984. It was also reported that more than forty-five 
books have been banned by the Malaysian authorities since 2003.

</b></p>
<p>222. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received concerning Mr. <b>Malik Imtiaz Sarwar</b>, one of two lawyers 
currently representing Ms. Lina Joy, in the Federal Court of Malaysia. Ms. Joy is a Malay </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
woman who has renounced her Muslim faith and embraced Christianity, and the court 
proceedings are concerned with whether she can renounce Islam and has the right to have the 
religious affiliation on her identity card deleted.  
</p>
<p>223. According to the information received, Malik Imtiaz is the subject of death threats by 
an unknown group, which openly calls for the death of Mr. Imtiaz because of his role as a lawyer 
in the Lina Joy court case. Such threats include posters, titled &#8220;Wanted Dead&#8221;, which describes 
Mr. Imtiaz Sarwar as a betrayer of Islam for his involvement in the Lina Joy court case and an 
email message circulating on the Internet offers a monetary reward to anyone willing to kill him. 
Concern is expressed that such threats are linked to the lawful professional activity of Mr. Imtiaz 
Sarwar as a lawyer and may represent an attempt to intimidate lawyers who take on cases in 
defence of right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>224. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Government has not responded to her 
communication dated 23 August 2006 and she is still waiting for a substantive response to the 
related communication sent on 12 October 2005 concerning the case of Ms. Lina Joy (see 
E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, paras. 246-248). She would like to remind the Government that paragraph 
9 of General Comment 22 of the Human Rights Committee states that, &#8220;the fact that a religion is 
recognized as a state religion or that it established as official or traditional or that its followers 
comprise the majority of the population, shall not result in any impairment of the enjoyment of 
any of the rights under the Covenant, including articles 18 or 27, nor in any discrimination 
against adherents to other religions or non-believers.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>225. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or belief&#8221; (see above para. 
1, category I. 1.). The Special Rapporteur considers situations where people are arrested, tried or 
otherwise challenged because they had converted to another religion as unacceptable forms of 
violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief because, in essence, they limit or tend to 
limit the freedom of thought or conscience itself. The Special Rapporteur has already covered the 
question of conversion in detail in her 2005 report to the General Assembly. She would like to 
reiterate that (see A/60/399, para. 53) &#8220;[i]n the cases where non-State actors interfere with the 
right to &#8216;have or adopt a religion or belief of [one&#8217;s] choice&#8217;, the requirements of article 18 of the 
Covenant and other relevant international instruments also entail a positive obligation for the 
State to protect persons from such interference. The Special Rapporteur wishes to re-iterate in 
this regard that States must ensure that the persons on their territory and under their jurisdiction, 
including members of religious minorities, can practise the religion or belief of their choice free 
of coercion and fear. If non-State actors interfere with this freedom, and especially the freedom to 
change or to maintain one&#8217;s religion, the State is obliged to take appropriate measures to 
investigate, bring the perpetrators to justice and compensate the victims (see also 
E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 42).&#8221;  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 10 October 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on

</b></p>
<p>226. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning attacks on <b>Dalit members </b>of the community in the Doti district of Nepal. 
On 26 August 2006, Dalit women were allegedly harassed by the Priest of Shivalaya Temple and 
some local men when they attempted to worship on the occasion of Teej, a Hindu festival. They 
were eventually barred from entering the temple. On 16 September 2006, the District 
Administrative Officer issued a formal notice that Dalits have the right to enter and worship at 
public temples, and that those who choose to discriminate on the basis of caste, in whatever 
form, will be prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>227. On 17 September 2006, Dalit worshippers visited the Saileswori Temple of Dipayal in 
Silgadhi, Doti District. Their worship was disrupted when upper-caste people, who alleged that 
the Dalit worshippers had been acting in an offensive manner, physically attacked them with 
knifes and other weapons.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>228. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the

framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to 
the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to worship&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. a) and 
&#8220;Places of worship&#8221; (category I. 3. b). As she noted in her 2005 report to the Commission on 
Human Rights, &#8220;members of religious communities or communities of belief, whenever they find 
themselves in places of worship, are in a situation of special vulnerability given the nature of 
their activity. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States should pay increased 
attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that all perpetrators of such attacks are 
properly prosecuted and tried.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 49).

<b>Samira Haddad</b>, a 32-year-old Muslim woman who was reportedly refused a post as Arabic 
teacher at the Islamic College in Amsterdam based on her refusal to wear a headscarf. 
Subsequent to the communication sent on 28 October 2005, she has been informed by various 
reliable sources that the national Equality Commission ruled in favour of Ms. Haddad on 15 
November 2005. Although the Netherlands&#8217; system of parallel public and private denominational 
education gave the Islamic college a high level of discretion in deciding what requirements it 
could set for its staff, the Equality Commission found that the fact that non-Muslim employees 
were exempt from the requirement to wear a headscarf while Muslim employees were obliged to 
wear a headscarf constituted an inadmissible differentiation on the basis of religion.

<p> 
<b>Response from the Government dated 13 March 2006  
</b></p>
<p>230. The Dutch Government wishes to add that the staff regulations of the school contained 
provisions obliging all feminine employees to wear a headscarf. An exception was provided for 
non-Islamic women, who could be released from the obligation on request. The Government also 
informs that a complaint has been lodged by Ms. Haddad at the &#8220;Commissie Gelijke 
Behandeling&#8221; (Dutch Equal Treatment Commission). The Dutch Equal Treatment Commission 
concluded that the school failed to demonstrate that the obligation to wear a headscarf was 
necessary in pursuance of the post of an Arabic teacher and decided in favour of Ms. Haddad.  In 
this particular case, the school decided to disregard the opinion of the Dutch Equal Treatment 
Commission. Since Ms. Haddad has not started legal proceedings, there is currently no follow up 
of the case. 
</p>
<p>231. A judgement (&#8220;Opinion&#8221;) of the Dutch Equal Treatment Commission is the result of a 
specific case of alleged differentiation between two parties. In a written explanation the 
Commission describes whether the respondent has acted in contravention with the Dutch equal 
treatment laws or not. Its opinions are not legally binding, but are generally acted upon 
accordingly by petitioner and respondent.  
</p>
<p>232. Regarding the legal basis regulating the wearing of religious symbols, the Government 
indicated that there is no specific regulation regarding the wearing of religious symbols. The 
relevant jurisprudence in this field describes only two possible situations in which regulation 
imposing restrictions on the wearing of garments covering the face or part of the face can be 
justified: the necessity to ensure identification and proper communication and the necessity to 
guarantee the neutrality of state organs. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>233. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the detailed response from the Government. She 
would like to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international 
human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Religious symbols&#8221; (see above 
para. 1, category I. 3. c). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has already covered the question 
of religious symbols in detail in her 2006 report to the Commission on Human Rights (see 
E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 36-60). She would like to reiterate that &#8220;[t]he fundamental objective 
should be to safeguard both the positive freedom of religion or belief as manifested in 
observance and practice by voluntarily wearing or displaying religious symbols, and also the 
negative freedom from being forced to wear or display religious symbols.&#8221; (see E/CN.4/2006/5, 
para. 60). While welcoming the opinion of the Dutch Equal Treatment Commission in the case of 
Ms. Haddad, the Special Rapporteur expresses her concern about pressure within the school to 
adhere to certain religious obligations. She recognizes the complexity of the issues involved and 
encourages the Government to promote an atmosphere of tolerance and non-discrimination.

<p><b>Communication sent on 20 January 2006 
</b></p>
<p>234. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received concerning <b>Shaukat Ali Wahla</b>, an employee of the Auqaf Organization in Punjab. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 56 
 
According to the information received, on 25 January 1996, he was granted promotion to the post 
of Superintendent. On 6 August 1998, the promotion was withdrawn on the grounds that the 
Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance 1979 did not permit the promotion of a non-Muslim as an 
officer. On 18 September 2000, the High Court of Lahore allowed his petition against the 
decision to withdraw the promotion (No. 13894/1996) and he was subsequently reinstated. On 29 
January 2001, he was once again demoted on the grounds that his promotion had been illegal. On 
13 October 2004, the High Court of Lahore allowed his petition against the demotion finding that 
the prohibition on the promotion of non-Muslims to officer positions in the Punjab Waqf 
Properties Ordinance violated Article 27 of the Constitution, which provides that, &#8220;No citizen 
otherwise qualified for appointment in the service of Pakistan shall be discriminated against in 
respect of any such appointment on the ground only of [&#8230;] religion [&#8230;]&#8221; (No. 2398/2002). 
Despite the judgment of the High Court of Lahore, Shaukat Ali Wahla has not been reinstated to 
the post of Superintendent or considered for further promotion.   
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 27 April 2006 
</b></p>
<p>235. The Government informed the special Rapporteur about the case of Mr. Shaukat Wahla. 
Once Mr. Wahla approached the Honourable Lahore High Court, this Court stated on 13 October 
2004 that the guarantee against discrimination on the ground of religion is absolute and not 
subject to reasonable qualification or restriction. Therefore, Section 5(1) added to the Punjab 
Waqf properties Ordinance 1979 (iv of 1979) by the Punjab Ordinance No. XIII of 1984 violates 
Article 27 of the Constitution of Pakistan.  
</p>
<p>236. The Honourable Lahore High Court also stated that &#8220;as far as the second contention of 
the learned counsel for the petitioner that a Superintendent is not an officer concerned, it is not 
required to be determined in this case&#8230;Therefore, on the basis of part II of the Schedule, in the 
absence of job description of the post of Superintendent, it is not possible to say whether he is or 
not an officer for the purpose of proviso of the Punjab Ordinance No. IV of 1979&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>237. The Auqaf Department has since filed a petition to the Honourable Supreme Court of 
Pakistan against the decision of the Honourable Lahore High Court, which has been admitted. 
Since the Honourable Lahore High Court&#8217;s judgement has not been suspended by the 
Honourable Supreme Court, the case of promotion of Mr. Wahla as an Officer Superintendent 
was considered by the Departmental Promotion Committee in its meeting held on 7 April 2005, 
and was promoted as Superintendent subject to the final decision of the Apex Court. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>238. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response from the Government and she would 
be appreciative to be informed of recent developments in that case.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 15 February 2006 jointly with Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p>239. The Special Procedures mandate holders raised their concerns at the case regarding Mr. 
<b>Younis Masih</b>, a citizen of Pakistan of Christian faith, resident in the Chunngi Amar Sadu area 
of Lahore. According to the information received, Younis Masih was arrested on charges of 
blasphemy on 11 September 2005 and taken to Kot Lakhpat jail, in Lahore, where he is still </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 57 
</p>
<p> 
detained. Apparently, on 10 September 2005 a Muslim cleric filed a complaint against Younis 
Masih, accusing him of blasphemy under Section 295C of the Pakistan penal code for having 
allegedly made derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed at a religious service. 
Blasphemy charges carry the death penalty or life imprisonment. A first bail petition was rejected 
by the session&#8217;s court in Lahore in November 2005 and a second petition is currently pending in 
the Lahore High Court.  
</p>
<p>240. The Special Procedures mandate holders are aware that people detained on blasphemy 
charges in Pakistani prisons have been killed by fellow detainees or prison wardens, including at 
Kot Lakhpat, the prison where Younis Masih is currently held. The mandate holders are 
concerned that Younis Masih&#8217;s life would thus appear to be in danger.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 16 May 2006 
</b></p>
<p>241. Mr. Younas Masih, son of Wason Masih, was admitted in Central Jail Lahore on 11 
September 2005, as under trial prisoner involved in the case FIR (First Information Report) 
No.723/05 dated 10 September U/S 295 Police Station Factory Area, Lahore. He is at present 
facing trial in the court of Mr. Muhammad Saleem, Magistrate 1st Class, Model Town, Lahore. 
The Government indicated that Mr. Younas Masih has been provided with all security jail 
facilities according to jail rules. Special security arrangements have been put in place to ensure 
that there is no threat to his life. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>242. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response from the Government and she would 
like to refer to  her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human 
rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom of expression including questions 
related to religious conflicts, religious intolerance and extremism&#8221; (see above para. 1, category 
IV. 1.). 
</p>
<p>243. Furthermore she would like to make reference to her predecessor&#8217;s report on his country 
visit to Pakistan in June 1995 (E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.1, para. 82): &#8220;While protecting freedom of 
conscience and freedom of worship is clearly a necessity, applying the death penalty for 
blasphemy appears disproportionate and even unacceptable, especially in view of the fact that 
blasphemy is very often the reflection of a very low standard of education and culture, for which 
the blasphemer is never solely to blame. The Special Rapporteur endorses the Government&#8217;s 
proposal to amend procedural aspects of the blasphemy law and would encourage it not only to 
give effect to this proposal, but also to go further in amending the law on blasphemy and more 
generally on religious offences in accordance with the views expressed above. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that in any event some practical measures, especially administrative and 
educational, should be implemented pending more substantial constitutional and legislative 
changes.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 5 July 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions</b> 
</p>
<p>244. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government of Pakistan 
information they had received concerning Mr. <b>Abdul Sattar Gopang,</b> who was reportedly </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 58 
 
stabbed to death while he was on trial for blasphemy charges at the District and Session Court of 
Muzzafargarh on 16 June 2006. According to what has been alleged, his murder was instigated 
by Mr. R. and carried out by five members of his seminary. Two of the perpetrators were 
subsequently captured by bystanders and handed over to the police while two policemen who 
allegedly tried to overpower the attackers were injured.  
</p>
<p>245. Mr. Abdul Sattar Gopang worked as a tax collector for the union council in Jatoi town, 
Muzzafargarh. Mr. R., in charge of a seminary, had not been paying his toll tax and had verbally 
threatened Mr. Gopang when asked to do so. On 13 March 2006, Mr. R. again refused to pay his 
toll tax. He then went to the police and filed a fabricated case of blasphemy against Mr. Gopang. 
According to the information received, Mr. R. allegedly told members of his seminary that they 
would go to heaven if they killed Mr. Gopang for having committed blasphemy. Concerns have 
been expressed that fabricated blasphemy charges are possible as a consequence of the 
Blasphemy Laws. To date, it is the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; understanding that the three remaining 
perpetrators remain at large and that no charges have been brought in connection with the murder 
of Mr. Gopang.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>246. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to refer to her 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to 
the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom of expression including questions related to religious 
conflicts, religious intolerance and extremism&#8221; (see above para. 1, category IV. 1.). Moreover, 
the Special Rapporteur wishes to appeal to the Government of Pakistan to ensure that the death 
of Mr. Abdul Sattar Gopang is promptly, independently and thoroughly investigated.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 13 July 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living  
</b></p>
<p>247. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding <b>twelve Ahmadiya families</b> from Jhando Sahi village in Daska Tehsil. On 24 
June 2006, a group of unidentified individuals attacked an area inhabited by a dozen Ahmadiya 
families in Jhando Sahi village, forcing the families to leave the village. The group injured two 
people, burned down the community&#8217;s place of worship, two shops and a number of houses. The 
group attacked the community following as yet unsubstantiated claims that Ahmadiyya youths 
had burned copies of the Quran. According to the information received, the District Police have 
charged four Ahmadiyya youths with desecrating the Quran. However, no charges have been 
brought in connection with the attack on the village. Furthermore, the families have been 
informed by the police that they are not allowed to visit their village and to go back to their 
houses without prior permission. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 12 October 2006 
</b></p>
<p>248. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan presented the information 
received from the concerned authorities of Pakistan on the attack on Ahmadiya families. On 24 
June 2006 some Qadiyanis allegedly set fire to pages of the Holy Quran. This was witnessed by 
some Muslim villagers of the area. Consequently, the villagers gathered and took out the protest </p>

</p>
<p> 
procession and caused damage to the moveable and immoveable property of Qadiyanis. An FIR 
(First Information Report) No. 165 dated 24.06.2006 u/s 295 &#8211; B of the Pakistan Penal Code was 
registered and the two above mentioned accused were arrested while two others accused are yet 
to be arrested. For their own safety, the district police shifted the Qadiyani families to a safer 
place. Cases have been registered by the local police against 25 known and 33 unknown persons 
for the damage caused to the properties of the Qadiyani families. In a meeting with the DCO 
Sialkot, the representatives and residents of the area ensured that they would cooperate in the 
maintenance of law and order in the area. The dislocated Qadiyani families have come back and 
are residing in their respective houses. At present there is no tension in the area. Survey of 
damage to the properties is also being carried out for paying compensation to the affected 
Qadiyanis. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p><b>Communication sent on 26 September 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the

</b></p>
<p>250. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning the arrest of <b>Sultan Dogar</b> and <b>Abdul Sattar Khan</b>, both employees of the 
Daily Alfazal, a newspaper run by the Ahmadi community, in Lahore. On 9 September, Chenab 
Nagar (Rabwah) police raided the offices of the Daily Alfazal, where they arrested two of the 
newspaper&#8217;s employees, Sultan Dogar, a printer and Abdul Sattar Khan, a journalist. The two 
men were charged under article 298B (offence of a member of the Ahmadi faith misusing holy 
personages or places) and article 298C (offence of a member of the Ahmadi faith calling himself 
a Muslim) of the Pakistan Penal Code, article 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order Act and 
article 9 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Abdul Sattar Khan was subsequently released, but Sultan 
Dogar is still in detention. According to the information received, the police have indicated that 
the raid was part of the Government&#8217;s policy of preventing the dissemination of hate literature. 
The charges are based on the articles in the newspaper which discussed Qadiyani beliefs and 
described Ahmadis as Muslims.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>251. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the

the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Minorities&#8221; (see above para. 1, category III. 5.). 
</p>
<p>252. Furthermore she would like to make reference to her predecessor&#8217;s report on his country 
visit to Pakistan in June 1995 (E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.1, para. 82): &#8220;In the light of the above 
considerations, the Special Rapporteur has concluded, after careful thought and having studied 
the matter and consulted other views, that the present State laws related to religious minorities, 
and more generally speaking the subject of tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion or 
belief, are likely to favour or foster intolerance in society. The law applied specifically to the 
Ahmadi minority is particularly questionable and in some respects frankly unwarranted.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>253. The Special Rapporteur had received information concerning the <b>Hindu community </b>in 
Moscow. According to the information received, in 2004, the authorities demolished the only 
Hindu temple in the city, with assurances that a new temple would be built in another location. In 
October 2005, the authorities withdrew the land allocated for the building a new temple, 
allegedly because of minor legal inconsistencies. However, no alternative land was allocated for 
the construction of a new temple. Since June 2004, the Hindu community has had to worship in 
inadequate accommodation. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 14 August 2006 
</b></p>
<p>254. The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation indicated that a two-storey building 
used for religious purposes, namely a Hindu temple, was demolished in Moscow in 2004 to make 
way for new development. The city authorities have proposed two sites to the Hindu community 
for the construction of a new temple. The proposal to use plot No. 39 on Leningradsky Prospekt 
was withdrawn on technical legal grounds. At the time of writing, the possibility of building a 
temple on plot No. 5, Dybenko Street, is under consideration. The matter is currently being

<p>255. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response from the Government. She would be

would like to take the opportunity to remind the Government of article 6 of the 1981 Declaration 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or 
Belief, according to which the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief includes 
the freedom, &#8220;(a) To worship or assemble in connection with a religion or belief [&#8230;]; (c) To

</p>
<p>256. The Special Procedures mandate holders drew the attention of the Government to 
information received regarding <b>Abdu Salim Navruzov</b>, a Tajik national, <b>Sakhabuddin 
Tursunov</b>, a Tajik national, <b>three unidentified Russian nationals</b> and <b>four unidentified Tajik 
nationals</b>. According to the information received, at approximately 6.30am on 7 May 2006, 
armed men in masks with automatic weapons and pistols entered the city mosque on 
Matmasovskaya Street, in Tyumen City, during morning prayers. The men said that they were 
members of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and told Abdu Salim Navruzov, Sakhabuddin </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 61 
</p>
<p> 
Tursunov and the seven other individuals in the mosque to show them their ID cards. The FSB 
members physically threatened them and forced them to get into a bus, which drove them to 
Tyumen City Police Station No.2. At the police station, they were forced to face the wall and 
were forbidden to speak. They were taken one by one to an office where they were interrogated 
about who financed the mosque and why they attended the mosque. The FSB members demanded 
that they stop attending the mosque and agree to cooperate. They also threatened that if they 
refused to co-operate, they would plant narcotics on them and bring false charges against them.  
</p>
<p>257. The three Russian detainees were subsequently released. However, the six Tajik detainees 
were taken to a bus at gun point. They were made to lie on the floor in the bus and taken to the 
Lenin Regional Ministry of Interior office in Tyumen. At the Lenin Regional Ministry of Interior 
Office, Abdu Salim Navruzov, whose residence permit had expired, was taken away somewhere. 
When the other five individuals asked where he had been taken, they were told, &#8220;Soon you will 
see him in heaven.&#8221; The FSB members then counted their bullets in front of the detainees and 
discussed if they had enough bullets for all of the detainees. The whereabouts of Abdu Salim 
Navruzov are still unknown. 
</p>
<p>258. The remaining five Tajik nationals were taken in a bus to forest near the village of 
Antipino. As they were getting out of the bus, the FSB members told them to be happy and smile 
because they were going to meet with Allah. One of them, Sakhabuddin Tursunov, was subjected 
to a mock execution by one of the FSB members who forced him to his knees, put a pistol put to 
his head and clicked the trigger. The FSB members demanded that the men stop going to the 
mosque and stop praying, and threatened them with death if they went to the mosque. They then 
forced them to run into the forest and aimed their guns at them and clicked the triggers as they 
ran away.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>259. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a response from the

report to the Human Rights Council where she also covers the issue of &#8220;Violations linked to 
counter-terrorism measures&#8221; (A/HRC/4/21, para. 40): &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is conscious of 
the fact that the States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote human rights requires them to take 
effective measures to combat terrorism. However, she would like to underline that States must 
ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under 
international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.&#8221;

<p>260. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding <b>Ms. X</b>, aged 23, from Argun in Chechnya. On 19 March 2006, she was 
detained by local law enforcement officers, following allegations by her husband that she had 
committed adultery with a serviceman of Christian faith. She was taken to a law enforcement 
compound in Argun where she was beaten, while being told &#8220;Turn around and be condemned by 
Allah&#8221;. Her eyebrows and head were shaved and her scalp was painted green, the colour 
associated with Islam. A cross was also smeared on her brow. She was ordered to strip, and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 62 
 
beaten with wooden rods and hoses on her buttocks, arms, legs, hands, stomach and back. She 
was forced to confess to being unfaithful and then taken to her husband&#8217;s home and made her 
dance before her neighbours while they verbally insulted her. Several of the law enforcement 
officials kicked her.  
</p>
<p>261. On 21 March 2006, she suffered a miscarriage. The local authorities initially failed to 
investigate the events, despite the fact that these had been recorded on mobile phone videos, and 
widely circulated in the region. On 29 August 2006, the Chechen Premier, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, 
reportedly stated that he had ordered the Chechen Interior Ministry to investigate the events.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 December 2006 
</b></p>
<p>262. The Government informed that on 18 March 2006, when Malika Soltayeva underwent a 
medical examination at the central district hospital in Shali, scars on her face, hands and back 
and a concussion were detected. On the same day, the police received reports that she had been 
abducted. Consequently, the Prosecutor of Argun investigated the case. During the course of this 
investigation Ms. Soltayeva explained that she had not been abducted, that she had not been 
subjected to any physical or moral pressure and that she had sustained the injuries as a result of 
domestic violence. She never complained about her injuries to the police. Therefore, on 7 May 
2006 the Prosecutor of Argun refused to open a criminal case for reason of the &#8220;absence of a 
crime&#8221; (art. 24, para 1 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code). However, given the numerous 
contradictions in testimonies of the persons involved and of eye-witnesses and allegations of 
wrong-doing by police officers, the case has been referred to the Republican Prosecutor, 
following which, on 16 October 2006, on the basis of the statement of Ms Soltayeva a criminal 
case was opened with reference to art. 117, para. e (2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation (harassment by a group of persons).

Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov were the subject of an urgent appeal sent to your Government 
by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 27 May 2004. 
According to the allegations received, in February 2004, Ravil Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov, 
along with five other Russian citizens, were returned from Guant&#225;namo Bay to Russia. In April 
2005, they were arrested in connection with a pipeline explosion in Tatarstan in January 2005. In 
detention, interrogators pulled hairs from Ravil Gumarov&#8217;s beard and forced vodka down his 
throat, which is a particularly offensive form of ill-treatment for abstinent Muslims, in an effort 
to force him to confess. Interrogators warned Timur Ishmuratov that they would call in his 
pregnant wife for questioning and could not guarantee the safety of the foetus. Both men 
confessed to the crime during the investigation, but subsequently withdrew their confessions in 
court. </p>

from the Russian Supreme Court to annul the verdict so that the three could be tried again for the 
same crime. On 5 May 2006, the defendants were convicted of terrorism and illegal possession of 
weapons or explosives (Articles 205 and 222 of the Russian Criminal Code). They were also 
ordered to pay damages of about U.S. $2,000 for property damage. Ravil Gumarov was 
sentenced to a term of 13 years, and Timur Ishmuratov to 11 years and one month. The third man, 
Fanis Shaikhutdinov, received 15 years and six months. According to the information received, 
another suspect had confessed to carrying out the crime in July 2005, however, the defence 
lawyers for the three men were never informed of this confession. All three have appealed their 
convictions to the Russian Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>266. According to the information received, two witnesses in the trial were detained and beaten 
to force them to testify against the defendants. On 31 March 2005, Timor Ishmuratov&#8217;s brother, 
<b>Rustam Hamidullin</b>, was detained by the Tatarstan Organized Crime Unit at his Aunt&#8217;s house in 
Nefteyugansk, in Khanti-Mansiisk province. Police held him for several days at Nefteyugansk 
police station and beat him while he was handcuffed to a radiator to coerce him to admit that he 
had witnessed preparations for the crime. Police then took him on the train to Tatarstan. Rustam 
Hamidullin was ill-treated during the two-day train trip.  
</p>
<p>267. On 1 April 2005, <b>Ildar Valeev</b>, another witness for the prosecution, was called in for 
questioning to the Organized Crime Unit in Almetievsk, Tatarstan. He was subsequently 
sentenced to five days&#8217; administrative arrest for swearing in a mosque. He was held in an 
investigation cell in Bugulma, where he was stripped, beaten and subjected to threats and 
psychological pressure until he agreed to sign a statement saying he had witnessed the explosion. 
He was released on 27 April 2005. Both Rustam Hamidullin and Ildar Valeev withdrew their 
statements at the trials.   
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 December 2006 
</b></p>
<p>268. The Government informed that the investigation into the pipeline explosion in Tatarstan 
in January 2005 was conducted by Republican prosecutors together with the Federal Security 
Service. During the investigation, several complaints about illegal acts by law-enforcement 
agents in relation to Ravil Gumarov, Timur Ishmuratov, Rustam Hamidullin and Ildar Valeev 
were filed with the Republican Prosecutor&#8217;s office, but the investigations conducted by the 
Republican Prosecutors did not confirm these allegations. In September 2005 a jury trial took 
place, before which Rustam Hamidullin and Ildar Valeev retracted their earlier confessions and 
were acquitted. The Republican Prosecutors appealed the acquittal and the Supreme Court of the 
Russian Federation annulled the jury&#8217;s sentence and sent the case back for additional 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>269. On 12 May 2006, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, on the basis of the 
sentence of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tatarstan, sentenced Mr. Gumarov, Mr. 
Shaikhutdinov and Mr. Ishmuratov to respectively 13 years, 15 years and 6 months and 11 years 
and one month of imprisonment. They were found guilty of terrorism, i.e. to have collectively 
committed the explosion, which constituted a deadly risk to people, did considerable damage to 
property and had other dangerous consequences for society with the aim of destroying public 
security, spreading fear among the population and influencing the authorities&#8217; decision-making </p>

and several other crimes. By decision of the chamber for criminal affairs of the Supreme Court of 
the Russian Federation of 29 November 2006 the sentence was reduced to 10 years and 6 months 
of imprisonment for Mr. Shaikhutdinov, 9 years for Mr. Gumarov and 8 years and 1 month for 
Mr. Ishmuratov. The appeal on cassation of the three convicts was rejected.

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>270. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response and she would like to 
refer to her most recent annual report to the Human Rights Council where she also covers the 
issue of &#8220;Violations linked to counter-terrorism measures&#8221; (A/HRC/4/21, para. 40): &#8220;The Special 
Rapporteur is conscious of the fact that the States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote human 
rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism. However, she would like to 
underline that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their 
obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>271. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Persons deprived of their liberty&#8221; (see above para. 1, category III. 2.) and 
&#8220;Prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221; 
(category IV. 3.). As she noted in her 2005 report to the General Assembly, &#8220;[t]he religious 
beliefs of a detainee should under no circumstances be used by the authorities against the 
detainee in order, for instance, to extract information from him or her.&#8221; (A/60/399, para. 90).

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 27 September 2006 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the

</p>
<p>272. The Special Procedures mandate holders drew the attention of the Government to 
information they had received regarding <b>Hadi Saeed Al-Mutif</b>, aged 31, a prisoner at Najran 
Prison. According to the information received, in October 1993, he enrolled at Narjan Police 
Training Camp. On 20 January 1994, he was arrested for making a blasphemous comment in the 
presence of other recruits. In December 1994, his trial began on charges of apostasy, which 
carries a discretionary death sentence. In 1995, he was sentenced to death but his relatives did not 
receive a copy of the judgment or the sentence. In 1999, King Abdullah, the then Crown Prince, 
refused to sign the execution warrant, but his sentence was not officially commuted to life 
imprisonment. On 5 or 6 September 2006, he began a hunger strike and was placed in solitary 
confinement. There are concerns that the severity of his sentence may be linked to the fact that he 
is a member of the Ismaili Shi&#8217;ite community. 
</p>
<p>273. The Special Rapporteurs expressed their concerns with regard to the circumstance that, if 
the allegations were correct, he has been detained for twelve years in a state of constant 
uncertainty as to whether he will be executed or not. There are, moreover, concerns that the 
sentence may have been particularly severe due to the fact that<b> Hadi Saeed Al-Mutif</b> is a 
member of the Ismaili Shi&#8217;ite community.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>274. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a response from the 
Government and she would like to reiterate her question concerning the prospects of the death 
sentence being commuted or pardon being granted. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw 
the Government&#8217;s attention to article 2(1) of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, which provides that 
&#8220;[n]o one shall be subject to discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons, or person 
on the grounds of religion or other belief.&#8221; Article 4(1) of the 1981 Declaration goes on to state 
that &#8220;[a]ll States shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the 
grounds of religion or belief in the recognition, exercise and enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil, economic, political, social and cultural life.&#8221; 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for communications, 
more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning 
&#8220;Persons deprived of their liberty&#8221; (see above para. 1, category III. 2.) and &#8220;Right to life, right to

<p><b><i>Serbia and Montenegro</i>Communication sent on 8 May 2006</b>1<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>275. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received concerning the <b>adoption and signing of a new law on religion.</b> According to the 
allegations, on 27 April 2006, President Tadic signed a new law on religion, after Parliament 
approved the law on 20 April 2006. The law was passed with 129 of the 250 parliamentarians 
taking a vote, of which 120 voted in favour of the law. The new law differentiates between seven 
traditional and all other faiths, and awards different privileges and rights to each category. For 
example, non-traditional faiths will lose, and will have to reapply for, legal status, as well as 
losing their tax-exempt status. The Special Rapporteur has raised concerns about this issue twice 
before, in 2004 and 2005. President Tadic has also reportedly expressed concerns about the law 
and has called for amendments that would bring the legislation in line with relevant international 
standards. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>276. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a response from the

religion is not limited to members of registered religious communities. As she noted in her 2005 
report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;registration should not be compulsory, i.e. it should 
not be a precondition for practicing one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal 
personality and related benefits&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58).

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 1 March 2006 </b> 
</p>
<p>279. The Special Rapporteur received information regarding the <b>destruction of a synagogue in 
Dushanbe</b>. According to the information received, on 7 February 2006, the authorities in 
Dushanbe began the demolition of the city&#8217;s only synagogue, which is also the only functioning 
synagogue in the country. The authorities have offered the congregation a plot of land on the 
edge of Dushanbe to build a new synagogue. However, they have not provided any compensation 
and the congregation do not have the funds to build a new Synagogue. According to the 
information received, one member of the congregation tried to film the demolition until city 
officials threatened to break the camera if he did not stop filming. The synagogue was earmarked 
for demolition more than two years ago, under plans for construction of a &#8220;Palace of Nations&#8221;, 
which will be the new residence of the Tajik President. In May 2003, the Jewish community 
received a letter from the authorities ordering them to vacate the synagogue building by July 
2003.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 67 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Response from the Government dated 10 March 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>280. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan reported that the synagogue 
of the Jewish community in Dushanbe is an ordinary adobe residential building dating from the 
1930s, occupying 0.13 hectares at 27, N. Khikmat Street in Dushanbe. The current synagogue 
building has absolutely no historical or architectural value and is the communal property of the 
Ismoili Somoni district in Dushanbe. In 1980 the premises were placed at the disposal of 
Tajikistan&#8217;s Jewish community. 
</p>
<p>281. The synagogue is currently scheduled for demolition under a plan to build a new 
Government residence. In this connection, representatives of Jewish communities and 
organizations, including the chief rabbi of Central Asia, Mr. Abe Dovid Gurevich, visited 
Dushanbe on a number of occasions. On 4 June 2004 Mr. Gurevich held one of a series of 
meetings with senior officials at Dushanbe city hall, during which it was agreed to allocate a 
0.15-hectare plot at 38/1, Negmat Karabaev street in Dushanbe to Jewish communities and 
organizations for the construction of a new synagogue. 
</p>
<p>282. This proposal (one of six submitted for the consideration of Jewish community leaders) 
was approved by the chief rabbi of Central Asia, Mr. Abe Dovid Gurevich, in his letter dated 5 
July 2004 addressed to the mayor of Dushanbe. It should be noted that the rabbi of the Dushanbe 
synagogue, Mr. M.I. Abdurakhmonov, attended these meetings and talks between the chief rabbi 
of Central Asia and senior officials of the city of Dushanbe. 
</p>
<p>283. At the same time, pending the completion of the new synagogue, Dushanbe city hall 
proposed that the synagogue be temporarily moved to 48a, Negmat Karabaev Street in Dushanbe, 
and arranged for the distribution of free food to elderly and indigent members of the 
congregation. 
</p>
<p>284. Unfortunately, despite the agreement between the two sides and the chief rabbi&#8217;s letter of 
9 July 2004, the decision of 26 July 2004 allocating a plot of land, and mayoral decision No. 398 
of 23 August 2004 giving the go-ahead for the design of a new synagogue, the Dushanbe Jewish 
community has to date taken no specific steps to draw up plans for the construction of this 
building. 
</p>
<p>285. The Ministry notes that Jewish community leaders have recently sought to exploit this 
situation by kicking up an unjustified fuss about this so-called &#8220;issue&#8221; in the media. It must also 
be stressed that no members of the Jewish congregation in Dushanbe, who number several dozen, 
have to date submitted any specific complaints or statements regarding this matter to the Tajik 
Government or the city of Dushanbe. Photographs of the existing Jewish synagogue in Dushanbe 
were annexed to show its current state of repair and provide an unbiased assessment of its 
historical and architectural significance. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 18 May 2006 
</b></p>
<p>286. The Special Rapporteur sent this communication in relation to the <b>draft law entitled 
&#8220;About the freedom of conscience and religious unions&#8221;. </b>The Committee on Religious Affairs 
has produced a draft law &#8220;About the freedom of conscience and religious unions&#8221;. Article 16 of 
the draft stipulates that all non-registered religious activity is deemed illegal. Article 18 of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 68 
 
draft provides that the founders of religious organizations and unions must submit signatures 
from 200 citizens in support of the establishment of a religious association in any given town or 
settlement. For a central religious association to be established 800 signatures are required for a 
Muslim association and 600 are required for a non-Muslim association. Other draft articles 
include the condition that any religious organisation or union must have at least twenty founding 
members (article 4); allowing religious education only for children who are older than 7 years old 
(article 10); only allowing one mosque for villages that have a population of between 200 and 
2000 people (article 14). There are concerns that the draft law could lead to limits on the rights of 
religious communities.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>287. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response to the urgent appeal 
sent on 1 March 2006 and for having extended an invitation to visit the country. Consequently, 
she will address the question of the destruction of a synagogue in Dushanbe as well as the draft

<p><b>Communication sent on 2 June 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people</b> 
</p>
<p>288. The Special Rapporteurs raised concern on information they had received concerning <b>the 
desecration of Hmong graves in Wat Tham Krabok</b>. According to the allegations, monastery 
officials from the Wat Tham Krabok Buddhist monastery, which was formerly used as a Hmong 
refugee camp, have been exhuming Hmong graves. There are said to be about 2,000 Hmong 
graves in the Monastery. According to monastery officials the reason for digging up the graves is 
that they were contaminating the Monastery&#8217;s water supply. Relatives of the Hmong people 
buried at Wat Tham Krabok were not given notice of the exhumations. The Hmong consider 
graveyards to be sacred sites. The exhumations sometimes include dismemberment, separation of 
parts of the corpses and cremation, which violates Hmong religious and cultural tradition.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>289. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to refer to her 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to 
the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to worship&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. a) and 
&#8220;Places of worship&#8221; (category I. 3. b).  
</p>
<p>290. As she noted in her 2005 report to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/61, 
paras. 49-51): &#8220;Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that in addition to places of worship, 
different types of buildings or properties that have more than a material signification for the 
religious community that is attached to it, such as cemeteries, monasteries or community 
headquarters, have been targeted. Finally, while attacks on such places have usually been 
committed by non-State actors, other forms of harm or restrictions were usually committed or 
imposed by State authorities. Regarding, in particular, attacks on places of worship, the Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 69 
</p>
<p> 
Rapporteur wishes to point out that in addition to the special protection that is granted to 
religious places, sites and shrines by resolution 2004/36, members of religious communities or 
communities of belief, whenever they find themselves in places of worship, are in a situation of 
special vulnerability given the nature of their activity. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the 
opinion that States should pay increased attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that 
all perpetrators of such attacks are properly prosecuted and tried. More generally, as mentioned, 
inter alia, in paragraph 4 of the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 22, the Special 
Rapporteur insists that places of worship are an essential element of the manifestation of the right 
to freedom of religion or belief to the extent that the great majority of religious communities or 
communities of belief need the existence of a place of worship where their members can 
manifest their faith. Moreover, unlike other forms of violations of the right to freedom of religion 
or belief, attacks or other forms of restriction on places of worship or other religious sites and 
shrines in many cases violate the right not only of a single individual, but the rights of a group of 
individuals forming the community that is attached to the place in question.&#8221;

<p><b><i>Turkmenistan</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 2 December 2005 
</b></p>
<p>291. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the information that, 
since August 2005, the State Security Ministry (MSS) secret police has been monitoring young 
men who regularly visit mosques in the central Ahal region. The MSS is also systematically 
questioning the parents of young practising Muslims. Concern has been expressed that the 
authorities are conducting a campaign against Islam religious practice under the pretext of 
combating &#8220;Wahhabism&#8221;. Mr. <b>Muhamad Nurmukhamedov</b> and Mr. <b>Yager Kurbanov</b>, both 
residents of Dashoguz, were reportedly arrested as part of this campaign, after they were accused 
of &#8220;Wahhabism&#8221;. Reports further indicate that MSS secret police officers have obliged all Imams 
to post lists of mosque-goers above the doors of their mosques and to prevent people whose 
names are on the list from visiting the mosque. Concern has also been expressed that Imams are 
forced to place copies of the Ruhnama (Book of the Soul) in a place of honour in each mosque 
and to quote from it during sermons. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 February 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>292. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan informed that the relevant law 
enforcement agencies of Turkmenistan have taken steps to elucidate the incidents referred to in 
the communication and have established that the persons referred to in the communication do not 
live in Dashoguz velayat (province). In accordance with national legislation, religious 
organizations and groups, irrespective of their size, denomination or religion, are registered in 
Turkmenistan in compliance with universally recognized norms. There are no instances of 
detention of people on account of their beliefs, or of the application of administrative sanctions 
against them. 
</p>
<p>293. The Government of Turkmenistan maintains that the information obtained which states 
claims about the two mentioned persons are from unreliable sources and is absolutely untrue. The 
Government of Turkmenistan also inform that there has not been a single instance of arrest or 
conviction on political, religious or other grounds in Turkmenistan. Moreover, since its society is 
politically stable, all conditions have been created to ensure the livelihood and development of all </p>

nationalities and peoples living in the country. These opportunities are guaranteed by law, under 
which all violations of citizens&#8217; rights are punishable. The Government of Turkmenistan would 
also like to emphasize that the book Rukhnama recounts the origin and history of the religion, 
customs, traditions and ceremonies of the Turkmen. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>294.  The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that her mandate carries out a close and detailed assessment 
of the information in order to ensure that the situations or cases that are transmitted to 
Governments has a very high level of reliability. She would also like to draw the Government&#8217;s 
attention to the concluding observations which the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination adopted on 17-18 August 2005 (CERD/C/TKM/CO/5, para. 17): &#8220;The 
Committee, while stressing the complex relationship between ethnicity and religion in 
Turkmenistan, notes with concern information that members of religious groups do not fully 
enjoy their rights to freedom of religion and that some religious confessions remain unregistered. 
It notes, however, the relaxation of registration rules in 2004. The Committee recalls the State 
party&#8217;s obligation to ensure that all persons enjoy their right to freedom of religion, without any 
discrimination based on national or ethnic origin, in accordance with article 5 (d) of the 
Convention. The State party should accordingly respect the right of members of registered and 
unregistered religions to freely exercise their freedom of religion, and register religious groups 
who wish to be registered. Detailed information on religions actually registered in Turkmenistan 
should be provided to the Committee.&#8221; 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>295. The Special Rapporteur received information that on the morning of 7 October 2005, Ms. 
<b>Durdygul Ereshova</b> and Ms. <b>Annajemal</b> <b>Tuyliyeva</b>, were arrested by a district police officer, 
reportedly on suspicion of &#8220;illegal religious activity&#8221; and vagrancy. They were taken to Niyazov 
District Police Station where they were beaten by the police chief, Mr. Aymuradov, who ordered 
them to be taken to the basement and raped. They were ill-treated for several days before they 
were freed. The police stole a ring from Ms. Tuyliyeva and confiscated Ms. Ereshova&#8217;s passport. 
They were also threatened with internal deportation to a remote part of Turkmenistan, despite 
having a residence permit to live in Ashgabad.  
</p>
<p>296.  It has been reported that other Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses have recently been subjected to 
beatings and fines and have had religious literature confiscated. On the morning of 13 October 
2005, two police officers, including Murad from the 6th Department, took Ms. <b>Jamilya 
Kerimova</b> from her workplace in Ashgabad to her home. A police detachment of between five or 
six officers reportedly searched the house without a search warrant. The police photographed and 
confiscated all the religious literature they could find. Ms. Kerimova was brought to the 6th 
Department, where she was repeatedly beaten by police officers. On 14 October 2005, a Judge 
from the Ashgabad&#8217;s Kopetdag District Court fined her 150,000 Manats. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 5 January 2006

<p>297. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs states firstly that Turkmenistan is a secular State and,

unswerving and consistent conduct of policy for the comprehensive implementation of safeguards 
in the field of human rights and freedoms, including in the area of religion and belief.

<p>298. Article 11 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan stipulates that &#8220;the State guarantees 
freedom of religion and faith and the equality of religions and faiths before the law. Religious 
organizations are separate from the State, and may not interfere in its affairs or perform 
Governmental functions. Everyone has the right independently to determine his or her own 
religious preference, to practice any religion alone or in association with others or to practice no 
religion, to express and disseminate beliefs related to religious preference, and to participate in 
the performance of religious services, rituals and ceremonies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>299. Furthermore, Turkmenistan has proclaimed by law its obligations towards the international 
community in the field of human rights. The Declaration on the international human rights 
obligations of neutral Turkmenistan, adopted by the People&#8217;s Council (Khalk Maslakhaty) on 27 
December 1995, states that &#8220;Turkmenistan guarantees to everyone the rights and freedoms 
enshrined in the Constitution, laws and generally accepted norms of international law without any 
distinction as to race, sex, language, religion, place of residence, political and other beliefs, ethnic 
or social origin, wealth, official or other status&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>300. These principles were set forth in the Constitutional Act on the permanent neutrality of 
Turkmenistan passed on 27 December 1995, under which &#8220;Turkmenistan recognizes and respects 
the core of democratic rights and liberties of individuals and citizens adopted by the international 
community and enshrined in the norms of international law, and shall furnish political, economic, 
legal and other guarantees of their enjoyment in practice. Turkmenistan shall ensure the equality 
of all nations and peoples, freedom of religion and freedom of confession&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>301. The Government also indicates that religious organizations and groups in the territory of 
Turkmenistan are registered under its legislation and in compliance with generally accepted 
international norms, regardless of their size, belief and religion. This is evidenced by the fact that 
religious organizations and groups of Muslims, Orthodox Christians, the Seventh-day Adventist 
Church, Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, Evangelical Christian Baptists, Hare Krishna, the Church of Christ, the Greater 
Grace Evangelical Church, the Light of the East Evangelical Church, the Full Gospel Christian 
Church and the New Apostolic Church are now officially registered and functioning in 
Turkmenistan.   
</p>
<p>302. The Government also notes, at the same time, that, on the basis of the humanist traditions 
of the Turkmen people and guided by the principles of justice, clemency and philanthropy, 
pardons were granted to 10 people convicted of evading service in the army (they belonged, in 
their own words, to a group of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses) in 2004-2005. Despite the fact that these 
persons had committed an offence, i.e. refusal to perform military duties, which is a 
constitutional obligation for a Turkmenistan citizen, they were pardoned. 
</p>
<p>303. There are no instances of the detention of people on account of their beliefs, or of the 
application of administrative sanctions against them. With regard to the persons mentioned in 
communication sent, D. Ereshova and A. Tuyliyeva, who are members of a group of Jehovah&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 72 
 
Witnesses (which is not registered under the established procedure), it has been confirmed from 
the available information that they were living without any identity papers. Consequently, efforts 
were made pursuant to the law to determine their identities. These persons were not arrested and 
certainly not subjected to violence.  
</p>
<p>304. In relation to J. Karimova&#8217;s case, the Government maintains the information of the 
communication is contrary to the actual circumstances. Also, official meetings were held with 
diplomatic representatives, during which exhaustive replies were given. Accordingly, the 
Government regrets the use made of unreliable sources. 
</p>
<p>305. The Government also wants to point out that in Turkmenistan there has not been a single 
instance of an arrest or conviction for political, religious or other reasons. Furthermore, with the 
political stability existing in society all the conditions have been created to ensure the livelihood 
and development of representatives of all nationalities and peoples residing in the country. These 
opportunities are guaranteed by the law, under which any violation of the rights of citizens incurs 
the sanctions prescribed by law. 
</p>
<p>306.  To conclude, the Government emphasizes that Turkmenistan is demonstrating in practice 
its readiness to conduct a dialogue with international organizations, and especially the United 
Nations, in a spirit of constructiveness and commitment to the achievement of common goals 
defined in the name of peace and prosperity for the peoples forming the basis of our cooperation 
within the community of nations. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>307. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s detailed response and she would 
like to refer to her observations concerning the communication dated 2 December 2005. The 
Special Rapporteur hopes to receive a reply from the Government further to her letter sent in 
2003 asking for an invitation to visit Turkmenistan to assess the situation of freedom of religion 
or belief. 
</p>

<p><b>Communication sent on 30 June 2005  
</b></p>
<p>308. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Wazir Ahmed</b>, Mr. <b>Zahid Ahmed</b>, Mr. <b>Hashmat Ali</b>, 
Mr. <b>Abdul Majeed</b>, <b>Shamsulhaq</b>, Mr. <b>Muhammad Aslam</b> and Mr. <b>Muhammad Abid</b>, former 
detainees of the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They were among a group of forty-
five men originally arrested four years ago in Afghanistan. According to the information 
received, while they were in custody in Guantanamo Bay, the aforementioned were victims of ill-
treatment, such as sexual harassment during prayers as well as humiliation through desecration of 
the Holy Koran, which was deliberately designed to hurt their religious beliefs.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 24 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>309. The Government stated that the Department of Defense (DoD) has carefully looked into 
the matter of Koran mishandling at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The 
DoD investigation, completed in June 2005, found five instances of apparent mishandling by </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 73 
</p>
<p> 
guards or interrogators. The Government maintained its firm commitment to respect religious 
freedom and it stated that the United States is particularly dedicated to respecting the religious 
and cultural dignity of the Koran and the detainees&#8217; practice of faith. The Joint Task Force has 
carefully implemented a standard operating procedure that makes every effort to provide 
detainees with religious articles associated with the Islamic faith, accommodate prayers and 
religious periods, and provide culturally acceptable meals and practices.  
</p>
<p>310. The alleged instances of Koran mishandling were the focus of an in-depth investigation 
that was launched on 5 May 2005. This investigation found no credible evidence that a member 
of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay flushed a Koran down the toilet. An interview with 
the detainee who reportedly made this allegation revealed that he was not a witness to any such 
mistreatment and no other claims of this type have been made. The matter is therefore considered 
closed.  
</p>
<p>311. Since the issuing of Korans to detainees in January 2002, there have been nineteen 
incidents involving handling of the Koran by Joint Task Force personnel. Of these nineteen 
incidences, ten involved the touching of a Koran during the normal performance of duty. The 
other nine incidents involved intentional or unintentional mishandling of a Koran. General Hood, 
who led the investigation, identified seven incidents where a guard may have mishandled a 
Koran. In two additional instances (one confirmed) an interrogator may have mishandled a 
Koran. The investigation also revealed fifteen cases in which the detainees themselves 
mishandled or inappropriately treated the Koran.  
</p>
<p>312. With regard to the five instances of confirmed Koran mishandling the Joint Task Force 
specifically found:  
</p>
<p>313. During an interrogation in February 2002, a detainee complained that guards at Camp X-
ray kicked the Koran of a detainee in a neighbouring cell. The interrogator reported the incident, 
the guards were aware of the detainee&#8217;s complaint but there is no evidence of further 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>314. On 15 August 2003, two detainees complained that their Korans were wet because the 
night shift guards had thrown water balloons on the cell block. The complaints were recorded. It 
has not been determined whether further complaints were made by the detainees or whether their 
Korans were replaced. There is no evidence of further investigation into this incident.  
</p>
<p>315. On 21 August 2003, a detainee complained that a two-word obscenity had been scrawled 
in English on the inside cover of his English-language Koran. The complaint was recorded and 
the English-language Koran was taken from the detainee who retained his Arabic-language 
Koran. There is no record of a formal complaint of the detainee to the commander.  
</p>
<p>316. On 25 March 2005 a detainee complained to his guards that urine came through an air 
vent and splashed on him and his Koran while he lay near the air vent. A guard reported to his 
cellblock commander that he was at fault since he had left his post to urinate outside and had 
done so near the air vent so that the wind blew his urine into the air vent. The guard was relieved 
of duty and the detainee was immediately issued with a fresh uniform and a new Koran.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 74 
</p><p> 
317. On 25 July 2003, a contract interrogator apologized to a detainee for stepping on the 
detainee's Koran in an earlier interrogation. The memorandum of the 25 July 2003 interrogation 
shows that the detainee had reported to other detainees that his Koran had been stepped on. The 
detainee accepted the apology and agreed to inform other detainees of the apology and ask them 
to cease the disruptive behaviour caused by the incident. The interrogator was later terminated for 
a pattern of unacceptable behaviour. 
</p>
<p>318. As part of the investigation, General Hood has determined that the current guidance to the 
Guard force for handling the Koran is adequate although a number of recommendations for minor 
modifications are under review. The Government feels it is important to note the number of 
Korans (some 1600) which have been distributed among detainees to facilitate their desire to 
freely worship and the small number of very regrettable incidents should be seen in light of the 
volume of efforts to facilitate free religious practice.

<p><b>Communication sent on 3 April 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of

</p>
<p>320. The Special Rapporteurs raised concerns regarding information they had received 
regarding the case of <b>John H. Hartley</b>, who maintains to be<b> </b>a Native American from the 
Cherokee Nation. Mr. Hartley is currently in detention at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility 
(NY) where he is reportedly unable to practice his traditional religious beliefs due to lack of 
recognition of the correctional authorities of his affiliation to the Cherokee Nation. According to 
the information received his mother is Native American and he has been practicing his traditional 
religion since he was a child. His mother has signed a &#8220;Verification Affidavit&#8221; that describes her 
son as Native American. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>321. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to make reference to her 
predecessor&#8217;s conclusions after his country visit to the United States of America in 1998: 
&#8220;Concerning the religious rights of Native American prisoners, apart from the recommendation 
made in the section on legal issues, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the positive and 
practical action taken in many federal prisons (fully compatible with security requirements, e.g. 
ending the practice of cutting their hair) should become general throughout the United States 
prison system and that steps should be taken to ensure, particularly through training, and perhaps 
through penalties for prison officers and governors, that these rights are not treated as privileges 
that can be granted or refused at the whim of an authority or official.&#8221; (E/CN.4/1999/58/Add.1, 
para. 84).  
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 23 May 2006

<p>322. The Special Rapporteur received information concerning <b>Saifullah A. Paracha</b>, aged 58, 
a Pakistani national who has been detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay since September 2004. According </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
to the allegations received, Saifullah Paracha has not been allowed to speak to a chaplain since he 
arrived at Guant&#225;namo Bay in September 2004, despite the fact that he has indicated that he 
would be willing to speak to a Chaplain of any tradition.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>323. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She takes note of the response of the 
United States dated 14 March 2006 to the &#8220;Human Rights Experts Joint Report on the Situation 
in Guantanamo&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/120). The Special Rapporteur would be grateful if the 
Government extended an invitation to her to visit &#8211; together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the

</p>
<p>324. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Persons deprived of their liberty&#8221; (see above para. 1, category III. 2.). In this 
regard she noted in her 2005 report to the General Assembly (A/60/399, para. 80) that &#8220;[b]ecause 
the opportunity to practise one&#8217;s religion, either in private or in public, might easily be restricted 
by the fact of detention, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners make 
specific reference to the need for prison authorities to allow prisoners to observe their religion 
and to have access to a minister of that religion.&#8221;

persons were arrested by Kazakhstani authorities starting from 23 November 2005 in Southern 
Kazakhstan and handed over to the Uzbek authorities at the border between the two countries. 
They are now in the custody of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tashkent. They are accused of 
either &#8220;Wahabbism&#8221;, membership in &#8220;Akramia&#8221;, a banned religious movement or participation in 
the Andijan events of May 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 30 January 2007 
</b></p>
<p>326. The Government informed that Nozim Rakhmonov and Sharafutdin Latipov, both active 
members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, helped to create and lead the illegal 
organization &#8220;wahhabiy&#8221; starting from 1998, for which they were paid 150 USD per months. On </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 76 
 
20 February 2006, a criminal case was opened against them and they both fully confessed that 
they were guilty, which has been corroborated by testimonies and associations with whom they 
committed the crimes, confiscated material evidence and other materials found in the course of 
the preliminary investigation. On 8 May 2006, they both were found guilty by the criminal 
chamber of Tashkent City court of crimes under article 244 (1) of the Criminal Code, i.e. for 
preparing or distributing materials constituting a threat to public safety and societal order, and 
sentenced to five years of imprisonment. None of them filed any complaints during the pre-trial 
investigation. They are currently serving their sentences in KIN-61 and KIN-29.  
</p>
<p>327. Abdurakhman Ibragimov, Alisher Mirzakholov, Abdurauf Khalmuratov and Alijon 
Mirganiev, all active members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, helped to create and lead 
the illegal organization &#8220;wahhabiy&#8221; starting from 1998, for which they were paid 150 USD per 
months. From the moment of their respective arrests, all of them had full access to their lawyers 
and all investigative actions were conducted in presence of their defense lawyers. They also were 
allowed to repeatedly be visited by their family members. On 7 March 2006, all of them were 
accused of crimes under article 244 (2) of the Criminal Code, i.e. of setting up, leading or 
participating in a religious-extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other illegal organization. 
Abdurakhman Ibragimov, Alisher Mirzakholov and Alijon Mirganiev fully confessed that they 
were guilty. Abdurauf Khalmuratov partly confessed his guilt. On 17 May 2006, they were all 
found guilty by the court and sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>328. Tohirjon Abdusamatov, an active member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, 
helped to create and lead the illegal organization &#8220;wahhabiy&#8221; starting from 1998, for which he 
was paid 150 USD per months. On 4 April 2006 a criminal case was opened against him under 
articles 244 (2) and 248 (3) of the Criminal Code. On 14 June he was sentenced to 10 years of 
imprisonment, which he is serving in KIN-49.  
</p>
<p>329. Shoirmat Sharakhmetov, helped to create and lead the illegal organization &#8220;wahhabiy&#8221; 
starting from 1998. He was arrested by police on 22 December 2005 in Tashkent Region. In the 
course of the investigation it was found that he is suffering from schizophrenia and needs forced 
medical treatment, which was confirmed by a decision of the criminal chamber of Tashkent City 
court on 20 April 2006. He therefore was sent to Tashkent psychiatric hospital n. 1, where he still 
is.  
</p>
<p>330. Azomodin Kasimjanov, member of &#8220;Akromiya&#8221;, actively participated in the so-called 
demonstrations organized close to the court building in Andijan and in the armed group that 
attacked the military unit and the akhimyat. On 29 November 2005 a criminal case was opened 
under a series of aricles of the Criminal Code, including terrorism, premeditated murder, illegal 
possession of weapons etc. Two days later he was arrested and on 21 July 2006 the criminal 
chamber of Tashkent City Court sentenced him to 13 years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>331. Rukhiddin Fakhrutdinov, on 15 September 2006, was found guilty of crimes under a 
series of articles of the Criminal code including terrorism, falsification of documents, illegal 
entering or leaving of the territory of Uzbekistan etc and sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment 
by the criminal chamber of Tashkent City Court. He partly confessed to having committed the 
crimes he was accused of. In addition, several witnesses, such as A. Kholierov, B. Abdukhalikov, 
D. Akhmedov confirmed that R. Fakhrutdinov had given them monthly lessons with the 
underlying aim of conducting jihad in order to overthrow the constitutional system of the </p>

Yakubov was punished by 15 days in an isolation cell for reciting Muslim prayers (namaz). 
According to the information received, prisoners at Labour camp 64/47 are prohibited from 
saying prayers at all times, in contravention of internal prison regulations which allow prisoners 
to say prayers from the time the guards awaken them until curfew time. There are also concerns 
that the internal prison regulations, applicable throughout the country, prevent prisoners from 
saying dawn prayers before the guards awaken the prisoners.

houses</b>. According to the information received, following a meeting of the heads of the main 
confessions organised by the Religious Affairs Department held on 28 July 2006, a number of 
changes to the criminal and administrative Codes were announced. In particular these changes 
provide that persons who promote the bible outside prayer houses should be fined, and, in case of 
repeated attempts, imprisoned. Also the &#8220;pastor&#8221; of the church to which the person belongs can 
be fined or punished. These punishments also apply if a person carries more than one bible since 
it is assumed that only one is needed for private use.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>336. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a reply from the 
Government concerning the above mentioned allegation. She would like to take the opportunity </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 78 
 
to remind the Government of article 6 (d) of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, according to which the 
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief includes the freedom, &#8220;[t]o write, issue 
and disseminate relevant publications in these areas&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>337. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her framework for 
communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the mandate 
practice concerning &#8220;Teaching and disseminating materials, including missionary activity&#8221; (see 
above para. 1, category I. 3. f). In her 2005 report to the General Assembly, she noted the 
following (see A/60/399, para. 62): &#8220;Whereas the scope of freedom afforded to persons for the 
practice of their religion or belief by producing and distributing information about their religion 
or belief is wide, certain limitations can be imposed in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3, of 
the Covenant. However, it should be noted that this article allows for restrictions only in very 
exceptional cases. In particular the fact that it mentions the protection of &#8220;<i>fundamental</i> rights and 
freedoms&#8221; (emphasis added) of others as a ground for restriction indicates a stronger protection 
than for some other rights whose limitation clauses refer simply to the &#8220;rights and freedoms of 
others&#8221; (e.g. article 12, 21 and 22). It could indeed be argued that the freedom of religion or 
belief of others can be regarded as such a fundamental right and freedom and would justify 
limitations to missionary activities, but the freedom of religion and belief of adults basically is a 
question of individual choice, so any generalized State limitation (e.g. by law) conceived to 
protect &#8220;others&#8217;&#8221; freedom of religion and belief by limiting the right of individuals to conduct 
missionary activities should be avoided.&#8221;

<p>338. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding Mr.<b> Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin, </b>imam of a mosque in the city of Kara-
Suu, Mr. <b>Ayubkhodja Shahobidinov</b> and Mr. <b>Fathullo Rahimov</b>. On 6 August 2006, the above-
mentioned individuals were killed in the city of Osh, Kyrgyzstan, as the result of an alleged 
counter terrorism operation, led by the National Security Service of Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation 
with the security forces of Uzbekistan. It has been reported that these individuals were suspected 
members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and were planning to carry out a terrorist attack 
on the territory of the State of Uzbekistan. Other reports highlight that it was not alleged that Mr. 
Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or that he 
was involved in the commission of terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p><b>Statement conveyed by the Government on 24 November 2006 
</b></p>
<p>339. The Government of Uzbekistan conveyed the text of a statement by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan of 24 November 2006. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs indicated that the news of the inclusion of Uzbekistan by the U.S. State Department in the 
so-called list of &#8220;states which cause a particular concern in the sphere of observance of religious 
freedoms&#8221; was received with astonishment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs set out that religious 
tolerance and forbearance have always been and remain to be the most important component of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan&#8217;s state policy. It states that there are eighteen religious confessions in 
the country, including Islam, the Orthodox, the Judaism and Catholicism, and that they coexist </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/21/Add.1 
page 79 
</p>
<p> 
peacefully and freely observe their religious practices. There have been no conflicts regarding 
religious situations in the past years. 
</p>
<p>340. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regrets some entirely groundless statements by particular 
politicians, statesmen and mass media, which they consider of an explicitly provocative 
orientation, capable of undermining the mutual understanding among religions. Particularly, it 
refers to the link which is made between international terrorism and the Muslims. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs highlights that some slogans coming from the Western press circulate with 
offensive assessments, which hurt the honour, national dignity and feelings of hundreds of 
millions of Muslim believers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also affirms that the Republic of 
Uzbekistan is one of the acclaimed hubs of the development of Islamic culture and philosophy. It 
consistently pursues the policy of restoring, learning and preserving their rich spiritual heritage. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>341. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that she has not received a substantive response to 
the communication sent jointly on 1 September 2006. She would like to emphasize that her 
mandate primarily receives information from non-state-entities and not from Governmental 
sources. The Special Rapporteur would be grateful if the Government of Uzbekistan indicated 
the legal basis for designating an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; as well as the consequences 
of such qualification under the law of Uzbekistan. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to refer to her most recent annual report to the Human Rights Council where she also covers 
the issue of &#8220;Violations linked to counter-terrorism measures&#8221; (A/HRC/4/21, para. 40): &#8220;The 
Special Rapporteur is conscious of the fact that the States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote 
human rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism. However, she would 
like to underline that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies 
with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee 
and humanitarian law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>342. The Special Rapporteur hopes to receive a reply from the Government further to her letter 
sent in 2004 asking for an invitation to visit Uzbekistan to assess the situation of freedom of 
religion or belief.

<p><b>Communication sent on 12 December 2005  
</b></p>
<p>343. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received concerning <b>Vo Van Thanh Liem</b>, a Hoa Hao Buddhist. According what is been alleged, 
on 14 September 2005, Vo Van Thanh Liem was convicted on charges of &quot;opposing public 
authorities&quot; and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. The trial took place before a closed court. He 
was arrested by local police officers in front of the Quang Minh Tu Temple, also known as Coc 
Ong Tu in Cho Moi District, An Giang Province on 5 August 2005. Prior to his arrest, local police 
officers surrounded the temple and barricaded the gate, preventing people from attending 
religious ceremonies. There is concern that his trial and conviction may have been linked to his 
religious activities.  </p>

344. There is also concern that the Standing Committee of Vietnam&#8217;s National Assembly 
issued an &#8216;Ordinance Regarding Religious Belief and Religious Organizations&#8217; on 18 June 2004. 
The Ordinance confines all religious activities to &#8220;religious establishments&#8221;. This Ordinance has 
restricted the religious activities of Hoa Hao Buddhists, who tend to carry out private acts of 
home-based worship. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government sent on 24 January 2006</b> 
</p>
<p>345. The Government indicated that, on 2 April 2005, Vo Van Thanh Liem threw petrol at 3 
women while they were doing morning exercises, causing eyes injuries to Ms. Tran Thi Hang 
(injury percentage: 17%). On 5 April 2005, Ms. Hang lodged a request for legal action against 
Mr. Liem. On 5 August 2005, Mr. Liem was arrested and charged for &#8220;intentionally causing 
injury or doing harm to the health of other persons&#8221; (Article 104 of the Penal Code of Vietnam). 
The arrest was made while he was in his residence. On 15 September 2005, the People&#8217;s Court of 
Cho Moi district, An Giang province, put Mr. Vo Van Thanh Liem on trial and sentenced him to 6 
years and 6 months of prison for his offence. There has been no appeal from Mr. Liem. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>346.  The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response; however, she would 
like to enquire about the rationale behind the provisions of the &#8216;Ordinance Regarding Religious 
Belief and Religious Organizations&#8217; which confine all religious activities to &#8220;religious 
establishments&#8221;. In this regard, she wants to remind the Government of article 6 of the 1981 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
Religion or Belief, according to which the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or 
belief includes the freedom, &#8220;(a) To worship or assemble in connection with a religion or belief 
[&#8230;]; (c) To make, acquire and use the necessary articles and materials related to the rites or 
customs of a religion or belief&#8221;. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to 
the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to worship&#8221; (see above para. 1, category I. 3. a) and 
&#8220;Places of worship&#8221; (category I. 3. b).
