<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights 
focuses on the right to participation of people living in poverty. Participation is a basic 
human right in itself, a precondition or catalyst for the realization and enjoyment of other 
human rights, and of fundamental importance in empowering people living in poverty to 
tackle inequalities and asymmetries of power in society. The report presents the human 
rights approach to participation and a framework based on human rights for how to include 
people living in poverty in the design, implementation and evaluation of policies and 
programmes in a meaningful and effective way, taking into account the obstacles they face.

<p><b> I. Activities undertaken by the mandate holder 
</b></p>
<p>1. The current report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 17/13.  
</p>
<p>2. Since her previous annual report (A/HRC/20/25), the Special Rapporteur has 
submitted a report to the General Assembly (A/67/278), in which she analyses the obstacles 
to access to justice for persons living in poverty.  
</p>
<p>3. At the twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council, in accordance with 
resolution 15/19, the Special Rapporteur presented the final draft of the guiding principles 
on extreme poverty and human rights (A/HRC/21/39), adopted by consensus on 27 
September 2012 in resolution 21/11. In December 2012, in the biannual resolution on 
human rights and extreme poverty (A/RES/67/164), the General Assembly took note of the 
guiding principles with appreciation. Since then, the Special Rapporteur has met with the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (November 2012) and with the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (February 2013) during 
which she encouraged Committee members to refer to the guiding principles in future 
discussions with State parties.  
</p>
<p>4. During the current reporting cycle, the Special Rapporteur also visited Namibia 
(October 2012) and Mongolia (December 2012). She takes this opportunity to thank both 
Governments for the active support they provided during the missions. 
</p>
<p>5. Additionally, during the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur participated in 
numerous events and held working meetings with Governments, United Nations agencies, 
the World Bank, donor agencies, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) and representatives of people living in poverty. Information about these meetings 
can be found on the mandate&#8217;s website.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>6. The issue of participation is at the core of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate: through 
its resolutions 8/11 and 17/13, the Human Rights Council requested her to, inter alia, make 
recommendations on how persons living in extreme poverty can participate in the definition 
of measures affecting them. The Special Rapporteur has emphasized the importance of 
participation in all her reports, including the conceptual framework outlined at the start of 
her mandate (A/63/274).  
</p>
<p>7. In order to respond to the Human Rights Council&#8217;s request, the present report 
examines the key human rights principles and standards that determine the content of the 
right to participation with regard to the poorest and most marginalized members of society. 
After examining these norms and standards, the report presents a human rights-based 
framework for meaningful, empowering participation and elucidates the necessary actions 
and enabling factors to support and enable such participation for people living in poverty.   
</p>
<p>8. While the issue of participation of people living in poverty is a common theme in the 
literature on development and humanitarian aid, there has been little discussion of this topic 
from a human rights perspective. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision 
of the Human Rights Council to bring the discussion to human rights forums.   
</p>

<p>9. In order to prepare the report, the Special Rapporteur addressed a questionnaire to 
States and other stakeholders requesting information on participatory mechanisms 
implemented at the domestic level. The responses are available on the mandate&#8217;s website.2 
The Special Rapporteur benefited from a review of many studies on participation, and from 
an expert meeting convened by her and organized by the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on 28 and 29 January 2013. The Special Rapporteur also participated in a 
workshop convened by International Movement ATD Fourth World from 24 to 26 January 
2013 in Pierrelaye, France, which brought together activists living in poverty, community 
workers, academics and representatives of NGOs and United Nations agencies to produce 
recommendations on participation at the conclusion of a 2 1/2 year evaluation of the 
Millennium Development Goals by people living in poverty in 11 countries.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her gratitude to all States and civil society 
organizations that submitted information, and to the experts, NGOs and United Nations 
agencies that supported this process and assisted in the preparation of the present report. 
The Special Rapporteur is particularly grateful for the support and guidance of International 
Movement ATD Fourth World. 
</p>
<p>11. The primary focus of the present report is on States&#8217; role in participation, as States 
maintain the primary responsibility for human rights protection. However, other actors also 
have an important role to play in facilitating and organizing participation; thus, the human 
rights-based framework presented is not exclusive to State-managed processes. The final 
section gives recommendations to States on concrete actions they can take to respect, 
protect and fulfil the right to participation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Participation, power and poverty 
</b></p>
<p>12. Lack of power is a universal and basic characteristic of poverty. Poverty is not solely 
a lack of income, but rather is characterized by a vicious cycle of powerlessness, 
stigmatization, discrimination, exclusion and material deprivation, which all mutually 
reinforce each other. Powerlessness manifests itself in many ways, but at its core is an 
inability to participate in or influence decisions that profoundly affect one&#8217;s life, while 
decisions are made by more powerful actors who neither understand the situation of people 
living in poverty, nor necessarily have their interests at heart.  
</p>
<p>13. The right of people living in poverty to participate fully in society and in decision-
making is blocked by multiple compounding obstacles &#8211; economic, social, structural, legal 
and systemic.3 All of these relate to their lack of financial, social and political power. 
Discrimination and stigma, disempowerment, lack of income, mistrust and fear of 
authorities all limit the possibilities and incentives for people living in poverty to 
participate. Due to their lack of status and power, people living in poverty are also 
particularly vulnerable to corruption, clientelism or co-option. At the most extreme level, 
poor or marginalized individuals may face reprisal (emanating from State or non-State 
actors such as corrupt community leaders of business enterprises) if they speak out in 
participatory spaces, in the form of violence or threats to them, their families, property or 
livelihoods. Often, the economic dependency of people living in poverty on more powerful 
</p>
<p>  
 2  Questionnaire responses were received from Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Brcko District), 
</p>
<p>Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Estonia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, 
Lithuania, Mexico, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Qatar, Romania, Senegal, Serbia, Slovenia and Tunisia. 
Civil society organizations also responded to a similar questionnaire. All responses are available from 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/ResponsesGovernmentsLivingInPoverty.aspx 
</p>
<p> 3  Many are similar to obstacles they confront in trying to access other rights; see A/67/278 (2012). </p>


<p>individuals or groups may also prevent them from participating or speaking out, even in the 
absence of concrete threats, for fear of losing their livelihoods. This is a problem 
particularly in very hierarchical or caste-based societies. 
</p>
<p>14. Material deprivation and disempowerment create a vicious circle: the greater the 
inequality, the less the participation; the less the participation, the greater the inequality.4 
When the participation of people living in poverty is not actively sought and facilitated, 
they are not able to participate in decision-making and their needs and interests are not 
taken into account when policy is designed and implemented. This exacerbates their 
exclusion and often perpetuates the privilege of elites who are able to influence policy 
directly, or of groups such as the middle class who have a considerable voice in the media 
or other public spaces. Lack of participation in decision-making and in civil, social and 
cultural life is thus recognized by the international community as a defining feature and 
cause of poverty, rather than just its consequence.5 
</p>
<p>15. Arguably, the main aim of human rights is transforming power dynamics between 
individuals in society, in order to challenge oppression, subvert the subordination and 
marginalization of certain groups and individuals, and promote individual agency, 
autonomy and respect of the inherent dignity of every human being. The theory and 
practice of human rights is deeply concerned with preventing powerful actors from 
imposing their will or interests at the expense of others through coercion, force or 
manipulation. Thus, participatory processes based on human rights do not accept power 
dynamics as they are. Rather, they start from the premise that power differentials must be 
eliminated and seek to explicitly recognize and challenge inequality, including structural 
and systemic power imbalances in social and economic life. In order to do so, it is 
necessary to understand the way that power plays out in a particular context, to diagnose 
asymmetrical power relations and understand how power is exercised both within and 
between communities to control and exclude disadvantaged groups.  
</p>
<p>16. Through meaningful and effective participation, people can exercise their agency, 
autonomy and self-determination. Participation also limits the capacity of elites to impose 
their will on individuals and groups who may not have the means to defend their interests. 
Conceived as a right, participation is a means of challenging forms of domination that 
restrict people&#8217;s agency and self-determination. It gives people living in poverty power over 
decisions that affect their lives, transforming power structures in society and creating a 
greater and more widely shared enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>17. Rights-based participation is particularly necessary in order to ensure that the 
poorest and most marginalized people can make their voices heard, because of its 
principled foundations of dignity, non-discrimination and equality. Therefore, in contrast to 
some supposedly &#8220;participatory&#8221; processes that are pro forma, tokenistic or undertaken to 
give predetermined policies a veneer of legitimacy, rights-based participation aims to be 
transformative rather than superficial or instrumental. It promotes and requires the active, 
free, informed and meaningful participation of persons living in poverty at all stages of the 
design, implementation and evaluation of policies that affect them, based on a 
comprehensive analysis of their rights, capacity and vulnerabilities, power relations, gender 
relations and the roles of different actors and institutions.6

<p>18. Participation has been associated with a range of positive effects in development 
cooperation, humanitarian aid and poverty reduction programmes, such as better 
assessment of needs and capacities, and improvements in implementation and 
sustainability. However, the degree of positive impact that participation can have on 
poverty reduction is debated, and depends on what type of participation is being studied and 
in what arena. Nevertheless, evidence shows that in many cases participatory processes 
have shown positive outcomes in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion, 
particularly in building organization and capacity, strengthening social cohesion and 
democratic governance and creating better development outcomes (such as improved 
services).7 Participation in processes like budget formulation or service monitoring has 
brought tangible benefits to persons living in poverty in specific cases. However, 
participation on its own is not a silver bullet for poverty reduction, and must be combined 
with other inputs such as improvements in public services, education and accountability 
mechanisms to achieve this end.8  
</p>
<p>19. Moreover, as participation is not merely a means to an end (e.g. poverty reduction) 
but rather a fundamental human right and valuable in and of itself, the most important 
outcomes &#8211; such as exercising self-determination, rights consciousness, assertiveness and 
empowerment, increased capacity and social capital &#8211; may be intangible or difficult to 
measure. While acknowledging the instrumental benefits participation may have, this report 
focuses on participation as an inherent right that aims to empower those living in poverty, 
and seeks to identify the conduct and actions that States must undertake to respect, protect 
and promote this right for people living in poverty.  
</p>
<p>20. This report focuses on the intrinsic value of participation as a fundamental right to 
which individuals are inherently entitled by virtue of their humanity. This right to take part 
and exert influence in decision-making processes that affect one&#8217;s life is inextricably linked 
to the most fundamental understanding of being human and the purpose of rights: respect of 
dignity and the exercise of agency, autonomy and self-determination. The right to 
participation imposes concrete obligations on States voluntarily assumed in several binding 
human rights instruments.9  
</p>
<p>21. Participation, when undertaken with a rights foundation, provides an opportunity for 
people living in poverty to be active agents in their own destiny; thus, it is fundamentally 
important to reclaiming dignity. Testimony from people living in poverty confirms that 
meaningful and effective participation can have important effects: building self-respect and 
gaining the respect of others; creating a sense of belonging; becoming part of a network 
where they can recount their experience and feel they are listened to and supported by 
others; regaining self-confidence and developing a plan for the future; being recognized as 
a human being.10 
</p>
<p>22. The right to participation is strongly linked with empowerment, which is a key 
human rights goal and principle. Effective participation can build capacity and rights 
awareness. It allows those living in poverty to see themselves as full members of society 
and autonomous agents rather than subjects of decisions taken by others who see them as 
objects of assistance or mere statistics. As stated by a Peruvian activist, &#8220;[f]or us,

<p>participating means leaving our isolation, breaking our silence and overcoming our fear&#8230; 
Before I was afraid, but now I&#8217;m strong, not humbled&#8221;.11 It can also provide people living 
in poverty with the chance to speak out against and challenge injustice, discrimination and 
stigma. It can give them confidence in dealing with government officials and bureaucracy. 
Indeed, exercising their right to participation can be a springboard to fully claiming other 
rights.    
</p>
<p>23. Ultimately, the enjoyment of the right to participation can benefit society as a whole, 
building trust and solidarity, creating better social cohesion and contributing to more 
inclusive and pluralistic societies, and bringing new issues and voices into the public arena.  
</p>
<p>24. There is no doubt that initiating and sustaining meaningful and effective 
participatory processes requires time, patience, resources and planning. However, it is not a 
simple policy option that policymakers can choose not to implement. States (all branches at 
the local, national and international levels) have a legal obligation to implement inclusive, 
meaningful and non-discriminatory participatory processes and mechanisms, and to engage 
constructively with the outcomes. With political will, all States are in a position to improve 
the enjoyment of this right. The practices of some States, United Nations agencies and civil 
society organizations has shown that it is possible for States to create or support 
participatory mechanisms that succeed in empowering disadvantaged members of the 
public and improving policy. Experience shows that the benefits and opportunities 
outweigh the risks and challenges. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. The international human rights framework affirms the right to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs and the right of those affected by key decisions to participate in 
the relevant decision-making processes. The right to participation is enshrined in numerous 
international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (arts. 21 and 27), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 25), 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  (arts. 13.1 and 15.1), 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (arts. 7, 
8, 13(c) and 14.2), the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (art. 5(e)(vi)), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 12 and 31), 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (arts. 3(c), 4.3, 9, 29 and 30), the 
International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their 
Families (arts. 41 and 42.2), the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development 
(arts. 1.1, 2 and 8.2) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (arts. 5, 18, 19 and 41).  
</p>
<p>26. These norms have been further developed by human rights monitoring bodies, who 
have emphasized that participation should be understood broadly and requires concrete 
political, legal and institutional actions. Electoral participation is just one specific 
expression of the right to participation (A/HRC/18/42, para. 5); although free and fair 
elections are a crucial component, they are not enough to ensure that those living in poverty 
enjoy the right to participation in key decisions affecting their lives (E/C.12/2001/10, 
para.12). According to the Human Rights Committee, the right to participation in the 
conduct of public affairs covers &#8220;all aspects of public administration, including the 
formulation and implementation of policy at international, national, regional and local 
levels&#8221; (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7, para. 5). The right to participation necessitates 
</p>
<p>  
 11  International Movement ATD Fourth World, <i>Extreme Poverty is Violence: Breaking the Silence, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Searching for Peace</i>, 2012, p. 60. </p>


<p>participatory mechanisms with a legal basis, providing for &#8220;access to appropriate 
information, adequate support, feedback &#8230; and procedures for complaints, remedies or 
redress&#8221; (CRC/C/GC/12, para. 48). Participation should not be a one-off event, but requires 
a long process of intensive dialogue regarding the development of policies, programmes 
and measures in all relevant contexts (ibid., para. 13). For example, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has said that participation in decision-making 
processes must be an integral component of any policy, programme or strategy related to 
the rights to health and water (E/C.12/2000/4, para. 54, and E/C.12/2002/11, para. 48). The 
right is not limited to participation in formal political institutions, but also in civil, cultural 
and social activities (A/HRC/18/42, Annex, para. 5); for example, the right to take part in 
cultural life is also an essential element of the right to participation, and States must adopt 
concrete measures to ensure enjoyment of this right (E/C.12/GC/21, para. 39). 
</p>
<p>27. All human rights are interdependent and indivisible, and participation is no 
exception. Ensuring effective and meaningful participation of people living in poverty thus 
requires that a broad set of interlinked human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled by 
the State, especially freedom of expression (Universal Declaration of Human Rights art. 19, 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 19), freedom of assembly 
(Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 20; International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, art. 21), freedom of association (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
art. 20; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 22; Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, art. 7(c); Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, art. 15), the right to seek, receive and impart information (Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, art. 19; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
art. 19) and the right to education, including the right to human rights education 
(International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 13.1; Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, art. 26.2; Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 29.1; 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 24(c)). All these rights are 
necessary preconditions to participation: in order to participate effectively, all members of 
the public must be able to organize, meet, express themselves without intimidation or 
censorship, know the relevant facts and arguments, be conscious of their rights and have the 
requisite skills and capacity. To ensure accountability and access to remedy and redress in 
cases where rights are violated, States parties should also ensure that all members of the 
public have effective access to justice, including the right to a fair trial (Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, arts. 8 and 10; International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, art. 14) and the right to an effective remedy (International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, art. 3) (A/67/578). 
</p>
<p>28. Regarding the right to information, States have to make every effort to ensure easy, 
prompt, effective and practical access to information which might be of public interest, 
including by proactively making this information available and putting in place necessary 
procedures which enable prompt, effective, practical and easy access to information. Fees 
charged should not constitute an unreasonable impediment to access to information, and an 
appeals system should be in place to challenge failures to provide information 
(CCPR/C/CG/34). 
</p>
<p>29. Education is a key human right in itself, and a means by which disadvantaged adults 
and children can lift themselves out of poverty and participate fully in their communities 
(E/C.12/1999/10, para. 1). The right to education, as reflected in the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, specifically provides that education shall &#8220;enable 
all persons to participate effectively in a free society&#8221;; educational programmes should 
therefore transmit the necessary knowledge to enable full participation, on an equal footing, 
in local and national communities (E/C.12/GC/21, para. 27). </p>


<p>30. States therefore have positive obligations under international human rights law to 
establish specific mechanisms at all the relevant levels to ensure that all persons concerned 
have the de facto opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs and decisions that 
might affect them (A/63/274, para. 22). This is especially relevant for people living in 
extreme poverty who might lack the necessary strength, knowledge or education required to 
make a meaningful contribution to the conduct of public affairs.  
</p>
<p><b>  Other sources of international law 
</b></p>
<p>31. Aside from the United Nations human rights instruments, various other legal 
frameworks also refer to participation. While not specifically focused on participation of 
people living in poverty, these other frameworks could also assist in determining the legal 
content of the right to participation. For example, the Convention on Access to Information, 
Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 
(Aarhus Convention) regulates procedural rights for environmental decision-making for 
State parties. It links environmental rights with human rights, and in particular the right to 
participation,12 and is based on three pillars &#8211; access to information, public participation in 
decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters. The Convention sets out 
minimum requirements for public participation in various categories of environmental 
decision-making. The public participation requirements include: (a) timely and effective 
notification to the concerned public; (b) reasonable time frames for participation, including 
provision for participation at an early stage; (c) a right for the concerned public to inspect 
information relevant to the decision-making process at no cost; (d) an obligation for the 
decision-making body to take due account of the outcome of public participation; and (e) 
prompt public notification of the decision, with the text of the decision and the reasons and 
</p>
<p>considerations on which it is based made publicly accessible.13  
</p>
<p>32. The Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of the International Labour 
Organization (1989) (ILO Convention No. 169) is focused on participation of indigenous 
people in decision-making, and is the only international convention to assign governments 
the duty of face-to-face consultation with communities.14 It states that consultation with 
indigenous peoples should be undertaken through appropriate procedures, in good faith and 
through the representative institutions of these peoples; the peoples involved should have 
the opportunity to participate freely at all levels in the formulation, implementation and 
evaluation of measures and programmes that affect them directly. ILO Convention No. 169 
also specifies individual circumstances in which consultation with indigenous and tribal 
peoples is an obligation. In particular, relocation/displacement of the community should 
take place only with their &#8220;free and informed consent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. If not developed with the indigenous and tribal institutions or organizations that are 
truly representative of the peoples in question, consultations will not comply with the 
requirements of the Convention. Notably, in applying the Convention, several judgments of 
national and regional tribunals have found that the non-participation of indigenous groups 
in consultation or decision-making processes violated their rights and, as such, a broad set 
of measures have been judicially ordered, from the invalidation of approval of government

</p>
<p>34. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, although not 
legally binding, developed further the importance of free, prior and informed consent in 
matters of fundamental importance for the rights, survival and dignity of indigenous 
peoples,16 based on their right to self-determination. &#8220;Free&#8221; means without coercion, 
intimidation or manipulation; &#8220;prior&#8221; implies in advance of the activity or decision being 
made, with sufficient time for indigenous peoples to undertake their own decision-making 
processes; &#8220;informed&#8221; necessitates provision of objective, accurate and complete 
information relating to the activity, presented in a manner and form understandable to 
indigenous peoples (A/HRC/18/42, Annex, para. 25). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights-based approach to participation 
</b></p>
<p>35. While the existing legal framework does not refer specifically to how to ensure and 
support the participation of people living in poverty, a systematic and teleological 
interpretation17 of several human rights norms, standards and principles can provide 
guidance. In the present section, several key human rights principles will be examined with 
the aim of determining how the right to participation of people living in poverty should be 
understood and realized from a human rights perspective. The subsequent section then 
provides concrete recommendations to States on how to operationalize these principles.  
</p>
<p>36. The following human rights principles should guide all participatory processes, 
including the design, formulation, implementation, follow-up and evaluation. With each 
principle are listed guidelines which are intended to demonstrate what specific measures 
that principle would necessitate in order to achieve a participatory process that is human 
rights compliant, inclusive of and accessible to people living in poverty. The guidelines 
listed are not exhaustive,18 nor will each apply or be appropriate in every circumstance.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Respect for dignity, autonomy and agency  
</b></p>
<p>37. Dignity is the foundation of all human rights, inextricably linked to the principles of 
equality and non-discrimination. When based on human rights, participation can help to 
reclaim the dignity and autonomy of people living in poverty by recognizing them as active 
agents with rights and responsibilities, and enabling agency in decisions that directly affect 
their lives.  
</p>
<p>38. Respect for the inherent dignity of those living in poverty must inform all 
participatory processes and strategies, and each person&#8217;s expertise, experience and input 
</p>
<p>must be valued. First and foremost, participation must be premised on the recognition of 
each person as a valid speaking partner with a unique and valuable knowledge to 
contribute. Participatory processes should begin with and be premised on the

 16  See e.g., articles 10, 11, 19, 28, 29 and 32. 
 17  Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. 
 18  Due to the nature and limitations of this document, this section refers in general to the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>the right to participation by people living in poverty. Additional measures would be needed to 
facilitate the participation of certain specific groups or individuals such as children, older persons, 
persons with disabilities and indigenous peoples. The present report does not include an outline of 
such specific measures.  </p>


<p>understandings and perspectives of people living in poverty, and give value to these, rather 
than assuming that they will comply with officials&#8217; assumptions, methods or thinking.19  
</p>
<p>39. To fully respect dignity and autonomy, participatory processes must be meaningful 
for those living in poverty and they should be able to exert influence over the final 
outcome. They should be included in all stages of the relevant decision-making processes 
so that they have the chance to set priorities or question the agenda in fundamental ways. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>40. All human beings must be able to enjoy and exercise their human rights on a basis of 
equality, free from discrimination of any kind. The principle of equality and non-
discrimination implies that everyone should have equal and effective opportunities for 
making their views known to other members of society, and to be part of decision-making 
processes. Particular efforts must be made to ensure that certain groups who suffer 
structural forms of discrimination - including but not limited to women, ethnic minorities 
and persons with disabilities - have equal opportunities to express their views, including by 
assigning specific resources, mechanisms and strategies for this purpose.  
</p>
<p>41. Non-discrimination and equality are core elements of the international human rights 
framework.20 These principles must be respected in all stages of the participatory process, 
from selection of the participants to evaluation.  
</p>
<p>42. People living in poverty experience discrimination on the grounds of poverty itself 
(E/C.12/GC/20, paras. 34&#8211;35), but also frequently due to membership in other 
disadvantaged sectors of the population, including but not limited to indigenous peoples, 
persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities and people living with HIV/AIDS. Particular 
attention must be paid to upholding the right to equality between men and women.21 Thus, 
when designing, implementing and monitoring participatory processes, States must take 
into account the different experiences of men and women and gender power relations in the 
community. They must recognize the multiple forms of discrimination that women 
experience, and address women&#8217;s specific needs throughout the different phases of their life 
cycle (childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age). Participatory processes must also 
acknowledge the responsibilities of care providers without reinforcing patterns of 
discrimination and negative stereotyping. 
</p>
<p>43. Even where participatory mechanisms exist, people living in poverty face serious 
constraints in accessing or exerting influence through them,22 such as lack of information, 
low levels of education and illiteracy. At the logistical level, participatory processes often 
require time and resources that people living in poverty simply do not have; for example, 
they may have to pay for transportation to reach a meeting venue, find childcare or take

<p>time off work, thereby sacrificing hourly pay. Many people living in poverty live in remote 
rural locations and do not speak the official language; thus, they may find it difficult to 
access information about participatory processes or reach meeting venues.  
</p>
<p>44. The principle of equality and non-discrimination requires affirmative action to 
ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to participate. This means that the barriers that 
prevent vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from participating must be identified and 
actively tackled to ensure substantive equality. A human rights approach requires focusing 
on power asymmetries at the community level and on the removal of physical, economic, 
legal, cultural and political obstacles that prevent marginalized groups from enjoying their 
right to participation. Participatory processes should not only avoid perpetuating 
asymmetries of power in the communities, but should actively seek to enable the most 
disadvantaged and excluded members of the community to participate as a matter of 
priority. 
</p>
<p>45. Simply increasing the number of people living in poverty present in existing 
decision-making spaces is not sufficient. Realizing the right to participation of people living 
in poverty requires prioritizing their meaningful involvement from the very beginning of 
the process, including priority-setting, and a number of political risks (e.g., co-option and 
manipulation) need to be considered. 
</p>
<p>46. Before implementing the participatory process, States or other facilitators should 
consider and put in place the specific resources, mechanisms and strategies needed to 
enable the participation of people living in poverty, in particular those most marginalized 
and excluded. To prevent discrimination, officials must be trained and educated to avoid 
stigma and stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>47. Every community or demographic has its own power dynamics; therefore, even 
participatory mechanisms targeted at people living in poverty are vulnerable to &#8220;elite 
capture&#8221; by more powerful individuals within a community. Processes that do not actively 
reach out to new and marginalized groups will reinforce the status quo and undermine the 
principle of equality. Therefore, to prevent dominant groups from co-opting participatory 
processes, officials must be trained to detect and understand how power is exercised to 
control and exclude disadvantaged groups. They should diagnose and counteract power 
relations and ensure that their own actions do not reproduce or legitimize these power 
dynamics.  
</p>
<p>48. Appropriate mechanisms for coordinating participation must be developed; these 
should be participatory themselves. In terms of the inclusion and identification of 
participants, programmes must be targeted to ensure the involvement of all stakeholders 
who may be or perceive themselves to be affected by the policy, decision or programme in 
question. The principles of non-discrimination and equality necessitate that participants 
must be identified in a transparent and proactive way. This should include undertaking a 
stakeholder analysis or mapping to identify vulnerable or disadvantaged groups with a stake 
in the outcomes of the decision; ensuring that the most marginalized groups and 
communities are identified and engaged from the outset, taking into account the obstacles 
they face; and dedicating resources to reach out to them.23  
</p>
<p>49. Based on the principle of equality between women and men, this preparation must 
include a gender analysis, and members of both sexes must be given the chance to represent 
their views, including, if necessary, through specially targeted consultations (for example, 
women-only spaces) and support. Processes to identify participants must not rely on 
community elites in a manner than can reinforce existing inequalities, for example by 
</p>
<p>  
 23  Foti and de Silva, <i>A Seat at the Table</i>, p. 15. </p>


<p>requiring attestation from officials or community elites that a person is likely to be 
&#8220;affected&#8221; by the outcome of a decision.24 NGOs with close knowledge of and links with 
the community in question can assist in identifying those within the community who are 
most excluded, and support their inclusion and participation. 
</p>
<p>50. In addition, the principles of equality and non-discrimination require that 
participatory processes and mechanisms meet the standards of availability, accessibility, 
adaptability and acceptability.  
</p>
<p>51. In the context of participation, availability means that channels of participation, 
access to information and accountability mechanisms must be made available in sufficient 
quantity (and be of sufficient quality) to meet the needs of the community in question.  
</p>
<p>52. These mechanisms, opportunities and processes must be physically and 
economically accessible to all, without discrimination and without disproportionate cost or 
risk. This implies that the obstacles which prevent the poorest and most marginalized 
people from participating must be addressed, including additional and overlapping 
obstacles due to age, disability, ethnicity, language, geographical location or other factors.  
</p>
<p>53. Mechanisms, processes and channels should be adaptable to the local context, taking 
into account the specific needs of communities or individuals in different social and cultural 
settings, and also adaptable to changing local, national and international contexts and 
standards.  
</p>
<p>54. In terms of acceptability, the processes and channels of participation, information 
and accountability mechanisms must be designed and implemented in a form that respects 
the cultural values, norms and practices of all those groups that request and use them. They 
must be respectful of diversity, using terminology and references accepted by the 
community, and the space used for participatory processes should also be culturally 
adequate for the community.  
</p>
<p>55. For instance, in terms of accessibility, organizers must ensure that the meeting 
locations are neither exclusionary nor prove to be a further obstacle to participation for 
people living in poverty. Community-based processes will reduce costs and travel time for 
participants, increasing the likelihood of their involvement. Participatory processes must 
also extend to remote rural communities. Organizers must provide adequate notice, via an 
appropriate mode of communication; this will vary depending on the community, taking 
into consideration the principles of acceptability and adaptability. Traditional and personal 
methods of communication should be considered and may be more likely to reach people 
living in poverty than official bulletins or announcements on websites. 
</p>
<p>56. Similarly, organizers should consult with individuals to identify a time for meetings 
that does not detrimentally impact wage-earning possibilities or care responsibilities &#8211; for 
example, after regular work hours and during seasons when migrant labourers are at home 
and available.25 Organizers and facilitators must be trained to have sufficient understanding 
of the social, cultural and political context; build trust and respect, be non-judgemental; and 
motivate and support participants. Similarly, it may be necessary to conduct capacity-
building activities with participants in advance of the main process.  
</p>
<p>57. In order to ensure that people living in poverty can participate on an equal basis, 
participants should be reimbursed for all costs related to attendance at meetings, including 
upfront, hidden and opportunity costs. At a minimum, participants must be reimbursed for 
transportation costs, and, if appropriate, their time, and on-site childcare should be 
</p>
<p>

 25  Ibid., p. 19. </p>


<p>provided. Organizers must provide a secure, safe atmosphere. Participation procedures must 
allow for the full expression of the views of people living in poverty, in a timely manner 
and based on their full understanding of the issues involved, so that they may be able to 
affect the outcome.26 
</p>
<p>58. It is essential that societal and intra-community power relations are openly 
recognized and clarified27 at the start of the process, in order to confront the factors that 
often obstruct debates and prevent issues of inequality from being raised in decision-
making arenas. Taking account of different kinds of power relations (visible, hidden and 
invisible) and the particular needs of marginalized groups, officials and advocates should 
take steps to ensure that such groups can organize their views, express them frankly and be 
heard. In order to ensure full substantive equality in enjoyment of the right to participation, 
where appropriate to enable full and free expression (particularly in very patriarchal or 
socially stratified communities), separate meetings should be held for excluded or 
vulnerable groups. For instance, in some communities it may be appropriate to separate 
participants by age group and sex. However, so as not to further entrench exclusion, the 
discussions should be brought together in a central plenary at critical moments so each 
group can share their analysis and actions.28 Similarly, although power dynamics may 
necessitate separate meetings and processes for people living in poverty in order to 
facilitate their full participation and free expression, where appropriate, participatory 
mechanisms should include opportunities for members of different social groups to interact 
and share points of view. 
</p>
<p>59. The format and level of formality of the meeting must not be alienating or difficult 
to negotiate for people living in poverty. Organizers must allow sufficient time for 
participants to debate and seek consensus or common positions from which to develop 
representative and legitimate messages. The methodology of the process must not rely 
wholly on written materials, as this would exclude those who are illiterate or have poor 
reading skills. Instead, more inclusive and accessible methodologies should be used, 
including different media such as pictograms or theatre. Accessibility and adaptability 
requires that meetings should be conducted in the minority language appropriate to the 
community where necessary; if this is not possible, well-trained interpreters must be 
provided. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transparency and access to information  
</b></p>
<p>60. From a human rights perspective, effective access to public information is a 
precondition for exercising other human rights. Exercise of the right to participation 
depends on transparency and access to complete, up-to-date and comprehensible 
information. People must have the capacity and opportunity to use the information, 
understand their entitlements and be able to evaluate the quality of the services, policies or 
programmes in question. Transparency is essential to ensure rights holders are fully aware 
of the aims and scope of the process, the other actors involved and their role and level of 
influence. 
</p>
<p>61. Organizers should provide appropriately designed information and tools well in 
advance, so individuals can make informed choices at each stage of the participatory 
process. Information should not only be made available, but must conform to the principles 
of accessibility, acceptability and adaptability. This means information should be made

<p>available in a manner accessible to the poorest and most disadvantaged, taking into account 
the constraints they suffer, including illiteracy and language barriers. It should be free of 
charge, relevant, up-to-date, understandable, free of technical language or jargon, and in 
local languages. Outreach and dissemination should be undertaken according to the local 
context and through channels that reach the poorest, for example, in non-written form, radio 
announcements or community theatre.  
</p>
<p>62. Organizers should hold preparatory meetings well in advance to agree on the 
parameters, goals, purposes and scope, with the involvement of the potential participants. 
Acceptable forms of facilitation, chairing and leadership should also be agreed with 
participants in advance.29 The level and nature of involvement on offer must be clarified to 
potential participants, as well as the roles and responsibilities of facilitators, policymakers, 
participants and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>63. When participants meet for the first time, the purposes and scope of the process 
should be made clear and agreed; this includes setting realistic expectations and clarifying 
any limitations. Participants must know why they have been asked to participate and how 
their opinions will be used, and should clearly understand what degree of influence they can 
expect to have on the final outcome. Similarly, the other considerations and actors that are 
feeding into the process must be revealed<i>. </i>There must be a mechanism and/or procedures in 
place by which participants can easily request and access additional information that they 
feel they need. 
</p>
<p>64. Once the decision-making body has taken its decision, it should promptly notify 
participants and the public; both the text of the decision and the justifications for it must be 
made public, in media accessible to people living in poverty. In addition, reports of the 
process and meetings held should be made available in all relevant languages and in an 
accessible manner, while respecting confidentiality.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>65. Accountability is a critical feature of a human rights approach to participation. 
Participation understood as a right implies rights holders and duty bearers who can and 
must be held to account for failure to respect, protect and fulfil that right. To this end, 
people need access to procedures and institutions that provide redress and remedy, and 
mechanisms to ensure that their Government fulfils the right of access to information and 
the right to participation.30 
</p>
<p>66. Organizers should ensure that there are effective complaint mechanisms in place in 
advance of the process starting. Responsibilities and the relevant chain of accountability for 
decision-making and the process itself should be made clear from the outset, and 
participants should be made aware of their rights and responsibilities. Participants must 
periodically evaluate the process, with indicators derived from their priorities. Where 
appropriate, independent advisers should monitor the process. 
</p>
<p>67. At the end of the process, a final assessment of what has been agreed and what has 
not should be presented, to be discussed and agreed with participants,31 as well as 
information on next steps in the decision-making process and those responsible. The

Paper No. 109, 2000, p. 70. </p>


<p>confidentiality of the participants must be respected in any final report or summary of the 
process. 
</p>
<p>68. A participatory process should be followed by concerted action and participatory 
evaluation. People living in poverty must have effective access to grievance mechanisms in 
order to hold decision-makers accountable if they feel the outcomes of the participatory 
process have not been adequately considered, or to seek remedy in case of any abuse. 
Similarly, there should be accessible accountability mechanisms in place to protest policies 
or programmes implemented with a lack of participation. Such mechanisms must be 
accessible and adaptable; for example, a variety of cost-free channels should be provided, 
as necessary, for the needs and constraints of people living in poverty. Complaint and 
grievance mechanisms must be sufficiently resourced, culturally appropriate and designed 
to facilitate the broadest participation possible by vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, in 
particular by women.  
</p>
<p>69. For States, the participation of people living in poverty in decisions that affect their 
lives is a legal obligation rather than a policy option. This means that a person cannot be 
excluded or &#8220;disinvited&#8221; from participation, for example if what they say challenges the 
status quo. The right to participation must be enforceable and the lack of participation must 
be challengeable through the courts. Therefore, appropriate laws, policies, institutions, 
procedures and redress mechanisms that will enable accountability for lack of participation, 
exclusion from participation, or manipulated or co-opted participation, are a crucial 
foundation for any rights-based participatory process. These mechanisms must be 
transparent, and must conform to the standards of availability, accessibility, acceptability 
and adaptability. Ultimately, policymakers and public officials must be accountable for 
responding to the demands of the people. 
</p>
<p>70. The question of who can claim to legitimately represent people living in poverty is 
an extremely sensitive issue. Ideally, people living in poverty should be directly involved in 
any decision-making process (see section E below). However, where they are represented 
by civil society actors such as facilitators or community workers, these actors should give 
full account of their work to the community. They should also be held responsible for any 
abuse of their position, breach of trust or acting beyond their mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Empowerment 
</b></p>
<p>71. From a human rights perspective, participation must be premised on empowerment 
as the ultimate goal. Thus, participation should not be extractive or instrumental, but 
instead aimed at building the capacity, social capital, confidence, rights awareness and 
knowledge of people living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>72. Currently, many participatory processes are limited to &#8220;consultation&#8221; &#8211; a higher 
authority giving information to or extracting information from members of the public. 
Participatory processes that are not designed and implemented with a human rights 
perspective may in fact be disempowering, and serve to exclude or reinforce existing power 
structures. In contrast, human rights-based participation is an important tool to empower 
people living in poverty by allowing them to exercise their voice to influence relevant 
decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>73. There is an important distinction between closed, invited and claimed policy 
spaces32 in terms of their empowering potential. Spaces for policy influence should not be

<p>  
 32  L. VeneKlasen <i>et al.</i>, <i>Rights-based Approaches and Beyond: Challenges of Linking Rights and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Participation</i>, IDS Working Paper No. 235, 2004, p. 5. </p>


<p>closed or predetermined, but must allow for ideas to emerge from the ground up,33 and 
participation must occur early enough in a process to set priorities and influence 
deliberation, drafting and outcome. It must not be limited to marginal or peripheral issues, 
but should focus on key issues such as public services, budgets and fiscal policy. 
Empowerment must be a primary and stated goal of such a process, through providing a 
participatory learning process that helps people to analyse local problems and develop 
solutions that use and promote rights. 
</p>
<p>74. A foundation of an educated and informed public who knows their rights is crucial 
to build effective participation. In particular, people living in poverty must be empowered 
so as to make their participation effective. Therefore, it is critical to strengthen the capacity 
of people living in poverty to engage in participatory processes, by promoting their critical 
thinking and ability to analyse and confront structures of oppression and power relations. 
They should be empowered to identify the root causes of their marginalization and to take 
action (individually or collectively) to make claims and realize their rights. This requires, 
inter alia, human rights education and other capacity-building activities,34 which should be 
built into each participatory process and begun before the process starts. This may include 
public speaking training, human rights education, workshops and information provision. </p>
<p>75. To the extent possible, people living in poverty should be able to set the terms of the 
debate and choose topics for discussion. Facilitators should enable involvement, in 
particular with regard to the most disadvantaged and excluded, but should not dominate or 
excessively &#8220;manage&#8221; the discussion.  
</p>
<p>76. Meaningful decisions must be on the table for consideration and discussion,35 
including budgets and resource allocation. Research shows that lively participation is more 
likely where control over resources is located close to local people; this proximity is also 
critically important to whether participation can make a difference to people&#8217;s lives.36 
People living in poverty must be given space to criticize all elements of a programme or 
project, as well as the agenda or rationale behind it. For example, service delivery may take 
place primarily at the local level, but key decisions relating to resource allocation, service 
delivery structure, etc. may be taken centrally. Therefore, real participation necessitates that 
the public is able to discuss and criticize both elements of the equation.  
</p>
<p>77. While NGOs, especially grass-roots organizations, have an important role to play in 
supporting and facilitating the participation of people living in poverty, they are not a 
proxy. Staff or volunteers of NGOs or civil society organizations should not automatically 
be seen as &#8220;representatives&#8221; or &#8220;spokespersons&#8221; for people living in poverty, but rather 
serve as facilitators and advocates, with the ultimate goal of allowing them to express 
themselves and influence decision-making on their own terms. They can also play a role in 
helping the community organize and empowering people living in poverty with skills and 
knowledge that facilitate their more active participation and free expression.  
</p>
<p>78. Rather than just using meetings to extract information, facilitators and organizers 
should seek to actively build the capacity of the participants and foster their better 
enjoyment of rights such as education and freedom of expression. The opportunity to 
provide workshops or courses relevant to the needs of the participants, for example literacy

<p>or leadership training, should be taken. It may be helpful to involve local organizations in 
building local organizing capacity. Facilitators can also help participants forge useful links 
&#8211; both horizontal links with other communities or community-based groups, and vertical 
links with decision-makers and relevant officials, for example in the local government.  
</p>
<p>79. Evaluation and follow-up should be collaborative. Monitoring should be undertaken 
by the participants themselves, based on indicators set by them according to their priorities 
and analysis of change. As working with people living in poverty requires a long-term 
process, not a one-off intervention,37 a &#8220;consultation&#8221; should never be an objective in itself, 
but rather should be part of an ongoing process where persons living in poverty have 
various possibilities to exercise their right to participation, and decision-makers should be 
required to seriously consider the opinions expressed. Resources should be devoted to make 
the participatory mechanisms long-term and self-sustaining, for instance by training and 
investing in grass-roots facilitators. Regular forums for dialogue between policymakers and 
people living in poverty should be created and promoted. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations to States: an operational framework to 
ensure meaningful participation of people living in poverty    
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>People living in poverty are entitled to participate in the design, 
implementation and monitoring of poverty interventions and other policies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes and interventions that affect their lives, and to hold duty bearers 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable. Looking at participation through the prism of human rights norms and

<p><b>effective and meaningful participation of people living in poverty.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Building on the human rights framework above, this section will give practical 
guidance to States on how to operationalize the right to participation of people living

<p><b>in poverty. It is neither possible nor desirable to formulate detailed universal

<p><b>participation with regard to people living in poverty. Human rights provide a way to 
</b></p>
<p><b>do so.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>While the recommendations below are primarily addressed to States, many are 
also relevant for participatory processes established by other actors such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>international financial institutions and donor agencies. Recommendations to national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institutions are also included due to their potentially crucial role. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>States have three levels of obligations with regard to human rights: to respect; 
to protect; and to fulfil (E/C.12/GC/21, para. 48). In terms of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation, the obligation to respect requires States to refrain from interfering, 
</b></p>
<p><b>directly or indirectly, with the enjoyment of the right. For example, States must not 
</b></p>
<p><b>close down participatory spaces, impose censorship, repress public deliberation or 
</b></p>
<p><b>retaliate against those who speak out (e.g. through violence, confiscation of property 
</b></p>

<p><b>third parties (including business enterprises or private individuals) from interfering in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to participation. This would include safeguarding participatory spaces, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting freedom of expression through law and policy, and protecting individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>from reprisal from non-State actors. It also requires States to protect social 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements, community organizers and human rights defenders. Lastly, the obligation 
</b></p>
<p><b>to fulfil requires States to facilitate, promote and provide for the full realization of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to participation, through appropriate legislative, administrative, judicial, 
</b></p>
<p><b>budgetary and other measures. This includes strengthening skills and capacity of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>public and officials, presenting meaningful decisions for public deliberation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>devoting resources to long-term, sustainable participatory mechanisms to influence 
</b></p>
<p><b>national priorities, programmes and decisions.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Government agencies and policymakers must be prepared to give value to the 
findings of participatory processes, critically examine their own practices and 
</b></p>
<p><b>attitudes, and allow the necessary resources and time to enable people living in 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty to participate effectively. Instituting meaningful participation will require the 
</b></p>
<p><b>State to relinquish unilateral control over some areas of policy traditionally seen as 
</b></p>
<p><b>government prerogative, for example budgets. Similarly, while successful 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation is frequently dependent on some form of State engagement, States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not seek to </b>&#8220;<b>own</b>&#8221;<b> all spaces of participation, and must protect and promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>the role of NGOs and civil society. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Promising participatory practices have been implemented in a wide variety of 
contexts by actors including States, bilateral development agencies, United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies, civil society organizations and others. Prominent examples include 
</b></p>
<p><b>participatory budgeting, environmental decision-making, slum surveys, citizen juries, 
</b></p>
<p><b>social monitors and community scorecards. Much can be learned from such practices. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Meaningful participation requires resources, time and planning, and should be seen as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a process rather than an event, with multiple entry points through which members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the public can engage. However, evidence shows that it is possible, even in the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenging of situations. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>In order to comply with their human rights obligations regarding the right to 
participation, the Special Rapporteur recommends States undertake the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions: 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (a) Legal and institutional framework: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Adopt a legal framework that includes the explicit right of individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>and groups to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy, programme or strategy that affects their rights, at the local, national 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international levels. This should include: 
</b></p>
<p><b>a. Putting in place operational guidelines, policies and capacity-
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening measures to enable public officials to apply these laws, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring that these are adaptable to different contexts and allow innovation 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on feedback from the ground. 
</b></p>
<p><b>b. Requiring the establishment of inclusive participatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms at the local and national levels. 
</b></p>
<p><b>c. Explicitly including the duty of policymakers and public officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>to actively seek and support the meaningful participation of people living in 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty. </b></p>


<p><b>d. Setting and enforcing minimum standards for participatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes, including thresholds for participation of people living in poverty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged groups such as women, minorities and persons with disabilities.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Strengthen decentralization of power, responsibilities and resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>from central to local governments, with adequate accountability mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Promulgate and enforce legislation to prohibit discrimination of any 
</b></p>
<p><b>kind, including on the basis of economic and social status. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Create meaningful opportunities for active public participation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>budget formulation and monitoring, including by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>a. Prioritizing areas of national or local budgets that most affect 
</b></p>
<p><b>people living in poverty. 
</b></p>
<p><b>b. Requiring the supreme audit institution to maintain mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>for public participation in auditing budgets.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Incorporate participatory mechanisms in national development plans, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including people living in poverty from the start of the planning process.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Respect the right to participation in the implementation of any 
</b></p>
<p><b>international assistance and cooperation programme. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) Strengthen laws relating to freedoms of association, assembly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>speech; media freedom; anti-corruption; access to information; and whistle-
</b></p>
<p><b>blower protection.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(viii) Strengthen protection of individuals and non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations that work with and advocate for those living in poverty; 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognizing the right to act collectively; and prevent and punish any reprisal 
</b></p>
<p><b>against those who exercise their right to participation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ix) Regulate the involvement of powerful non-State actors (such as business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises) in participatory processes; ensure that they cannot exert undue 
</b></p>
<p><b>influence; and provide mechanisms for redress in cases of abuses. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Create an independent national council on poverty and social exclusion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including people living in poverty, to represent this group to political decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>makers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (b) Resources: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Allocate sufficient resources to support the participation of people living 
</b></p>
<p><b>in poverty in any decision-making process that affects their rights, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>earmarked funds to compensate participants for opportunity costs such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>travel and to provide on-site childcare. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Improve official capacity to facilitate public participation and access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>information, including through adequate staff, equipment and training. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Provide long-term funding for capacity-building in disadvantaged 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, including by granting resources to community-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Grant the national human rights institution adequate resources to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote the right to participation and pursue accountability and remedies. </b></p>


<p><b>  (c) Equality and non-discrimination: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Undertake an audit of barriers to participation and identify those 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and groups who face the most obstacles in enjoying their right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Set up a task force of people with experience of living in poverty to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations on how people living in poverty can effectively participate in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Use these recommendations and audits to issue guidance to all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>government departments on how to ensure non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the right to participation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Design participatory mechanisms, taking into account the inequalities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and asymmetries of power in a given context, and take all necessary measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>to counteract them, including through affirmative action.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Ensure that conditions for participation do not unfairly exclude certain 
</b></p>
<p><b>categories of people, for example those without identity documents or with 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobility restrictions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Take positive action to promote the inclusion of disadvantaged groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>including ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies, including by allocating resources and designing mechanisms tailored for 
</b></p>
<p><b>their use. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) Undertake </b>an analysis of barriers to women&#8217;s participation, particularly 
</p>
<p><b>in poor communities, and take proactive measures to tackle these barriers, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>example implementing women-only participatory spaces or providing childcare 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (d) Access to information: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Enact a comprehensive right to information law, ensuring that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>department designated to deal with requests is properly resourced, Promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective and widespread use of the law including by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>a. Adopting policies, programmes and proactive measures that 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote its use by people living in poverty. 
</b></p>
<p><b>b. Training public officials on the importance of access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and the need to protect information solicitors. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Take specific measures to provide State data to the public, in accessible 
</b></p>
<p><b>formats and via appropriate channels for people living in poverty, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>a. Publishing and disseminating regular information related to
