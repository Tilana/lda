<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present technical guidance is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant 
to resolution 24/11 of 26 September 2013, in which it requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in close collaboration with the World 
Health Organization (WHO), to prepare concise technical guidance on the application of a 
human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce 
and eliminate preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age.  
</p>
<p>2. The technical guidance was prepared by OHCHR, in close collaboration with WHO 
and with the support of an external advisory group of human rights and child health experts. 
It was also informed by input received from a public consultation and responses to a note 
verbale circulated to States, national human rights institutions and civil society requesting 
relevant information. Detailed information can be found at www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues 
/Children/TechnicalGuidance/Pages/TechnicalGuidanceIndex.aspx. 
</p>
<p>3. In spite of significant progress in recent years, mortality and morbidity of children 
under 5 remain unacceptably high. In 2012, an estimated 6.6 million children died before 
their fifth birthday.1 More than half of those deaths were preventable.2 In addition, millions 
more children suffer illness and disability every year. Patterns of child mortality and 
morbidity reveal significant and persisting inequalities between and within countries, driven 
by poverty, social exclusion, discrimination, gender norms and neglect of basic human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>4. A human rights-based approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity can help 
draw attention to potential barriers to successfully addressing these issues, highlight the 
range of actors responsible for this work and provide a legal framework to strengthen 
public health efforts in this area. It can also facilitate the identification of populations at 
high risk, enable analysis of complex gaps in protection, participation and accountability, 
and promote the identification of comprehensive and sustainable solutions.3 A rights-based 
approach can enable children and their families to live lives of dignity.  
</p>
<p>5. A broad range of international human rights treaties are relevant to child mortality 
and morbidity, inter alia the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. Furthermore, general comment No.15 of the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, general comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and general recommendation 24 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women are also relevant.  
</p>
<p>6. Those treaties and general comments are complemented by documents on child 
health published by WHO that highlight the importance of adopting a human rights-based 
approach to addressing child mortality and morbidity.4 Furthermore, the centrality of a 
human rights-based approach to child mortality and morbidity has been recognized by a 
wide range of global efforts such as the United Nations Secretary-General&#8217;s Global

</p>
<p>7. The primary purpose of the present technical guidance is to assist States and non-
State actors to improve the realization of the right of the child to health and survival by 
providing guidance on reducing child mortality and morbidity in accordance with human 
rights norms, standards and principles. 
</p>
<p>8. The guidance is primarily directed towards health decision-makers and policy-
makers but is also relevant to other sectors, such as the finance and education sectors, as 
well as to parliamentarians, the judiciary, civil society, health service providers, national 
human rights institutions, donor States and the private sector, as well as intergovernmental 
agencies. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Child mortality and morbidity 
</b>9. Most child mortality is due to a small number of diseases and conditions. Globally, 
43 per cent of such deaths occur among babies aged 0&#8722;28 days (newborn babies)5 and are 
mainly due to pre-term birth complications, birth asphyxia and trauma, and sepsis. After the 
first 28 days, until the age of 5 years, the majority of deaths are attributable to infectious 
diseases such as pneumonia (22%), diarrhoeal diseases (15%), malaria (12%) and 
HIV/AIDS (3%).6 The vast majority of conditions and diseases that lead to death among 
children under 5 years of age are preventable and treatable through cost-effective 
interventions. 
</p>
<p>10. The risk factors associated with the leading causes of death in newborn babies are 
multiple and complex. They include complications during pregnancy and childbirth, such as 
bleeding, hypertension, prolonged and obstructed labour and infections, and lack of timely 
access to skilled care during and after birth. 
</p>
<p>11. The main risk factors associated with the leading causes of death in children aged 
between 1 month and 5 years include low birth weight, lack of breastfeeding, 
undernutrition, overcrowded conditions, indoor air pollution, unsafe drinking-water and 
food, lack of sanitation and poor hygiene practices. In some regions, HIV and malaria are 
also significant risk factors. 
</p>
<p>12. Undernutrition is estimated to be associated with 45 per cent of child deaths 
worldwide.5 Undernutrition is also strongly correlated with vulnerability to infections and 
to delayed physical and mental development.  
</p>
<p>13. Many of the leading causes of mortality among children are also the primary causes 
of morbidity. Coughing, diarrhoea and fever are the commonest reasons for children to 
attend health services, and severe pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria are the commonest 
causes of severe illness requiring hospital treatment. Other infections, disability arising 
from congenital malformations or pre-term birth, and nutritional deficiencies also 
contribute to child morbidity globally. 
</p>
<p>14. A high burden of child morbidity is attributable to violence against children, 
including physical, sexual and psychological violence, which exists in every country and 
occurs in various settings, including the family, institutions and the community.7

<p>15. The life-course approach to health recognizes the continuum from birth through 
childhood, adolescence and adulthood. This approach reflects the principle that care given 
to children during their first five years of life, or even that given to their mothers prior to 
their birth, will affect their immediate well-being and will have an impact on their health 
and development in later years.8 
</p>
<p>16. A multi-faceted response, which also addresses the broader risk factors and 
determinants of child mortality and morbidity, is required.  
</p>
<p>17. The response must give sustained consideration to the needs of society&#8217;s most 
disadvantaged and marginalized children and their families if improved and more equitable 
child health outcomes are to be achieved.9 
</p>
<p><b> III. A human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>18. A human rights-based approach requires systematic attention to a range of human 
rights standards and principles. This approach is not only about achieving human rights 
goals and outcomes, but also about achieving them through a participatory, inclusive, non-
discriminatory, transparent and responsive process.  
</p>
<p>19. A human rights-based approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity requires 
the identification of relevant duty-bearers and rights-holders, and building the capacity of 
the former to fulfil their obligations, and of the latter to claim their rights relevant to child 
health and survival. In this, States and State actors hold the principal obligation. In the case 
of young children, parents and other caregivers and health-care workers can simultaneously 
be considered both duty-bearers and rights-holders, who may benefit from capacity-
building to fulfil their duties and claim respect for the rights of the children they represent. 
</p>
<p>20. International human rights law includes fundamental obligations by States to address 
under-5 mortality and morbidity as part of their work to ensure the child&#8217;s right to the 
highest attainable standard of health and other related rights. It provides a legal framework 
for this work and a basis for accountability. A human rights-based approach requires 
systematic attention to human rights standards and principles in all aspects of policies and 
programmes.  
</p>
<p>21. A human rights-based approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity requires 
that States and other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and 
non-governmental organizations, take action at all levels to address the interlinked root 
causes of child mortality and morbidity. These root causes include poverty, malnutrition, 
gender inequality, harmful practices, violence, stigma, discrimination, unsafe households 
and environments, denial of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, denial of the 
right to health, including lack of accessible, affordable and appropriate health services and 
medicines, late detection of childhood illnesses and denial of the right to education.  
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights standards and principles 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a holistic framework for 
reducing child mortality and morbidity, emphasizing health outcomes, goods and services, 
and highlighting the need to tackle the underlying determinants of health.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
  A/HRC/24/60. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
  Ibid. </p>


<p>23. Article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child highlights States parties&#8217; 
obligation to ensure the survival, growth and development of the child, including the 
physical, mental, moral, spiritual and social dimensions of their development. Article 24 
recognizes the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
health, explicitly requiring States parties to take appropriate measures to reduce infant and 
child mortality and to ensure the provision of necessary medical assistance and health care 
for all children.  
</p>
<p>24. Taking account of the indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all 
human rights, a human rights-based approach recognizes that fulfilment of the child&#8217;s rights 
to health and survival depends on the realization of other related rights, including the rights 
to life, non-discrimination, an adequate standard of living, water and sanitation, food, 
education, birth registration and social security.  
</p>
<p>25. States are required to progressively realize those rights to the maximum extent of 
available resources and, where needed, within the framework of international cooperation.10 
While recognizing the principle of progressive realization and acknowledging constraints 
due to the limits of available resources, States have certain immediate obligations in 
relation to the right to health, such as the guarantee that the right will be exercised without 
discrimination of any kind and the obligation to take deliberate, concrete and targeted steps 
towards the full realization of this right.11  
</p>
<p>26. Child mortality and morbidity are also linked to women&#8217;s rights and the ability of 
women to survive pregnancy and childbirth and to exercise autonomy over decisions 
relating to their reproductive lives and optimal infant feeding practices. Investment in 
women&#8217;s health and education, and in the empowerment of the poorest and most 
marginalized population groups, including women, is vital to ensure an effective response 
to under-5 mortality.12 The present technical guidance on a human rights-based approach to 
reducing preventable maternal morbidity and mortality can help guide work in this area.13 
</p>
<p>27. A human rights-based approach requires that States focus efforts to reduce child 
mortality and morbidity on marginalized children and those in under-served areas, and take 
all appropriate measures to ensure equality and protect children against discrimination. 
Discrimination, in law and in practice, is an important factor underlying much preventable 
child mortality and morbidity, with the most marginalized groups bearing a 
disproportionate burden of mortality and morbidity.14 Discrimination is proscribed on the 
grounds of a child&#8217;s, parent&#8217;s or legal guardian&#8217;s race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other 
status.15 Disproportionate vulnerability and ill health of certain groups of children can also 
exist beyond the proscribed grounds for discrimination.16 The collection, analysis, 
dissemination and use of disaggregated data is a precondition for revealing where 
discrimination is occurring, which groups of children are not realizing their rights to health 
and survival and how remedial action might be taken. 
</p>
<p>28. Human rights provide a legal imperative for participation: in order to fulfil their 
human rights obligations, States must ensure stakeholder participation in priority-setting, in

<p>policy/programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and in 
accountability mechanisms. This includes ensuring that institutional mechanisms exist that 
enable people to participate; ensuring that all segments of the population, including the 
most marginalized, can participate; and making available functional independent 
accountability mechanisms in relation to participation.  
</p>
<p>29. Participation requires that States create an enabling environment for citizen 
engagement and develop capacity to ensure that duty-bearers can fulfil their obligations and 
that rights-holders have the knowledge that allows them to claim their rights. Participation 
should be viewed as fostering critical awareness, and decision-making as the basis for 
active citizenship.17 In the case of young children, such capacity-building may be targeted 
towards their caregivers.  
</p>
<p>30. Participation in the context of under-5 mortality and morbidity means ensuring that 
children&#8217;s parents, or other representatives, can access all relevant and necessary 
information to ensure an informed opinion about the child&#8217;s health status and potential 
interventions, and participate meaningfully in the decision-making processes which affect 
their children&#8217;s survival and health.  
</p>
<p>31. The best interests of the child should be assessed and taken as a primary 
consideration in all actions affecting children, including actions concerning their health, and 
should guide decisions on issues ranging from individual treatment options to policy and 
regulatory frameworks. This requires that States place children&#8217;s interests at the centre of 
all decisions affecting their health and survival, including decisions on the allocation of 
resources and on the development and implementation of policies and interventions that 
affect the underlying determinants of health. 
</p>
<p>32. Ensuring accountability is at the core of actions to address under-5 mortality and 
morbidity. Accountability requires multiple forms of monitoring, review, oversight and 
redress &#8211; administrative, social, political and legal. States have the obligation to ensure that 
relevant government authorities and service providers are accountable for maintaining the 
highest possible standards of children&#8217;s health and health care. This means, for instance, 
ensuring that health service users are able to report essential medicine stock-outs in addition 
to ensuring that there procedures for investigating preventable deaths. States have an 
obligation to ensure that functional, accessible accountability mechanisms exist such that 
all duty-bearers can be held to account and that both the individual and the structural nature 
of any children&#8217;s rights violations and harm caused by discrimination in regard to children&#8217;s 
health-related rights can be addressed.18  
</p>
<p>33. A human rights-based approach to health requires States to ensure the availability, 
accessibility, affordability, acceptability and quality of facilities, goods and services related 
to health, as well as to address its underlying determinants, such as poverty, poor education 
and lack of access to other social services.19 A well-developed and accessible health system 
characterized by attention to all the principles of a human rights-based approach, through 
which children and caregivers have access to health information, services and commodities, 
is critical. Similarly, collaboration across government sectors is required to address the 
underlying determinants of health. 
</p>
<p>34. The State bears the primary human rights obligation in relation to child health and 
survival and also has an obligation to ensure that non-State actors, including individuals, do

<p>not jeopardize the enjoyment by any child of his or her health and human rights. Alongside 
its obligations to ensure children&#8217;s non-discriminatory access to high-quality health and 
related services that are socially and culturally acceptable, the State has a crucial role to 
play, and is obliged under human rights law, to sensitize the population about appropriate 
care-seeking behaviours for child health.20 
</p>
<p>35. In a recent report to the Human Rights Council a number of essential steps for 
effectively addressing under-5 mortality using a human rights-based approach were 
highlighted.21 They include: ensuring a supportive legal and policy environment; increasing 
access to preventive health interventions, services and life-saving drugs; expanding access 
to services for the integrated management of childhood illnesses at the community level and 
elsewhere; and establishing accessible, transparent and effective mechanisms of monitoring 
and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Operational guidance 
</b>36. Applying a human rights-based approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity 
means systematically incorporating attention to all relevant rights, standards and principles 
into national measures aimed at improving child health and survival. This begins with an 
assessment of relevant legislative measures, governance and coordination mechanisms, 
planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation efforts, mechanisms for 
remedy and redress and international cooperation to determine the extent to which existing 
measures, mechanisms and processes are fully compliant with recognized human rights 
standards and principles and where gaps and barriers remain that must be addressed. This 
should build on existing efforts with additional attention to human rights standards and 
principles as required.  
</p>
<p>37. Rights-based efforts to reduce child mortality and morbidity should adopt a life 
course approach. They should be situated within a continuum of care that pays due attention 
to the health and rights of women before, during and after pregnancy.22 
</p>
<p>38. Reliable data on priority health problems, including new and neglected causes of 
mortality and morbidity, and key determinants of children&#8217;s health, enable States and other 
duty-bearers to target efforts to address child mortality and morbidity. Governments and 
other stakeholders should collect such data through routine health information systems as 
well as other surveys and research, and ensure that they include quantitative, qualitative and 
policy data.  
</p>
<p>39. A human rights-based approach requires that those data be disaggregated by age, 
sex, location and other relevant categories in order to identify groups that may be 
marginalized or discriminated against and to direct additional efforts and resources to 
ensuring that any inequalities are addressed. 
</p>
<p>40. Data should be analysed, disseminated and used to inform national and subnational 
laws, policies, budgets, programmes and services relevant to child health and survival. 
</p>
<p>41. In the subsections below, illustrative examples are provided of State actions required 
under a human rights-based approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity.

<p><b> A. Legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>42. Article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates the requirement for 
States parties to take all necessary legislative measures for the implementation of the rights 
recognized in the Convention. This includes incorporating into national legal frameworks 
all international human rights commitments, ensuring that services and medications are 
available at appropriate levels of the health system to maximize safe uptake, ensuring non-
discrimination in access to health-related information and services, and removing 
impediments to realizing the child&#8217;s rights to health and survival.  
</p>
<p>43. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has determined that &#8220;a comprehensive 
review of all domestic legislation and related administrative guidance to ensure full 
compliance with the Convention is an obligation&#8221; and that States parties &#8220;need to ensure, by 
all appropriate means, that the provisions of the Convention are given legal effect within 
their domestic legal systems&#8221;.23 This should begin with an assessment of the existing 
legislative framework and structures for any potential impediment to, or discriminatory 
effect on, reducing child mortality and morbidity. Alongside an analysis of data on priority 
child health issues, such an assessment can highlight where current legislative measures are 
sufficient, where amendments or repeal may be needed and where legislative gaps exist that 
need to be filled. 
</p>
<p>44. States are required to enact national laws that: 
</p>
<p>(a) Incorporate international human rights commitments relevant to child health 
and survival; 
</p>
<p>(b) Place a statutory obligation on the State to provide the services, programmes, 
human resources and infrastructure needed to realize children&#8217;s rights relating to health and 
survival, including those considered core obligations;24  
</p>
<p>(c) Recognize children as rights-holders and define the scope of their rights 
relating to health and survival based on international human rights obligations;  
</p>
<p>(d) Clarify what services children, pregnant women and parents are entitled to 
claim, and disseminate that information;  
</p>
<p>(e) Provide a statutory entitlement to essential, child-sensitive, high-quality 
health and related services for pregnant women and children under 5, including birth 
registration and other social services, irrespective of their ability to pay;  
</p>
<p>(f) Regulate public and private services and medications relating to child health 
to ensure that they cause no harm and are of good quality; 
</p>
<p>(g) Enable public participation and dialogue in legislative processes by ensuring 
functional national and subnational political processes and public forums;  
</p>
<p>(h) Provide a framework for access to effective, child-friendly legal remedies, 
both judicial and non-judicial, in the case of human rights violations in relation to child 
health and survival, and ensure that statutes of limitation are not unduly restrictive.25

<p><b> B. Governance and coordination 
</b></p>
<p>45. Governance of child health means ensuring that the appropriate systems and 
coordination mechanisms are in place to facilitate the full realization of all child health-
related rights and to provide avenues for remedy and redress where obligations are not 
fulfilled. This includes ensuring collaboration, coordination and dialogue between 
government ministries, local governments, service providers and communities, and 
supporting systematic monitoring and follow-up action to ensure that children&#8217;s health-
related rights are realized.26 
</p>
<p>46. Strong governance and coordination mechanisms are particularly critical in the 
context of a human rights-based approach to child mortality and morbidity given the need 
for attention to the wide range of actors involved, including health and other sectors within 
government, the private sector, families, communities, civil society and other stakeholders. 
Building on existing systems, strengthening them and adapting them as appropriate can 
facilitate the realization of child health-related rights and reduce child mortality and 
morbidity. 
</p>
<p>47. Decisions about allocations to different levels of services and geographical areas 
should reflect patterns of mortality and morbidity, the core elements of the primary health 
care approach and due attention to disadvantaged groups. While decentralization or 
delegation may be required to meet the particular needs of localities, sectors or federal 
systems, this does not reduce the direct responsibility of the central or national government 
to fulfil its obligations to all children within its jurisdiction. Similarly, the State remains 
fully accountable, regardless of the level of involvement of the private sector. 
</p>
<p>48. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ratify and implement international human rights instruments and their 
related optional protocols relevant to under-5 mortality and morbidity, and ensure the 
inclusion of information on efforts made to reduce under-5 mortality and morbidity in 
periodic reports to human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>(b) Adopt and enforce appropriate laws and regulations; 
(c) Ensure that appropriate structures, processes and resources are made 
</p>
<p>available to translate laws and policies relating to child health and survival into practice, 
including institutional reform and capacity-building for duty-bearers to enable them to 
understand and meet their obligations as required; 
</p>
<p>(d) Identify and remove obstacles to transparency, coordination, partnership and 
accountability in the provision of services affecting child health and survival; 
</p>
<p>(e) Establish and use a comprehensive and cohesive national coordinating 
framework on children&#8217;s health, situated within child welfare and protection systems as 
well as within the continuum of care for reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health, 
and built upon human rights standards and principles. This will facilitate cooperation 
between government ministries and different levels of government, as well as interaction 
with civil society, including parents and other caregivers;

<p> </p>


<p>(f) Engage all sectors of society in reducing child mortality and morbidity. This 
should include: 
</p>
<p>(i) The creation of conditions conducive to the continual growth, development 
and sustainability of relevant civil society organizations; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Active facilitation of civil society involvement in the development, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of children&#8217;s health policies and 
services;  
</p>
<p>(iii) The provision of appropriate financial support, or assistance in obtaining 
financial support, to relevant civil society organizations;  
</p>
<p>(iv) Capacity-building of rights-holders to enable them to understand their 
entitlements in relation to child health and survival and engage productively with 
service providers in securing those entitlements; 
</p>
<p>(g) Clarify the roles and responsibilities of all duty-bearers with regard to child 
health and survival; 
</p>
<p>(h) Ensure that all sectors working to address child mortality and morbidity fulfil 
their human rights-related responsibilities. This includes ensuring non-discrimination in 
service delivery, transparency in budgeting, and functional mechanisms for accountability;  
</p>
<p>(i) Identify and prioritize action to benefit children from marginalized groups 
and children who are at risk of any form of violence or discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Planning 
</b></p>
<p>49. Guaranteeing the child&#8217;s rights to health and survival implies an obligation to have a 
long-term national plan to address child mortality and morbidity based on evidence and the 
promotion and protection of human rights. The first step in all planning processes should be 
a situation analysis, not only to identify priority child health issues and their underlying 
determinants but also to map existing plans, services and capacities for addressing them. 
This should identify duty-bearers and include an assessment of their capacity to fulfil their 
human rights-related obligations in this regard. Situation analysis data should be 
disaggregated to enable groups of children who are marginalized and/or have particularly 
poor health indicators to be identified. 
</p>
<p>50. Based on the situation analysis and building on existing national and subnational 
strategies and plans, a strategy or plan should be developed. Benchmarks and targets which 
focus on child survival and development should be established to demonstrate the planned 
progressive realization of child health-related rights. 
</p>
<p>51. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ensure that the national plan is informed by appropriately disaggregated data 
and incorporates attention to groups of children who are the most marginalized, 
discriminated against and/or have the poorest health indicators. Where disaggregated data 
are unavailable, plans should include an approach to their timely collection; 
</p>
<p>(b) Involve a wide range of stakeholders in planning processes, including State 
and non-State actors; 
</p>
<p>(c) Include child health and survival in other sectoral policies, highlighting the 
links between children&#8217;s health and survival and the underlying determinants of health; </p>


<p>(d) Assess current institutional capacity to fulfil duty-bearers&#8217; roles and 
responsibilities for child health and provide adequate resources, including capacity- 
building, to ensure that those roles can be fulfilled; 
</p>
<p>(e) Ensure that all goods, services and information relevant to child health, 
whether provided through facilities or community-based interventions, are available, 
accessible and acceptable to all, as well as being of good quality; 
</p>
<p>(f) Ensure an appropriate and equitable distribution of resources, including 
financial resources, health services, goods and facilities and an adequately trained health 
workforce, to address child mortality and morbidity, with adequate attention to 
marginalized populations; 
</p>
<p>(g) Establish benchmarks and targets, budgeted action plans and operational 
strategies to reduce child mortality and morbidity within the time frame of the plan; 
</p>
<p>(h) Develop a framework for monitoring and evaluating policies, programmes 
and services, and promoting accountability for child mortality and morbidity;  
</p>
<p>(i) Make accessible the national plan and any accompanying plans of action and 
budgets to all rights-holders and duty-bearers. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Budgeting 
</b></p>
<p>52. States have an obligation to take steps to address child mortality and morbidity to 
the maximum of their available resources. This includes demonstrating their commitment to 
the progressive fulfilment of all their obligations in relation to child mortality and morbidity 
and prioritizing them even in the context of political or economic crises or emergency 
situations. This requires sustainable financing for children&#8217;s health and related policies, 
programmes and services. International funding assistance is of crucial importance but 
should not replace governmental funding to address child mortality and morbidity and does 
not relieve States of their obligation to devote the maximum available resources to that 
area.  
</p>
<p>53. If the overall State budget increases, the budget to address child mortality and 
morbidity should increase. Conversely, in the face of overall budget reductions, the budget 
for addressing child mortality and morbidity should not be reduced unless the State can 
demonstrate that it has taken all reasonable measures to avoid such a reduction. Policy-
makers are obliged to avoid decisions that might reduce the enjoyment of human rights by 
any group considered marginalized or discriminated against.  
</p>
<p>54. All activities should be fully costed, financed and made visible within national and 
subnational budgets. Budget planning, monitoring and evaluation processes relating to child 
health and survival should include the participation of citizens, civil society and health 
service providers. 
</p>
<p>55. Child health budgets should be transparent and used to ensure government 
accountability for child health, including the realization of child health-related rights. 
Transparency and simplification of processes relating to child health budgeting and 
expenditure may be required, to promote civil society involvement in planning, monitoring 
and evaluating work in those areas. Where budgets and allocations are insufficient to fulfil 
governmental obligations with regard to the child&#8217;s right to health, civil society has an 
important role to play.  
</p>
<p>56. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Make investment in child health and survival visible in the State budget 
through detailed compilation of resources allocated to them and expended;  </p>


<p>(b) Meet the WHO-recommended minimum health expenditure per capita27 and 
prioritize child health in budgetary allocations; 
</p>
<p>(c) Increase the budget and expenditure to address child mortality and morbidity, 
and their underlying determinants, over time, using interim benchmarks and targets to 
demonstrate progress, in line with the principle of progressive realization; 
</p>
<p>(d) Focus investment on the populations of children that are most marginalized 
and discriminated against; 
</p>
<p>(e) Reduce reliance on direct, out-of-pocket payments, increase the level and 
share of revenues channelled through prepaid and pooled mechanisms, and use the pooled 
funds to cover health-care costs for economically disadvantaged children; 
</p>
<p>(f) Implement rights-based budget planning, monitoring and analysis, as well as 
impact assessments of how investments, particularly in the health sector, may improve 
child health and survival outcomes;  
</p>
<p>(g) Identify insufficiencies and bottlenecks in child health budgeting and the 
disbursement of funds and take appropriate remedial action as required;  
</p>
<p>(h) Ensure sufficient transparency in budgets relating to child health to allow 
effective and participatory tracking of the flow of resources, including budgeting, allocation 
and expenditure, and its timeliness, from the national ministry of health through all levels 
down to health facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Implementation 
</b></p>
<p>57. Ensuring access to interventions, services and medications for child health requires 
action across the health sector, and also beyond it to encompass efforts in other sectors to 
address the underlying and structural determinants of child mortality and morbidity. 
Multisectoral action is required that fully conforms with international human rights 
standards and principles with regard to both its desired outcomes and its implementation 
processes.  
</p>
<p>58. States have an obligation to ensure for all children and caregivers the availability, 
accessibility, acceptability and quality of all facilities, goods and services relating to child 
health and survival, including services outside the health sector. Special attention may be 
required to reach the most marginalized child populations, in order to fulfil the obligation of 
immediate application of the principles of equality and non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>59. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Build the capacity of duty-bearers to fulfil their obligations and of children, 
parents and other caregivers to understand and claim their child health- and survival-related 
rights; 
</p>
<p>(b) Ensure that health workers are adequately trained in child health and child 
rights, supervised and mentored; 
</p>
<p>(c) Provide access to essential interventions for addressing child mortality and 
morbidity28 as well as other interventions outside the health sector to address underlying 
determinants; 
</p>

<p>(d) Provide access to essential medicines for addressing child mortality and 
morbidity included in the WHO list of essential medicines for children;29 
</p>
<p>(e) Adopt evidence-based interventions to support good parenting, including 
parenting skills education, support group and family counselling, especially for families 
experiencing children&#8217;s health and other social challenges;30 
</p>
<p>(f) Ensure functional systems for the prevention, identification and reporting of 
abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation of children while in the 
care of parents or other caretakers;31 
</p>
<p>(g) Ensure the participation of affected populations and other stakeholders in 
implementing efforts to address child mortality and morbidity. This might include, for 
example, consulting parents and caregivers on their priorities for addressing child mortality 
and morbidity, or involving community members in health facility management 
committees; 
</p>
<p>(h) Ensure, including through the analysis of disaggregated data, that the 
implementation of policies, programmes and services does not discriminate against any 
segment of the population and that, where necessary, additional efforts are made to reach 
populations of children who are marginalized or discriminated against;  
</p>
<p>(i) Reduce reliance on out-of-pocket payments for health services by providing 
social protection or sharing financial risks across the population, which promotes access to 
services by the most marginalized populations. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Monitoring and evaluation 
</b></p>
<p>60. Monitoring and evaluation of data relating to child mortality and morbidity, 
collected regularly and rigorously, are required to track fulfilment of relevant human rights 
as well as to inform policies, programmes and services. Well-functioning health 
information and surveillance systems should ensure that data are reliable, transparent and 
consistent, while protecting the right to privacy of children and their families. Data should 
be disaggregated to reveal which groups of children are being left behind and should be 
regularly used to track progress and direct action. 
</p>
<p>61. National accountability mechanisms should monitor, review and recommend 
remedial action based on their findings. Monitoring means providing data on the health 
status of children, the quality of children&#8217;s health services, and how much is spent, where, 
on what and on whom. This should include both routine monitoring and periodic, in-depth 
evaluations. Reviewing means analysing the data and consulting children, families, other 
caregivers and civil society to determine whether children&#8217;s health has improved and 
whether governments and other actors have fulfilled their commitments. Acting means 
using evidence emerging from those processes to repeat and expand what is working and to 
remedy and reform what is not.32

<p>62. Existing monitoring, evaluation and accountability processes and mechanisms 
should be assessed to determine the extent to which those functions can be fulfilled to help 
ensure child health and survival and where they may need to be strengthened. The 
generation and use of timely and accurate information relating to all factors affecting child 
mortality and morbidity are key to improving child health, informing an appropriate and 
effective response and ensuring the accountability of duty-bearers.  
</p>
<p>63. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Regularly review their health information system, including vital registration 
and childhood disease surveillance, with a view to its improvement; 
</p>
<p>(b) Create a well-structured and appropriately-disaggregated set of quantitative 
and qualitative indicators that encompasses key recommended child health indicators 
within and beyond the health sector, with a view to measuring changes in child health and 
survival, tracking progress towards established targets and addressing any discrimination; 
</p>
<p>(c) Monitor and evaluate the effects of the national legal and policy framework 
on child mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p>(d) Monitor budget allocations and expenditure for child health and other factors 
affecting child mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p>(e) Ensure the existence of quality assurance systems for education and training, 
including accreditation and certification for both private and public health workers, that 
meet nationally and internationally agreed standards; 
</p>
<p>(f) Monitor and evaluate non-State actors&#8217; fulfilment of their human rights 
responsibilities relevant to child health and survival, including that of private sector 
providers of health and ancillary services; 
</p>
<p>(g) Include civil society and other community members in the collection and 
analysis of monitoring and evaluation data relating to child health, as well as in making 
decisions arising from analysis of those data;  
</p>
<p>(h) Conduct regular reviews of child deaths in order that lessons may be learned 
at all levels of health and other systems, as a way to inform actions to prevent future child 
deaths; 
</p>
<p>(i) Monitor the use of mechanisms for reporting, remedy and redress in the case 
of violations of human rights relating to child mortality and morbidity and ensure their 
functionality; 
</p>
<p>(j) Disseminate the findings of child health monitoring and evaluation efforts 
and use the data to adapt and improve policies, programmes and services relating to child 
mortality and morbidity;  
</p>
<p>(k) Establish transparent accountability processes and mechanisms by setting 
performance targets, collecting information about action taken to meet those targets, 
making public judgements about the adequacy of such actions and imposing sanctions for 
unsatisfactory performance. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Remedies and redress 
</b></p>
<p>64. For rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress 
violations. Effective mechanisms for remedy and redress can promote the implementation 
of existing laws, policies and programmes, inform the reform of laws, policies and budgets 
that do not adequately protect children&#8217;s rights, challenge barriers to access to child health 
care, and provide redress for violations of child health-related rights. Judicial, medical and </p>


<p>other personnel should have adequate capacity to understand and respect the evolving 
maturity of the child and the child&#8217;s right to be heard. 
</p>
<p>65. Functional accountability mechanisms that are enforceable not only through the 
courts but also through quasi- and non-judicial mechanisms such as national human rights 
institutions, children&#8217;s ombudspersons and subnational social accountability and complaints 
mechanisms are a critical element of a human rights-based approach to reducing child 
mortality and morbidity. 
</p>
<p>66. An audit of existing remedy and redress mechanisms can help to identify areas that 
require strengthening. 
</p>
<p>67. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Provide, in law, policy and budgets, for a range of effective monitoring, 
claims and redress mechanisms available and accessible to children and their caregivers. 
They should include the provision of child-friendly information, advice, advocacy and 
access to the courts with necessary legal and other assistance;33 
</p>
<p>(b) Ensure and facilitate access to courts, as well as to quasi- and non-judicial 
accountability mechanisms, for parents and caregivers;  
</p>
<p>(c) Ensure community participation in determining appropriate mechanisms for 
accountability, including remedy and redress, relevant to child health and survival; 
</p>
<p>(d) Raise awareness about the applicability of claims relating to child health-
related rights among lawyers, judges, parents and caregivers through training, education 
and, where necessary, support to families; 
</p>
<p>(e) Ensure that where rights are found to have been breached there is appropriate 
reparation, including, where needed, compensation and measures to promote physical and 
psychological recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration;34  
</p>
<p>(f) Identify and remove any barriers to accessing mechanisms for reporting, 
remedying and redressing human rights violations in relation to child mortality and 
morbidity;  
</p>
<p>(g) Ensure that independent accountability mechanisms can be used to hold in-
country stakeholders as well as international cooperation partners to account. 
</p>
<p><b> H. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>68. States have an obligation to promote and encourage international cooperation with a 
view to achieving progressively the full realization of the child&#8217;s right to health.35 
International cooperation efforts should be rights-based in terms of the outcomes they seek 
to achieve as well as their own processes of design, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation. Coordination among different States giving and receiving cooperation 
assistance is required to ensure the complementarity of efforts to address child mortality 
and morbidity as well as their consonance with local priorities.  
</p>
<p>69. States and development partners are required to pay particular attention to children&#8217;s 
health priorities in resource-limited settings, in accordance with the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Iinternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

<p>and other relevant principles and guidelines.36 Non-State development partners such as 
foundations, the private sector, international financial institutions and non-governmental 
organizations, also have responsibilities to ensure that child rights relating to health and 
survival are not violated through their actions.37 
</p>
<p>70. States are required to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Direct international cooperation assistance to support and strengthen State-
led health systems and national plans to address child mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p>(b) Adopt a human rights-based approach to international cooperation for 
reducing child mortality and morbidity by ensuring attention to all relevant human rights 
standards and principles, for example by ensuring that priorities are set through 
participatory processes, that there is a focus on the most excluded and discriminated 
against, and that mechanisms for international accountability are in place; 
</p>
<p>(c) Ensure that all international cooperation supports laws, policies, programmes 
and services designed, implemented, monitored and evaluated using a human rights-based 
approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p>(d) Seek to ensure predictable, harmonized and transparent international 
cooperation to support State responses to child mortality and morbidity;  
</p>
<p>(e) Strengthen their international commitment, cooperation and mutual 
assistance with the objective of reducing child mortality and morbidity, including through 
the sharing of good practices, research, policies, monitoring and capacity-building;  
</p>
<p>(f) Direct their international cooperation assistance to supporting the creation of 
an environment in which all members of society can discharge their responsibilities with 
regard to child-health related human rights.38 This may include, for example, supporting 
social protection policies so that parents and caregivers are able to fulfil their 
responsibilities towards their children; 
</p>
<p>(g) Regulate, in line with relevant principles,39 private actors over which they 
exercise control, such as pharmaceutical companies, commodities and device 
manufacturers, producers and marketers of breastmilk substitutes and other companies that 
affect efforts to address child mortality and morbidity overseas, in order to prevent 
violations of child health-related rights and ensure accountability, including remedy and 
redress, if violations occur;40  
</p>
<p>(h) Minimize the impact of economic sanctions on child health and survival.41

<p>based action. In addition, it encompasses systematic attention to each of the key principles 
of a human rights-based approach and selected elements of the operational guidance. 
</p>
<p>73. Neonatal mortality - deaths within the first 28 days of life - accounts for 
approximately 43 per cent of all child deaths.42 Up to two thirds of those deaths could be 
prevented if known effective health measures were provided at birth and during the first 
week of life.43 
</p>
<p>74. Tackling neonatal mortality includes attention to the care of pregnant women, 
skilled attendance at delivery, and management of neonatal sepsis. However, low education 
levels, lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation, insufficient access to health 
services (including emergency care at delivery), gender discrimination and a lack of 
empowerment prevent women from seeking health care and making the best choices for 
themselves and their children&#8217;s health, resulting in delays and poorer health outcomes. A 
human rights-based approach to addressing neonatal mortality encompasses attention to all 
of these dimensions of women&#8217;s and neonatal health care, including the underlying 
determinants of neonatal mortality.  
</p>
<p>75. Attention to the issues raised by the child&#8217;s rights to health and survival and other 
relevant human rights, should be incorporated throughout policy and budget planning 
processes. These processes require identifying the resource needs for implementation and 
prioritizing actions through transparent mechanisms of accountability.  
</p>
<p><b>  Legal and policy environment 
</b></p>
<p>76. A first step is to ratify international treaties relevant to neonatal mortality and 
incorporate them into national laws and policies.  
</p>
<p>77. Adopting and enforcing laws and policies that promote access to high-quality 
maternal and newborn care in both the public and private sectors is a key component of a 
human rights-based approach to preventing neonatal mortality. This encompasses laws and 
policies for: ensuring universal access by women and children to health-care services, birth 
registration and social services; non-discrimination; notification of maternal and perinatal 
deaths; context-specific approaches to HIV and infant feeding; and implementing and 
monitoring the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.  
</p>
<p>78. In addition, workplace policies are important to support women during pregnancy 
and in the postnatal period by protecting pregnant women from physically demanding work 
and supporting breastfeeding in the workplace.44 
</p>
<p><b>  Health services 
</b></p>
<p>79. Given the critical importance of health services to neonatal health in the immediate 
postnatal period, attention to the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of 
facilities, goods and services is required.  
</p>
<p>80. It is important that the availability of life-saving interventions and commodities be 
secured in all health facilities, including those in remote areas. Attention to non-
discrimination ensures that actions to address neonatal mortality are sufficiently targeted to 
marginalized communities to eliminate inequalities.

<p>81. Access to early postnatal care for mothers and newborns within two days of birth 
has a major impact on newborn health and can be enhanced through the elimination of user 
fees for maternal and neonatal health services that might pose a barrier to service uptake. 
</p>
<p>82. The availability of skilled health workers who are motivated, adequately equipped 
and appropriately distributed is critical to ensuring access to services. Providing extra care 
to babies with low birth weight is particularly important to reduce newborn mortality, and 
health personnel need to be given the capacity and a clear mandate to support those babies 
and their mothers. Ensuring that midwifery curricula meet global standards and that 
students acquire the necessary competencies to deliver good-quality services with 
confidence can help ensure an adequately skilled health workforce. 
</p>
<p>83. Appropriate care during labour, birth and in the immediate postnatal period can 
prevent the onset of complications or enable their early detection and prompt management. 
Ensuring the acceptability of maternal and neonatal health services requires, for example, 
ensuring that women are treated with dignity and respect, that pain management is provided 
for mothers and newborns, and that there is no unnecessary separation of mothers and 
newborns.  
</p>
<p>84. Ensuring the quality of maternal and neonatal services for all women and infants 
without discrimination may increase their uptake and have a positive impact on neonatal 
mortality. 
</p>
<p>85. Alongside the expansion of service delivery, a human rights-based approach requires 
addressing the underlying legal, policy and practical reasons, for example poverty, low 
levels of education, gender inequality, disability and discrimination, why access to neonatal 
health services remains constrained for some populations.  
</p>
<p>86. The principles of equality and non-discrimination demand attention to why neonatal 
mortality remains a problem and which groups of infants are most affected. They require 
that national policies and programmes prioritize improving access for the most 
marginalized populations. Those groups will vary according to the context, which again 
highlights the need for appropriately disaggregated data as a tool for identifying groups that 
may require special attention. 
</p>
<p>87. To ensure accountability at the health facility level, feedback mechanisms should be 
in place for health workers and clients to identify any shortcomings in service provision, 
such as drug stock-outs or poor quality of care, that managers should review and take 
appropriate action on in a timely fashion.  
</p>
<p><b>  Community-level interventions 
</b></p>
<p>88. Involving communities in child health-related activities can reduce neonatal 
mortality and help ensure that interventions are appropriate and effective.45 A recent review 
found benefits for maternal and child health outcomes from attention to participation, 
particularly in combination with additional human rights principles.46 
</p>
<p>89. Community health committees, whose membership combines local citizens and

participation can help improve neonatal health outcomes by sharing responsibility for 
ensuring that services maintain a certain standard of performance. The human rights

<p>principles of participation, equality and non-discrimination require ensuring that various 
groups of women are included.  
</p>
<p>90. Ensuring the participation of marginalized groups in community health committees 
requires reaching, and supporting the engagement of, those who are often not reached, such 
as remote populations, women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, people with low 
capacity to engage in health and development processes and people who have little 
experience of articulating their needs and priorities.  
</p>
<p>91. Strategies should empower committee members to articulate their expectations 
towards the State and other duty-bearers to take charge of their own development and to 
facilitate collaboration with others in implementing interventions.47  
</p>
<p>92. Situated within the community, committee members are ideally placed to advise on 
where, when and how interventions to address neonatal mortality can be delivered to ensure 
their availability, accessibility and acceptability to the whole community, especially the 
most marginalized.48 In this way, in addition to improving access to information and 
services, community participation in planning service delivery can also contribute to 
addressing inequalities in neonatal outcomes.  
</p>
<p>93. An independent accountability mechanism with accessible complaints mechanisms 
will also be important for promoting social accountability, by ensuring that community 
members can monitor local health service delivery and the committee&#8217;s activities. 
</p>
<p>94. This example of a human rights-based approach to reducing neonatal mortality 
highlights that, beyond the legal imperative for attention to human rights, this approach can 
lead to better health outcomes by ensuring systematic attention to the legal and policy 
environment, equality and non-discrimination, the participation of affected populations, the 
best interests of the child, accountability and the availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
quality of child health facilities, goods and services.

<p><b> VI. Moving forward

<p>95. <b>To ensure that all efforts to reduce child mortality and morbidity fully conform 
to recognized international human rights standards and principles, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) strongly encourages 
the implementation of the present technical guidance at the national and subnational 
levels.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>States should disseminate the technical guidance to all relevant government 
sectors and other stakeholders, and ensure its systematic application in the 
development, implementation and review of laws, policies, budgets and programmes 
related to child to health and survival. States are also encouraged to generate and 
disseminate examples of good practice of implementation of a human rights-based 
approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The technical guidance should be applied within the framework of the broader 
recommendations made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the WHO and 
the Independent Expert Review Group on Monitoring and Accountability for 
Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health on strengthening human rights and accountability 
frameworks to achieve better health and accountability for women and children. To
