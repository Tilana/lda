EV Energy Partners Announces Second Quarter 2016 Results
HOUSTON, August 9, 2016 /GlobeNewswire/ -- EV Energy Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: EVEP)
today announced results for the second quarter of 2016 and the filing of its Form 10-Q with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Second Quarter 2016 Results
For the second quarter 2016, EVEP reported a net loss of $29.0 million, or $(0.58) per basic
and diluted weighted average limited partner unit outstanding compared to a net loss of
$29.0 million, or $(0.58) per basic and diluted weighted average limited partner unit
outstanding for the first quarter of 2016. Included in net loss for the second quarter of 2016
were the following items:
·$54.8 million of non-cash losses on commodity and interest rate derivatives,
$47.7 million of gain on early extinguishment of debt related to repurchases of Senior Notes at a
·
discount to par,
$2.0 million of impairment charges related to the write down of certain oil and natural gas
·
properties primarily due to a change in development plans,
·$1.4 million of non-cash costs contained in general and administrative expenses, and
· $0.8 million of dry hole and exploration costs.
For the second quarter of 2015, EVEP reported net income of $164.1 million, or $3.25 per
basic and diluted weighted average limited partner unit outstanding. Net income for the
second quarter of 2015 included a $246.7 million gain related to the sale of its interest in
Utica East Ohio, which was partially offset by $48.3 million of impairment charges.
Production for the second quarter of 2016 was 13.0 Bcf of natural gas, 313 Mbbls of oil and
585 Mbbls of natural gas liquids, or 201.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day (Mmcfe/day).
This represents flat production versus the first quarter of 2016 production of 201.4
Mmcfe/day and a 24 percent increase over the second quarter of 2015 production of 162.8
Mmcfe/day. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 was primarily due to the addition
of producing properties acquired on October 1, 2015.
Adjusted EBITDAX for the second quarter of 2016 was $26.5 million, a 31 percent increase
over the first quarter of 2016 Adjusted EBITDAX of $20.2 million and a 50 percent decrease
from the second quarter of 2015 Adjusted EBITDAX of $53.4 million. EVEP reported
Distributable Cash Flow of $5.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $(1.2)
million for the first quarter of 2016 and $26.2 million for the second quarter of 2015. The
increases in Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow over the first quarter of 2016
were primarily attributable to lower operating expenses and higher realized oil and natural
gas liquids prices, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. The decreases in
Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow from the second quarter of 2015 were
primarily attributable to lower realized oil and natural gas prices, lower realized hedge
gains and the sale of EVEP’s interest in Utica East Ohio in the second quarter of 2015,
partially offset by the addition of producing properties acquired on October 1, 2015.
Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow are Non-GAAP financial measures and
are described in the attached table under “Non-GAAP Measures.”
“We continue to focus on reducing leverage and operating costs. We recently completed
our Senior Note repurchase program, increasing our total repurchases for 2016 to $82.7
million of Senior Notes for $35.0 million of cash. At the end of the second quarter our total
debt was $623 million, and we had over $170 million of liquidity between balance sheet
cash and available borrowing base capacity," said Michael Mercer, President and CEO.

income taxes, cash interest expense, net, realized losses on interest rate swaps, and
estimated maintenance capital expenditures.
Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow are used by our management to provide
additional information and statistics relative to the performance of our business, including
(prior to the creation of any reserves) the cash available to pay distributions to our
unitholders. We believe these financial measures may indicate to investors whether or not
we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support quarterly distributions.
Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow are also quantitative standards used
throughout the investment community with respect to performance of publicly-traded
partnerships. Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered
as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or
any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with
GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow exclude some, but not all, items
that affect net income and operating income and these measures may vary among
companies. Therefore, our Adjusted EBITDAX and Distributable Cash Flow may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
