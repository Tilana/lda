NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•
•
1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
Organization
We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in Delaware in 1996 and focused on the midstream segment of
the crude oil and natural gas industry in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, primarily Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and in Wyoming and the Gulf of Mexico. We have a diverse portfolio of assets, including
pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and
unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks. We are owned 100% by our limited partners. Genesis Energy,
LLC, our general partner, is a wholly-owned subsidiary. Our general partner has sole responsibility for conducting our
business and managing our operations. We conduct our operations and own our operating assets through our subsidiaries
and joint ventures. We manage our businesses through the following five divisions that constitute our reportable segments:
•Offshore pipeline transportation and processing of crude oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico;
•Onshore pipeline transportation of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide (or "CO2");
Refinery services involving processing of high sulfur (or “sour”) gas streams for refineries to remove the sulfur, and selling
•
the related by-product, sodium hydrosulfide (or “NaHS”, commonly pronounced "nash");
Marine transportation to provide waterborne transportation of petroleum products and crude oil throughout North America;
and
Supply and logistics services, which include terminaling, blending, storing, marketing and transporting crude oil and
petroleum products and, on a smaller scale, CO2.
On July 24, 2015, we acquired the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its
affiliates for approximately $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. That business includes interests in offshore crude oil
and natural gas pipelines and six offshore hub platforms that serve some of the most active drilling and development
regions in the United States, including deepwater production fields in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama. That acquisition complements and substantially expands our existing offshore pipelines
segment.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include Genesis Energy, L.P. and its
subsidiaries, including our general partner, Genesis Energy, LLC.
Our results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected
for the fiscal year. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared by us without
audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they reflect
all adjustments (which consist solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary
for a fair presentation of the financial results for interim periods. Certain information and notes normally included in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading when read in conjunction with the information contained in the periodic
reports we file with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Consolidated Financial
Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Except per unit amounts, or as noted within the context of each footnote disclosure, the dollar amounts presented in the
tabular data within these footnote disclosures are stated in thousands of dollars.
2. Recent Accounting Developments
Recently Issued
In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current
revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an
entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard
provides a five-step analysis for transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The guidance permits the
use of either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral
of the effective date of this standard to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The
FASB also approved
7
Table of Contents
early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the
transition methods and the impact of the amended guidance on our financial position, results of operations and related
disclosures.
In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance modifying the accounting for inventory. Under this guidance, the measurement
principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost or net realizable value. The guidance
defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable
costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016,
with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 in response to stakeholder feedback that restating prior periods to
reflect adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination adds cost and complexity to
financial reporting, but does not significantly improve the usefulness of information provided to users. Under the new ASU,
an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the
reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU also requires that the acquirer present
separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current
period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the
provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for reporting periods after
December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this guidance and it has not had a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to improve the transparency and comparability among companies by
requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. The
guidance also requires additional disclosure about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is
permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance.
3. Acquisition and Divestiture
Acquisition
Enterprise Offshore
On July 24, 2015, we acquired the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its
affiliates for approximately $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. That business includes interests in offshore crude oil
and natural gas pipelines and six offshore hub platforms, including a 36% interest in the Poseidon Oil Pipeline System, a
50% interest in the Southeast Keathley Canyon Oil Pipeline System, and a 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil
Pipeline System. To finance that transaction, in July, we issued 10,350,000 common units in a public offering that
generated proceeds of $437.2 million net of underwriter discounts and $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75%
senior unsecured notes due 2022 that generated net proceeds of $728.6 million net of issuance discount and underwriting
fees. The remainder of that transaction was financed with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility.
We have reflected the financial results of the acquired business in our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment from the
date of acquisition. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
estimated preliminary fair values. Those preliminary fair values were developed by management with the assistance of a
third-party valuation firm and are subject to change pending a final valuation report and final determination of working
capital acquired and other purchase price adjustments. As of June 30, 2016, we have yet to finalize the purchase price
allocation for this transaction. We will finalize our purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2016 and we do not
expect any material adjustments to these preliminary purchase price allocations. Our preliminary purchase price allocation
remains unchanged from what was disclosed in the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.     
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of our acquired offshore pipeline transportation business since
July 24, 2015, the closing date of the acquisition. The following table presents selected financial information included in
our Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented:

The table below presents selected unaudited pro forma financial information incorporating the historical results of our
newly acquired offshore pipeline transportation assets. The pro forma financial information below has been prepared as if
the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2015 and is based upon assumptions deemed appropriate by us and
may not be indicative of actual results. This pro forma information was prepared using historical financial data of the
Enterprise offshore pipelines and services businesses and reflects certain estimates and assumptions made by our
management. Our unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated financial
results would have been had the Enterprise acquisition been completed on January 1, 2015.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The market value of inventories were not below recorded cost as of
June 30, 2016 and were below recorded costs by approximately $0.9 million as of December 31, 2015; therefore we
reduced the value of inventory in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for this difference in 2015.

Asset Retirement Obligations
We record AROs in connection with legal requirements to perform specified retirement activities under contractual
arrangements and/or governmental regulations. As a result of the Enterprise acquisition of the offshore pipeline and
services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. on July 24, 2015, we recorded AROs based on the fair value
measurement assigned during the preliminary purchase price allocation.

Of the ARO balances disclosed above, $5.5 million and 9.8 million is included as current in "Accrued liabilities" on our
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The
remainder of the ARO liability as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is included in "Other long-term liabilities" on our
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
With respect to our AROs, the following table presents our forecast of accretion expense for the periods indicated:

Certain of our unconsolidated affiliates have AROs recorded at June 30, 2016 relating to contractual agreements and
regulatory requirements. These amounts are immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
6. Equity Investees
We account for our ownership in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. The price we pay to acquire an
ownership interest in a company may exceed or be less than the underlying book value of the capital accounts we acquire.
Such excess cost amounts are included within the carrying values of our equity investees. At June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the unamortized excess cost amounts totaled $406.0 million and $414.0 million, respectively. We
amortize the excess cost as a reduction in equity earnings in a manner similar to depreciation.
As part of our Enterprise acquisition, we increased our ownership interest in each of Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline
Company ("CHOPS") and Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline Company, LLC ("SEKCO") from 50% to 100%.
Consequently, these entities were reflected as equity investees until July 24, 2015, at which point they became fully
consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries.
Also, as part of our Enterprise acquisition, our ownership interest in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, LLC ("Poseidon")
increased from 28% to 64%. We also acquired a 50% ownership interest in Deepwater Gateway, LLC and a 25.7% interest
in Neptune Pipeline Company, LLC. These additional interests are accounted for as equity investments from the
acquisition date of July 24, 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in Deepwater Gateway, LLC for approximately $26.0
million (including adjustments for working capital), so we now own 100% of that entity. Consequently, we now consolidate
Deepwater Gateway, LLC instead of accounting for our interest under the equity method.

Poseidon's revolving credit facility
Borrowings under Poseidon’s revolving credit facilities, which was amended and restated in February 2015, are primarily
used to fund spending on capital projects. The February 2015 credit facility is non-recourse to Poseidon’s owners and
secured by substantially all of Poseidon's assets. The February 2015 credit facility contains customary covenants such as
restrictions on debt levels, liens, guarantees, mergers, sale of assets and distributions to owners. A breach of any of these
covenants could result in acceleration of the maturity date of Poseidon’s debt. Poseidon was in compliance with the terms
of its credit agreement for all periods presented in these Unaudited Combined Financial Statements.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1)
In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements as
a direct reduction of related debt liabilities with amortization of debt issuance costs reported as interest expense. Under
current U.S. GAAP standards, debt issuance costs are reported as deferred charges (i.e., as an asset). This guidance is
effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and is to
be applied retrospectively upon adoption. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period for
financial statements that have not been previously issued. Genesis adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement and senior
unsecured notes indentures.
Senior Secured Credit Facility
In April 2016, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the committed amount under our
revolving credit facility to $1.7 billion (from $1.5 billion), with the ability to increase the committed amount by an additional
$300.0 million, subject to lender consent and (ii) permanently relax the maximum consolidated leverage ratio to 5.5 to 1.0.
The key terms for rates under our $1.7 billion senior secured credit facility, which are dependent on our leverage ratio (as
defined in the credit agreement), are as follows:
•The applicable margin varies from 1.50% to 2.75% on Eurodollar borrowings and from 0.50% to 1.75% on alternate base
rate borrowings.
•Letter of credit fees range from 1.50% to 2.50%
•The commitment fee on the unused committed amount will range from 0.250% to 0.500%.
•The accordion feature is $300.0 million, giving us the ability to expand the size of the facility up to $2.0 billion for
acquisitions or growth projects, subject to lender consent.
At June 30, 2016, we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our $1.7 billion credit facility, with $57.8 million of the borrowed
amount designated as a loan under the inventory sublimit. Our credit agreement allows up to $100.0 million of the capacity
to be used for letters of credit, of which $12.3 million was outstanding at June 30, 2016. Due to the revolving nature of loans
under our credit facility, additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re-borrowings may be made until the maturity
date. The total amount available for borrowings under our credit facility at June 30, 2016 was $281.9 million.
9. Partners’ Capital and Distributions
At June 30, 2016, our outstanding common units consisted of 109,939,221 Class A units and 39,997 Class B units.
On July 27, 2016, we issued 8,000,000 Class A common units in a public offering at a price of $37.90 per unit. We granted
the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,200,000 additional units from us. We received the proceeds, net of
underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $298.0 million from that offering.

10. Business Segment Information
We currently manage our businesses through five divisions that constitute our reportable segments:
Offshore Pipeline Transportation – offshore pipeline transportation and processing of crude oil and natural gas in the Gulf
of Mexico;
•Onshore Pipeline Transportation – transportation of crude oil, and to a lesser extent, CO2;
Refinery Services – processing high sulfur (or “sour”) gas streams as part of refining operations to remove the sulfur and
•
selling the related by-product, NaHS;
Marine Transportation – marine transportation to provide waterborne transportation of petroleum products and crude oil
throughout North America; and
Supply and Logistics – terminaling, blending, storing, marketing and transporting crude oil and petroleum products
(primarily fuel oil, asphalt, and other heavy refined products) and, on a smaller scale, CO2.
Substantially all of our revenues are derived from, and substantially all of our assets are located in, the United States.
We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges,
such as depreciation and amortization), and segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable
cash generated by our equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of our
legacy stock appreciation rights plan and includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing
leases.
Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of
measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes, where relevant, and capital investment.

At June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we had incurred liabilities for fixed and intangible asset additions totaling $55.6
million and $52.9 million, respectively, that had not been paid at the end of the second quarter, and, therefore, were not
included in the caption “Payments to acquire fixed and intangible assets” under Cash Flows from Investing Activities in the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
At June 30, 2016 we had incurred liabilities for other asset additions totaling $0.1 million, that had not been paid at the end
of the second quarter and, therefore, were not included in the caption "Other, net" under Cash Flows from Investing
Activities in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
13. Derivatives
Commodity Derivatives
We have exposure to commodity price changes related to our inventory and purchase commitments. We utilize derivative
instruments (primarily futures and options contracts traded on the NYMEX) to hedge our exposure to commodity prices,
primarily of crude oil, fuel oil and petroleum products. Our decision as to whether to designate derivative instruments as fair
value hedges for accounting purposes relates to our expectations of the length of time we expect to have the commodity
price exposure and our expectations as to whether the derivative contract will qualify as highly effective under accounting
guidance in limiting our exposure to commodity price risk. Most of the petroleum products, including fuel oil that we supply,
cannot be hedged with a high degree of effectiveness with derivative contracts available on the NYMEX; therefore, we do
not designate derivative contracts utilized to limit our price risk related to these products as hedges for accounting
purposes. Typically we utilize crude oil and other petroleum products futures and option contracts to limit our exposure to
the effect of fluctuations in petroleum products prices on the future sale of our inventory or commitments to purchase
petroleum products, and we recognize any changes in fair value of the derivative contracts as increases or decreases in
our cost of sales. The recognition of changes in fair value of the derivative contracts not designated as hedges for
accounting purposes can occur in reporting periods that do not coincide with the recognition of gain or loss on the actual
transaction being hedged. Therefore we will, on occasion, report gains or losses in one period that will be partially offset by
gains or losses in a future period when the hedged transaction is completed.
We have designated certain crude oil futures contracts as hedges of crude oil inventory due to our expectation that these
contracts will be highly effective in hedging our exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices during the period that we
18

GENESIS ENERGY, L.P.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
expect to hold that inventory. We account for these derivative instruments as fair value hedges under the accounting
guidance. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are used to offset
related changes in the fair value of the hedged crude oil inventory. Any hedge ineffectiveness in these fair value hedges
and any amounts excluded from effectiveness testing are recorded as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.
In accordance with NYMEX requirements, we fund the margin associated with our loss positions on commodity derivative
contracts traded on the NYMEX. The amount of the margin is adjusted daily based on the fair value of the commodity
contracts. The margin requirements are intended to mitigate a party's exposure to market volatility and the associated
contracting party risk. We offset fair value amounts recorded for our NYMEX derivative contracts against margin funding as
required by the NYMEX in Current Assets - Other in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At June 30, 2016, we had the following outstanding derivative commodity contracts that were entered into to economically
hedge inventory or fixed price purchase commitments.

Financial Statement Impacts
Unrealized gains are subtracted from net income and unrealized losses are added to net income in determining cash flows
from operating activities. To the extent that we have fair value hedges outstanding, the offsetting change recorded in the fair
value of inventory is also eliminated from net income in determining cash flows from operating activities. Changes in
margin deposits necessary to fund unrealized losses also affect cash flows from operating activities.

These derivative liabilities have been funded with margin deposits recorded in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets under Current Assets - Other.
Our accounting policy is to offset derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty when a master
netting arrangement exists.  Accordingly, we also offset derivative assets and liabilities with amounts associated with cash
margin.  Our exchange-traded derivatives are transacted through brokerage accounts and are subject to margin
requirements as established by the respective exchange.  On a daily basis, our account equity (consisting of the sum of our
cash balance and the fair value of our open derivatives) is compared to our initial margin requirement resulting in the
payment or return of variation margin.  As of June 30, 2016, we had a net broker receivable of approximately $8.3 million
(consisting of initial margin of $5.6 million and increased by $2.7 million of variation margin).  As of December 31, 2015, we
had a net broker receivable of approximately $5.5 million (consisting of initial margin of $4.4 million increased by $1.1
million of variation margin).  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of our outstanding derivatives contained
credit-risk related contingent features that would result in a material adverse impact to us upon any change in our credit
ratings.

We classify financial assets and liabilities into the following three levels based on the inputs used to measure fair value:
(1)
(2)
Level 1 fair values are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
Level 2 fair values are based on pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities and are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date; and

 $(13,340) $ —  $ —  $(411 ) $ —  $ —
(3)Level 3 fair values are based on unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.
As required by fair value accounting guidance, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value requires judgment and may affect the placement of
assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 
 
Recurring Fair Value Measures Level 1  Level 2 Level 3 Level 1  Level 2 Level 3
Commodity derivatives:
Assets
Liabilities
Our commodity derivatives include exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded options contracts. The fair value of these
exchange-traded derivative contracts is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and is, therefore, included in
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
See Note 13 for additional information on our derivative instruments.
Other Fair Value Measurements
We believe the debt outstanding under our credit facility approximates fair value as the stated rate of interest approximates
current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable maturities. At June 30, 2016 our senior unsecured
notes had a carrying value of $1.8 billion and a fair value of $1.7 billion, compared to $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2015. The fair value of the senior unsecured notes is determined based on trade information
in the financial markets of our public debt and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.
    
Additionally, we recorded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our
Enterprise acquisition as of the acquisition date of July 24, 2015. The fair value measurements were primarily based on
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) developed using company-specific information. See Note 3 for further information
associated with the values recorded in our Enterprise acquisition.
21
Table of Contents
GENESIS ENERGY, L.P.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Additionally, the fair value measurements, using unobservable (Level 3) inputs, used in recording the estimated fair value
of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed of CHOPS and SEKCO (which we now own 100% interest in and
consolidate given the respective 50% ownership interest acquired from Enterprise for each of these subsidiaries) as a
result of our Enterprise acquisition were used to calculate the effects of the re-measurement of our pre-acquisition historical
interest in CHOPS and SEKCO at fair value, based on accounting guidance involving step acquisitions as discussed in
ASC 805-10-25.
15. Contingencies
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. Policies and procedures are in place to aid in monitoring
compliance and detecting and addressing releases of crude oil from our pipelines or other facilities; however, no
assurance can be made that such environmental releases may not substantially affect our business.
We are subject to lawsuits in the normal course of business and examination by tax and other regulatory authorities. We do
not expect such matters presently pending to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
16. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
Our $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes co-issued by Genesis Energy, L.P. and Genesis
Energy Finance Corporation are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by all of Genesis Energy, L.P.’s
current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, except Genesis Free State Pipeline, LLC, Genesis NEJD Pipeline,
LLC and certain other minor subsidiaries. Genesis NEJD Pipeline, LLC is 100% owned by Genesis Energy, L.P., the
parent company. The remaining non-guarantor subsidiaries are owned by Genesis Crude Oil, L.P., a guarantor subsidiary.
Genesis Energy Finance Corporation has no independent assets or operations. See Note 8 for additional information
regarding our consolidated debt obligations.
During 2015, the Company determined the need to revise its disclosures and presentation with respect to the Condensed
Consolidating Financial Information included in this footnote. These revisions relate solely to transactions between
Genesis Energy, L.P. and its subsidiaries and only impact the information that is presented in the Condensed
Consolidating Financial Information presented herein and does not affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in any
way. The Company determined that adjustments to the presentation relating to advances to and from affiliates was
necessary and were made. This resulted in the reclassification of such advances from current assets and liabilities to long
term assets and liabilities. The condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015
has been adjusted to reflect these changes. There is also a schedule below that reflects all these adjustments and
reconciles from what has been disclosed in previous filings to what we represent in the financial statements below.
The following is condensed consolidating financial information for Genesis Energy, L.P., the guarantor subsidiaries and the
non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following information should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following information and such
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should also be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and related notes, together with our discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations,
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis are the following sections:
•Overview
•Results of Operations
•Liquidity and Capital Resources
•Non-GAAP Financial Measures
•Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
•Forward Looking Statements
Overview
We reported Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $23.7 million, or $0.22 per common unit, during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 (“2016 Quarter”) compared to net income of $11.7 million, or $0.12 per common unit, during
the three months ended June 30, 2015 (“2015 Quarter”). The large increase in our net income was principally due to
contributions from the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets we acquired from Enterprise in July 2015. In addition, a portion of the
increase is attributable to a non-cash loss on debt extinguishment during the 2015 Quarter. These increases were partially
offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from acquired and
constructed assets (primarily related to the financing of the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets we acquired from Enterprise), an
increase in depreciation expense for assets acquired or placed into service (including those offshore Gulf of Mexico assets)
and decreases in contributions from segments other than our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment.
Cash flow from operating activities was $62.6 million for the 2016 Quarter compared to $8.6 million during the 2015
Quarter.
Available Cash before Reserves was $96.0 million for the 2016 Quarter, an increase of $27.2 million, or 40%, from the
2015 Quarter. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on Available Cash before Reserves.
Segment Margin (as described below in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) was $142.5 million for the 2016 Quarter, an
increase of $43.9 million, or 45%, from the 2015 Quarter.
The increases in our Net Income and Segment Margin resulted primarily from increases attributable to our Offshore
Pipeline Transportation Segment of $59.2 million. Those increases are primarily related to assets recently acquired from
Enterprise.
Our diversified, yet increasingly integrated, businesses continued to perform in the 2016 quarter within an acceptable
range in spite of the ongoing dislocations in the energy sector, uncertainties in capital markets and the midstream space,
and specific challenges, at the margin, on certain of our operations. Even if this challenging backdrop continues in future
quarters, we would expect to see sequentially higher net income and Available Cash before Reserves due to a variety of
factors, including increasing volumes out of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the end of certain refinery turnarounds, and the
initiation of service, and the anticipated ramp up of volumes between now and the end of 2017, from some of our recent
organic projects. In the aggregate, we believe our commercial operations are relatively stable in this challenging
environment and we believe we have a reasonably clear line of sight of volume growth over the next four to six quarters. As
a result, we feel comfortable that our financial results and condition will continue to strengthen in future periods.
Our primary objective continues to be to deliver the best value to our unitholders while never wavering from our
commitment to safe and responsible operations. A lot has changed, we recognize, in how the market apparently values unit
prices for MLPs or other midstream entities over the last year and a half to two years. Although the move to eliminate our
IDRs almost six years ago and continuing to deliver double-digit growth in distributions on a year over year basis were
rewarded historically, we believe the metrics demanded by the markets have changed during these recent tumultuous
times.
We now believe the best way to promote unit price appreciation under current conditions is to exercise strong financial
discipline designed primarily to maintain and enhance our financial flexibility across the business cycle. Although we
believe we would otherwise naturally restore our financial flexibility with cash flows from operations, we feel we can
accelerate that process by issuing additional equity, lowering the future growth rate of quarterly distributions, or pursuing a
combination of the two.

Table of Contents
Consequently, on July 27, 2016, we closed a public offering of 8,000,000 common units generating net proceeds of
approximately $298 million. As a practical matter, we would have issued such additional equity a year ago at the time of
closing our Enterprise acquisition had markets been stronger at that point. This 2016 equity raise instantly improved our
liquidity and credit metrics.
We believe our increased liquidity and even stronger balance sheet resulting from such actions should combine to give us
the flexibility to continue to pursue acquisitions and/or organic projects that we feel are consistent with delivering long term
value to all of our stakeholders. We also believe that our improved credit profile will significantly lower the future costs of
refinancing our public debt when such issued tranches become due beginning in 2021 or callable beginning in 2017.
A more detailed discussion of our segment results and other costs is included below in “Results of Operations”.    
Distribution Increase
In July 2016, we declared our forty-fourth consecutive increase in our quarterly distribution to our common unitholders. In
August 2016, we will pay a distribution of $0.69 per unit related to the 2016 Quarter.
July 2016 Public Offering of Common Units
On July 27, 2016, we issued 8,000,000 Class A common units in a public offering at a price of $37.90 per unit. We granted
the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,200,000 additional units from us. We received the proceeds, net of
underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $298.0 million from that offering. We have used the proceeds to repay a
portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility going
forward with regards to funding the activities of the partnership.
Results of Operations
Revenues and Costs and Expenses
Our revenues for the 2016 Quarter decreased $210.4 million, or 32%, from the 2015 Quarter. Additionally, our costs and
expenses decreased $229.0 million, or 37%, between the two periods.
A substantial majority of our revenues and costs are derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum
products. The significant decrease in our revenues and costs between the two second quarter periods is primarily
attributable to a decrease in market prices for crude oil and petroleum products as described below. In general, we do not
expect fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas to affect our Net Income, Available Cash before Reserves or
Segment Margin to the same extent they affect our revenues and costs. We have limited our direct commodity price
exposure through the broad use of fee based service contracts, back-to-back purchase and sale arrangements, and
hedges. As a result, changes in the price of oil would similarly impact both our revenues and our costs with a
disproportionately smaller net impact on our Segment Margin. The same correlation would be true in the case of higher
crude oil and petroleum products sale prices and purchase costs.
Although prices of crude oil have partially recovered since December 31, 2015, prices were substantially lower in the three
and six month periods ending on June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. We would expect changes in
crude oil prices to continue to cause fluctuations in our revenues and, similarly, costs as derived from the purchase and
sale of crude oil and petroleum products, producing minimal direct impact on Segment Margin from those operations. The
average closing prices for West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX")
decreased 21% to $45.59 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $57.94 per barrel in the second quarter
of 2015.
We currently have two distinct, complementary types of operations-(i) our onshore-based refinery-centric crude oil and
refined petroleum products transportation, supply and logistics, and handling operations, focusing predominantly on
refinery-centric customers (as opposed to producers), and (ii) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline
transportation and handling operations, focusing on integrated and large independent energy companies who make
intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large reservoir, long-lived crude
oil and natural gas properties. Refiners are the shippers of over 80% of the volumes transported on our onshore crude
pipelines, and refiners contract for approximately 85% of the use of our inland barges, which are used primarily to transport
intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between refining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are
mostly integrated and large

independent energy companies who have developed, and continue to explore for, numerous large-reservoir, long-lived
crude oil properties whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast, unlike the
lighter crude oil and condensates produced from numerous onshore shale plays. Those large-reservoir properties and the
related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically
viable, in most cases, even in this lower commodity price environment. Given these facts, we do not expect changes in
commodity prices to impact our Net Income, Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin in the same manner in
which they impact our revenues and costs derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products.

We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges,
such as depreciation and amortization), and segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable
cash generated by our equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of our
legacy stock appreciation rights plan and includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing
leases. Our reconciliation of total Segment Margin to net income reflects that Segment Margin (as defined above) excludes
corporate general and administrative expenses, non-cash gains and charges, depreciation and amortization, interest
expense, certain non-cash items, the non-cash effects of our stock appreciation rights plan and unrealized gains and
losses on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
A reconciliation of total Segment Margin to Net Income for the periods presented is as follows:
Total Segment Margin
Corporate general and administrative expenses
Depreciation and amortization
Interest expense
Adjustment to exclude distributable cash generated by equity investees not
included in income and include equity in investees net income (1)

Segment Margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 includes approximately $22.8 million and $43.6
million, respectively, of distributions received from our offshore pipeline joint ventures accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. Segment Margin for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 includes $24.7 million
and $49.8 million, respectively, in similar distributions from our offshore pipeline joint ventures.
One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (GEL Offshore Pipeline, LLC, or "GOPL") owns our undivided interest in the
Eugene Island pipeline system.
Our SEKCO pipeline was completed in June of 2014. Under the terms of SEKCO’s transportation arrangements, its
shippers commenced making minimum monthly payments at that time, even though they did not commence throughput
of crude oil until January 2015. Volumes reported for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 for SEKCO
reflect the gradual commencement of throughput beginning in January of 2015. Even though our SEKCO volumes flow
through both SEKCO and Poseidon, we include those volumes only once in the table above.
Volumes are the product of our effective ownership interest through the year, including changes in ownership interest,
multiplied by the relevant throughput over the given year.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter increased $59.2 million, or 236%, from the 2015
Quarter. This increase is primarily due to our acquisition from Enterprise, which closed in July 2015. As a result of our
acquisition from Enterprise, we obtained approximately 2,350 miles of additional offshore natural gas and crude oil
pipelines (including increasing our ownership interest in each of the Poseidon, SEKCO, and CHOPS pipelines) and six
offshore hub platforms. The operating results of the offshore pipeline assets acquired from Enterprise continue to meet or
exceed our expectations, with sequential increases in volumes (compared to the first quarter of 2016) in the most
significant offshore crude oil pipelines in which we acquired (as well as those in which we previously owned an interest).

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter decreased $2.3 million, or 16%. Certain significant
components and details of this change were as follows:
With respect to our onshore crude oil pipelines, tariff revenues decreased quarter to quarter primarily due to a net
decrease in throughput volumes of 13,425 barrels per day or 12%. This was primarily the result of decreased volumes on
our Texas pipeline system, particularly delivery volumes to the Texas City refining market. Such lower volumes on our
Texas system to historical customers will likely continue in future periods as we complete the repurposing, which includes
making the necessary upgrades on our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline to reverse the direction of
flow, of our Houston area crude oil pipeline and terminal infrastructure. We anticipate this repurposing, as well as the other
components of our Houston area crude oil pipeline and terminal infrastructure project, to be completed prior to the end of
•
•
2016. This decrease was partially offset by volume variances on our other onshore pipeline systems. Though volumes on
our Louisiana system have decreased sequentially as a result of a protracted turnaround at our primary customer's refining
complex, we anticipate volumes on our Louisiana system to ramp back up starting in the third quarter upon the completion
of this turnaround. Additionally, operating costs increased compared to the 2015 Quarter due to costs related to our
Wyoming pipeline, which was not operational during the 2015 Quarter. These factors, when combined with lower sales of
pipeline loss allowance volumes, resulted in a $1.1 million decrease in Segment Margin compared to the 2015 Quarter.
Although volumes on our Free State CO2 pipeline system decreased 83,486 Mcf per day, or 50%, in the 2016 Quarter as
compared to the 2015 Quarter due to lower levels of tertiary crude oil activities in Mississippi, that decrease had a much
smaller effect on the contributions to Segment Margin by that pipeline. We provide transportation services on our Free
State CO2 pipeline system through an “incentive” tariff which provides that the average rate per Mcf that we charge during
any month decreases as our aggregate throughput for that month increases above specific thresholds. As a result of this
"incentive" tariff, fluctuations in volumes above a base level on our Free State CO2 pipeline system have a limited impact
on Segment Margin.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the first six months of 2016 decreased $0.9 million, or 3%. Certain
significant components and details of this change were as follows:
Onshore crude oil pipeline loss allowance volumes, collected and sold, resulted in a decrease in Segment Margin quarter
over quarter of $0.7 million. This decrease is primarily due to the change in the market price of crude oil between the
respective periods. Due to the nature of our tariffs on the Louisiana system, we do not collect or sell pipeline loss
allowance volumes on that system.
With respect to our onshore crude oil pipelines, tariff revenues increased by $0.3 million period to period, despite an
overall net decrease in throughput volumes of 6,686 barrels per day, which was primarily the result of increased volumes
associated with ramping-up our Louisiana and Wyoming pipeline systems offset by a decrease in volumes on our Texas
system. Due to a mix of tariff rates on our onshore pipelines, the impact on onshore crude oil tariffs and revenues from
these volume variances largely offset each other. This increase in tariff revenues was more than offset by increases in
operating costs, which include increased costs necessary to accommodate the increase in volumes and activity on our
Louisiana and Wyoming pipeline systems.
Although volumes on our Free State CO2 pipeline system decreased 71,120 Mcf per day, or 40%, in the first six months of
2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 due to lower levels of tertiary crude oil activities in Mississippi, that
decrease had a much smaller effect on the contributions to Segment Margin by that pipeline. We provide transportation
services on our Free State CO2 pipeline system through an “incentive” tariff which provides that the average rate per Mcf
that we charge during any month decreases as our aggregate throughput for that month increases above specific
thresholds. As a result of this "incentive" tariff, fluctuations in volumes above a base level on our Free State CO2 pipeline
system have a limited impact on Segment Margin.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Refinery Services Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter decreased $0.4 million, or 2%. Certain significant components and
details of this change were as follows:
NaHS revenues decreased 10% due primarily to a decrease in NaHS sales volumes. This decrease was primarily due to
lower demand from pulp and paper customers during the scheduled downtime these customers typically exhibit in the
spring, compared to the 2015 Quarter.
We were able to realize benefits from our favorable management of the purchasing (including economies of scale) and
utilization of caustic soda in our (and our customers') operations and our logistics management capabilities, which
somewhat offset the effects on Segment Margin of decreased NaHS sales volumes.
Caustic soda revenues decreased 10% primarily due to a reduction in our sales volumes. Although caustic sales volumes
may fluctuate, the contribution to Segment Margin from these sales is not a significant portion of our refinery services
activities.
Average index prices for caustic soda increased to $612 per DST in the 2016 Quarter compared to $577 per DST during
the 2015 Quarter. Those price movements affect the revenues and costs related to our sulfur removal services as well as
our caustic soda sales activities. However, generally, changes in caustic soda prices do not materially affect Segment
Margin attributable to our sulfur processing services because we usually pass those costs through to our NaHS sales
customers. Additionally, our bulk purchase and storage capabilities related to caustic soda allow us to somewhat mitigate
the effects of changes in index prices for caustic soda on our operating costs.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Refinery Services Segment Margin for the first six months of 2016 increased $1.7 million, or 4%. Certain significant
components and details of this change were as follows:
NaHS revenues decreased 7% primarily to a decrease in NaHS sales volumes. This decrease was primarily due to lower
demand from pulp and paper customers during the scheduled downtime these customers typically exhibit in the spring,
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
We were able to realize benefits from our favorable management of the purchasing (including economies of scale) and

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Marine Transportation Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter decreased $9.1 million, or 34%, from the 2015 Quarter. This
decrease in Segment Margin in the 2016 Quarter is primarily due to pressure on rates and utilization of our blue water,
offshore barges. The impacts of certain negative factors and pressures on our offshore barge performance that we have
previously discussed in our March 31, 2016 quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been consistent with our expectations with
regards to both timing and scale. Additionally, we faced certain challenges on utilization and rates for our inland barges in
large part attributable to fewer long voyages from the midwest to the Gulf Coast than we have historically experienced. We
believe these conditions may be reflective of certain aspects of the changing dynamics in refining operations which we
must continue to monitor in future periods.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Marine Transportation Segment Margin for the first six months of 2016 decreased $15.9 million, or 30%, from the first six

offshore barges. The impacts of certain negative factors and pressures on our offshore barge performance that we have
previously discussed in our March 31, 2016 quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been consistent with our expectations with
regards to both timing and scale. Utilization rates and prices for our inland barge fleet, which primarily transports
intermediate refined products for refineries, did not change significantly between the respective periods.

Supply and Logistics Segment
Our Supply and Logistics Segment is focused on utilizing our knowledge of the crude oil and petroleum markets to provide
crude oil and natural gas producers, refiners and other customers with a full suite of services. Our Supply and Logistics
Segment owns or leases trucks, terminals, gathering pipelines, railcars, and rail loading and unloading facilities. It uses
those assets, together with other modes of transportation owned by third parties and us, to service its customers and for its
own account. These services include:
utilizing the fleet of trucks, trailers and railcars owned or leased by our Supply and Logistics Segment to transport products
(primarily crude oil and petroleum products) for customers;
utilizing various modes of transportation owned by third parties and us to transport products (primarily crude oil and
petroleum products) for our own account to take advantage of logistical opportunities primarily in the Gulf Coast states and
waterways;
•purchasing/selling and/or transporting crude oil from the wellhead to markets for ultimate use in refining;
•supplying petroleum products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products) to wholesale markets;
purchasing products from refiners, transporting those products to one of our terminals and blending the products to a
quality that meets the requirements of our customers and selling those products;
•railcar loading and unloading activities at our crude-by-rail terminals; and
•industrial gas activities, including wholesale marketing of CO2 and processing of syngas through a joint venture.
We also use our terminal facilities to take advantage of contango market conditions, to gather and market crude oil, and to
capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time for both crude oil and petroleum products.
Despite crude oil being considered a somewhat homogeneous commodity, many refiners are very particular about the
quality of crude oil feedstock they process. Many U.S. refineries have distinct configurations and product slates that require
crude oil with specific characteristics, such as gravity and sulfur content, among others. Refineries evaluate the costs to
obtain, transport and process their preferred feedstocks. That particularity provides us with opportunities to help refineries
in our areas of operation identify crude oil sources meeting their requirements and to purchase the crude oil and transport it
to refineries for sale. The imbalances and inefficiencies relative to meeting refiners’ requirements can provide opportunities
for us to utilize our skills and assets to meet their demands. The pricing in the majority of our purchase contracts contains a
market price component and a deduction to cover the cost of transporting the crude oil and to provide us with a margin.
Contracts sometimes contain a grade differential which considers the composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different
customers. Typically, the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade
differentials. The margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and
to capitalize on grade differentials.
In our petroleum products marketing operations, we supply primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products to
wholesale markets. We also provide a service to refineries by purchasing “heavier” petroleum products that are the residual
fuels from gasoline production, transporting them to one of our terminals and blending them to a quality that meets the
requirements of our customers.
We utilize our fleet of trucks, trailers, railcars, and leased and owned storage capacity to service our crude oil and refining
customers and to store and blend the intermediate and finished refined products.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Segment Margin for our Supply and Logistics Segment decreased by $3.5 million, or 30%, between the two three month
periods.
In the 2016 Quarter, the decrease in our Segment Margin is primarily due to lower demand for our services, relative to the
2015 Quarter, in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and
trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. We have found it difficult to compete with
certain persons in the market who are willing to lose money on such local gathering because they are attempting to
minimize their losses from minimum volume or take-or-pay commitments they previously made in anticipation of new
production that has not yet and is unlikely to come online. In addition, a portion of this decrease can be attributed to
decreased rail volumes as a major refinery customer supported by our Baton Rouge facilities was experiencing a refinery
turnaround during the 2016 Quarter. We anticipate such rail volumes related to our Louisiana facilities to begin ramping
back up starting in the third quarter upon the completion of this turnaround.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Segment Margin for our Supply and Logistics Segment decreased by $2.8 million, or 13%, between the first six months of
2016 and the first six months of 2015.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, the decrease in our Segment Margin is primarily due to lower demand for our
services, relative to the six months ended June 30, 2015, in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing
business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. We
have found it difficult to compete with certain persons in the market who are willing to lose money on such local gathering
because they are attempting to minimize their losses from minimum volume or take-or-pay commitments they previously
made in anticipation of new production that has not yet and is unlikely to come online. This decrease was partially offset by
the improved performance of our now right-sized heavy fuel oil business (after reducing volumes and related infrastructure
to match new market realities resulting from the general lightening of refineries' crude slates which has resulted in a better
supply/demand balance between heavy refined bottoms and domestic coker and asphalt requirements) compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2015.

Net interest expense
Net interest expense increased $17.6 million and $32.8 million between the three and six month periods primarily due to
an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from acquired and constructed assets, primarily related to additional
debt outstanding as a result of financing our Enterprise acquisition. In July 2015, we issued an additional $750 million of
aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes to fund a portion of the purchase price for our Enterprise
acquisition. Capitalized interest costs increased $2 million and $5.2 million over the three and six month periods due to our
growth capital expenditures for projects still under construction when compared to the prior year period.
Income tax expense
A portion of our operations are owned by wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations. As a result,
a substantial portion of the income tax expense we record relates to the operations of those corporations, and will vary
42
Table of Contents
from period to period as a percentage of our income before taxes based on the percentage of our income or loss that is
derived from those corporations. The balance of the income tax expense we record relates to state taxes imposed on our
operations that are treated as income taxes under generally accepted accounting principles and foreign income taxes.
Other
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included an unrealized loss on derivative positions of $1.3 million. Net
income for the same period in 2015 included an unrealized loss on derivative positions of $1.3 million. Net income for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 included an unrealized gain on derivative positions of $0.4 million. Net income for the
same period in 2015 included an unrealized gain on derivative positions of $0.2 million. Those amounts are included in
supply and logistics product costs in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and are not a
component of Segment Margin. The three and six months ended June 30, 2015, also included a loss of
approximately $19.2 million that was recognized in relation to the early retirement of our $350 million, 7.875% senior
unsecured notes in the 2015 Quarter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
As of June 30, 2016, we had $281.9 million of remaining borrowing capacity under our $1.7 billion senior secured
revolving credit facility, $579.9 million after giving pro forma effect to the net proceeds we received from our equity offering
in July 2016, discussed in more detail below. We anticipate that our future internally-generated funds and the funds
available under our credit facility will allow us to meet our ordinary course capital needs. Our primary sources of liquidity
have been cash flows from operations, borrowing availability under our credit facility and the proceeds from issuances of
equity and senior unsecured notes.
Our primary cash requirements consist of:
•working capital, primarily inventories and trade receivables and payables;
•routine operating expenses;
•capital growth and maintenance projects;
•acquisitions of assets or businesses;
•payments related to servicing outstanding debt; and
•quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders.
Capital Resources
Our ability to satisfy future capital needs will depend on our ability to raise substantial amounts of additional capital from
time to time — including through equity and debt offerings (public and private), borrowings under our credit facility and
other financing transactions—and to implement our growth strategy successfully. No assurance can be made that we will
be able to raise additional capital on satisfactory terms or implement our growth strategy successfully.
At June 30, 2016, long-term debt totaled $3.2 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion outstanding under our credit facility
(including $57.8 million borrowed under the inventory sublimit tranche), a $350.0 million carrying amount of senior
unsecured notes due on February 15, 2021, a $400.0 million carrying amount of senior unsecured notes due on May 15,
2023, a $350.0 million carrying amount of senior unsecured notes due on June 15, 2024, and a $750.0 million carrying
amount of senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2022.
In April 2016, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the committed amount under our
revolving credit facility to $1.7 billion (from $1.5 billion), with the ability to increase the committed amount by an additional
$300.0 million, subject to lender consent and (ii) permanently relax the maximum consolidated leverage ratio to 5.5 to 1.0.
On July 27, 2016, we issued 8,000,000 Class A common units in a public offering at a price of $37.90 per unit. We granted
the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,200,000 additional units from us. We received proceeds, net of
underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $298.0 million from that offering. We have used the proceeds to repay a
portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility going
forward with regards to funding the activities of the partnership.
Equity Distribution Program and Shelf Registration Statements
We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, including
those related to opportunistically acquiring assets and businesses and constructing new facilities.
43
Table of Contents
In 2016, we implemented an equity distribution program that will allow us to consummate “at the market” offerings of
common units from time to time through brokered transactions, which should help mitigate certain adverse consequences
of underwritten offerings, including the downward pressure on the market price of our common units and the expensive
fees and other costs associated with such public offerings. We entered into an equity distribution agreement with a group of
banks who will act as sales agents or principals for up to $400.0 million of our common units, if and when we should elect
to issue additional common units from time to time, although there are limits to the amount of our “at the market” offerings
the market can absorb from time to time. In connection with implementing our equity distribution program, we filed a
universal shelf registration statement (our "EDP Shelf") with the SEC. Our EDP Shelf allows us to issue up to $400.0
million of equity and debt securities, whether pursuant to our equity distribution program or otherwise. Our EDP Shelf will
expire in August 2017. We expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement before our EDP Shelf expires.
We have another universal shelf registration statement (our "2015 Shelf") on file with the SEC. Our 2015 Shelf allows us to
issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities in connection with certain types of public offerings. However, the
receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of equity and/or debt securities cannot be assured and may be
negatively impacted by, among other things, our long-term business prospects and other factors beyond our control,
including market conditions. Our 2015 Shelf will expire in April 2018. We expect to file a replacement universal shelf
registration statement before our 2015 Shelf expires.
Cash Flows from Operations
We generally utilize the cash flows we generate from our operations to fund our distributions and working capital needs.
Excess funds that are generated are used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and/or to fund a portion of our capital
expenditures. Our operating cash flows can be impacted by changes in items of working capital, primarily variances in the
carrying amount of inventory and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to capital
expenditures.
We typically sell our crude oil in the same month in which we purchase it, so we do not need to rely on borrowings under
our credit facility to pay for such crude oil purchases, other than inventory. During such periods, our accounts receivable
and accounts payable generally move in tandem, as we make payments and receive payments for the purchase and sale
of crude oil.
In our petroleum products activities, we buy products, and typically either move the products to one of our storage facilities
for further blending or we sell the products within days of our purchase. The cash requirements for these activities can
result in short term increases and decreases in our borrowings under our credit facility.
The storage of crude oil and petroleum products can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities. In
the month we pay for the stored oil or petroleum products, we borrow under our credit facility (or use cash on hand) to pay
for the crude oil or petroleum products, utilizing a portion of our operating cash flows. Conversely, cash flow from operating
activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil or petroleum
products. Additionally, we may be required to deposit margin funds with the NYMEX when commodity prices increase as
the value of the derivatives utilized to hedge the price risk in our inventory fluctuates. These deposits also impact our
operating cash flows as we borrow under our credit facility (or use cash on hand) to fund the deposits.
    See Note 12 in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding changes in
components of operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.
The increase in operating cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was
primarily due to increases in earnings, including net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization. This primarily
results from the contributions of the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets we acquired from Enterprise. This increase was partially
offset by increases in working capital needs. As discussed above, changes in the cash requirements related to payment for
petroleum products or collection of receivables from the sale of inventory impact the cash provided by operating activities.
Additionally, changes in the market prices for crude oil and petroleum products can result in fluctuations in our working
capital and, therefore, our operating cash flows between periods as the cost to acquire a barrel of oil or petroleum products
will require more or less cash. Net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016
were $103.7 million compared to $71.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Capital Expenditures and Distributions Paid to our Unitholders
We use cash primarily for our operating expenses, working capital needs, debt service, acquisition activities, organic
growth projects and distributions we pay to our unitholders. We finance maintenance capital expenditures and smaller
organic growth projects and distributions primarily with cash generated by our operations. We have historically funded
material growth capital projects (including acquisitions and organic growth projects) with borrowings under our credit
facility, equity issuances and/or the issuance of senior unsecured notes.

Expenditures for capital assets to grow the partnership distribution will depend on our access to debt and equity capital.
We will look for opportunities to acquire assets from other parties that meet our criteria for stable cash flows.
Growth Capital Expenditures
We anticipate that approximately $125.0 million will be spent, inclusive of capitalized interest, during the remainder of 2016
for projects currently under construction. The most significant of these projects currently under construction are described
below.
Houston Area Crude Oil Pipeline and Terminal Infrastructure
We are constructing new, and expanding existing, crude oil pipeline and terminal facilities in Webster, Texas and Texas
City, Texas as a result of expanding our crude oil pipeline and terminal infrastructure in the Houston area. We are
constructing a new crude oil pipeline that will deliver crude oil received from upstream crude oil pipelines (including
CHOPS, which delivers crude oil originating in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to the Texas City area) to our new Texas City
Terminal, which will ultimately connect to our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline. Our new Texas
City Terminal will initially include approximately 750,000 barrels of crude oil tankage. Our Webster Terminal is connected
to other crude oil pipelines servicing other Houston area refineries. As a part of this project, we are also making the
necessary upgrades on our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline to reverse the direction of flow. The
result of this expanded crude oil infrastructure will allow additional optionality to Houston and Baytown area refineries,
including the Exxon-Mobil Baytown refinery, its largest refinery in the U.S.A., and provide additional delivery outlets for
other crude oil pipelines. We expect these assets to become operational in the fourth quarter of 2016.
45
Table of Contents
Wyoming Crude Oil Pipeline
In the third quarter of 2015, we completed construction of a new 60 mile crude oil pipeline to transport crude oil from new
receipt point stations in Campbell County and Converse County, Wyoming to our existing Pronghorn Rail Facility.  This
new crude oil pipeline has an initial capacity of approximately 45,000 barrels per day and is supplied by truck volumes and
third party gathering infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. 
We also constructed a new 75 mile pipeline from our Pronghorn Rail Facility to a delivery point at our new Guernsey
Station in Platte County, Wyoming. This Pronghorn to Guernsey pipeline has an initial capacity of approximately 45,000
barrels per day and will allow for connectivity to additional downstream pipeline markets at Guernsey, including regional
refineries and Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express Pipeline.  This pipeline became operational in the first quarter of
2016.
Baton Rouge Terminal
We constructed a new crude oil, intermediates and refined products import/export terminal in Baton Rouge that will be
located near the Port of Greater Baton Rouge and will be pipeline-connected to that port's existing deepwater docks on the
Mississippi River. We constructed approximately 1.1 million barrels of tankage for the storage of crude oil, intermediates
and/or refined products with the capability to expand to provide additional terminaling services to our customers. In
addition, we constructed a new pipeline from the terminal that will allow for deliveries to existing Exxon Mobil facilities in
the area, as well as connect our previously constructed 17 mile line to the terminal allowing for receipts from the Scenic
Station Rail Facility. Shippers to Scenic Station will have access to both the local Baton Rouge refining market, as well as
the ability to access other attractive refining markets via our Baton Rouge Terminal. Our Baton Rouge Terminal and related
facilities are expected to become operational by early fourth quarter of 2016.
Raceland Rail Facility
The Raceland Rail Facility, a new crude oil unit train unloading facility located in Raceland, Louisiana and capable of
unloading up to two unit trains per day, will be connected to existing midstream infrastructure that will provide direct
pipeline access to the Louisiana refining markets. It is expected to be operational by the end of 2016.
Inland Marine Barge Transportation Expansion
We ordered 28 new-build barges and 18 new-build push boats for our inland marine barge transportation fleet. We have
accepted delivery of 15 of those barges and 11 of those push boats through June 30, 2016. We expect to take delivery of
those remaining vessels periodically through 2016 and 2017.
Maintenance Capital Expenditures
Our decrease in maintenance capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to June 30, 2015
primarily relates to our marine segment, where construction of new marine push boats, as completed in 2015, to replace
older boats resulted in higher spending during 2015. See further discussion under "Available Cash before Reserves" for
how such maintenance capital utilization is reflected in our calculation of Available Cash before reserves.
Distributions to Unitholders
On August 12, 2016, we will pay a distribution of $0.69 per common unit totaling $81 million with respect to the 2016
Quarter to common unitholders of record on July 29, 2016. This is the forty-fourth consecutive quarter in which we have
increased our quarterly distribution. Information on our recent distribution history is included in Note 9 to our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non- GAAP Financial Measures
General
    
To evaluate our business, we use the non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure of total
Segment Margin. We also present total Available Cash before Reserves as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our Non-
GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may
include or exclude other specified items. The schedules above provide reconciliations of Available Cash before Reserves
to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America (GAAP). A reconciliation of total Segment Margin to net income is also included in our
segment disclosure in Note 10 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as
being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative
and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves and total Segment Margin measures are just two of the
relevant data points considered from time to time.
When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making
discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team has access to a wide
range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational
information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance, liquidity and
similar measures; income; cash flow; and expectations for us, and certain information regarding some of our peers.
Additionally, our board of directors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time
to time. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by
management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each
individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so
much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user.
Segment Margin
Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of
measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and capital investment. We define Segment Margin
as revenues less product costs, operating expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges, such as depreciation and
amortization), and segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable cash generated by our
equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of our legacy stock appreciation
rights plan and unrealized gains and losses on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Our Segment Margin definition also includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing leases.
A reconciliation of total Segment Margin to net income is included in our segment disclosure in Note 10 to our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Available Cash before Reserves
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Available Cash before Reserves, also referred to as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the
investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial
measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research
analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)the financial performance of our assets;
(2)our operating performance;
(3)
(4)
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to
those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including
interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth capital expenditures,
certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.
(5)
We define Available Cash before Reserves as net income as adjusted for specific items, the most significant of which are
the addition of certain non-cash gains or charges (including depreciation and amortization), the substitution of distributable
48
Table of Contents
cash generated by our equity investees in lieu of our equity income attributable to our equity investees (includes
distributions attributable to the quarter and received during or promptly following such quarter), the elimination of gains and
losses on asset sales (except those from the sale of surplus assets), unrealized gains and losses on derivative transactions
not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, the elimination of expenses related to acquiring or constructing assets
that provide new sources of cash flows and the subtraction of maintenance capital utilized, which is described in detail
below.
Recent Change in Circumstances and Disclosure Format
We have implemented a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because of our expectation that our
future maintenance capital expenditures may change materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and
amount from time to time. We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital
expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context
of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those
users with new information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available
Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance
capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating
expenses and depreciation from period to period.
Maintenance Capital Requirements
MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing
assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance
capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.
Historically, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures have been (a) related to our pipeline assets and
similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash
before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had
very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate
the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those
expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have
been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be
replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically
in the absence of such replacement.
Prospectively, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related
to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c)
potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those future expenditures
will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we
incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable
manner. If we chose not make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically,
although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including
maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be
replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could
continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.
In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the
nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more
detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management’s recently increasing ability to determine if and
when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our
business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our
Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe
are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures,
distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly
discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a new measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we
believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves. Our maintenance capital utilized measure,
which is described in more detail below, constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it
takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation
from period to period.
MAINTENANCE CAPITAL UTILIZED
We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements
measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized
measure as
49
Table of Contents
that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant
quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each
project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components.
Because we have not historically used our maintenance capital utilized measure, our future maintenance capital utilized
calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013.
Further, we do not have the actual comparable calculations for our prior periods, and we may not have the information
necessary to make such calculations for such periods. And, even if we could locate and/or re-create the information
necessary to make such calculations, we believe it would be unduly burdensome to do so in comparison to the benefits
derived.
Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
There have been no material changes to the commitments and obligations reflected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, or financing partnerships, other than as disclosed
under “Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, nor do we have any debt or equity triggers based upon our unit or commodity prices.
Forward Looking Statements
The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical information may be “forward looking
statements” as defined under federal law. All statements, other than historical facts, included in this document that address
activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including things such as
plans for growth of the business, future capital expenditures, competitive strengths, goals, references to future goals or
intentions and other such references are forward-looking statements, and historical performance is not necessarily
indicative of future performance. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“forecast,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “could,” “plan,” “position,” “projection,” “strategy,” “should” or “will,” or the negative of those
terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology. In particular, statements, expressed or implied, concerning
future actions, conditions or events or future operating results or the ability to generate sales, income or cash flow are
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. Future actions, conditions or events and future results of operations may differ materially
from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond
our ability or the ability of our affiliates to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from
those in the forward-looking statements include, among others:
demand for, the supply of, our assumptions about, changes in forecast data for, and price trends related to crude oil, liquid
petroleum, natural gas, NaHS, caustic soda and CO2, all of which may be affected by economic activity, capital
expenditures by energy producers, weather, alternative energy sources, international events, conservation and
technological advances;
•throughput levels and rates;
•changes in, or challenges to, our tariff rates;
our ability to successfully identify and close strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms (including obtaining third-party
consents and waivers of preferential rights), develop or construct energy infrastructure assets, make cost saving changes
in operations and integrate acquired assets or businesses into our existing operations, including the assets we acquired in
the Enterprise acquisition;
•service interruptions in our pipeline transportation systems and processing operations;
shutdowns or cutbacks at refineries, petrochemical plants, utilities or other businesses for which we transport crude oil,
petroleum, natural gas or other products or to whom we sell such products;
•risks inherent in marine transportation and vessel operation, including accidents and discharge of pollutants;
changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject, including tax withholding issues, regulations regarding
qualifying income, accounting pronouncements, and safety, environmental and employment laws and regulations;

our inability to borrow or otherwise access funds needed for operations, expansions or capital expenditures as a result of
our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our notes, which contain various affirmative and negative
covenants;
•loss of key personnel;
cash from operations that we generate could decrease or fail to meet expectations, either of which could reduce our ability
to pay quarterly cash distributions at the current level or continue to increase quarterly cash distributions in the future;
•an increase in the competition that our operations encounter;

•natural disasters, accidents or terrorism;
•changes in the financial condition of customers or counterparties;
•adverse rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or tax matters;
the treatment of us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if we become subject to entity-level taxation for
state tax purposes; and
the potential that our internal controls may not be adequate, weaknesses may be discovered or remediation of any
identified weaknesses may not be successful and the impact these could have on our unit price.
You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. When considering forward-looking statements,
please review the risk factors described under “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. These risks may also be specifically described in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K and Form 8-K/A and other documents that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Except
as required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend to update these forward-looking statements and information.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The following should be read in conjunction with Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included
under Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material
changes that would affect the quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided therein. Also, see Note 13 to our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion related to derivative instruments and hedging
activities.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, with the participation of our management, have evaluated our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is accumulated and communicated to them and our management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.
There were no changes during the second quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
