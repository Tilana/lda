<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 28 and 29 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, Ms. Gabriela Knaul, held a consultation on the independence of the 
judiciary in the seven countries of Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama). The first day was devoted to a meeting of 
experts, and the second day to a meeting with representatives of the Governments of Belize, 
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. 
</p>
<p>2.  The consultation brought together 22 participants from the judicial service, 
academics, civil society, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the 
OHCHR Regional Office to discuss current challenges to the independent action of the 
judiciary, such as procedures for the selection, appointment or election of magistrates and 
judges in the region. Procedures used in each country were explained and challenges and 
good practices identified. 
</p>
<p>3.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s initiative was well received by the participants, who 
termed it necessary and appropriate, since comparative regional studies on the subject are 
rare. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Governments concerned for their extensive 
cooperation, the experts for the information provided and the OHCHR Regional Office for 
its assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b>5. In the exercise of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that the 
separation of powers and the rule of law not only constitute the pillars of democracy but 
also open the way to an administration of justice that provides guarantees of independence, 
impartiality and transparency.1 A number of international instruments establish the 
independence of the judiciary as an essential guarantee of a proper system of justice, for 
example article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 8 of the American Convention 
on Human Rights and the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary. General 
comment No. 32 (2007) on the right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial 
states that &#8220;[t]he right to equality before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial is a key 
element of human rights protection and serves as a procedural means to safeguard the rule 
of law&#8221;.2 Thus, the United Nations has recognized that an independent judiciary is 
&#8220;essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable 
to the processes of democracy and sustainable development&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>6. One of the challenges facing States is precisely the achievement or consolidation of 
the independence of the judiciary. Central America must cope with a number of risks and 
threats that transcend the local level,4 and the judicial authorities face many challenges

 In this region, risks and threats to security have become transnational, simultaneously affecting more 
</p>
<p>than one State. Such risks include drug trafficking, the phenomenon of youth gangs, trafficking in 
persons and arms trafficking. </p>

</b></p>
<p>which call for a strengthening of the administration of justice and its independence in order 
to put an end to impunity. A judiciary with independent magistrates and judges determined 
to respect human rights and promote the rule of law is indispensable in that regard. 
</p>
<p>7. Pursuant to the Basic Principles, procedures for the selection, appointment or 
election of magistrates and judges must be based on integrity and ability and must 
safeguard against &#8220;judicial appointments for improper motives&#8221;.5 Accordingly, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterated the importance of establishing and applying objective and transparent 
selection and appointment criteria based on merit.6 
</p>
<p>8. The objective of the subregional consultation was to discuss the current situation 
regarding the independence of the judiciary in Central America and, in particular, to 
promote a forum for the exchange of experiences so as to identify the biggest challenges as 
well as good practices which might be shared by States and applied in accordance with the 
situation in each country. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Institutional and legal framework of the Central American 
States 
</b>9. The Constitutions of the seven countries of the Central American region provide for 
the independence of judges and magistrates in the exercise of their functions. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Belize 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Constitution establishes the following judicial structure: the Supreme Court, 
Court of Appeal and first instance courts (summary jurisdiction courts and district courts). 
The decisions of the Court of Appeal can be overturned by the Caribbean Court of Justice, 
because Belize is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The Caribbean 
Court of Justice replaces the role of the court of last resort played by the Privy Council, 
which is the appeals body for most members of the Commonwealth. The criminal justice 
system is based on the principles of common law. 
</p>
<p>11. Criteria for selection as justice of the Supreme Court are as follows: candidates must 
have at least five years&#8217; experience practising as an attorney-at-law in a Belize court or as 
an advocate in a Commonwealth court with unlimited jurisdiction for civil or criminal cases 
or matters. They are appointed by the Governor-General, acting in conformity with the 
recommendations of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission and with the consent of 
the Prime Minister, following consultations with the leader of the opposition. They remain 
in office until the age of 65 and may be removed solely for reasons of physical or mental 
illness or for misconduct. The power to remove Supreme Court justices ultimately falls 
within the competence of the Governor-General. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the Governor-General with 
the consent of the Prime Minister following consultations with the leader of the opposition. 
</p>
<p>13. The criteria for the selection of judges of the Court of Appeal are as follows: 
candidates must hold the post of judge on a Commonwealth court with unlimited 
jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters or on any court with appellate jurisdiction; and 
they must have held a licence to practise as an attorney-at-law or advocate or in a 
Commonwealth court for at least 15 years. They are appointed by the Governor-General, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 Principle 10.

<p>6
 A/HRC/11/41, paras. 30, 31 and 97; A/HRC/17/30/Add.3, para. 23. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.13-12614 
</p>
<p>acting with the consent of the Prime Minister and following consultations with the leader of 
the opposition, for a term of office to be specified in the letter of appointment. The 
procedures for removal are identical to those for Supreme Court justices. Participants in the 
regional consultation were of the view that short terms of office and re-election processes 
make magistrates vulnerable to political interference. 
</p>
<p>14. The criteria for the selection of judges of first instance courts, which are set out in 
the Constitution and regulated in the Belize Legislation Acts, require that candidates have a 
minimum of three years&#8217; experience as attorney-at-law. The judges are appointed by the 
Judicial and Legal Services Commission. The Constitution guarantees tenure for judges; 
however, they may be removed by the Commission for inability to discharge their duties for 
reasons of physical or mental illness or for misconduct. 
</p>
<p>15. There is also a separate procedure for appointing judges of the Caribbean Court of 
Justice, which was established in 2001 under the agreement signed by the Member States of 
CARICOM. The criteria for the selection of judges of the Caribbean Court of Justice are as 
follows: candidates must have knowledge of international law, including international trade 
law, and a minimum of five years&#8217; experience as judge on a court with unlimited 
jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters in the territory of a contracting party or the 
Commonwealth, or at least 15 years&#8217; experience teaching law in a Member State of 
CARICOM or the Commonwealth. They must be persons of high moral character, 
intellectual and analytical ability, sound judgement and integrity and must have an 
understanding of people and society. The judges are appointed through a complex process 
in which the Chief Justice of the Court is appointed and removed by a three-quarters vote of 
the Member States of the Court on the recommendation of the Regional Judicial and Legal 
Services Commission. The other judges are elected by a majority vote in the Regional 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>16. There is another process for members of the Privy Council. Through its Judicial 
Committee, the Council exercises the function of court of last resort for those countries of 
the Commonwealth which continue to maintain this system in force. In Belize, apart from 
cases pending before the Council, this function has been transferred to the Caribbean Court 
of Justice. The Privy Council is composed primarily of members of the House of Lords. 
</p>
<p>17. Despite the existence of these provisions, during the consultation it was emphasized 
that to achieve the independence of the judiciary, magistrates and judges must be separate 
and independent of other State bodies. Given that the budget elaborated by the judiciary 
must then be approved by the National Assembly, the financial independence of the 
judiciary must be further strengthened. 
</p><p>18. The participants also stressed that judges should be appointed by their peers with the 
participation of civil society, because the selection and appointment process in Belize does 
not make provision for public hearings. 
</p>
<p>19. It was also pointed out that the biggest problem facing the country was not so much 
the selection procedure, but rather the poor training of aspirant judges and magistrates. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Costa Rica 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Constitution establishes the following judicial structure: the Supreme Court and 
the lower courts (small claims, minor offences and summary proceedings courts and 
tribunals; first instance and penal courts; collegiate courts; and courts of cassation), with 
distinct selection and appointment procedures. 
</p>
<p>21. The criteria for the selection of Supreme Court justices are as follows: candidates 
must be Costa Rican by birth, or through naturalization with a domicile in the country for at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12614 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>least 10 years since obtaining the naturalization document (the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court must be Costa Rican by birth); they must be citizens with all civil rights; they must 
have lay status; they must be at least 35 years old; and they must hold a law degree issued 
or legally recognized in Costa Rica and must have at least 10 years&#8217; experience practising 
law, except for judicial officials, who must have at least five years&#8217; experience in the field. 
</p><p>22. Supreme Court justices are elected for a term of eight years by a two-thirds majority 
vote of the members of the Legislative Assembly. In the exercise of their functions, they 
must work efficiently, and they are considered to be re-elected for an identical term unless 
otherwise decided in a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the Legislative 
Assembly. The Supreme Court appoints a Chief Justice from among its members. 
</p>
<p>23. Supreme Court justices may not be suspended except by means of a declaration of 
grounds for legal action or for reasons set out in articles 191 and 192 of the Act on the 
Organization of the Judiciary. The Legislative Assembly is empowered to decide whether 
or not to revoke an appointment, and it is for the Supreme Court, meeting in plenary 
session, to decree a suspension by means of a two-thirds majority vote of its members. 
</p><p>24. The criteria for the selection and appointment of judges of the lower courts are 
regulated by the Judicial Service Act, the Internal Regulations of the Judicial Service and 
the Act on the Organization of the Judiciary; they vary as a function of duties and post, but 
generally speaking they are as follows: candidates must be Costa Rican; they must be 
citizens with all civil rights; they must be licensed to practise law; and they must be 
members of the Bar Association of Costa Rica. The procedure is conducted by the Council 
of the Judiciary, and candidates are examined and evaluated on the basis of their experience 
and seniority in office, performance, proven ability and quality of service in previous 
positions held, as well as training and specialized courses taken of relevance to the post, 
duration of academic teaching and publications of research or works of general interest. 
Interviews and examinations are held that focus on the candidates&#8217; personality, knowledge 
of the particular field and judicial techniques of relevance to the post to which they aspire. 
Any medical and psychological tests deemed appropriate may also be ordered. 
</p>
<p>25. The Council of the Judiciary sends lists of three candidates to the Supreme Court or 
the High Council of the Judiciary, as appropriate, which are responsible for carrying out 
and approving the respective appointments. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of participants expressed concern about the weakness of practice in the 
selection and appointment procedures. Although the Council of the Judiciary is responsible 
for supervising the procedure for the selection of judges and for regulating appointments, 
transfers and promotions, it does not have decision-making power. The Council is part of 
the Selection Board that evaluates the candidates. However, the process for examining 
candidates has serious defects. For example, there are no objective criteria for determining 
the final score in the examination, nor is it possible to contest the final score. Another major 
limitation is the lack of a gender perspective in the reports, since greater importance is 
attached to postgraduate work, teaching and publications. 
</p>
<p>27. Another difficulty in the judicial service is the composition of the Council of the 
Judiciary, which is made up of one magistrate (who chairs it), one person from the High 
Council of the Judiciary, one person from the Governing Council of the Judicial Training 
School and two higher-court judges. The presence of only two judges on the Council 
undermines the institution, because the other members are directly or indirectly subordinate 
to the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>28. One element that affects the independence of the judiciary is related to the system of 
sanctions. Article 199 of the Act on the Organization of the Judiciary includes a criterion 
pursuant to which the Supreme Court, meeting in plenary session, is empowered to sanction </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.13-12614 
</p>
<p>a judge. This has a direct impact on judges&#8217; discretionary power, within the framework of 
the law, to rule on matters within their competence. 
</p>
<p>29. Another serious problem to which reference was made was the existence of alternate 
judges in the Supreme Court, because they may be practising lawyers and thus are subject 
to interference, including of a political nature. 
</p>
<p><b> C. El Salvador 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Constitution establishes that the judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court 
and the lower courts (courts of appeal, courts of first instance and magistrates&#8217; courts), with 
distinct selection and appointment procedures. 
</p>
<p>31. The Constitution enumerates the following criteria for the selection of Supreme 
Court justices: candidates must be Salvadoran by birth; they must have lay status; they must 
be of recognized standing and competence; they must be citizens with all civil rights; they 
must be at least 40 years old; they must be licensed to practise law in El Salvador; and they 
must have at least six years&#8217; experience in a Court of Appeal or nine years&#8217; experience in a 
court of first instance or have obtained a licence to practise law at least 10 years prior to 
election. 
</p>
<p>32. The selection of justices of the Supreme Court is a two-step process. The National 
Council of the Judiciary submits a list of candidates to the Legislative Assembly. The list is 
provided by the Federation of Lawyers&#8217; Associations of El Salvador (FEDAES), which 
selects its candidates through elections, and by the National Council of the Judiciary, which 
chooses from among lawyers who have submitted their candidacy to it. The Legislative 
Assembly appoints them in a public roll-call vote. Supreme Court justices are elected for a 
term of nine years and may be re-elected. One third of the bench is re-elected every three 
years. Judges may be removed by the Assembly for reasons established by law. Election 
and removal both require a two-thirds majority vote of the elected deputies. 
</p><p>33. Criteria for admission to the judicial service in all courts of lower instances are as 
follows: candidates must be Salvadoran; they must have lay status; they must be licensed to 
practise law in El Salvador; they must be of recognized standing and competence; and they 
must be citizens with all civil rights. The criteria of age and duration of prior experience as 
judge or lawyer vary. To become a judge in a Court of Appeal, candidates must be older 
than 35 and must have served at least six years in a court of first instance or have obtained a 
licence to practise law at least eight years prior to the election. To become a judge of first 
instance, candidates must have served as a judge in a magistrates&#8217; court for at least one year 
or have obtained a licence to practise law at least two years prior to their appointment. To 
become a judge in a magistrate&#8217;s court, candidates must be older than 21. In exceptional 
cases, the National Council of the Judiciary may propose persons who are not lawyers for a 
term of one year. 
</p>
<p>34. The list of potential candidates must also include experience in legal matters and 
professional merits; training completed and marks obtained; posts held in State institutions, 
with dates and duration; research published and teaching experience; and the status or result 
of complaints and accusations submitted to and dealt with by the authorities over the past 
five years. 
</p>
<p>35. The procedure for the selection of judges and magistrates of the lower courts is 
conducted by the National Council for the Judiciary, which draws up and submits lists of 
three candidates to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court then makes the appointment. 
The technical selection procedures, which involve competitive examinations, in some cases 
in conjunction with the Judicial Training School, are carried out by the Council and must </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12614 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>guarantee objectivity, equality of opportunity for candidates and the suitability of persons 
selected. 
</p>
<p>36. The participants referred to a number of obstacles to procedures for the selection and 
appointment of judges and magistrates in the country. One was the lack of representativity 
of the Federation of Lawyers&#8217; Associations of El Salvador in organizing the preselection of 
candidates for the post of Supreme Court justice. The Federation has not been impartial and 
transparent. Moreover, the National Council of the Judiciary does not have clear criteria 
and requirements for the preselection of candidates for posts of magistrates and judges. It 
was stressed that, although good appointments had been made of independent magistrates 
and judges who are not vulnerable to the wishes of political parties, what ultimately 
prevails is cronyism, political expediency and a distribution of posts on the basis of party 
quotas. 
</p>
<p>37. The participants recommended that a specific legal mechanism should be defined in 
the short term for each step of the selection process, with precise, motivated selection 
criteria and on the basis of the profile of the civil servant sought, and that transparent 
selection processes with public participation should be introduced. Concerning the selection 
of judges, they also recommended a return to the system of prior training, such as the Initial 
Training Programme, which guaranteed selection in accordance with the criteria of 
objectivity and merit. 
</p><p>38. In the medium term, it was recommended that administrative and jurisdictional 
functions should be separated at the various levels of the judiciary, in particular the 
Supreme Court, and that a body should be established, without political partisanship, to 
serve as a nominations committee for all second-tier elected officials. 
</p>
<p>39. The participants also referred to a number of serious internal threats to the 
independence of judges, such as article 55 of the Judicial Service Act, on removal from 
office, and to external threats, such as the influence of the media and organized crime in 
judicial bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Constitution establishes the following judicial structure: the Supreme Court, the 
Court of Appeal and other collegiate courts, and the lower courts (courts of first instance 
and magistrates&#8217; courts), with distinct selection and appointment procedures. 
</p><p>41. The criteria for all magistrates and judges are as follows: candidates must be 
Guatemalan by birth; they must be of recognized standing; and they must be citizens with 
all civil rights and must be licensed to practise law, apart from the exceptions established 
by law with regard to the latter requirement for certain judges of private jurisdictions and 
juvenile courts. The following additional criteria apply for Supreme Court justices: 
candidates must be older than 40, and they must have served for a full term as magistrate in 
the Court of Appeal or a collegiate court or have practised law for more than 10 years. The 
Act on Nominations Committees also establishes other more specific requirements for the 
candidate selection process. The Committee publishes a vacancy announcement and uses a 
point system of 1 to 100 to score candidates, numerically quantifying ethical, academic, 
professional and personal merits for the elaboration of lists of names for submission to 
Congress. 
</p>
<p>42. Supreme Court justices are elected by Congress for a period of five years from a list 
of 26 candidates submitted by a Nominations Committee composed of a representative of 
the rectors of Guatemala&#8217;s universities, who chairs the Committee, the deans of the law 
school or legal and social sciences faculty of each university in the country, an equal 
number of representatives elected by the General Assembly of the Bar and Notaries </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.13-12614 
</p>
<p>Association of Guatemala and an equal number of representatives elected by the 
magistrates of the Court of Appeal and other tribunals. The election of candidates requires a 
two-thirds majority vote of the members of the Nominations Committee. The members of 
the Supreme Court elect a Chief Justice by a two-thirds majority for a term of one year; the 
Chief Justice may not be re-elected during that session of the Court. 
</p>
<p>43. In addition to the above-mentioned criteria, the requirements for magistrates of the 
Court of Appeal and the collegiate tribunals are as follows: candidates must be older than 
35 and must have been a judge in a court of first instance or have practised law for more 
than five years. 
</p>
<p>44. The magistrates of the Court of Appeal are elected by Congress from a list 
containing the names of twice the number of persons to be elected, which is submitted by a 
Nominations Committee composed of a representative of the rectors of Guatemala&#8217;s 
universities, who chairs the Committee, the deans of the law school or legal and social 
sciences faculty of each university in the country, an equal number of representatives 
elected by the General Assembly of the Bar and Notaries Association of Guatemala and an 
equal number of representatives elected by the magistrates of the Court of Appeal and other 
tribunals. The election of candidates requires a two-thirds majority vote of the members of 
the Nominations Committee. 
</p>
<p>45. The criteria for the selection of judges of the lower courts, which are established by 
the Constitution and the Act on Nominations Committees, are as follows: candidates must 
be Guatemalan by birth; they must be of recognized standing; and they must be citizens 
with all civil rights and must be licensed to practise law. The procedure for the selection of 
judges is carried out by Nominations Committees, and the list of candidates is submitted to 
the Supreme Court, which appoints them. 
</p>
<p>46. The participants stressed that the establishment of Nominations Committees for the 
purpose of reducing the decision-making power of Congress and minimizing the political 
nature of the process has strengthened the judicial system. According to the participants, the 
system has worked relatively well. However, problems persist, such as the lack of an 
effective judicial service and pressure exerted by politicians to elect candidates who will be 
favourably disposed towards them. In addition to political parties, business groups, gangs 
and organized crime also try to influence the members of the Nominations Committees and 
the Bar and Notaries Association. The participants suggested that the criteria for the 
selection of the members of the Nominations Committees should be reconsidered and the 
size of membership reduced. 
</p>
<p>47. With regard to budgetary independence, although the Constitution establishes that 
the Supreme Court is empowered to draft its budget (and for that purpose it is assigned at 
least two per cent of State revenue), the participants pointed out that allocations from the 
Ministry of Finance are on a quarterly basis and that there are considerable delays, thus 
hindering a fair, independent and impartial administration of justice. 
</p><p>48. Participants also referred to a bill to amend the Constitution (&#8220;Reformas a la 
Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de la Rep&#250;blica de Guatemala&#8221;) which would strengthen the judicial 
service and the independence of the judiciary, but they noted that its adoption has been 
delayed until mid-2013. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Constitution establishes the following judicial structure: the Supreme Court, 
Courts of Appeal and lower courts (civil courts and magistrates&#8217; courts), with distinct 
selection and appointment procedures. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12614 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>50. The criteria for the selection of Supreme Court justices are as follows: candidates 
must be Honduran by birth; they must be citizens with all civil rights; they must be licensed 
lawyers; they must be at least 35 years of age; and they must have at least five years&#8217; 
experience as a judge or ten years&#8217; experience as a lawyer. 
</p><p>51. The procedure for the selection and appointment of Supreme Court justices is 
conducted by the National Congress. Justices are elected from a list of candidates submitted 
by a Nominations Committee composed of a representative of the Supreme Court (elected 
by a two-thirds majority of the judges); a representative of the Bar Association (elected by 
the Bar Association Assembly); a representative of the Office of the National 
Commissioner for Human Rights; a representative of the Honduran Council of Private 
Enterprise (elected by the Assembly of the Council); a representative of law school 
professors (recommended by the National Autonomous University of Honduras); a 
representative elected by civil society organizations; and a representative of the country&#8217;s 
trade union confederations. 
</p>
<p>52. Election is by a two-thirds majority vote of all members of the National Congress, 
based on a list of no fewer than three candidates for each vacancy. In the event that there is 
no qualified majority for the election of the full list of judges, a direct secret vote is held to 
elect the remaining judges individually; the vote is repeated as many times as necessary 
until the two-thirds majority is attained. 
</p><p>53. For the election of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the judges, meeting in 
plenary session, nominate one of their members by means of a two-thirds majority vote; the 
nominee&#8217;s name is then submitted to Congress, whose approval of the nomination is 
likewise based on a two-thirds majority vote of all its members. 
54. The criteria for the selection of magistrates of the Courts of Appeal and the lower 
courts and tribunals are set out in the Act on the Council of the Judiciary and the Judicial 
Service. The criteria for these categories are as follows: candidates must be Honduran; they 
must be practising lawyers; they must not fall under any of the cases under article 30 (such 
as being physically or mentally disabled or having been suspended or disqualified from 
holding public office), and they must be of recognized standing. To become a judge in a 
magistrates&#8217; court, candidates must be older than 21. To become a judge in a civil court, 
candidates must be older than 25 and must have at least five years&#8217; professional experience 
in any area of law or in the service of a court. To become a judge of a Court of Appeal, 
candidates must be older than 35, must have more than five years&#8217; experience in the judicial 
service and must not be a representative of a religious denomination at any level. 
</p>
<p>55. The procedure for the appointment of magistrates and judges specifies that the 
Supreme Court is empowered to appoint and remove them upon recommendation by the 
Council of the Judiciary. The Act on the Council of the Judiciary and the Judicial Service 
also sets out the various stages of the Council&#8217;s selection process, such as the establishment 
of a Selection Board to analyse candidates&#8217; academic records, psychometric tests, 
theoretical and practical knowledge, and labour-related and socioeconomic research. 
</p>
<p>56. During the consultation, the participants said that significant progress had been 
made with the new Act on the Council of the Judiciary and the Judicial Service. The Act 
separates the jurisdictional functions of the Supreme Court from its administrative 
functions, which are transferred to the Council. However, the participants stressed that the 
members of the Council are still not elected or appointed by the National Congress and that 
the Council is still not in operation. Moreover, the Act contains a number of shortcomings, 
such as its provisions on disciplinary measures and the fact that it designates the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court as chair of the Council. The participants stressed that in 
reality, the situation is characterized by the lack of a real judicial service, that competitive 
examinations are the exception, that promotions are not regulated, that interim or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.13-12614 
</p>
<p>transitional appointments become permanent and that in many cases cronyism and political 
recommendations prevail. 
</p>
<p> 57. The participants suggested that clear parameters should be used to evaluate 
candidates objectively in order to try to eliminate subjectivity and to guarantee equal terms 
for candidates, establishing a greater opening for persons of African origin and other 
minorities, as well as to eliminate discriminatory wording in some legislation, such as the 
notion of &#8220;moral&#8221;, because they exclude persons from competing. In this regard, initiatives 
have been undertaken to eliminate political influence and ensure that elections are based on 
merit, for example the bill on public hearings for the appointment of high State officials 
(which has yet to be adopted). 
</p><p>58. Another serious concern raised by the participants was the budgetary dependence of 
the judiciary. The Constitution guarantees that the judiciary has complete administrative 
and financial autonomy because it is allocated three per cent of current revenue by the 
executive branch, paid in advance on a quarterly basis. However, reductions and delays in 
budgetary payments to the judiciary are frequent, which hinders a proper administration of 
justice. 
59. Reference was also made to the serious imbalance between State powers, and above 
all the concentration of powers in Congress. Although the Constitution establishes that the 
Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution, Congress has passed legislation 
assigning itself that role, in violation of rulings by the Supreme Court&#8217;s Constitutional 
Chamber. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Nicaragua 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Constitution establishes the following judicial structure: the Supreme Court, 
Courts of Appeal and lower courts (district and local courts), with distinct selection and 
appointment procedures. 
</p>
<p>61. The criteria for the selection of Supreme Court justices are as follows: candidates 
must be Nicaraguan &#8211; persons who have acquired another nationality must have renounced 
it at least four years prior to the date of the election; they must be lawyers of recognized 
standing; they must have held the office of judge or practised law for at least 10 years or 
have been a judge of a Court of Appeal for at least five years before becoming a Supreme 
Court justice; they must be citizens with all civil and political rights; they must be at least 
35 years of age and no older than 75 on the day of the election; they must not have been 
suspended from the profession of lawyer or notary through a final court decision; they must 
not be in active military service and, if they were in the past, they must have left military 
service at least 12 months prior to the election; and they must have lived in the country 
continuously for four years prior to the date of the election, unless during that period they 
were on diplomatic mission, were working for international organizations or were studying 
abroad. 
</p>
<p>62. The procedures for the selection and appointment of Supreme Court justices are 
conducted by the National Assembly, which is empowered to elect them from lists 
proposed separately for each post by the President of Nicaragua and by members of the 
Assembly in consultation with the relevant civil associations. The lists must be submitted 
within 15 days from the date of the convocation of the Assembly for the election. If the 
President does not submit lists, the proposals made by the members of the Assembly 
suffice. 
</p>
<p>63. Judges are elected by a vote of at least 60 per cent of the members of the National 
Assembly. The Supreme Court&#8217;s Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice are elected from 
among the Court&#8217;s members by a majority vote for a term of one year; Chief Justices may </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12614 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>be re-elected. The term of office of Supreme Court justices is five years; they enjoy 
immunity and may be removed from office solely for reasons set out in the Constitution and 
the law. 
</p>
<p>64. The criteria for the selection of judges of the Courts of Appeal are the same as those 
for Supreme Court justices. In addition, the Act on the Organization of the Judiciary makes 
provision for the following criteria for becoming a district or local judge: candidates must 
be Nicaraguan; they must be citizens with all civil and political rights; they must be lawyers 
of recognized standing; they must not have been suspended from the profession of lawyer 
or notary by a final judicial decision; they must not be in active military service and, if they 
were in the past, they must have left military service at least 12 months prior to their 
election; and they must not be the subject of any legally established incompatibility. To 
become a judge of a district court, candidates must be at least 25 years of age; they must 
have held the post of judge of a local court for more than two years or court secretary for 
more than three years or have practised law or taught law at a university for at least three 
years. To become a judge of a local court, candidates must be at least 21 years of age. 
</p><p>65. The process for the selection and appointment of the various categories of judges 
and magistrates was established under the Act on the Judicial Service, which specifies that 
the National Council of the Administration and the Judicial Service of the Supreme Court 
conducts examinations for recruitment by the judicial service and submits lists of three 
candidates to the Supreme Court in plenary session. The Act sets out the steps involved for 
recruitment by the judicial service, including a merit-based selection process and a 
competitive examination for admission to an entry-level course on theory and practice. An 
assessment of a candidate&#8217;s merits accounts for 40 per cent and the results of the 
examination for the specific post for 60 per cent of the overall score. The scoring of the 
candidate&#8217;s merits is based on specialization, postgraduate work, years of public service 
and experience in a professional capacity, as well as publications of books and articles. The 
Supreme Court is empowered to appoint and dismiss judges through a three-quarters vote 
of its members. 
</p>
<p>66. During the consultation, the participants drew attention to the current serious 
situation in the country. They stressed that appointments of Supreme Court justices are 
heavily influenced by politics, above all in the current context, in which the party of the 
Government has a majority to reform the Constitution and appoint State officials without 
requiring consultations with, or the approval or support of, other political groups in the 
National Assembly. They also pointed out that, despite the passage of the Judicial Service 
Act and recent international cooperation facilitating the selection of family judges through 
open competitive examinations and training, the National Council of the Administration 
and the Judicial Service does not comply with selection and election procedures in 
competitive examinations. For example, it failed to set up a board to score theoretical and 
practical tests, which are the ultimate phase of the selection process. 
</p>
<p>67. The participants also stated that the Judicial Service Act is not applicable to tenure 
of office. The Act provides that judicial officials enjoy security of employment as a 
guarantee of their independence and that they may only be suspended or removed from 
office for reasons set out in the Act. However, article 37, paragraph 2, of the Act, on 
security of employment of such persons, opens a gap in this rule when it states that 
exceptionally, and for a limited period, provision may be made for the promotion or 
transfer of a judicial official due to the needs of the service or changes in the judicial 
organization; that, for the same reasons, to strengthen a judicial body, an agreement to that 
effect must indicate the reason and duration; and that at the completion of the time period, 
the person concerned must return to his or her post. The article does not make provision for 
or take into consideration the consent of the judge or magistrate to transfer or promotion; 
thus, the decision is taken on the basis of the interests of the institution. The participants </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.13-12614 
</p>
<p>also underscored that the system for removal from office does not contain sufficient 
guarantees of impartiality. 
</p>
<p>68. According to the participants, the expiry of term of office of many State posts, 
including in the judiciary, also poses a serious problem. For example, Supreme Court 
justices remain at their posts upon the completion of their term of office, because there is no 
political will to initiate a selection and appointment process. In fact, the possibility of 
making changes was considered impossible. In July 2013, the term of office of all Supreme 
Court justices will expire, and the National Assembly will have to elect the entire bench. 
</p><p>69. The participants also referred to a number of positive points, such as the Strategic 
Plan of the Judiciary 2012&#8211;2021, whose primary objective is to guarantee the impartiality 
and implementation of the Code of Ethics in order to promote the independence of judges, 
magistrates and other civil servants. They noted that, starting in January 2013, there will be 
a performance appraisal of all civil servants in the judicial service, including judges and 
magistrates. Its purpose is to establish a ranking within the judicial service so as to be able 
to select persons for promotion and implement a selection system based on a competitive 
examination, beginning with magistrates&#8217; courts. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Panama 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Constitution establishes the following judicial structure: the Supreme Court and 
the lower courts (higher courts of justice, judicial district courts, circuit and municipal 
courts, juvenile, maritime and industrial relations courts), with distinct selection and 
appointment procedures. 
</p>
<p>71. The criteria for the selection of judges of the Supreme Court are as follows: 
candidates must be Panamanian by birth; they must be at least 35 years of age; they must be 
citizens with all civil and political rights; they must be graduates of a law school and must 
have registered their university degree with the office prescribed by law; they must have 10 
years&#8217; experience either as a lawyer, at a post in the judiciary or an electoral body requiring 
a university degree in law, or as a law professor at a university. 
</p>
<p>72. Supreme Court justices are appointed through agreements with the Council of the 
Executive Cabinet, subject to approval by the legislature, for a term of 10 years. 
Appointments are staggered: two judges are appointed every two years, except in cases in 
which more or fewer judges are appointed as a function of total Supreme Court 
membership. 
</p>
<p>73. The criteria for the selection of magistrates and judges of the lower courts are 
established by the Judicial Code and are as follows: candidates must be Panamanian; they 
must be citizens with all civil and political rights; and they must be graduates of a law 
school and must have registered their degree with the Ministry of Education or with the 
office prescribed by law. To become a judge of a higher court of justice, candidates must be 
at least 30 years old; they must have at least five years&#8217; experience as a lawyer, a judge of a 
circuit court, a prosecutor of a circuit court or higher court, Secretary-General of the 
Supreme Court or any of its chambers, at a post in the prosecutor-general&#8217;s office or in the 
administration, in a higher district court or in a higher industrial relations court; or they 
must have taught law at a Panamanian university or any other State-certified university for 
the same length of time. Candidates are also deemed suitable for the post if they have been 
licensed to practise throughout the country and have held a post as judge on the Supreme 
Court or high courts of justice, prosecutor in a judicial district, or judge or prosecutor on a 
circuit court for at least four years, provided that the other requirements are met. To become 
a judge on a circuit court, candidates must be at least 30 years of age; they must have a 
licence to practise law issued by the Supreme Court; and they must have at least three </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12614 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>years&#8217; experience as a lawyer or have held, for the same length of time, a public office for 
which a law degree and a licence to practise law are required. To become a municipal 
judge, they must meet the same requirements as those for becoming a judge on a circuit 
court and must be at least 25 years of age. 
</p>
<p>74. In the tribunals and courts specified by law, magistrates are appointed by the 
Supreme Court in plenary session, and judges by their hierarchical superior. All such 
appointments are made in accordance with the judicial service. There is no act specifically 
regulating the judicial service. Instead, article 305 of the Constitution is applied, which 
institutes the judicial career and establishes a list of eight public service careers which 
expressly states that those careers must function in accordance with the merit system. The 
regulation of judicial careers is set out in the Judicial Code and in Supreme Court decision 
No. 46 of 27 September 1991, which stipulates that the Staff Committee and the 
Department of Personnel of the Judiciary, in coordination with the corresponding office 
heads, determine the types of theoretical and practical tests or examinations for each post. 
The appraisal and selection process also takes into consideration academic qualifications, 
working experience, publications, languages, probationary periods etc. 
</p>
<p>75. During the consultation, the participants stated that although a process for the 
selection and appointment of judges and magistrates exists, including for Supreme Court 
justices, there is no guarantee that selection is based on merit, abilities, academic training 
and vocation. The selection gives priority to persons close to or enjoying the confidence of 
the nominating body. Selected candidates often owe &#8220;the favour&#8221; of the appointment to 
those who elect them and therefore do not &#8220;dare disobey&#8221; them. The system, which 
functions without public participation, is therefore subject to abuse of power by higher 
judicial authorities and to the will of the President of Panama. 
</p><p>76. Thus, although the Constitution stipulates that magistrates and judges are 
independent in the performance of their duties, the lower courts are bound by rulings issued 
by higher courts which revoke or alter their judgements upon appeal. Hence the risk that the 
lower courts might act to anticipate judgements sought by the higher courts. 
77. The participants also noted that in 2005, the process for accreditation in the judicial 
service was suspended because of agreements under the State Covenant for Justice to 
introduce a more modern system which guarantees selection based on merit and 
achievement. According to the participants, three years ago all vacant posts were opened to 
a competitive examination, but only in very few cases have decisions been taken on that 
basis. However, there are also positive developments, such as the recent adoption by the 
National Assembly on first reading of a bill on the judicial service and an ethical and 
disciplinary system for the judiciary which would establish a governing body for the 
judicial service. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of 
magistrates and judges common to all Central American 
States 
</b>78. The Special Rapporteur was able to confirm that the Constitutions or legislation of 
the seven States of Central America guarantee the independence of judges and magistrates 
in conformity with principle 1 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary. 
However, she noted that each of the States is facing a number of challenges to making 
institutional independence and judicial impartiality a reality and that many of those 
challenges are common to all the countries in the region. </p>

</p>
<p><b> A. External and internal interference in the independence of the judiciary 
 1. Procedures and criteria for the selection, appointment or election of magistrates and 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges 
</b>79. The Special Rapporteur was able to confirm that one of the main challenges is the 
highly politicized nature of systems for the selection, appointment or election of judges and 
magistrates. This begins in many cases with the procedure for the selection, appointment or 
election of magistrates of the highest court of justice of each country and continues with the 
appointment of magistrates and judges of the other courts, thus affecting the entire judicial 
system. 
</p>
<p>80. The appointment of magistrates of the highest courts, and in some countries even 
judges of lower courts, is by decision of the legislative or executive branch based on 
selection criteria which, although established by the Constitution and legislation, are very 
broad, general and subjective, thus making it difficult to adequately assess the personal 
integrity, independence and professional qualifications of the candidates. Consequently, 
although the norms of all these countries are in conformity with principle 10 of the Basic 
Principles, practice reveals an absence of proper and more specific selection criteria as well 
as a lack of transparency and public scrutiny in the procedures for the appointment or 
election of magistrates and judges, a circumstance which has opened the door to 
interference by political parties and economic groups, generating a system based on 
political favours and patronage. 
</p>
<p>81. For that reason, the participants emphasized the need to give consideration to criteria 
for measuring the abilities of candidates for judicial service. The selection processes should 
include written, anonymous examinations, with complete interviews and psychometric 
tests, in order to ascertain whether the candidate is able to discharge his or her functions 
independently and impartially. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that a revision of the 
system for the selection and appointment of magistrates and judges could help prevent 
appointments for improper reasons. 
</p>
<p>82. This politicization assumes very serious dimensions when the judicial body with 
constitutional competence is called upon to arbitrate in political conflicts or conflicts 
concerning matters of a political nature. In such cases, the Supreme Court or the 
Constitutional Chamber must rule independently and impartially on all applications referred 
to them; that leads to a politicization of the judiciary. Such a situation usually results in 
conflicts between the different branches of State power. The participants referred to serious 
interference in the independence of the judiciary, which takes the following forms: assaults, 
intimidation and threats against judges as well as their removal, especially those who have 
constitutional jurisdiction; attempts to create political mechanisms that make it possible to 
revise or disregard judicial decisions by issuing decrees; and the appointment of magistrates 
who are not independent. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur has expressed concern about recent cases in that regard in El 
Salvador,7 Costa Rica8 and Honduras.9 She is also concerned about the delay in the 
appointment of judges after the expiry of their terms of office, as is currently the case in 
Nicaragua, which causes great insecurity in the administration of justice.

<p>GE.13-12614 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>84. Another concern is related to the question of the power of organized crime and its 
recent intrusion in selection and appointment bodies as well as the courts. The participants 
noted that more and more judges and magistrates are being threatened by criminal 
organizations. Although some countries have laws making trafficking in influence a crime, 
for example in Guatemala with the Illicit Enrichment Act, the subject has yet to be 
discussed in political spheres. 
</p>
<p>85. Another problem is the virtual non-existence of civil society participation in 
processes for the selection and appointment of judges and magistrates. According to the 
participants, the best practices are in those countries in which society plays an active part in 
the process, such as in Guatemala. The participants referred to the importance of public 
hearings and the possibility of subjecting candidates to questioning by citizens as a way of 
reducing interference in those processes by the political sphere or pressure groups. 
However, public participation must be responsible, with representatives of society as a 
whole and not fictitious organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Selection and appointment bodies 
</b></p>
<p>86. With regard to the selection body, although most of the countries in the region have 
set up institutions to support the Supreme Courts in the administration of justice, such as 
the National Council of the Judiciary in El Salvador, the National Council of the 
Administration and the Judicial Service in Nicaragua and the Council of the Judiciary and 
the Judicial Service in Honduras (created, but not yet functioning), these institutions must 
be independent from the Supreme Courts in practice,10 with independent members, and 
must establish objective and transparent procedures for the selection, appointment, 
promotion, suspension and dismissal of judges. The composition of such bodies must be 
pluralist, with a predominance of magistrates and judges as members, and they must 
guarantee the participation of organizations of civil society. The process for the selection of 
their members must be transparent and public. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Instability of employment 
</b></p>
<p>87. Another challenge that affects the independence of the judiciary is the short term of 
office and the need for constant re-elections of magistrates and judges, who depend on 
those wielding political power for re-election. Ensuring tenure of office and the stability of 
judges in their functions would help prevent internal and external interference in the 
judiciary and ensure the effectiveness of the judicial service. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Misuse of the media 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to the role of the media in 
undermining the independence of judges and magistrates. She was informed that the media 
often attacked and slandered judges as a way of seeking to have rulings reversed or judges 
removed. The independence of the media must be strengthened, because in many cases, 
they are used by public institutions, those wielding political power and economic groups to 
discredit the judiciary. The participants stressed how important it was for the judiciary to 
have a communication strategy, for example through a &#8220;judicial spokesperson&#8221;, to help the 
media obtain accurate information on cases and rulings, thereby preventing improper 
interference in the work of the courts.

</p>
<p><b> B. Administration of justice 
 1. Judicial service 
</b></p>
<p>89. During the consultation, it became clear that there is a high concentration of power 
in the highest judicial bodies, usually the Supreme Court, which accumulate judicial and 
administrative functions, such as disciplinary, promotion, suspension and dismissal 
procedures for magistrates and judges as well as the administration of the budget. 
</p><p>90. This concentration of power is very dangerous for the independence of the judiciary 
when there is improper interference in the procedure for the selection, appointment or 
election of judges. Such interference may undermine the independence of the entire 
structure and functioning of the judicial system at all levels. 
91. Hence the need for legislation on the judicial service which strengthens the 
independence and impartiality of magistrates and judges and impedes any interference, 
external or internal, in their work, such as the improper application of disciplinary 
procedures to intimidate judges, the practice of making telephone calls to persuade judges 
to revise their rulings or the improper transfer of judges to other jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Alternate magistrates and judges 
</b>92. According to the participants, the presence of alternate magistrates and judges in the 
Supreme Court and other judicial bodies is a matter of concern for the independence of the 
judiciary. In some countries, alternates can be used by other branches of government to 
interfere in the decisions and activities of regular magistrates and judges. In other countries, 
alternate judges practise law at the same time, which encourages considerable trafficking in 
influence and court decisions that are not in conformity with the law, thereby further 
undermining the independence of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The budget of the judiciary 
</b>93. Lack of budgetary independence also has a serious impact on the independence of 
the judiciary. Although in most of the countries in the region the Constitution assigns a 
fixed percentage of the national budget to judicial institutions, the amount concerned is not 
adequately transferred to the judiciary. The budgetary allocations which the judiciary 
requests from the executive or legislative branch are often reduced and their payment 
delayed, thereby hampering the proper administration of justice. That situation is contrary 
to principle 7 of the Basic Principles and the recommendations of the mandate which refer 
to how important it is for the judiciary to draft its budget and for safeguards to be 
introduced to guarantee the payment of budgetary funds earmarked for the courts.11 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Education and training 
</b></p>
<p>94. One challenge common to all the countries of the region is the low quality of 
education in law schools, which produce professionals who have not been properly trained 
to exercise the profession and hold judicial positions. The situation is aggravated by the 
lack of initial training and preparation of judges. According to the participants, this state of 
affairs is linked to a large extent to the low prestige of the judiciary in most of the countries 
in the region. The need to rethink the training of professionals in the judicial system was 
stressed. This problem is consistent with what the Special Rapporteur has reiterated in her 
report: that it is important to promote initial and ongoing human rights training for all

<p>members of the judicial system and to strengthen the role played by universities in that 
process.12 
</p>
<p>95. When academic institutions are part of the selection bodies, the process of selecting 
their own representatives is often questionable, because there is no guarantee that selection 
procedures will be based on objective and transparent criteria. These institutions must 
review their internal procedures to ensure transparent participation in the processes for the 
selection and appointment of judges and magistrates. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>96. <b>The administration of justice in Central America needs to be strengthened so as 
to make the constitutional and legal principle of the independence of the judiciary a 
reality. Despite the presence of two systems of justice in the region, common law in 
Belize and continental law in the other countries, a number of shared challenges were 
identified which testify to the urgent need to develop mechanisms which eliminate 
external and internal interference and ensure an independent, impartial, efficient and 
effective administration of justice. Examples of these challenges include the 
politicization of the system for the selection and appointment of judges and 
magistrates, in particular in the highest courts, the lack of a proper budget and the 
need to improve the quality of schooling and training for judges and magistrates. 
</b>97. <b>As most of these countries are young democracies, the consolidation of public 
institutions, and the judiciary in particular, is of crucial importance for combating 
impunity, corruption and organized crime, curbing urban and rural violence, 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and promoting social and 
economic development.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The dialogue launched by the consultation may be an important starting point 
for the establishment of a forum for the exchange of experiences and mutual 
assistance between judicial bodies in the region to ensure the independence of the 
judiciary. A strong social consensus and political will are therefore required to bring 
about the changes needed so that the judiciary can play its role in the consolidation of 
the rule of law independently and impartially.</b>
