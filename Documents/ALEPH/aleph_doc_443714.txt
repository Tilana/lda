FOURTH QUARTER 2010
Report to shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2010
Suncor Energy 2010 fourth quarter results
All financial figures are unaudited and in Canadian dollars unless noted otherwise. Certain financial measures referred to in this document are not prescribed by Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For a description of these measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory in this document. Certain crude oil and
natural gas liquid volumes have been converted to millions of cubic feet equivalent of natural gas (mmcfe) on the basis of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet (mcf). Also, certain
natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or thousands of boe (mboe) on the same basis. Mmcfe, boe and mboe may be misleading, particularly
if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one barrel of crude oil or natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion
method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent value equivalency at the wellhead.
On August 1, 2009, Suncor Energy Inc. completed its merger with Petro-Canada. As such, results for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2010 reflect results of
post-merger Suncor and the comparative figures for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2009 reflect results for five months of the post-merger Suncor and seven
months of legacy Suncor prior to the merger. References to the merger herein mean the merger between Suncor Energy Inc. and Petro-Canada.
Suncor Energy Inc. (the company) recorded fourth quarter 2010 net earnings of $1.353 billion ($0.87 per common share),
compared to net earnings of $457 million ($0.29 per common share) for the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating earnings (1) in
the fourth quarter of 2010 were $946 million ($0.60 per common share), compared to $342 million ($0.22 per common
share) in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The increase in fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, was primarily due to
improved margins and increased refined product sales in Refining and Marketing, higher realized prices in Oil Sands and
International and Offshore, and increased Oil Sands production.
As a result of strategic divestments during 2010, total production in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased to 625,600 boe
per day (boe/d), from 638,200 boe/d in the fourth quarter of 2009. However, production from continuing operations
increased to 605,400 boe/d in the fourth quarter of 2010, from 544,500 boe/d in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase
resulted from record quarterly production of 325,900 barrels per day (bpd) from Oil Sands (excluding Syncrude) due to
improved operational reliability and higher bitumen supply, and new production from International and Offshore.

Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
Cash flow from operations (see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Advisory Section) was $2.144 billion ($1.37 per
common share) in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $1.129 billion ($0.72 per common share) in the fourth quarter
of 2009. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the same factors that impacted operating
earnings in the fourth quarter, as well as the positive impact of the redetermination of the company’s working interest in
the Terra Nova oilfield and a royalty recovery related to a notice received by the company from the Crown modifying the
bitumen valuation methodology calculation.
‘‘Operational results were strong across the business in the fourth quarter,’’ said Rick George, president and chief executive
officer. ‘‘In our oil sands business, steady and reliable production from both mining and in situ assets drove record
quarterly production volumes, while our international and offshore assets continued to perform well. In our downstream
operations, both production volumes and margins were strong contributors in the quarter, underlining the benefits of our
integrated strategy.’’
Fourth Quarter Highlights
(cid:127) Oil Sands (excluding Syncrude) achieved record average production volume of 325,900 bpd in the fourth quarter of
2010 compared to 278,900 bpd in the fourth quarter of 2009. Increased production was largely due to improved
operational reliability in the Upgrader and increased bitumen supply from mining and in situ operations.
(cid:127) Results from Refining and Marketing in the fourth quarter of 2010 were very strong, with operating earnings and cash
flow from operations more than double as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of higher margins and
increased utilization of refining capacity. Total sales of refined petroleum products averaged 91,100 cubic metres per day
during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 82,900 cubic metres per day in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting
more reliable operations in all our facilities and improved product demand.
(cid:127) Total upstream production in the fourth quarter was 625,600 boe/d, compared to 638,200 boe/d in the fourth quarter
of 2009. Lower production volumes were primarily due to asset sales in Suncor’s Natural Gas and International and
Offshore businesses, partially offset by improved operational reliability at Oil Sands, and production increases in
continuing International and Offshore operations.
(cid:127) Net debt, calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, as at December 31, 2010 was $11.1 billion, a decrease
of approximately $400 million during the fourth quarter and down from approximately $13.4 billion at December 31,
2009. The reduction was largely due to proceeds from asset dispositions being directed to debt retirement and the
appreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar through the period.
(cid:127) During the fourth quarter of 2010 Suncor recognized $295 million (pre-tax) of additional income to be reimbursed by
the other Terra Nova joint owners for the period of February 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010. Suncor’s working interest
in Terra Nova has increased to 37.675% from 33.990% based on a technical review of the interests contributed by the
joint owners of the Terra Nova oilfield. The owners reached agreement concerning redetermined working interests on
December 1, 2010.
(cid:127) In the fourth quarter of 2010 Suncor recognized a $140 million (pre-tax) favorable royalty recovery related to a notice
received by the company from the Crown modifying the bitumen valuation methodology calculation for the interim
period of January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The company continues to negotiate final adjustments to the bitumen
valuation calculation for the 2009 and 2010 interim period and for the term of the Suncor Royalty Amending
Agreement that expires December 31, 2015.
(cid:127) On December 17, 2010, Suncor announced that it entered into a strategic partnership with Total E&P Canada Ltd.
Subject to certain conditions, the agreement provides that the two companies plan to develop the Fort Hills and Joslyn
oil sands mining projects and restart construction on the Voyageur upgrader with targeted operational dates ranging
from 2016 to 2018. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals, with closing targeted for the

first quarter of 2011. The development of the Fort Hills and Joslyn oil sands mining projects, as well as the continued
construction of the Voyageur upgrader, is subject to approval by all of the partners in these ventures and by Suncor’s
Board of Directors.

(1) Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts net earnings for significant items that management believes are not indicative of
operating performance and reduces the comparability of the underlying financial performance between periods. All reconciling items are
presented on an after-tax basis. See the Non-GAAP Measures Advisory section of this document.
(2)
(3)
The company adjusts operating earnings for the change in fair value of significant crude oil risk management derivatives. The company also
holds less significant risk management derivatives in other segments that are not adjusted.
The 2010 year-to-date total includes Natural Gas non-core asset sales and International and Offshore asset and share sales, a gain on unproven
natural gas land and Refining and Marketing sales of retail sites. The 2009 loss on disposal was related to a loss recognized when a highway
interchange constructed by Suncor was transferred to the Provincial government of Alberta, and fair value adjustments to assets acquired in
the merger.
(4) Other income resulting from the settlement payment due to Suncor related to the Terra Nova redetermination. The payment will effectively
reimburse Suncor for certain revenue related to its increased working interest (to 37.675% from 33.990%) back to the payout date of
February 1, 2005. Operating earnings for prior quarters have been restated to reflect the portion of settlement attributable to the respective
quarters.
(5)
Impact from a royalty recovery related to a notice received by the company from the Crown modifying the bitumen valuation methodology
calculation for the interim period of January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. As a result, the company reduced its royalty provision by
approximately $105 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating earnings for prior quarters have been restated to remove the
original provision booked in the affected quarters. The company continues to negotiate final adjustments to the bitumen valuation calculation
for the 2009 and 2010 interim period and for the term of the Suncor Royalty Amending Agreement that expires December 31, 2015.

(8)
The 2010 year to date total includes a write-down related to certain extraction equipment in the Oil Sands segment, a write-down of land
leases no longer being pursued by the Natural Gas segment, an impairment of natural gas properties due to the lower gas price environment,
adjustment to spare parts inventory and assets from the International and Offshore segment that required a write-down of book value based
on agreed sale price.
The 2010 year to date total includes adjustments for unfavorable pipeline commitments, adjustments made to the cost estimates for the
Exploration and Production Sharing Contract in Libya, a dry hole in Libya, write-off of unproven land in Natural Gas, and a reduction to the
provision related to the Montreal coker project.
Impact from an increase in the future income tax liability resulting from a revised provincial allocation for income tax purposes because of
the merger.
(9)
Impact from the deemed settlement value assigned to bitumen processing contract with Petro-Canada upon close of the merger.
(10)
Inventory acquired through the merger with Petro-Canada at fair value was sold during the third quarter of 2009, resulting in a one-time
decrease to earnings.

Capital Investment
Suncor spent $1.8 billion on capital and exploration in the fourth quarter of 2010, bringing the full year spend to
$5.7 billion, which was marginally higher than Suncor’s original 2010 budget of $5.5 billion. The capital expenditures were
primarily focused on sustaining safe and reliable existing operations throughout the company, and the continued
development of the Firebag Stage 3 and 4 expansions.

In December 2010, the Suncor Board of Directors approved a $6.7 billion 2011 capital spending plan. Approximately
$2.8 billion will be directed towards growth project funding, primarily at the company’s Oil Sands operations, while
approximately $3.9 billion will be directed towards sustaining existing operations, including significant planned
maintenance to support reliability and further deployment of new tailings reclamation technology. Approximately 40% of
planned sustaining capital will be targeted to spending that is not expected to recur on an annual basis. In addition to

Oil Sands net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $487 million compared to $236 million for the fourth quarter
of 2009. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009 included the positive impact of a royalty provision
recovery and lower costs related to deferral of growth projects, partially offset by lower gains on change in fair value of

commodity derivatives used for risk management. The favorable royalty recovery was related to a notice received by the
company from the Crown modifying the bitumen valuation methodology calculation for the interim period January 1,
2009 to December 31, 2010. As a result, the company recognized a royalty recovery of approximately $105 million (after
tax). Operating earnings for all quarters impacted since January 1, 2009 have been restated to include only the amount
that relates to the comparative period. The company continues to negotiate final adjustments to the bitumen valuation
calculation for the 2009 and 2010 interim period and for the term of the Suncor Royalty Amending Agreement that
expires December 31, 2015. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a $103 million favorable adjustment
related to a reduction of the Ontario corporate tax rate. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were
$404 million compared to $189 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in 2010 fourth quarter operating
earnings was primarily due to increased production and higher realized prices partially offset by a build in inventory, of
which margins are not recognized until the inventory is sold.
Production
Oil Sands production, excluding Suncor’s share of production from Syncrude, was 17% higher in the fourth quarter of
2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved upgrader reliability and higher bitumen supply from all of the Oil
Sands assets (mining and in situ), contributed to a record production volume of 325,900 bpd in the fourth quarter of
2010. The prior year quarter was negatively impacted by the fire that occurred in December 2009 at Upgrader 2.
Syncrude production decreased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due
to minor upgrader outages that occurred during the quarter.
Prices
Oil Sands benefited from higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower realized hedging losses in the fourth quarter of
2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, partially offset by wider heavy crude oil differentials and the stronger
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Heavy crude oil differentials remained wider in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a
result of the Enbridge pipeline disruptions that limited the export capacity of heavy crude products from Western Canada,
resulting in reduced and discounted sales. This negatively impacted both sour crude and bitumen price realizations in the
fourth quarter of 2010.
The six week planned turnaround for Upgrader 2 that began in September continued for three weeks into the fourth
quarter of 2010. Hydrogen supply and hydrotreating capacity were periodically limited through the fourth quarter of 2010
reducing the value of the product mix.
Inventory
In the fourth quarter of 2010, Oil Sands had a large inventory buildup as additional volumes were stored due to pipeline
restrictions along the Enbridge mainline. In the fourth quarter of 2009, Oil Sands had a net draw on inventory as available
inventory was sold to meet customer commitments following the December 2009 upgrader fire. The overall inventory
buildup quarter over quarter had a negative impact on earnings as the margin is not recognized until sold.
Capital
Oil Sands capital expenditures were $1.067 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, bringing the annual spend to
$3.709 billion. Growth spending was primarily focused on the construction of Firebag Stage 3.
The company is continuing with its planned growth initiatives related to the Firebag Stage 3 in situ oil sands expansion.
The planned expansion is targeted to begin production late in the second quarter of 2011, ramping up toward capacity of

2010 Fourth Quarter
62,500 bpd of bitumen over approximately 24 months thereafter. The 2010 expenditures focused on construction of
co-generation and central plant facilities and well pads.
Spending in 2010 also focused on engineering, procurement, construction and sustaining capital required to keep the
mining, upgrading, extraction and in situ assets operating effectively.
The company also had expenditure relating to Suncor’s TROTM tailings reclamation technology. Project activities during the
fourth quarter included engineering, procurement of certain long lead items, site preparation for the barge assembly area
and pipeline corridor work. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.

Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter 009
Natural Gas had a net loss from continuing operations of $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a net
loss of $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The higher net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of
2010 included the impacts of a $13 million write-down of spare parts inventory and higher costs related to stock-based
compensation. The net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an $8 million favorable
adjustment related to a reduction of the Ontario corporate tax rate. Operating losses from continuing operations for the
fourth quarter of 2010 were $43 million compared to $61 million in 2009. Operating losses improved in the fourth
quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower exploration costs from increased drilling
success in 2010, partially offset by lower natural gas average sale prices consistent with the decrease in the
AECO benchmark.
Production
Gross production from continuing operations decreased by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth
quarter of 2009. The lower production was mainly due to natural declines.
Capital
Natural Gas is focused on improving profitability by investing in low exploration risk drilling programs conducive to low
cost repeatable drilling and those with a high percentage of liquids production. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Natural Gas
spent $57 million on exploration and development activities bringing the 2010 total to $178 million, of which $8 million
was related to assets disposed of during the year. The 2010 activity was targeted towards unconventional gas
opportunities, as well as land acquisitions in northeast British Columbia.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Natural Gas business began two new drilling programs: one in the Ferrier area located
in central Alberta and another at Pouce Coupe in western Alberta. Both programs are expected to start being tied-in
during the first quarter of 2011.
Suncor’s key shallow gas producing properties near Medicine Hat, in eastern Alberta, continued with drilling and tie-in
activity. In total, 324 wells were drilled in the year ending December 31, 2010. Overall production from this area was
72 mmcfe/d in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Twelve months ended December 31, 2009 reflects five months of post-merger Suncor. Total production for the five month period was
178.8 boe/d.
International and Offshore had net earnings from continuing operations of $452 million in the fourth quarter of 2010,
compared to $230 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 included the impacts
from the settlement payment due to Suncor related to the Terra Nova redetermination that increased Suncor’s working
interest to 37.675% from 33.990%. This working interest redetermination was finalized in December 2010 in accordance
with the Terra Nova Development and Operating Agreement. The payment of $220 million (after tax) reimburses Suncor
for certain revenues related to its increased interest from the payout date of February 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010.
Operating earnings for all quarters impacted since February 1, 2005 have been restated to include only the amount that
relates to the comparative period. Operating earnings from continuing operations were $280 million in the fourth quarter
of 2010, compared to operating earnings from continuing operations of $218 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The
increase in operating earnings from continuing operations was due to increased production and higher sales prices
consistent with higher benchmark pricing.
Production
Overall, production from continuing operations was 14% higher in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth
quarter of 2009, primarily due to Syrian gas production coming on-stream in the second quarter of 2010.
Capital
East Coast Canada
International and Offshore spent $81 million on capital and exploration in the fourth quarter of 2010 on East Coast
Canada operations, bringing the annual expenditures to $264 million. Spending was primarily focused on White Rose,
Hibernia, and exploration drilling at the Ballicatters prospect.
Development drilling of 11 wells for the North Amethyst portion of White Rose is planned to continue until late 2012,
when production is expected to peak.

Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter 011
Development drilling on the first phase of the West White Rose development began in August 2010, with first oil
expected by the second quarter of 2011. Drilling results from Stage 1, combined with production evaluation and ongoing
reservoir evaluation, are expected to define the full field development scope.
Capital spending continues on the Hibernia South Extension project, where first production is expected in the second
quarter of 2011.
The contract for front end engineering and design and topsides engineering, procurement and construction for Hebron
was awarded in September 2010. The development plan approval submission is expected to be made in the first quarter
of 2011, with first oil expected in 2017.
International
International and Offshore capital and exploration expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 on International operations
were $255 million, bringing annual expenditures to $832 million, of which $169 million was related to assets disposed of
during the year. Spending was primarily focused on development spending in the U.K., Libya and Syria, as well as
exploration drilling in Libya and Norway.
The Buzzard enhancement project started-up in mid-October 2010 with production ramp-up expected into the first quarter
of 2011. The project included the installation of a fourth platform with equipment to handle high sulphur content.
The Beta Statfjord appraisal well 34/4-13S on the Beta Brent discovery in our operated licence PL375 was successfully
tested. Additional appraisal well testing is required to further delineate the discovery.
Two seismic survey projects continued to acquire data in relation to the Libyan Exploration and Production Sharing
Agreements (EPSA’s) in 2010. Seismic data acquisition will continue into the first quarter of 2011.

Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
Refining and Marketing had net earnings of $372 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $151 million in the
fourth quarter of 2009. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 included $27 million of costs related to stock-based
compensation and a $10 million gain from divestment of retail sites throughout the quarter. Net earnings in the fourth
quarter of 2009 included a $19 million favorable adjustment related to a reduction of the Ontario corporate tax rate.
Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $389 million compared to $134 million in the fourth quarter of
2009. Operating earnings improved in the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to stronger and more reliable operations,
higher volumes and improved margins, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Margins
Margins were significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Increased
production enabled refining and product supply activities to benefit from an improved business environment in the fourth
quarter of 2010, with higher cracking margins in every major market area and stronger product demand compared to the
fourth quarter of 2009. The Sarnia refinery was negatively impacted by the Enbridge crude pipeline outage which
restricted deliveries of lower cost sour crudes received from Western Canada and necessitated processing of more
expensive off-shore crude. The Edmonton refinery benefited from lower feedstock costs due to wider light/heavy and
light/sour synthetic crude differentials.
Volumes
Total sales of refined petroleum products increased 10% due to improved reliability in operations and higher product
demand in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall, refinery utilization averaged 94%
in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to 90% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was due to fewer scheduled
maintenance turnarounds and more reliable, uninterrupted operations. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Sarnia refinery
continued to be negatively impacted by Enbridge pipeline disruptions which limited crude availability and refinery
utilization. This production shortfall was offset by increasing throughputs at the Montreal refinery to support Ontario
market demands.
Marketing network sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2010 were marginally higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Strong sales in both the retail and wholesale divisions were partially offset by the loss of volume associated with the
divestment of merger remedy sites.
Capital
Refining and Marketing capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $272 million with spending primarily
focused on planned turnarounds and other refinery projects.
Annual expenditures totaled $667 million and were focused on refining assets. Successful turnarounds at all of the
refineries and the lubricants business were completed during the year to support continued safe and reliable operations.
Corporate, Energy Trading and Eliminations
Corporate, Energy Trading and Eliminations includes the company’s investment in renewable energy projects, results related
to third-party energy supply and trading activities and other activities not directly attributable to other operating segments.

Operating loss for the Corporate, Energy Trading and Eliminations segment was $140 million in the fourth quarter of
2010, compared to an operating loss of $161 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Renewable energy contributed $6 million in operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010, which was consistent with
the same period in 2009.
Energy trading operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $28 million, compared to $23 million in 2009. In
the fourth quarter of 2010, the gain was driven by buying heavy crude oil in Western Canada at wide price differentials
relative to WTI, and transporting this product to more favorable markets. In the fourth quarter of 2009, results were
positively impacted by realized physical gains on crude inventory positions.
Corporate experienced an operating loss of $175 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to an operating loss of
$195 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in operating loss was primarily the result of lower net interest
expense due to increased capitalized interest in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Group eliminations reflect the elimination of profit on crude oil sales between Oil Sands or East Coast Canada and
Refining and Marketing, where profits are realized when the products are sold to third parties.
Capital
Corporate capital expenditures were $152 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, bringing annual expenditures to
$360 million. Spending was focused on merger integration related activities and renewable energy.
Work is underway to integrate legacy Suncor and legacy Petro-Canada systems onto one common platform as well as to
integrate processes, information and technology.

Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
Construction continued on the Wintering Hills wind power project in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is expected to be
completed by the end of 2011. At peak operation, the project is expected to generate enough electricity to power
approximately 35,000 Alberta homes and displace 200,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.
Construction also continued on the Kent Breeze wind power project in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is expected to
be completed by mid-2011.
Suncor’s ethanol plant, located in Sarnia, Ontario, has a current capacity of 200 million litres per year, displacing the
equivalent of 300,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The company’s plant expansion was completed in January 2011 and has
doubled the capacity of the ethanol plant to 400 million litres per year.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ADVISORY
Certain financial measures referred to in this report to shareholders, namely operating earnings, cash flow from operations,
return on capital employed (ROCE), and oil sands cash operating costs, are not prescribed by Canadian GAAP. These
non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to
similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management
uses this information to analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Therefore, such measures should not be
considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures of performance prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP.
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
A detailed numerical reconciliation of ROCE is provided on an annual basis in the company’s annual MD&A, which is to be
read in conjunction with the company’s annual consolidated financial statements.
Operating Earnings
Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts net earnings for significant items that management believes are
not indicative of operating performance and reduce the comparability of the underlying financial performance between
periods. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate operating performance, because management believes it
provides better comparability between periods. All reconciling items are presented on an after-tax basis.

stock based compensation, gas swaps, accretion of asset retirement obligations and imported bitumen (excluding other reported product
purchases). For the three months ended December 31, other non production related costs are lower in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due
to lower safe mode costs ($101 million). For the twelve months ended December 31, other non production related costs are lower in 2010
compared to 2009, primarily due to lower safe mode costs deduction ($254 million) and higher imported bitumen costs ($67 million).

Legal Advisory – Forward-Looking Information
This Report to Shareholders contains certain forward-looking statements and other information based on Suncor’s current expectations, estimates,
projections and assumptions that were made by the company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends.
All statements and other information that address expectations or projections about the future and other statements and information about Suncor’s
strategy for growth, expected and future expenditures, commodity prices, costs, schedules, production volumes, operating and financial results and
expected impact of future commitments, are forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements and information may be identified
by words like ‘‘expects,’’ ‘‘anticipates,’’ ‘‘estimates,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘scheduled,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘believes,’’ ‘‘projects,’’ ‘‘indicates,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘focus,’’ ‘‘vision,’’
‘‘goal,’’ ‘‘outlook,’’ ‘‘proposed,’’ ‘‘target,’’ ‘‘objective,’’ and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this Report to Shareholders include
references to:
(cid:127) the strategic partnership with Total E&P Canada Ltd., and the expectation that the two companies will develop the Fort Hills and Joslyn oil sands
mining projects and restart construction on the Voyageur upgrader with targeted operational dates ranging from 2016 to 2018;
(cid:127) Suncor’s 2011 capital spending plan, including the intention that approximately $2.8 billion will be directed towards growth project funding
(including Firebag Stage 3 and 4 expansions and investment in the Fort Hills oil sands mining projects and Voyageur upgrader), primarily at the
company’s oil sands operations, with the remaining $3.9 billion targeted towards sustaining existing operations, including significant planned
maintenance to support reliability and further deployment of new tailings reclamation technology;
(cid:127) the intention that approximately 40% of planned sustaining capital for 2011 will be targeted to spending that is not expected to recur on an
annual basis;
(cid:127) the planned expansion for Firebag 3, with the target to begin production late in the second quarter of 2011, ramping up toward capacity of
62,500 bpd of bitumen over approximately 24 months thereafter;
(cid:127) the schedule for Suncor’s TROTM tailings reclamation project (planned complete by the end of 2012);
(cid:127) Suncor’s drilling programs located in the Ferrier area in central Alberta and Pouce Coupe in western Alberta, including the plan to have both
tied-in during the first quarter of 2011;
(cid:127) developmental drilling in the North Amethyst portion of White Rose, and the expectation that production will peak in late 2012;
(cid:127) the expectation that first oil will occur for: (i) West White Rose in the second quarter of 2011; and (ii) Hebron in 2017;
(cid:127) the Hibernia South Extension, and the expectation of production in the second quarter of 2011;
(cid:127) the expectation that the Buzzard enhancement project will ramp up into the first quarter of 2011;
(cid:127) the plans for the Wintering Hills wind power project, including targeted completion by the end of 2011 and the expectation that the project will
be able to generate enough electricity to power approximately 35,000 Alberta homes and displace 200,000 tonnes of CO2 per year; and
(cid:127) timelines for the Kent Breeze wind power project (expected to be completed by mid-2011).
This Report to Shareholders also contains forward-looking statements and information concerning the anticipated completion and timing of the
proposed transaction with Total E&P Canada Ltd. Suncor has provided these anticipated times in reliance on certain assumptions that we believe are
reasonable at this time, including assumptions as to the timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory, court and other third party approvals; and the
time necessary to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the transaction. These dates may change for a number of reasons, including unforeseen
delays in the ability to secure necessary regulatory or other third party approvals or the need for additional time to satisfy the conditions to the
completion of the transaction. The transaction may not close as scheduled or at all. As a result of the foregoing, readers should not place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements and information contained in this Report to Shareholders concerning these times.
Forward-looking statements and information are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some that
are similar to other oil and gas companies and some that are unique to Suncor. Suncor’s actual results may differ materially from those expressed or
implied by its forward-looking statements and information and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.
The financial and operating performance of the company’s business segments, including Oil Sands, Natural Gas, International and Offshore and
Refining and Marketing, may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
Factors that affect our Oil Sands business:
(cid:127) Production reliability risk. Our ability to reliably operate our oil sands facilities in order to meet production targets.
(cid:127) Our ability to finance oil sands growth and sustaining capital expenditures in a volatile commodity pricing environment.
(cid:127) Bitumen supply. The unavailability of third party bitumen, poor ore grade quality, unplanned mine equipment and extraction plant maintenance,
tailings storage and in situ reservoir and equipment performance could impact production targets.
(cid:127) Performance of recently commissioned facilities. Production rates while new equipment is being lined out are difficult to predict and can be
impacted by unplanned maintenance.
(cid:127) Our ability to manage production operating costs. Operating costs could be impacted by inflationary pressures on labour, volatile pricing for
natural gas used as an energy source in oil sands processes, and planned and unplanned maintenance. We continue to address these risks through
strategies such as application of technologies that help manage operational workforce demand, offsetting natural gas purchases through internal
production, investigation of technologies that mitigate reliance on natural gas as an energy source, and an increased focus on preventative
maintenance.
018
Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
(cid:127) Our ability to complete projects both on time and on budget. This could be impacted by competition from other projects (including other oil sands
projects) for goods and services and demands on infrastructure in Fort McMurray and the surrounding area (including housing, roads and schools).
We continue to address these issues through a comprehensive recruitment and retention strategy, working with the community to determine
infrastructure needs, designing Oil Sands expansion to reduce unit costs, seeking strategic alliances with service providers and maintaining a strong
focus on engineering, procurement and project management.
(cid:127) Potential changes in the demand for refinery feedstock and diesel fuel. Our strategy is to reduce the impact of this issue by entering into
long-term supply agreements with major customers, expanding our customer base and offering a variety of blends of refinery feedstock to meet
customer specifications.
(cid:127) Volatility in light/heavy and sweet/sour crude oil differentials.
(cid:127) Logistical constraints and variability in market demand, which can impact crude movements. These factors can be difficult to predict and control.
(cid:127) Changes to royalty and tax legislation and related agreements that could impact our business (including our current dispute with the Alberta
Department of Energy in respect of the Bitumen Valuation Methodology Regulation). While fiscal regimes in Alberta and Canada are generally
stable relative to many global jurisdictions, royalty and tax treatments are subject to periodic review, the outcome of which is not predictable and
could result in changes to the company’s planned investments, and lower rates of return on existing investments.
(cid:127) Our relationship with our trade unions. Work disruptions have the potential to adversely affect Oil Sands operations and growth projects.
Factors that affect our Natural Gas business:
(cid:127) Volatility in natural gas prices.
(cid:127) Risk associated with a depressed market for asset sales, leading to losses on disposition.
(cid:127) The accessibility and cost of mineral rights. Market demand influences the cost and available opportunities for mineral leases and acquisitions.
(cid:127) Risks and uncertainties associated with weather conditions, which can shorten the winter drilling season and impact the spring and summer
drilling program, which may result in increased costs and/or delays in bringing on new production.
Factors that affect our International and Offshore business:
(cid:127) Risks and uncertainties associated with international and offshore operations normally inherent in such activities such as drilling, operation and
development of such properties including unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, fires, blow-outs, equipment failures
and other accidents, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids, pollution and other environmental risks.
(cid:127) Performance after completion of maintenance is not predictable and can significantly impact production rates.
(cid:127) Risks and uncertainties associated with consulting with stakeholders and obtaining regulatory approval for exploration and development activities.
These risks could increase costs and/or cause delays to or cancellation of projects and expansions to existing projects.
(cid:127) Risks and uncertainties associated with weather conditions, which may result in increased costs and/or delays in exploration, operations or
abandonment activities.
(cid:127) Suncor’s foreign operations and related assets are subject to a number of political, economic and socio-economic risks. Suncor’s operations in Libya
may be constrained by production quotas.
Factors that affect our Refining and Marketing business:
(cid:127) Production reliability risk. Our ability to reliably operate our refining and marketing facilities in order to meet production targets.
(cid:127) Management expects that fluctuations in demand and supply for refined products, margin and price volatility, and market competition, including
potential new market entrants, will continue to impact the business environment.
(cid:127) There are certain risks associated with the execution of capital projects, including the risk of cost overruns. Numerous risks and uncertainties can
affect construction schedules, including the availability of labour and other impacts of competing projects drawing on the same resources during
the same time period.
(cid:127) Our relationship with our trade unions. Hourly employees at our London, Ontario terminal operation, our Sarnia refinery, our Commerce City
refinery, our Montreal refinery, certain of our lubricants operations, certain of our terminalling operations and at Sun-Canadian Pipeline Company
Limited are represented by labour unions or employee associations. Any work interruptions involving our employees, and/or contract trades utilized
in our projects or operations, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
Additional Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors
Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence the actual results of all of Suncor’s business segments include but are not limited
to, market instability affecting Suncor’s ability to borrow in the capital debt markets at acceptable rates; consistently and competitively finding and
developing reserves that can be brought on-stream economically; success of hedging strategies; maintaining a desirable debt to cash flow ratio;
changes in the general economic, market and business conditions; our ability to finance capital investment to replace reserves or increase processing
capacity in a volatile commodity pricing and credit environment; fluctuations in supply and demand for Suncor’s products; commodity prices, interest
rates and currency exchange; volatility in natural gas and liquids prices is not predictable and can significantly impact revenues; Suncor’s ability to
respond to changing markets and to receive timely regulatory approvals; the successful and timely implementation of capital projects including
growth projects and regulatory projects; risks and uncertainties associated with consulting with stakeholders and obtaining regulatory approval for
exploration and development activities in Suncor’s operating areas (these risks could increase costs and/or cause delays to or cancellation of projects);
effective execution of planned turnarounds; the accuracy of cost estimates, some of which are provided at the conceptual or other preliminary stage

of projects and prior to commencement or conception of the detailed engineering needed to reduce the margin of error and increase the level of
accuracy; the integrity and reliability of Suncor’s capital assets; the cumulative impact of other resource development; the cost of compliance with
current and future environmental laws; the accuracy of Suncor’s reserve, resource and future production estimates and its success at exploration and
development drilling and related activities; the maintenance of satisfactory relationships with unions, employee associations and joint venture
partners; competitive actions of other companies, including increased competition from other oil and gas companies or from companies that provide
alternative sources of energy; labour and material shortages; uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to projects
or capital expenditures; actions by governmental authorities including the imposition of taxes or changes to fees and royalties, changes in
environmental and other regulations (for example, the Government of Alberta’s review of the unintended consequences of the proposed Crown
royalty regime, our negotiations with the Alberta Department of Energy in respect of the Bitumen Valuation Methodology Regulation; the
Government of Canada’s current review of greenhouse gas emission regulations); the ability and willingness of parties with whom we have material
relationships to perform their obligations to us (including in respect of any planned divestitures); risks and uncertainties associated with the ability of
closing conditions to be met, the timing of closing and the consideration to be received with respect to the planned sale of any of Suncor’s assets,
including the ability of counterparties to comply with their obligations in a timely manner and the receipt of any required regulatory or other third
party approvals outside of Suncor’s control; the occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, blowouts, freeze-ups, equipment failures and other
similar events affecting Suncor or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect Suncor; failure to realize anticipated synergies
or cost savings; risks regarding the integration of the Suncor and Petro-Canada after the merger; and incorrect assessments of the values of Petro-
Canada. The foregoing important factors are not exhaustive.
Many of these risk factors and other assumptions related to Suncor’s forward-looking statements and information are discussed in further detail
throughout this Report to Shareholders and its Annual Information Form/Form 40-F on file with Canadian securities commissions at www.sedar.com
and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at www.sec.gov. Readers are also referred to the risk factors and assumptions
described in other documents that Suncor files from time to time with securities regulatory authorities. Copies of these documents are available

Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
Quarterly Operating Summary  (continued)
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Certain financial measures referred to in the Highlights and Quarterly Operating Summary are not prescribed by Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Suncor includes operating earnings, cash flow from operations, return on capital
employed and cash and total operating costs per barrel data because investors may use this information to analyze operating
performance, leverage and liquidity. The additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Definitions
(1) Average sales price
(2) Cash operating costs
(3) Total cash operating costs
(4) Total operating costs
– This operating statistic is calculated before royalties (where applicable) and net of
related transportation costs.
– Include cash costs that are defined as operating, selling and general expenses
(excluding inventory changes), accretion expense and the cost of bitumen imported
from third parties. Per barrel amounts are based on total production volumes. For a
reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure see the fourth quarter Report to
Shareholders.
– Include cash operating costs – Total operations as defined above and cash start-up
costs. Per barrel amounts are based on total production volumes.
– Include total cash operating costs – Total operations as defined above and non-cash
operating costs. Per barrel amounts are based on total production volumes.
(5) Cash operating costs – In situ bitumen production
– Include cash costs that are defined as operating, selling and general expenses
(excluding inventory changes) and accretion expense. Per barrel amounts are based on
in situ production volumes only.
(6) Total cash operating costs – In situ bitumen production – Include cash operating costs – In situ bitumen production as defined above and cash
start-up operating costs. Per barrel amounts are based on in situ production
volumes only.
(7) Total operating costs – In situ bitumen production
– Include total cash operating costs – In situ bitumen production as defined above and
non-cash operating costs. Per barrel amounts are based on in situ production
volumes only.
(8) Average price realized
– This operating statistic is calculated before transportation costs and royalties and
excludes the impact of hedging activities.
Explanatory Notes

**
***
****
Excludes the impact of realized hedging activities.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, operating summary information reflects results of operations since the merger with
Petro-Canada on August 1, 2009.
Users are cautioned that the Syncrude cash costs per barrel measure may not be fully comparable to similar information calculated by
other entities (including Suncor’s own cash costs per barrel excluding Syncrude) due to differing treatments for operating and capital costs
among producers.
Commercial production for Syria commenced on April 19, 2010.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These interim consolidated financial statements of Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor or the company) have been prepared in accordance
with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles and follow the same accounting policies and methods of computation as,
and should be read in conjunction with, the most recent annual financial statements. Certain information and disclosures normally
required to be included in notes to the annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted.
Certain prior period comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
2. BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH PETRO-CANADA
(a) Overview
On August 1, 2009, Suncor completed its merger with Petro-Canada. The company has accounted for this business combination
as prescribed by Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook section 1581 ‘‘Business Combinations’’. As the
acquirer, the company is required to recognize Petro-Canada assets and liabilities as at August 1, 2009. The results of Petro-
Canada operations are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company from August 1, 2009.
(b) Final Allocation of Purchase Price
The following estimated fair values were assigned to the net assets of Petro-Canada as at August 1, 2009:
($ millions)
Current assets
Property, plant and equipment
Other assets
Total assets
Current liabilities
Long-term debt
Accrued liabilities and other
Future income taxes

4 410
3 416
4 570
16 137
16 452

The purchase price allocation was based on best estimates by Suncor’s management and was based principally on valuations
prepared by independent valuation specialists. Management finalized the purchase price allocation during the second quarter of
2010 and did not make any amendments to the preliminary allocation.
3. CHANGE IN SEGMENTED DISCLOSURES
During the first quarter of 2010, as a result of planned divestitures of the company’s assets in Trinidad and Tobago, The
Netherlands and certain assets in the United Kingdom (U.K.) (described in note 6), the company combined its International and
East Coast Canada segments into one new segment, International and Offshore. Continuing operations for the International and
Offshore segment are comprised of activity offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, including interests in the Hibernia, Terra Nova,
034
Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
White Rose and Hebron oilfields, and the exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas in the U.K., Norway, Libya
and Syria.
All prior periods have been restated to conform to these segment definitions.
4. BITUMEN VALUATION METHODOLOGY
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Minister of Energy for Alberta provided notice to the company for the quality adjustment to be
used under the Bitumen Valuation Methodology (Ministerial) Regulations for the interim period January 1, 2009 to December 31,
2010. As a result, the company recognized a royalty recovery of approximately $140 million.
The company continues to negotiate final adjustments to the bitumen valuation calculation for the 2009 and 2010 interim period
and for the term of the Suncor Royalty Amending Agreement that expires December 31, 2015.
5. TERRA NOVA REDETERMINATION
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the joint owners of the Terra Nova oilfield finalized the redetermination of working interests
required under the Terra Nova Development and Operating Agreement following field payout on February 1, 2005. Suncor’s
working interest increased to 37.675% from 33.990%, and the other owners have agreed to reimburse the company for its
increased working interest from February 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010. As a result, the company has recognized a $295 million
gain in Other Income.
Suncor’s financial presentation will reflect the increased working interest in Terra Nova beginning January 1, 2011.
6. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The company is divesting certain non-core assets as part of its continuing strategic alignment.

proceeds of US$481 million (Cdn$502 million).

In the third quarter of 2010, the company completed the sale of non-core natural gas properties located in west central Alberta
(Bearberry and Ricinus) for net proceeds of $275 million, and non-core assets in southern Alberta (Wildcat Hills) for net proceeds
of $351 million.

(Cdn$383 million), and the sale of its shares in Petro-Canada Netherlands BV for net proceeds of c316 million (Cdn$420 million).
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the company completed the sale of certain non-core U.K. offshore assets for net proceeds of

7. ASSET WRITE-DOWNS
During the second quarter of 2010, the company recognized a write-down of $189 million related to certain extraction equipment
in the Oil Sands operating segment. Also during the second quarter of 2010, the company recognized a charge of $44 million in
the Natural Gas operating segment to reflect the write-down of certain Western Canada and Alaska land leases.
During the third quarter of 2010, the company recognized a write-down of $106 million related to certain North Sea assets in the
International and Offshore operating segment. An agreement to sell these assets was entered into during the quarter and the
assets were written down to reflect fair value less cost to sell. Also during the third quarter of 2010, the company recognized a
charge of $222 million to reflect the write-down of certain assets in the Natural Gas operating segment to reflect fair value based
on discounted future cash flows.
These charges are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses and net earnings from discontinued operations in
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
Derivatives are financial instruments that either imitate or counter the price movements of stocks, bonds, currencies,
commodities and interest rates. Suncor uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign
currency exchange rates and to manage interest rate or currency-sensitive assets and liabilities. Suncor also uses derivatives for
trading purposes. When used in a trading activity, the company is attempting to realize a gain on the fluctuations in the
market value of the derivative.
Hedge accounting is a method for recognizing the gains, losses, revenues and expenses associated with the items in a
hedging relationship at the time when the underlying transaction impacts earnings. Suncor elects to use hedge accounting on
certain derivatives linked to future commodity and financial transactions.
Physical trading commodity contracts that exceed the company’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are accounted
for as derivative financial instruments whereby realized and unrealized gains and losses, and the underlying settlement of
these contracts is recognized and reported on a net basis in Energy Supply and Trading Activities revenue. The related
inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell, with changes in fair value recognized as gains or losses within Energy Supply
and Trading Activities revenue.
(a) Balance Sheet Financial Instruments
The company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, derivative contracts, current
liabilities (except for the current portions of income taxes), long-term debt, and a portion of non-current accrued liabilities and
other. Unless otherwise noted, carrying values reflect the current fair value of the company’s financial instruments.
The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on the company’s assessment of available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies based on industry accepted third-party models; however, these estimates
may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts that could be realized or settled in a current market transaction. The company
characterizes inputs used in determining fair value using a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs depending on the degree to which they
are observable in the market (see page 77 of Suncor’s 2009 Annual Report for further detail). As at December 31, 2010, there
were no significant changes to the distribution of the fair value hierarchy used to value financial instruments.
The company’s long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with the exception of the portion
of debt that is recorded at fair value as part of a fair value hedging relationship. Upon initial recognition, the cost of the debt is
its fair value, adjusted for any associated transaction costs. Gains or losses on our U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt
resulting from changes in the exchange rate are recognized in the period in which they occur. At December 31, 2010, the carrying
038
Suncor Energy Inc.
2010 Fourth Quarter
value of the fixed-term debt accounted for under the amortized cost method was $9.7 billion (December 31, 2009 – $10.1 billion)
and the fair value was $10.7 billion (December 31, 2009 – $10.7 billion).
(b) Hedge Accounting
Fair Value Hedges
At December 31, 2010, the company had interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges outstanding until August 2011,
relating to $200 million of its fixed-rate debt. The fair value of these swaps totalled $8 million at December 31, 2010 and was
recorded in accounts receivable (December 31, 2009 – $18 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognized on these interest rate
swaps during the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
(c) Other Derivatives
Risk Management Derivatives
The company periodically enters into derivative contracts which although not accounted for as hedges because they have not
been documented as such, or do not qualify under GAAP, are believed to be economically effective at mitigating exposure to
commodity price movements and are a component of Suncor’s overall risk management program. These derivative contracts
include crude oil, natural gas, refined products and foreign exchange contracts. The earnings impact associated with these
contracts for the three month period ended December 31, 2010, was a loss of $5 million (2009 – a loss of $134 million). During
the twelve month period ended December 31, 2010, the earnings impact was a gain of $89 million (2009 – loss of
$1,024 million).
Energy Trading Derivatives
The company’s Energy Trading group also uses physical and financial energy contracts, including swaps, forwards and options to
earn trading revenues. These energy contracts are comprised of crude oil, natural gas and refined products contracts.
The earnings impact associated with these contracts for the three month period ended December 31, 2010, was a gain of
$19 million (2009 – a loss of $17 million). During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2010, the earnings impact was a
gain of $81 million (2009 – loss of $70 million).

Financial Risk Factors
The company is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from normal course business exposures, as well as the
company’s use of financial instruments. These risk factors include market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency risk
and interest rate risk, as well as liquidity risk and credit risk.

The company maintains a formal governance process to manage its financial risks. The company’s Risk Management Committee
(RMC) is charged with the oversight of the company’s risk management for trading activities, which are defined as strategic
hedging, optimization trading, marketing and speculative trading. The RMC, acting under board authority, meets regularly to
monitor limits on risk exposures, review policy compliance and validate risk-related methodologies and procedures. All risk
management activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision with the
appropriate financial and management controls.
At December 31, 2010, the company’s exposure to risks arising from the use of financial instruments had not changed
significantly from December 31, 2009.

reclassified to net earnings from discontinued operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, income tax expense of
$301 million (2009 – income tax recovery of $70 million) has been reclassified to net earnings from discontinued operations
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Ontario provincial government substantively enacted a 4% reduction to its provincial corporate
tax rates. Accordingly, the company recognized a reduction in future income tax expense of $148 million related to the revaluation
of its opening future income tax balances.
In the third quarter of 2009, the provision for future income tax increased by $152 million due in part to the merger. The
combined provincial allocation of both entities caused an increase to the future income tax rate, the impact of which is recorded
in net earnings.

16. CAPITAL STRUCTURE FINANCIAL POLICIES
The company’s primary capital management objective is to maintain a conservative balance sheet, which supports a solid
investment-grade credit rating profile. This objective affords the company the financial flexibility and access to the capital it
requires to execute on its growth objectives.
The company’s capital is monitored through net debt to cash flow from operations (1) and total debt to total debt plus
shareholders’ equity.
Net debt to cash flow from operations is calculated as short-term debt plus total long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents
divided by the twelve-month trailing cash flow from operations.
Total debt to total debt plus shareholders’ equity is calculated as short term-debt plus total long-term debt divided by short-term
debt plus total long-term debt plus shareholders’ equity.
Financial covenants associated with the company’s various banking and debt arrangements are reviewed regularly and controls are
in place to maintain compliance with these covenants. The company complied with all financial covenants for the periods ended
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the company’s strategy was to maintain the measure set out in the following schedule. The
company believes that maintaining this capital target helps to provide the company access to capital at a reasonable cost by
maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings.
