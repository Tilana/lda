Contribution of parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>and its universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the crucial role that parliaments play in, inter alia, translating 
</p>
<p>international commitments into national policies and laws, and hence in contributing to the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment by each State Member of the United Nations of its human rights obligations and 
</p>
<p>commitments and to the strengthening of the rule of law,  
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the Human Rights Council and parliaments stand to gain 
</p>
<p>considerably from exploring possible synergies to ensure that the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>has the greatest impact at the national level, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since 
</p>
<p>2010, in particular its resolutions 65/123 of 13 December 2010 and 66/261 of 29 May 2012, 
</p>
<p>in which the Assembly recognized the importance of continued parliamentary support for 
</p>
<p>the work of the Human Rights Council and encouraged the Inter-Parliamentary Union, as 
</p>
<p>the world organization of national parliaments, to strengthen its contribution to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, particularly with regard to the universal periodic review, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-third session, a panel discussion on the 
</p>
<p>contribution of parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council and its universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to organize the panel discussion from within existing resources, and to liaise with 
</p>
<p>the Inter-Parliamentary Union, States Members of the United Nations and relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as with civil society, including non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, and national human rights institutions, with a view to ensuring 
</p>
<p>their participation; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
the Council on its twenty-second session (A/HRC/22/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p>3. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a conference 
</p>
<p>room paper on the outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary. 
</p>
<p><i>48th meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i>21 March 2013 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
