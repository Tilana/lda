Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Three Months Ended May 31, 2015 and and 2014
(Unaudited)
1. Incorporation and nature of operations
Falconridge Oil Technologies Corp. (“the Company”) was incorporated on May 30, 2007 under
the name Ameriwest Minerals Corp. on December 23, 2010, the Company changed its name to
Ameriwest  Petroleum  Corp.  by  way  of  a  merger  with  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Ameriwest
Petroleum Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name.
Effective  July  2,  2013,  in  accordance  with  approval  from  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory
Authority  ("FINRA"),  the  Company  changed  its  name  from  "Ameriwest  Petroleum  Corp."  to
"Falconridge  Oil  Technologies  Corp."  by  way  of  a  merger  with  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary
Falconridge Oil Technologies Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name.
The name change became effective with the OTCBB at the opening of trading on July 2, 2013
under the symbol "FROT".  On July 2, 2103, the Company's stock symbol changed from "AWSS"
to "FROT" to better reflect the new name of the Company.
The  Company  is  an  oil  and  gas  technology  company  that  specializes  in  identifying  and
accessing  additional  petroleum  reserves  that  are  usually  left  in  the  ground.    The  Company's
value  proposition  is  extracting  new  resources  from  wells  that  have  been  assessed  as
uneconomic.    Most  of  the  Company's  projects  will  evolve  depleted  or  low  producing
assets.    Assets  are  stimulated  utilizing  Terra  Slicing  Technology  ("TST")  for  maximum
effectiveness  and  productivity,  essentially  revitalizing  the  pre-existing  well  and  establishing  a
flow rate with a significant percentage of its initial production.  Alternatively, TST may be utilized
as part of a workover project or procedure.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes
have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  These unaudited
condensed consolidated interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the year ended February 28, 2015 and notes thereto
contained in the information as part of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on June 15, 2015.  Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the
disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the Form
10-K have been omitted.   In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) which are necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of
operations for the interim periods presented herein.  Unaudited interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full year, or any other period.
 
Use of estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)
Fair value of financial instruments
 
 
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-
35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments.  Paragraph  820-10-35-37  of 
the  FASB  Accounting  Standards  Codification
establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  in  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
(GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and
comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure  fair  value  into  three  (3)  broad  levels.  The  fair
value  hierarchy  gives  the  highest  priority  to  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for
identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of
fair  value  hierarchy  defined  by  paragraph  820-10-35-37  of  the  FASB  Accounting  Standards
Codification are described below:
 
Level
1
Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date.
Level
2
Pricing  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  included  in  Level  1,  which  are
either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
 
The  carrying  amounts  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  such  as  cash,  accounts  receivable,
accounts  payable,  and  accrued  expenses,  approximate  their  fair  values  because  of  the  short
maturity of these instruments.
The derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and estimated
volatility factors based on historical quoted market prices for the Company's common stock, and
are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
The  following  table  provides  the  assets  and  liabilities  carried  at  fair  value  measured  on  a
recurring basis as of May 31, 2015.

$Nil respectively which was classified  as a Level 3 financial instrument, and a loss on change in
fair value of derivative liabilities of  $92,305 and  $Nil for the three months ended May 31, 2015
and May 31, 2014 respectively.

3. Going concern
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of
$2,500,016 since inception, a stockholders' deficit of $1,710,007 at May 31, 2015 and a working
capital deficit of $1,185,305.  These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt as to the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  In response to these conditions, we may raise
additional capital through the sale of equity securities, through an offering of debt securities or
through borrowings from financial institutions or individuals.  The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going
concern.
 
4. Loans Payable - related parties
First World Trade Corporation (“FWT”) is a company controlled by a shareholder of the
Company.  As at May 31, 2015 and February 28, 2015, FWT has advanced the Company
$1,177,649 and $1,170,275 respectively) to fund operating costs and shared expenses, the loan
is non-interest bearing and without specific terms of repayment.
As of May 31, 2015 and February 28, 2015, the Company owed accounts payables to related
parties of $118,322 and $133,421l respectively.
 
5. Convertible notes payable
During  the  period  ended  May  31,  2015,  the  Company  issued  the  following  convertible  note
payable.
The Company has determined that it needs to account for each of the Convertible Note Payable
issued as derivative liabilities and apply the provisions of ASC 815.
EMA  Financial  LLC  $100,000  bearing  interest  at  12%  per  annum  and  matures  April  15,
2016.  The note may be prepaid up to 180 days from the date of issue with a prepayment of 135%
depending on date of prepayment and is Convertible into common shares at 60% of the lowest
trading  price  for  the  20  days  prior  to  giving  notice  of  conversion.    The  Company  received
$100,000 on issuance.  The Company recorded  a debt discount related to the day 1 fair value of
the derivative liability of $100,000.
The Company recorded amortization of debt discount expense of $22,493 during the period for
these notes.

6. Derivative liabilities
The Company has determined that it needs to account for the Convertible Notes Payable issued
as derivative liabilities and apply the provisions of ASC 815.
The Company records the fair value of the of the conversion price of the convertible notes
disclosed in Note 6 in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The fair value of the
derivative was calculated using a multi-nominal lattice model performed by an independent
qualified business valuator. The fair value of the derivative liability is revalued on each balance
sheet date with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of
operations. During the period ended May 31, 2015, the Company recorded a loss on the change
in fair value of derivative liability of $92,305 (2014 - $Nil).  At May 31, 2015 the Company
recorded a derivative liability of $575,463 (2014 - $Nil).
 
For the lattice options pricing model that values the compound embedded derivatives based on a
probability weighted discounted cash flow model.  The Convertible Note derivative issued April
16, 2015 was valued as of inception and as of May 31, 2015.  The following assumptions were
used for the valuation of the derivative liability related to the April 16, 2015 Note:
The stock price (decreasing from $1.15 to $0.018 in this period which significantly increased the
liability) would fluctuate with the Company’s projected volatility;
An event of default for the Convertible Note would occur 0% of the time, increasing 1.00% per
month to a maximum of 10%;
Alternative financing for the Convertible Note would be initially available to redeem the note 0%
of the time and increase monthly by 2% to a maximum of 10%;
The  monthly  trading  volume  would  average  $5,399,150  to  $599,618  and  increase  at  1%  per
month;
The variable conversion prices ranging from 60% to 65% of the trading prices over 20 trading
days have effective discount rates of 57.15% to 52.70%;
The Note Holders would automatically convert the notes with variable conversion prices if the
registration was effective and the company not in default;
The Company recorded the excess fair value of the derivative liability above the proceeds of
$13,814 as interest expense.

As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” mean Falconridge
Oil  Technologies  Corp.,  and  our  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Falconridge  Oil  Ltd.,  an  Ontario,
Canada corporation, unless otherwise indicated.
 
Corporate Background
 
We were incorporated on May 30, 2007 under the name Ameriwest Minerals Corp. On December
23,  2010,  we  changed  our  name  to  Ameriwest  Petroleum  Corp.  by  way  of  a  merger  with  our
wholly-owned subsidiary Ameriwest Petroleum, which was formed solely for the change of name.
We were an exploration stage corporation. Our company carried out the first phase of exploration
on the Key 1-4 Mineral Claims, SW Goldfield Hills Area, Esmeralda County, Nevada, USA. The
results of Phase I were not promising and management determined it was in the best interests of
the shareholders to abandon the property and we allowed the claim to lapse in September 2009.
 
On  November  4,  2009,  our  company  signed  a  letter  of  intent  with  Suntech  Energy  of  British
Columbia  to  establish  the  basic  terms  to  be  used  in  a  future  asset  purchase  between  our
company and Suntech Energy. The agreement was to become effective on or before March 31,
2010. The letter of intent expired without having concluded the agreement.
 
On November 13, 2009, our company purchased a bioreactor pod to use in a test process. As of
November  30,  2010,  our  company  had  not  been  able  to  take  possession  and  implement  the
testing  of  the  bioreactor  pod  due  to  legal  problems  the  manufacturer  was  experiencing.  Our
company therefore felt it was appropriate to write off the asset during the period ended November
30, 2010.
 
On  June  20,  2013,  we  entered  into  a  letter  of  intent  for  a  share  exchange  transaction  and
acquisition  with  Falconridge  Oil  Ltd.,  an  Ontario,  Canada  corporation,  and  its  shareholders.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we agreed to acquire all 100 issued and outstanding
shares of Falconridge Ontario’s common stock in exchange for the issuance by our company of
29,250,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Falconridge Ontario.
 
 
13
Effective  July  2,  2013,  in  accordance  with  approval  from  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory
Authority  (“FINRA”),  we  changed  our  company’s  name  from  “Ameriwest  Petroleum  Corp.”  to
“Falconridge  Oil  Technologies  Corp.”  by  way  of  a  merger  with  our  wholly-owned  subsidiary
Falconridge Oil Technologies Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name.
 
The name change became effective with the OTCBB at the opening of trading on July 2, 2013
and  our  stock  symbol  changed  from  “AWSS”  to  “FROT”  to  better  reflect  the  new  name  of  our
company.
 
On August 2, 2013, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Falconridge Ontario and
its shareholders. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire
all 100 issued and outstanding shares of Falconridge Ontario’s common stock in exchange for
the issuance by our company of 29,250,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of
Falconridge Ontario.
 
Further, pursuant to the share exchange agreement, we are required to:
 
(a)  provide to Falconridge Ontario a financing of debt or equity for $1,100,000, which is to close
no later than 150 days from the closing of the share exchange and on mutually agreeable
terms (completed);
(b)  complete  a  private  placement  of  an  aggregate  of  $400,000  at  $1.50  per  share  (for  the
purposes of furthering the business of Falconridge Ontario) (completed); and
(c)  complete  an  equity  financing,  using  our  commercially  best  efforts,  of  up  to  $6,000,000  for
4,000,000 units at a price of no less than $1.50 per unit. Each unit will consist of one common
share  in  our  capital  stock  and  one-half  of  one  whole  warrant  (each  one  whole  warrant,  a
“Financing  Warrant”).  Each  Financing  Warrant  shall  be  exercisable  into  one  share  of  our
common stock at a price of no less than $3.00 per share for a period of 24 months from the
date of issuance of the Financing Warrants. As a term to the equity financing, any party, who
is successful in raising funds, with respect to the equity financing, from a private investor shall
earn  a  cash  commission  of  7%  and  a  commission  of  5%  payable  in  warrants  (each,  a
“Commission  Warrant”).  Each  Commission  Warrant  shall  have  the  same  terms  as  the
Financing Warrants. If we are unable to complete the equity financing, then we may offer to
Falconridge  Ontario  to  complete  a  financing  of  up  to  $6,000,000  that  may  include  debt,
preferred shares of our company or a combination of the foregoing.
We may be unable to secure any debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, at
the time when we need such funding. Additionally, although we agreed to complete the above
financings, where we are unable to complete any of the financings in the agreement, there will
not be any real consequences on the parties of the agreement. The value of the agreement to
provide  such  financings  is  the  use  of  commercially  best  efforts  to  fulfill  the  financings  and
demonstrating the need for financings to occur for our business to be successful.
 
On August 2, 2013, we closed the share exchange by issuing the required 29,250,000 common
shares  to  the  shareholders  of  Falconridge  Ontario.  As  a  result  of  the  share  exchange,
Falconridge Ontario is now the wholly-owned subsidiary of our company. Concurrently, and as a
condition to closing the share exchange agreement, Mr. Muran cancelled 18,000,000 shares of
our common stock. He received no consideration for the cancellation of his stock.
 
In connection with the share exchange agreement, we adopted a stock option plan on August 2,
2013 to issue options to purchase up to 10% of the issued and outstanding of our capital stock
when  the  share  exchange  closed,  being  4,875,000  shares,  to  our  board  members  and
management, at an exercise price of $1.50 per share or higher. When the options are granted,
they will vest quarterly over two years from the date of grant and shall expire 24 months from
vesting.
 
 
14
Additionally, effective August 2, 2013, we changed our fiscal year end to February 28.
 
As  a  result  of  the  closing  of  the  share  exchange  agreement  with  Falconridge  Ontario,
Falconridge Ontario has become our wholly-owned subsidiary and we now carry on business in
the Province of Ontario, Canada. Our company has generated only minimal revenue.
 
On February 20, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to
create 450,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001.  The Certificate of Amendment
became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on February 23, 2015.
On February 20, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Nevada Secretary of State
designating 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock, which series
shall have certain designations and number thereof, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications,
limitations and restrictions, in particular, it shall have the following voting rights:
 
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder to one (1) votes for each share of
Series A Preferred Stock.  In any vote or action of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
voting together as a separate class, each share of issued and outstanding Series A Preferred
Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote per share. The holders of Series A Preferred
Stock  shall  vote  together  with  the  shares  of  Common  Stock  as  one  class.  The  holders  of  the
Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably, with the holders of common stock, in any dividends
that may, from time to time may be declared by the board of directors.  The holders of the Series
A Preferred Stock shall rank pari passu with the holders of common stock in respect of all rights
in  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up  with  all  of  said  assets  being  distributed  among  the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and other classes of stock ranking pari passu with the
Series A Preferred Stock.  The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to
convert  at  any  time  all  or  any  portion  of  the  shares  of  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  held  by  such
person into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock equal to 1,000
(one  thousand)  shares  of  Common  Stock  for  each  1  (one)  share  of  Series  A  Preferred  Stock
being converted (the “Conversion Ratio”), provided that the Company has a sufficient number of
authorized shares of Common Stock for such conversion.
 
Our administrative office is located at 17-120 West Beaver Creek Rd., Richmond Hill, Ontario,
Canada L4B 1L2. Our fiscal year end is February 28.
 
Business Overview
 
We  are  an  oil  and  gas  technology  company  that  specializes  in  identifying  and  accessing
additional  petroleum  reserves  that  are  usually  left  in  the  ground.  Our  value  proposition  is
extracting  new  resources  from  wells  that  have  been  assessed  as  uneconomic.  Most  of  our
projects  will  involve  depleted  or  low  producing  assets.  Assets  are  stimulated  utilizing  Terra
Slicing Technology (“TST”) for maximum effectiveness and productivity, essentially revitalizing
the  pre-existing  well  and  establishing  a  flow  rate  with  a  significant  percentage  of  its  initial
production. Alternatively, TST may be utilized as part of a workover project or procedure.
 
Using the TST, our company offers operators a lower-cost alternative to drilling a new well, by
accessing hydrocarbons currently in the ground within existing low or non-producing wells.
 
Our  goal  is  to  shift  the  industry  and  social  paradigm  away  from  new  drilling  and  towards
increasing efficiency of current extraction in existing well-bores to increase recovery of oil and
gas. Thus, when widely applied, TST can add significant reserves to the energy resources of the
world.
 
To date we have performed our TST services on only two wells. The Admiralty well continues to
perform and is declining in production as expected. The SEG Well 6-21 Nipisi continues to have
an extremely high water cut. The operator is continuing to pump the well aggressively on the
hope that the water cut will decline and profitable oil production will result. We will revisit this
situation at the end of the year.
 
 
15
We will finance projects involving the enhancement and stimulation of pre-existing oil and gas
assets such as:
 
·
Producing well assets;
·
Dead wells;
·   Non-performing well assets; and
Low yield assets.
·  
 
Most  projects  involve  depleted  or  low  producing  assets.  Assets  are  stimulated  utilizing  TST
technology for maximum effectiveness and productivity, essentially revitalizing the per-existing
well  and  establishing  a  flow  rate  with  a  significant  percentage  of  its  initial  production.
Alternatively,  TST  may  be  utilized  as  part  of  a  workover  project  or  procedure.  We  are  the
exclusive agents of TST in the United Arab Emirates and the exclusive marketing principal of
TST globally, with non-exclusive rights to TST in any geographical region, country, or territory
that does not infringe on the territorial rights of any other exclusive arrangement for TST that does
not involve us. Further, we may only implement TST in certain areas around the world where we
have a revenue interest in a property for which TST is applied (e.g. a gross over-riding royalty,
override, working interest, revenue share, or share in some form of the hydrocarbon extraction
from the property, contract, lease, or client).
 
Capital  outlay  and  availability  will  be  variable  per  project.  Our  intended  business  plan  is  to
operate as an enhancement company and take a revenue interest in properties for which TST is
applied  as  repayment  as  well  as  an  interest  in  the  form  of  a  gross  over-riding  royalty  on  the
producing  asset.  By  applying  TST,  an  operator  will  retrieve  a  significant  portion  of  the  well
reserves still locked in the ground.
 
Our company assumes a financial risk in the process, with no capital outlay required by the asset
holder or lease owner. Hence if there is no productivity, we bear the cost. To the well owner, this
is a strong value proposition as we are taking an existing non-performing asset, and converting it
to a cash flowing asset.
 
The financial risk we assume is part of our capital program to oil and gas well owner/operators.
We  understand  that  many  operators  cannot  afford  EORT  (enhanced  oil  recovery  techniques)
despite the fact that they have assets that could perform at higher levels. Our program is made
available  to  selected  clients  only  after  a  detailed  engineering  and  geological  review  of  their
asset. If it is confirmed that there will be a significant increase in production, then we enter into an
agreement with the operator where in return for a GORR (gross overriding royalty) we will provide
all the capital necessary to apply the TST technology to their asset. We assume all the financial
risk. There will be significant covenants in our agreement with our client, such as the right to audit
and the right to replace the operator should we ascertain a default in the agreement. Our program
is designed to ensure capital repayment from the GORR within 12 months and then a cashflow
uninhibited by operational costs of the well operator for the life of the well.
 
TST has been designed for deployment in virtually all environments and applications in the oil
and gas industry. TST is designed to be applicable on land, or marine environments, and for both
oil and gas well applications, in vertical or horizontal formats.
 
On February 17, 2011, Falconridge Ontario entered into an agreement with Meadowbank Asset
Management Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, Meadowbank will attempt to source properties for
the implementation of our technology. As a term to the agreement, Falconridge Ontario agreed to
remunerate Meadowbank where:
 
1.  Falconridge Ontario is required to finance the technology implementation, then Meadowbank
will be entitled to 10% of total gross revenue earned by Falconridge from the establishment of
relationships  and  target  from  Meadowbank  after  initial  expenses  of  enhancement  or
implementation are recovered from the property; or
2.  Falconridge  Ontario  is  not  required  to  finance  the  technology  implementation,  then
Meadowbank will be entitled to:
 
a.   
20%  of  total  gross  revenue  earned  by  Falconridge  from  the  establishment  of  relationships
  
and target from Meadowbank; and
b.      10% of any up-front fees charged for the implementation of the technology.
16
In October 2011, Falconridge Ontario contracted with a third party to perform a workover of a well
using TST. As payment, we received a royalty interest upon completion in February 2012. The
value of the royalty interest obtained was  fair  valued  based  on  our  reserve  report,  which  was
deemed to be $128,990. We accounted for this royalty interest received as service revenues and
capitalized the amount as oil and gas property. Falconridge performed its services on a second
well in December of 2013. Our technology again proved its ability to slice into the formation with
significant success. However, despite the successful demonstration of the TST’s ability, the well,
to date, has produced a significant amount of water.
 
On  October  1,  2012,  we  entered  into  a  licensing  agreement  with  HydroSlotter  Corporation  of
Canada (“HSC”). Pursuant to this agreement, we became the exclusive marketing agent for TST
from HSC in the United Arab Emirates. Additionally, we are the exclusive marketing principal
throughout  the  world  of  TST  in  any  region  that  HSC  does  not  already  have  exclusive
arrangements for. In consideration of these rights, we paid a fee to HSC.
 
After a term of 14 months, this agreement was to terminate with 30 days of advance notice. As of
December  1,  2013,  this  agreement  was  renewed  by  mutual  consent  and  signature  by  both
parties and continues on a year to year basis as neither party received notice of termination of
this agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, HSC and our company signed a letter of renewal
dated April 17, 2014 to evidence mutual consent to extend the license agreement until December
31, 2014 and has subsequently extended the agreement to December 31, 2015.
 
On October 15, 2014, we entered into an agreement with LiveCall Investor Relations Company.
Pursuant to this agreement, LiveCall is to provide us with investor relation services for a term of
three months. In exchange for the services provided by LiveCall, we are to compensate LiveCall
with an initial non-refundable fee of $7,500 and $2,500 per month. The term of this agreement
will be automatically extended on a monthly basis after the term of three months unless 30 days
of written notice is given by either party.

(depreciation, amortization and depletion, accounts payable and accrued liabilities).
 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
 
For  the  three  months  ended  May  31,  2015,  we  used  Nil  in  investing  activities  in  the  form  of
investment  in  oil  and  gas  properties,  whereas  we  did  not  use  or  receive  any  cash  flows  for
investing activities.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
 
We have financed our operations primarily from loans with related parties, the issuance of equity
and debt instruments. For the three months ended May 31, 2015, we generated $78,904 from
financing activities. For the three months ended May 31, 2014, we generated $Nil from financing
activities.
 
We will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These
funds may be raised through, equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result
in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.
 
Plan of Operation
 
We are now investigating other properties on which exploration could be conducted and other
business opportunities to enhance shareholder value. If we are unable to find another property or
business opportunity, our shareholders will lose some or all of their investment and our business
will likely fail.
 
Going Concern
 
There is significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We  have  incurred  a  net  loss  of  $333,733  during  the  three  months  ended  May  31,  2015.  This
condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In response to
these conditions, we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, through an
offering  of  debt  securities  or  through  borrowings  from  financial  institutions  or  individuals.  The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to
continue as a going concern.
 
As  shown  in  our  financial  statements,  we  have  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $2,500,016  since
inception, a stockholders' deficit of $1,710,007 at May 31, 2015 and a working capital deficit of
$1,185,305.  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern.  In response to these conditions, we may raise additional capital through the sale of
equity  securities,  through  an  offering  of  debt  securities  or  through  borrowings  from  financial
institutions or individuals.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Cash Requirements
 
We  anticipate  that  our  expenses  over  the  next  12  months  (beginning  June  2015)  will  be
approximately  $2,744,000  as  described  in  the  table  below.  These  estimates  may  change
significantly  depending  on  the  nature  of  our  business  activities  and  our  ability  to  raise  capital
from our shareholders or other sources.
 
Over the next 12 months we intend to carry on business as an enhanced oil and gas technology
company. We anticipate that we will incur the following operating expenses during this period:

We will require funds of approximately $2,744,000 over the next twelve months to operate our
business. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources,
which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is no assurance
that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on
their investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable.
 
Purchase of Significant Equipment
 
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
Contractual Obligations
 
As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
 
Inflation
 
Inflation  and  changing  prices  have  not  had  a  material  effect  on  our  business  and  we  do  not
expect  that  inflation  or  changing  prices  will  materially  affect  our  business  in  the  foreseeable
future.
 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current  or  future  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition,  revenues  or
expenses,  results  of  operations,  liquidity  or  capital  expenditures  or  capital  resources  that  is
material to an investor in our securities.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal
variations.  This  pattern  may  change,  however,  in  the  event  that  we  succeed  in  bringing  our
technology to market and acquire oil and gas assets.
 
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
 
There  is  no  historical  financial  information  about  us  upon  which  to  base  an  evaluation  of  our
performance.  We  are  an  exploration  stage  corporation  and  have  not  generated  any  revenues
from  operations.  We  cannot  guarantee  we  will  be  successful  in  our  business  operations.  Our
business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including
limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our properties, and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services.
 
To  become  profitable  and  competitive,  we  must  conduct  the  research  and  exploration  of  our
properties before we start production of any minerals we may find. We sought equity financing to
provide for the capital required to implement our research and exploration phases. We believe
that the funds raised from our offering will allow us to operate for one year.
 
We  have  no  assurance  that  future  financing  will  be  available  to  us  on  acceptable  terms.  If
financing  is  not  available  on  satisfactory  terms,  we  may  be  unable  to  continue,  develop  or
expand  our  operations.  Equity  financing  could  result  in  additional  dilution  to  existing
shareholders.

Critical Accounting Policies
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in  the  United  States  requires  our  management  to  make  assumptions,  estimates  and
judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures
of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are
significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important
for  an  understanding  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operation.  Critical  accounting
policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of
operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result
of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because
of  their  significance  to  financial  statements  and  because  of  the  possibility  that  future  events
affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. A complete
summary of these policies is included in the notes to our quarterly report, included herein.
 
Basis of presentation
 
The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes
have  been  prepared  by  management  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  to  Form  10-Q  and  Article  8  of  Regulation  S-X.    These  unaudited
condensed consolidated interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial  statements  of  our  company  for  the  year  ended  February  28,  2015  and  notes  thereto
contained in the information as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
June  15,  2015.    Notes  to  the  financial  statements  which  would  substantially  duplicate  the
disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the Form
10-K have been omitted.   In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated
interim  financial  statements  furnished  reflect  all  adjustments  (consisting  of  normal  recurring
adjustments)  which  are  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial  position  and  the  results  of
operations for the interim periods presented herein.  Unaudited interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full year, or any other period.
Use of estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair value of financial instruments
 
Our company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-
35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments.  Paragraph  820-10-35-37  of 
the  FASB  Accounting  Standards  Codification
establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  in  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
(GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and
comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure  fair  value  into  three  (3)  broad  levels.  The  fair
value  hierarchy  gives  the  highest  priority  to  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for
identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of
fair  value  hierarchy  defined  by  paragraph  820-10-35-37  of  the  FASB  Accounting  Standards
Codification are described below:
 
Level
1
Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date.
Level
2
Pricing  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  included  in  Level  1,  which  are
either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
 
The  carrying  amounts  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  such  as  cash,  accounts  receivable,
accounts  payable,  and  accrued  expenses,  approximate  their  fair  values  because  of  the  short
maturity of these instruments.
 
 
21
The derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and estimated
volatility factors based on historical quoted market prices for the Company's common stock, and
are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
 
The  following  table  provides  the  assets  and  liabilities  carried  at  fair  value  measured  on  a
recurring basis as of May 31, 2015.

$Nil respectively which was classified  as a Level 3 financial instrument, and a loss on change in
fair value of derivative liabilities of  $92,305 and  $Nil for the three months ended May 31, 2015
and May 31, 2014 respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this
Item.
 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
 
Management’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
We  maintain  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  that  are  designed  to  ensure  that  information
required  to  be  disclosed  in  our  reports  filed  under  the Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as
amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission’s  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is
accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  president  (our  principal
executive  officer)  and  chief  financial  officer  (our  principal  financial  officer  and  principal
accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president
(our  principal  executive  officer)  and  chief  financial  officer  (our  principal  financial  officer  and
principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president (our principal executive officer)
and  chief  financial  officer  (our  principal  financial  officer  and  principal  accounting  officer)
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable
assurance in the reliability of our reports as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
During  the  period  covered  by  this  report  there  were  no  changes  in  our  internal  control  over
financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
