Directors’ report 
 
Your directors present their report on the consolidated entity (referred to hereafter as the “group”) consisting of 
Perseus Mining Limited (“Perseus” or the “company”) and its controlled entities for the year ended 30 June 2016 
(the  “period”).  Perseus  is  a  company  limited  by  shares  that  is  incorporated  and  domiciled  in  Australia.  Unless 
noted otherwise, all amounts stated are expressed in Australian dollars. 
 
DIRECTORS 
 
The following persons were directors of Perseus during the period and up to the date of this report.  
 
Reginald Norman Gillard 
Jeffrey Allan Quartermaine 
Colin John Carson 
Terence Sean Harvey 
Michael Andrew Bohm 
John Francis Gerald McGloin (appointed 19 April 2016) 
Alexander John Davidson (appointed 19 April 2016) 
 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 
 
The  principal  activities  of  the  group  during  the  period  were  mining  operations  and  the  sale  of  gold,  mineral 
exploration  and  gold  project  evaluation  and  development  in  the  Republics  of Ghana,  Côte  d’Ivoire  and  Burkina 
Faso, in West Africa. 
 
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
 
During the financial year under review the intensive work program undertaken by Perseus at its Edikan Gold Mine 
in  Ghana  (“Edikan”  or  “EGM”),  has  been  successful  in  materially  improving  the  operating  performance  of  the 
mine in recent months. Perseus also commenced a period of accelerated capital investment at Edikan during the 
financial  year  relating  to  the  construction  of  infrastructure  and  relocation  housing  required  for  mining  access, 
stripping  waste  from  the  new  mining  areas,  the  acquisition  of  additional  power  generation  units  along  with 
processing  plant  improvements.  Perseus  has  a  further  six  months  of  this  capital  investment  to  undertake  at 
Edikan before the operation enters a period of sustained strong positive cash flows starting in early 2017. 
 
Following execution of a Mining Convention for  the Sissingué  Gold Mine  in Côte d’Ivoiré  (“Sissingué” or “SGP”) 
between  Perseus  and  the  Government  of  Côte  d’Ivoire  in  late  July  2015  a  programme  of  early  works  was 
completed. Execution plans for the full scale development of Sissingué have been activated with first production 
of  gold  scheduled  to  occur  in  the  December  2017  Quarter.  Negotiations  with  Lycopodium,  a  highly  regarded 
international engineering group,  were  well  advanced  on  contracts  covering  approximately  50%  of  the scope  of 
work for the Sissingué development, and subsequent to year end these were awarded and signed. 
 
On  18  April  2016,  a  scheme  of  arrangement  in  which  Perseus  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  shares  in  Amara 
Mining  plc  (“Amara”)  took  effect  giving  Perseus  ownership  of  one  of  West  Africa’s  highest  quality  pre-
development  stage  projects,  the  Yaouré  Gold  Project  in  Côte  d’Ivoire  (“Yaouré”  or  “YGP”).  This  asset,  together 
with  Edikan  and  soon-to-be  producing  Sissingué,  provides  Perseus  with  a  balanced  portfolio  of  producing  and 
growth assets.      
 
Perseus strengthened its balance sheet position, following an equity raising towards the end of the financial year. 
On  20  June  2016,  Perseus  announced  an  equity  placement  and  an  accelerated  entitlements  offer.  The 
institutional portion of the offering closed oversubscribed and the retail offering closed subsequent to the year 
end.  In  total,  $102 million  of  equity  was  raised  from  new  and  existing  institutional  and  retail  investors  to  fund 
Perseus’s growth strategy. Perseus has also advanced the negotiations for a project finance debt facility which will 
be  established  in  the  coming  months  to  supplement  existing  cash  balances  in  funding  the  development  of 
Sissingué.

Directors’ report 
 
Following the acquisition of Yaouré, contracts  for all material work packages to complete  the Yaouré Definitive 
Feasibility Study (“DFS”) have been awarded to a range of consultants and contractors. The environmental permit 
(“EISA”) for Yaouré is expected to be formally granted by the government of Côte d’Ivoire in the coming months.  
 
Exploration  continued  in  Ghana  and  Côte  d’Ivoire throughout  the  year, with  commencement  of  exploration  on 
two new Côte d’Ivoire properties, and drilling at several promising new prospects at Edikan.   
 
The  group’s  Proved  and  Probable  Ore  Reserves  as  at  30  June  2016  at  Edikan  and  Sissingué  decreased  to  59.6 
million tonnes (“Mt”) containing 2.55 million ounces of gold after allowing for mining depletion. At the end of the 
year, the group’s Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources (inclusive of Ore Reserves) were 6.36 million ounces 
of gold and Inferred Mineral Resources were 2.32 million ounces of gold. As a result of the acquisition the group 
has acquired an additional 5.2 million ounces of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources1, including 3.2 million 
ounces of Proven and Probable Ore Reserves1 relating to the Yaouré project.  
 
1.  Cautionary statement: The estimates for Yaouré are Foreign Estimates under the ASX Listing Rules and Historical Estimates under
Canadian NI 43-101 as at 24 November 2015 (Mineral Resource) and 14 May 2015 (Ore Reserve) and are not reported in accordance 
with the JORC Code. A qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify these estimates as current Mineral Resources or 
Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC code and the Company is not treating these estimates as current.  It is uncertain that 
following evaluation and/or further exploration work these estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves 
in accordance with the JORC Code. For further information regarding the treatment of the estimates, the reader is referred to page 45 
of this report.
Corporate 
 
On 29 February 2016, Perseus announced that the Boards of Perseus and Amara had reached agreement on the 
terms of a recommended combination of Perseus and Amara via a UK scheme of arrangement.  
 
Under  the  proposal  Amara  shareholders  were  entitled  to  receive  0.68  new  Perseus  shares  and  0.34  unlisted, 
transferrable Perseus warrants for every Amara share held. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one 
Perseus  share  at  A$0.44  for  a  period  of  36  months.  This  represented  a  combined  premium  for  Amara 
shareholders  of  42.2%  to  Amara’s  mid-market  closing  price  on  26  February  2016  or  28.3%  to  Amara’s  20-day 
VWAP. 
 
On 8 April 2016 the  Amara shareholders  voted overwhelmingly to approve  the  scheme  of arrangement. On 15 
April 2016 the High Court of Justice in England and Wales sanctioned the scheme of arrangement and it became 
effective from 18 April 2016. 
 
A total of 285,862,532 new Perseus shares were then issued to the owners of Amara shares, with ownership of 
Perseus  prior  to  any  exercise  of  warrants  in  the  ratio  of  64.9%  original  Perseus  shareholders  and  35.1%  new 
(former Amara) shareholders. In the event that all of the warrants are exercised in full, Perseus will benefit from 
additional equity funding of approximately $62.9 million. 
 
Two former directors of Amara, Messrs John McGloin and Alex Davidson have joined the Board of Perseus as non-
executive  directors.  This  expands  the  Board  to  a  total  of 7  directors  including 5  non-executive  and  2  executive 
directors.  Messrs  John  McGloin  and  Alex  Davidson  bring  a  wealth  of  highly  regarded,  international  mining 
experience to the Perseus Board. 
 
Following completion of the transaction Perseus now has:
  A balanced and diversified portfolio of high quality operating, development and exploration assets that
includes Edikan, Sissingué and Yaouré;
  A  strong  balance  sheet  that  can  be  utilised  together  with  strong  projected  cashflows  from  Edikan
(following the end of the 2017 financial year) to fund the development of Sissingué and Yaouré;
Page 4
Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report
  An  experienced  mine  construction  and  operating  team,  combined  with  members  of  the  current 
management  team  that  oversaw  the  construction  and  delivery  of  Edikan  into  production  on  time  and 
under budget, and an existing development presence in Côte d’Ivoire;
  A highly capable and reliable Board and management team that has many years of collective experience
operating in West Africa and other developing regions; and
  Well established “social licences” to operate in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.
EGM, Ghana 
 
The EGM is located on the Ayanfuri and Nanankaw mining leases spanning the border between the Central and 
Western  Provinces  of  the  Republic  of  Ghana,  in  West  Africa.  These  mining  leases,  together  with  the  adjoining 
exploration license areas of Grumesa, Kwatechi, Dunkwa, Nsuaem and Nkotumso that are also held or optioned 
by the group, cover a total area of about 383 square kilometres. The group owns a 90% interest in the EGM, with 
the remaining 10% a free carried interest owned by the Ghanaian government. 
 
Gold production operations 
 
Operating results at the EGM for the 12 months to 30 June 2016 and the corresponding period in 2015 were as

Total  mill  throughput  for  the  period  was  6,608k  tonnes  of  ore  grading  0.86  g/t  of  gold,  3.3%  higher  than  the 
previous period. Gold recovery of  83.1%, was 5.5%  lower than the previous period.  The reduction in ore grade 
and recovery was largely as a result of the majority of ore processed at Edikan being drawn from relatively low 
grade ore stockpiles as mining of fresh ore from the AG pit ceased in mid-August 2015 and limited quantities of 
fresh  ore  being  mined  from  the  Fobinso,  Fetish  and  Chirawewa  pits  early  in  the  financial  year  following  the 
delayed access to those pits as detailed below.    
 
Gold  production  for  the  period  was  153,902  ounces  at  an  all-in  site  cost  (including  production,  royalties, 
investment  in  pre-stripping  and  inventory,  development  and  sustaining  capital)  of  US$1,351/oz.  The  27.5% 
decrease in gold production during the period, relative to the 2015 financial year, is due to a lower average head 
grade along with decreased recoveries.  
 
On  12  August  2015,  the  Ghanaian  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (“EPA”)  formally  granted  environmental 
approval for full-scale mining of the Fetish, Chirawewa, Bokitsi (collectively referred to as the “Eastern Pits”) and 
Esuajah North gold deposits. The environmental approval opened the way for mining contractor, African Mining 
Services (“AMS”), to mine in the Eastern Pits area under the terms of their new contract with Perseus. Early in the 
2016 financial year, AMS deployed equipment to the Eastern Pits area, including that previously deployed in the 
AG pit, and in conjunction with Perseus has accelerated mine production with the aim of recovering time lost due 
to the delayed EPA approval.  
 
A  total  of  14,688k  bank  cubic  metres  (“bcm”)  of  ore  and  waste  were  mined  during  the  period  from  the 
Chirawewa,  Fetish,  AF  Gap  and  Fobinso  pits  as  well  as  from  the  decommissioned  heap  leach  pads,  including 
1,259k tonnes of oxide ore at 0.83g/t gold and 4,046k tonnes of oxide ore at 1.12g/t gold. The 137.8% increase in
Page 5
Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report 
 
total  material  moved  relative  to  the  prior  period  was  due  to  an  accelerated  amount  of  waste  stripping  of  the 
Eastern Pits during the year following the delayed access to these pits at the beginning of the year. 
 
Ore stockpiles (including both high and low grade ore but not mineralised waste) plus crushed ore decreased to 
2,059k  tonnes  grading  0.62  g/t  containing  approximately  40,853  oz  of  gold.  This  included  approximately  38% 
oxide ore and 62% primary ore. 
 
During the financial year Perseus commenced a period of intensive capital investment at Edikan relating to the 
construction  of  infrastructure  and  relocation  housing  required  for  mining  access,  the  acquisition  of  additional 
power  generation  units  along  with  processing  plant  improvements.  All  works,  including  civil  and  infrastructure 
works,  commenced  and  as  at  the  date  of  this  report  are  on  or  near  schedule  for  the  completion  of  the 
construction of replacement houses required to relocate current residents of the Eastern Pits and Esuajah North 
blast zones. Construction of the houses required for both the Eastern Pits residents and Esuajah North residents is 
scheduled for completion by the end of December 2016.  
 
Commissioning of a diesel fired power  station to ensure 100%  power self-sufficiency for Edikan in the event of 
possible  future  power  shortages  in  Ghana  which  commenced  during  the  financial  year,  was  completed  in  July 
2016. Furthermore, planned upgrades to the processing plant to improve run time and reduce maintenance costs 
are on track for implementation during the six months ending 31 December 2016. 
 
The all-in site cost (including production, royalties, investment in pre-stripping and inventory, development and 
sustaining  capital  divided  by  gold  ounces  produced)  for  the  period  of  US$1,351/oz  is  54.0%  higher  than  the 
previous period of US$877/oz. This is due to an increase in the operating cost base due to accelerated mining and 
waste  stripping  to mitigate  the  effects  of the  delayed  access  to  the  Eastern Pits,  higher  capital  expenditure  on 
relocation  housing,  building  of  a  power  station  and  process  plant  improvements,  combined  with  less  gold 
production resulting from a decrease in gold recovery and head grade of processed ore.

Mining costs per tonne of material mined have decreased from the prior period due to a decrease in underlying 
costs following the negotiation of two new mining contracts in 2015. The first new mining contract was awarded 
to Rocksure  International Limited for the  cutback  of the Fobinso pit, commencing  in January  2015. The second 
was awarded to AMS for the provision of mining services for the Eastern Pits. This work commenced just before 
the end of the prior period. Both new contracts represent material reductions in mining costs and the full effect 
has been seen in the current period. In addition, the tonnes of material mined has increased significantly from the 
prior  period  and  this  has  the  effect  of  reducing  the  unit  mining  costs  including  mining  overheads,  mining 
contractor management fees etc.  
 
Processing  costs  have  decreased  from  the  prior  period  due  to  a  reduction  in  consumable  costs  as  well  as  a 
reduction in consumption rates of some consumables due to improvements in operational efficiency. General and
Page 6
Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report 
 
administrative costs have decreased from the prior period due to cost reduction initiatives across all departments 
to build on reducing the operating cost base to date. 
 
Of the 153,957 ounces of gold that were sold at an average delivered price of US$1,224/oz, 37,810 ounces were 
delivered under forward sales contracts at a weighted average price of US$1,357/oz while the balance of the gold 
sales were made at prevailing spot prices or short term spot deferred contracts.  
 
As at 30 June 2016, the company held forward gold sale contracts totalling 211,190 ounces of gold at a weighted 
average  price of US$1,271/oz.  Included in this are  95,000 ounces  of hedging contracted at  a weighted average 
price of US$1,306/oz specifically to support the proposed Sissingué project finance debt facility. On 1 July 2016, a 
further  5,000  ounces  at  US$1,333  in  forward  metal  contracts  were  also  added  to  the  contracts  entered  into 
specifically to support the proposed Sissingué project finance debt facility. 
 
During  the  year,  the  group  received  a  partial  payment  of  the  outstanding  VAT  debt  from  the  GRA,  totalling 
GHS35.4 million (US$9.3 million). In early July 2016, Perseus received further payments of the outstanding VAT 
debt  from  the  GRA  totalling  GHS44.9  million  (US$11.4  million).  Perseus  is  continuing  to  work  with  the 
Government in the usual course of business with regards to VAT recovery. 
 
Exploration 
 
During  the  period  12,126  metres  were  drilled  on  various  targets  at  Edikan  and  on  adjoining  licence  areas, 
focussing on near-mine targets that could add incremental benefit to the current operation. 
 
Several small drilling programs were conducted on the Edikan mining leases and neighbouring licences. A number 
of  exploration  targets  were  tested  near  the  Fetish  and  Bokitsi  deposits  with  generally  modest  results.  Similar 
reverse  circulation  (“RC”)  drill  testing  of  shallow  targets  was  undertaken  at  Mampong  South,  Fobinso  East  and 
Kwadjo San which were unsuccessful. RC drilling around the Besem North prospect returned marginal results. 
 
At  Fobinso  North  drilling  beneath  historical  workings  developed  on  a  quartz-veined  and  altered  granite  body 
returned intersections indicating the potential for a significant body of low-grade near surface gold mineralisation 
over  a  200m  strike  length.  Further  drilling  is  underway  to  define  the  limits  and  test  the  continuity  of  the 
mineralisation.  
 
Soil sampling at the Kwekutikrom prospect, 9km south of the Edikan plant site, defined several zones of moderate 
to  strong  gold-in-soil  anomalism  extending  semi-continuously  in  two  subparallel  zones  over  a  strike  length  of 
3km. Encouraging results on sampling of dump material from an artisanal shaft was followed up with two short 
diamond holes. The mineralisation is open-ended and will be subjected to further drilling in the coming months.  
 
Exploration  at  Edikan  is  now  entering  a  stage  where  traditional  methods  of  exploration,  largely  driven  by  soil 
geochemistry, is delivering poorer results.  Consequently, in late 2015 the Company embarked on a major review 
of the extensive geological, geochemical and geophysical datasets it has acquired over the Edikan district with the 
intention of conducting a major targeting exercise.  This work, which will include the acquisition of new datasets 
such as airborne electromagnetic surveys over the whole project plus more discrete ground geophysical surveys 
over  specific  areas  of  interest,  is  currently  underway  and  is  expected  to  deliver  a  new  generation  of  targets 
towards the end of 2016. 
 
EGM Mineral Resource estimate:  
The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  for  Edikan  was  prepared  by  independent  consultant,  RungePincockMinarco 
(“RPM”)  in  accordance  with  the  JORC  Code  –  2012  Edition  on  1  May  2014  and  updated  in  March  2015  and 
December  2015  to  allow  for  additions  to  the  Chirawewa  and  Mampong  deposits  respectively.    The  Mineral 
Resource estimates have been amended to allow for mining depletion by Perseus in the AF Gap, Fobinso, Fetish 
and Chirawewa pits up to 30 June 2016.
Page 7
Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report 
 
The updated global Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource estimate for Edikan is now estimated as 143.7Mt 
grading 1.1g/t gold, containing 5,011k ounces of gold, as at 30 June 2016. A further 61.6Mt of material grading 
1.0g/t gold and containing a further 2,005k ounces of gold are classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource.

SGP, Côte d’Ivoire 
 
The SGP is located in the north of Côte d’Ivoire and lies within the Tengrela Est exploitation permit that comprises 
an  area  of  446km².  The  permit  is  located  along  a  structural/stratigraphic  corridor  within  the  Syama-Boundiali 
greenstone belt approximately 150km south-southeast of the Morila gold mine (approximately 7Moz) in Mali and 
65km west northwest of Randgold’s Tongon deposit (approximately 4.3Moz) in Côte d’Ivoire. The group owns an 
86% interest in the SGP, with the remaining 10% a free carried interest reserved for the Ivorian government and 
4% owned by local interests. 
 
Project development 
 
In late July 2015 the terms of a Mining Convention for Sissingué were finalised in accordance with Côte d’Ivoire’s 
legislated Mining Code and executed by Perseus and the Ministers for Industry and Mines, Economy and Finance, 
and  Budget.  Following  this,  a  programme  of  early  works  was  completed,  including  Front  End  Engineering  and 
Design  work  by  Lycopodium,  construction  of  site  access  roads,  initial  earthworks,  early  clearing  and  fencing, 
design and procurement of elements of the mine camp and certain items of mobile equipment. 
 
Organisation  structures  were  developed  for  both  the  construction  and  operating  phases  of  the  project  and 
Perseus recruited a small number of construction staff. A Recruitment Committee involving representatives of all 
villages located in the vicinity of Sissingué was established to ensure fair allocation of employment opportunities 
to local residents during both the construction and operating phases of the project. 
 
A  programme  of  engagement  was  initiated  with  all  national,  regional  and  local  government  and  community 
security stakeholders to ensure that all parties are adequately briefed on details of the project and committed to 
maintaining the peace and security in the vicinity of Sissingué.

Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report 
 
After  the  successful  raising  of  equity  finance,  execution  plans  for  the  full-scale  development  of  Sissingué  were 
activated early in the 2017 financial year.  At a total development cost to complete of US$100 million, Sissingué is 
currently forecast  to produce  385,000 ounces of gold at an all-in  site  cost  of US$632/ounce over a 5.25 period 
from first gold production, to generate an un-geared after tax internal rate of return of 27% at an average gold 
price of US$1,200/ounce. 
 
Financing 
 
The full scale development of Sissingué is intended to be financed through a mix of equity finance (US$40 million) 
and project debt finance (US$60 million). Perseus successfully completed the raising of $102 million in July 2016, 
US$40  million  of  which  has  been  allocated  to  fund  the  equity  portion  of  Sissingué’s  capital  budget.  Material 
progress  has  been  made  towards  establishing  a  US$60  million  project  financing  facility  for  Sissingué  and  final 
credit  approval  and  documentation  of  the  facility  to  be  provided  by  Macquarie  Bank  and  BNP  Paribas  are 
anticipated to be completed early in the 2017 financial year. 
 
To de-risk the project debt financing and ultimately the project economics, a total of 100,000 ounces of gold has 
been  sold  forward  at  an  average  price  of  approximately  US$1,308/ounce  in  satisfaction  of  the  project  lenders’ 
hedging requirement of not less than 100,000 ounces at a price of at least US$1,200/ounce. 
 
Project implementation       
 
Negotiations with Lycopodium were well advanced on finalising a suite of contracts, accounting for approximately 
50% of estimated construction scope. Subsequent to year end these contracts were awarded to Lycopodium and 
signed.  With  the  execution  of  the  construction  contracts  and  given  that  all  required  licencing,  permitting  and 
landowner compensation has been completed, re-commencement of site works is expected to occur early in 2017 
financial year.  
 
Given  the  quality  of  the  project  planning  and  the  assembled  project  management  team,  construction  and 
commissioning of Sissingué  is expected to progress reasonably quickly and hopefully  without incident  with first 
production of gold now scheduled to occur around mid-2018 financial year. 
 
Exploration 
 
During the period, 16,160 metres were drilled in Côte d’Ivoire, focussing on the Mahalé exploration licence and 
the Sissingué exploitation licence.  
 
A total of 7,461m of drilling was completed on the Mahalé licence, located 43km west-southwest of the currently 
planned SGP plant site. Over 5000m of RC and 890m of diamond drilling were undertaken at the Bélé East and 
West zones to upgrade the resources there to Indicated category. Further RC and diamond drilling is planned at 
both Bélé East and West to infill the current drill pattern and investigate possible extensions both along strike and 
down plunge. A review of previous soil and auger geochemical results from sampling programs has highlighted a 
number of anomalies that remain untested, drilling to investigate these targets is a high priority for the second 
half of 2016.    
 
A program of auger drilling with rotary air blast (“RAB”) drilling to follow up auger anomalies was conducted on 
the  Sissingué  exploitation  licence  to  evaluate  areas  of  potential  geochemical  masking  by  transported  regolith 
along  the  Papara-Sissingué-Kanakono  mineralised  corridor  north  of  Sissingué.  A  number  of  modest  auger 
anomalies  around  the  M’basso  prospect  were  subsequently  tested  through  a  RAB  drilling  program  for  the 
presence  of  in-situ mineralisation.  Overall  results  from  the  RAB  drilling  were  not  encouraging.    It  is  planned  to 
conduct a major review of all historical drilling, geochemical and geophysical data from the Sissingué project as 
part of an integrated targeting exercise to drive future exploration.

SGP Mineral Resource estimate  
 
In  October  2014,  independent  mining  industry  consultant,  Snowden  Mining  Industry  Consultants  (“Snowden”) 
was commissioned by Perseus to estimate Mineral Resources at the SGP deposit. The Mineral Resource estimate 
was prepared in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 Edition. The Mineral Resource estimate is summarised in 
the  following  table  that  reports  the  Resources  by  category  and  area,  above  a  0.6  g/t  gold  cut-off  grade.    The 
classification  categories  of  Inferred,  Indicated  and  Measured  under  the  JORC  Code  are  equivalent  to  the  CIM 
categories of the same name (CIM, 2014). 
 
The  global  Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  for  the  SGP  is  estimated  as  16.0Mt  grading  1.7g/t  gold, 
containing 880k ounces of gold. A further 1.1Mt of material grading 1.7g/t gold, containing a further 63k ounces 
of gold are classified as Inferred Mineral Resources. Details of these estimates are shown below in tables 6 and 7.

SGP Ore Reserve estimate 
 
RPM was commissioned by Perseus to complete a mining study and a subsequent independent estimate of the 
open cut Ore Reserves for the SGP. The Ore Reserve Statement estimates the Ore Reserves as at 1 February 2015 
and has been undertaken in compliance with the requirements of the reporting guidelines of the JORC Code 2012 
Edition.  A  total  of  5.5  Mt  of  open  cut  Ore  Reserves  grading  2.4g/t  gold  were  estimated  for  the  SGP  as  at  1 
February 2015 classified as follows in table 8.

Yaouré, Côte d’Ivoire 
 
On 18 April 2016, a scheme of arrangement pursuant to which Perseus acquired all of the outstanding shares in 
Amara  took  effect  resulting  inter  alia,  in  Perseus  owning  Yaouré,  one  of  West  Africa’s  highest  quality  pre-
development stage projects. 
 
DFS 
 
Following the acquisition of Yaouré, Perseus’s study team immediately commenced assessing the scope of work 
required to undertake a comprehensive DFS of the project. Following this assessment which included examining 
all of the work previously conducted by Amara, contracts for all material work packages required to complete the 
DFS  were  awarded  to  a  range  of  consultants  and  contractors  including  RPM  who  will  perform  the  role  of  lead 
consultant for the study. 
 
An integral part of the DFS is an initial 42,000 metre infill diamond drilling and RC drilling programme designed to 
enhance  Perseus’s  confidence  in  the  existing  Mineral  Resource  estimate  as  well  as  examine  opportunities  for 
incremental expansion of the Mineral Resource. The drilling programme includes grade control drilling in targeted 
areas.  A  40,000  metre  RAB  drilling  program  to  sterilise  the  planned  sites  of  mine  infrastructure  as  well  as 
geotechnical and hydrogeological drilling, will commence early in the 2017 financial year.  
 
Discussions with the Ivorian Environmental Protection Agency have advanced since acquisition of the project and 
an  ESIA  for  Yaouré  is  expected  to  be  formally  granted  by  the  government  of  Côte  d’Ivoire  early  in  the  2017 
financial year.  
 
It is expected that the DFS will take a total of 12 months to complete from commencement which should see the 
full study results being available around the middle of 2017. Drilling results and other information associated with 
progress of the DFS will be progressively released as the study progresses. 
 
Exploration 
 
Extensive soil sampling was conducted on the Yaouré East and West properties following the Amara acquisition.  
Work has focused on the Allekran  North prospect  on the Yaouré West  permit where  soil sampling has defined 
extensive  gold-in-soils  anomalism  along  the  faulted  contact  between  metasediments  and  mafic  volcanics.  Soil 
sampling is also being extended over the Angovia North and Diale-Gorankro areas on the Yaouré West permit to 
complete  soil  geochemical  coverage  over  all  those  parts  of  the  permit  not  previously  sampled,  with  auger  and 
RAB drilling planned to follow up anomalies generated by the soil sampling.
Page 12
Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report 
 
Other permits, Côte d’Ivoire 
 
Two  new  Exploration Permits  were  granted  during  the  period  –  Zouan  Hounien  in  the  Ity  district  of  southwest 
Côte d’Ivoire, and Kounahiri in central Côte d’Ivoire.  Exploration commenced almost immediately, with stream 
sediment  sampling  on  the  Kounahiri  permit  followed  up  by  soil  sampling  over  anomalous  catchments,  and  soil 
sampling at Zouan Hounien.  Low to moderate tenor geochemical anomalies were defined on both properties and 
work to investigate these anomalies is ongoing.
Burkina Faso 
 
Perseus has a farm-in agreement with West African Gold Limited (“WAG”), an Australian unlisted junior explorer, 
in respect of four exploration permits (Koutakou, Barga, Touya and Tangayé) in the North of Burkina Faso. An air-
core drilling program to follow up on a large, low tenor gold in soil anomaly defined on the Koutakou licence in 
early 2015 has been deferred due to ongoing delays in renewal of the permit. 
 
Sierra Leone 
 
As part of the scheme of arrangement with Amara, Perseus also acquired the Baomahun project in Sierra Leone. 
Subsequent  to  year  end  Perseus  has  been  advised  by  the  Sierra  Leone  National  Minerals  Agency  that  the 
Minister for Mines and Mineral Resources has cancelled Mineral Right ML 02/08 on which the Baomahun gold 
deposit  is  located.  This  action  has  been  taken  following  Perseus’s  advice  to  the  Minerals  Advisory  Board  that 
development  of  the  Baomahun  Gold  Project  as  defined  by  Amara  is  not  economically  feasible  at  current  gold 
prices  and  that  further  exploration  success  and  a  positive  feasibility  study  would  be  required  before  Perseus 
could consider committing to development.

GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS FOR RESERVE AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
Resource  drilling  is  conducted  by  NQ  and  HQ  diamond  drilling  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by  high  quality,  dry,  RC 
drilling. Drill hole positions are surveyed to high accuracy  with a DGPS and down hole deviations measured at 
30m  intervals  with  Reflex  or  Flexit  multi-shot  survey  equipment.  Drilling  is  logged  in  detail  for  lithology, 
alteration,  structure  and  mineralisation  and  is  then  validated  and  imported  into  a  master  database  using 
Datashed.  Sampling  is  typically  at  1  meter  intervals  and  samples  are  analysed  for  gold  by  50g  Fire  Assay  at 
external recognised laboratories. QA/QC procedures are industry standard with certified standards, blanks and 
duplicate samples inserted into the sample stream at a rate of 1 in 20 samples. 
 
Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are prepared and reported by suitably qualified Perseus personnel 
or external consultants (Competent Person) in accordance with the JORC code and other industry standards. The 
modifying  factors  for  EGM’s  Reserve  estimates  are  based  on  information  from  the  actual  operation.  Any 
supporting information and documentation including geological interpretation that are prepared and supplied by 
Perseus  personnel  are  reviewed  by  the  Competent  Person.  Block  models  are  visually  checked  by  Perseus 
personnel for comparison against the original exploration drilling data.

FINANCIAL RESULTS 
 
The group recorded a net loss after tax of $37.5 million for the period, compared to a net profit after tax of $92.2 
million in the previous financial year. This loss represents a 141% decrease, compared to the prior period profit. 
This is due to a number of factors, including:
  A  decrease  in  the  gold  produced  due  to  a  lower  average  head  grade  and  recoveries  as  a  result  of
processing low grade stockpiles while the Eastern pits were being stripped; 
Increases in total operating costs as a result of greater mining activity, offset by lower unit costs;
 
  Foreign exchange gain decreasing by $43.2 million from $52.4 million in the prior year to $9.2 million in 
the current year due mainly to the depreciation of the AUD against the USD and the revaluation of the 
intercompany loan;
  Write-off of exploration;  
  Offset by a write up of low grade run of mine stockpiles to net realisable value due to a higher gold price.

Equity capital raising 
On 20 June 2016, Perseus announced an equity placement and an accelerated entitlements offer totalling $102 
million to new and existing institutional and retail investors to fund Perseus’s growth strategy. The institutional 
placement and the accelerated institutional entitlement offer closed on 22 June 2016 while the retail portion of 
the entitlement offer closed on 15 July 2016. In total 203.9 million ordinary shares were issued as a part of the 
equity raising at a price of $0.50 per new share issued.  
 
Revenue protection 
 
A  total  of  37,810  ounces  were  delivered  under  forward  sales  contracts  at  a  weighted  average  price  of 
US$1,357/oz while the balance of the gold sales were made at prevailing spot prices, or under short dated spot 
deferred  contracts.  Included  in  this  are  100,000  ounces  of  hedging  contracted  at  a  weighted  average  price  of 
US$1,308/oz specifically to support the proposed Sissingué project finance debt facility. 
 
Metal Markets 
 
From  1  July  2015  to  30  June  2016  the  price  of  gold  increased  by  12.8%  to  US$1,321/oz,  (30  June  2015: 
US$1,171/oz).  Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  the  gold  price  increased  and  is  currently  averaging 
1.5% higher than 30 June 2016.  
 
The risk posed to Perseus’s business by the gold price has, to a certain extent, been mitigated by partial hedging 
of its gold production as outlined above. Perseus has no reason to believe that the gold market fundamentals will 
not remain consistent with the current position over the short to medium term. 
 
Outlook 
 
Edikan
  Gold production for the EGM for the year ended 30 June 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 205,000 to
245,000 ounces at an estimated total site cash cost of US$1,110/oz to US$1,325/oz.
  Continue  to  implement  improved  grade  control  practices  and  investigate  potential  opportunities  for 
improvements  in  grade  estimation,  fine-tune  plant  metallurgical  performance  and  maximise  SAG  mill 
throughput and continue to implement business improvement initiatives across all departments at Edikan 
including the installation of a power plant on site at Edikan.
  Complete construction of houses to relocate former residents of the Eastern Pits mine take area. 
  Complete  the  current  re-assessment  of  geological  datasets  with  the  aim  of  formulating  near  mine 
exploration programmes targeting high grade mineralisation that can be mined using either underground 
mining or open pit mining methods.
Sissingué
  Finalise contracts for 50% of scope of work of the Sissingué processing facility with Lycopodium, (signed
subsequent to year end).
  Commence detailed design and procurement. 
  Mobilise Lycopodium to site. 
  Re-commence construction of Sissingué. 
  Finalise the project debt facility required under the project funding plan. 
  Continue drilling of the Bélé deposit to expand the Mineral Resource ahead of optimisation and possible
inclusion in the Sissingué mine plan.

AMS.  In  addition,  contracts  related  to  approximately  50%  of  the  scope  of  work  for  the  Sissingué  mine 
development  have  been  awarded  to  Lycopodium.  The  balance  of  the  Sissingué  scope  of  works  will  be 
supervised by Perseus’s in-house development team;
2)  On  20  June  2016,  Perseus  announced  an  equity  placement  and  an  accelerated  entitlements  offer.  The 
institutional  portion  of  the  offering  closed  oversubscribed  on  22  June  2016  and  the  retail  portion  of  the 
offering closed subsequent  to year-end. In total, $102.0 million of equity was raised from new and existing 
institutional and retail investors to fund Perseus’s growth strategy of which $7.7 million relating to the retail 
portion was received in July 2016; and
3)  On  28  July  2016,  375,000  performance  rights  successfully  vested  under  the  terms  of  the  company’s 
Performance  Rights  Plan  and  converted  to  ordinary  shares  on  a  1  for  1  basis  on  satisfaction  of  specified 
conditions.  The  shares  were  issued  to  employees  at  nil  consideration  as  part  of  employee  remuneration.

REMUNERATION REPORT (audited)
This  report  outlines  the  remuneration  arrangements  in  place  for  Perseus’s  non-executive  directors,  executive 
directors  and  other  key management  personnel  (“KMP”)  for  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2016  in  accordance 
with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Act”) and its regulations. This information has been audited as required by 
section 308(3C) of the Act.   
 
The remuneration report has been set out under the following main headings: 
1.  Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration 
2.  Details of remuneration (including link to performance)

1.  Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration 
 
Remuneration committee 
 
The  remuneration  committee  (the  “committee”)  assists  the  board  to  fulfill  its  responsibilities  to  shareholders  and 
other stakeholders by ensuring the group has remuneration policies for fairly and competitively rewarding executives 
with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality board and 
executive management team. The committee’s decisions on reward structures are based on the state of the market 
for  experienced  resources  industry  executives,  remuneration  packages  for  executives  and  employees  performing 
comparative  roles  in  other  companies  in  the  resources  industry  and  the  size  and  complexity  of  the  group.  The 
committee comprises three independent non-executive directors.   
 
The committee is primarily responsible for making recommendations to the board on: 
  non-executive director’s fees; 
  executive remuneration (directors and other executives); and 
 
 
For  further  information  on  the  remuneration  committee’s  role,  responsibilities  and  membership  the  reader  is 
referred to the committee’s charter which is available on www.perseusmining.com.  
 
Use of remuneration advisors 
Independent  remuneration  consultants  are  engaged  by  the  committee  from  time  to  time  to  ensure  the  group’s 
remuneration  system  and  reward  practices  are  consistent  with  current  market  practices.  Various  remuneration 
arrangements in relation to the company’s key management personnel during previous financial years were based 
on  recommendations  made  by  an  independent  remuneration  consultant,  PJ  Kinder  Consulting.   Advice  was  last 
sought  out  from  PJ  Kinder  Consulting  in  2014.  Instructions  and  scope  of  terms  for  the  engagement  of  PJ  Kinder 
Consulting were issued by the committee.   
 
The board is satisfied that the remuneration recommendations made by PJ Kinder Consulting were made free from 
undue influence by the member or members of the key management personnel to whom the recommendations 
relate.  The board’s reasons for stating so are: 
(i) 
(ii)
that the instructions and terms were issued and set by the committee;  
PJ Kinder Consulting discussed its findings and recommendations with the committee only and not any 
members of the management;  
PJ Kinder Consulting’s fees were based on a time basis at rates commensurate with such professional 
services; and  
the committee had satisfied itself that PJ Kinder Consulting is a qualified and well-credentialed firm for the 
purposes of such professional advice and is independent from Perseus.

Policy and structure of non-executive directors’ remuneration  
 
Perseus’s  non-executive  director  remuneration  policy  aims  to  reward  the  directors  fairly  and  responsibly  with 
regards  to  the  demands  which  are  made  on,  and  the  responsibilities  of,  the  directors.  It  seeks  to  set  aggregate 
remuneration  of  non-executive  directors  at  a  level  which  provides  Perseus  with  the  ability  to  attract  and  retain 
directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is acceptable to shareholders. 
 
With  the  assistance  of  external  remuneration  consultants  from  time  to  time,  the  committee  reviews  fees  paid  to 
non-executive  directors  on  an  annual  basis  and  makes  recommendations  to  the  board.    The  committee  considers 
fees paid to non-executive directors of comparable companies when undertaking the annual salary review process. 
 
Any  equity  components  of  non-executive  directors’  remuneration,  including  the  issue  of  options  or  performance 
rights, are required to be approved by shareholders prior to award. 
 
Directors’ fee limits 
The  aggregate  amount  of  fees  payable  to  non-executive  directors  is  subject  to  periodic  review  and  approval  by 
shareholders.  The  maximum  amount  of  directors’  fees  that  is  currently  approved  for  payment  to  non-executive 
directors is $750,000 per annum (excluding the value of approved share based payments). The current limit of non-
executive directors’ fees was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.  
 
Directors’ fees framework 
Non-executive directors' remuneration consists of a base fee plus 9.5% statutory superannuation where the director 
is covered by Australian superannuation guarantee legislation. Board fees are not paid to executive directors as the 
time  spent  on  board  work  and  the  responsibilities  of  board  membership  are  considered  in  determining  the 
remuneration package provided to executive directors as part of their normal employment conditions. 
 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors for the year ended 30 June 2016 is detailed below.

legislation.

Policy on executive directors’ and other senior executives’ remuneration  
 
Perseus  aims  to  reward  its  executive  directors  and  other  senior  executives  with  a  level  of  remuneration 
commensurate with their position and responsibilities within the group. In doing so, it aims to: 
 

provide competitive rewards that attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives; 
align  executive  rewards  with  the  achievement  of  strategic  objectives  and  performance  of  the  group  and  the 
creation of value for shareholders; 
ensure total remuneration is competitive and reasonable; and 
comply with applicable legal requirements and appropriate standards of governance.
 
 
 
In  consultation  with  external  remuneration  consultants,  the  group  has  developed  an  executive  remuneration 
framework that is market competitive and is consistent with the reward strategy of the organisation. 
 
Executive remuneration structure 
 
The executive remuneration framework has two components, namely:

The fixed component of an executive’s remuneration comprises base salary and superannuation contributions. The 
size of the executive’s salary package is based on the scope of each executive’s role, the level of knowledge, skill and 
experience  required to satisfactorily perform the role  and the individual executive’s performance  in the role.  The 
proportion of an executive’s total fixed salary package that is paid as superannuation is at the executive’s discretion, 
subject to compliance with relevant superannuation guarantee legislation.
fixed salary package including base salary and benefits such as superannuation; and 
variable remuneration.
The  committee  annually  reviews  each  executive’s  performance  and  benchmarks  the  executive’s  salary  package 
against appropriate market comparisons using information and advice provided by external consultants. There are 
no guarantees of salary increases included in any executive’s employment contract. 
 
Variable remuneration  
The  objective  of  providing  a  variable  “at  risk”  component  within  executive  directors’  and  senior  executives’  total 
remuneration packages is to directly align a proportion of their remuneration to achievement of the group’s financial 
and strategic objectives with the objective of creating shareholder wealth. The group has a remuneration framework 
which sets out the basis of short term incentives (“STI”) and long term incentives (“LTI”), these are discussed further 
below. 
 
Receipt of variable remuneration in any form is not guaranteed under any executive’s employment contract. 
 
The  remuneration  of  executive  directors  and  senior  executives  including  both  fixed  and  variable  remuneration 
components for the year ended 30 June 2016 is detailed in table 2 of this report. 
 
STI 
 
The STI is the annual component of the “at risk” reward opportunity, which takes the form of a cash bonus. The STI is 
reliant on the achievement of job related KPI’s, both financial and non-financial, over a mix of group, function and 
individual targets. The objective of a STI is to align the performance of the individual to the short term operational 
and financial objectives of the group.

REMUNERATION REPORT – continued 
 
After the board evaluates and approves the group’s operating budget for the forthcoming financial year, a series of 
physical, financial and business sustainability targets are set. These are used to determine the KPI’s of the CEO and 
executives, their direct reports and so on down the organisation structure. 
 
These  performance  measures  are  chosen  to  represent  the  key  drivers  of  short  term  success  for  the  group  with 
reference to the group’s long term strategy. The CEO and executives have a target STI opportunity of 0% up to 33% 
of fixed remuneration.  
 
On  an  annual  basis  the  board  will  evaluate  the  group’s  physical,  financial  and  business  sustainability  targets  to 
determine whether these were met, give consideration to the group’s external environment including the  outlook 
for future years and then determine the STI pool that is available for payment to individuals. Each individual has a 
performance review conducted to measure performance against set KPI’s. 
 
The remuneration committee will then, after consideration of performance against KPI’s and recommendation from 
the CEO, determine the amount if any of the STI to be paid to each executive. STI payments are awarded  after the 
conclusion  of  the  assessment  period  and  confirmation  of  financial  results/individual  performance  for  all  eligible 
participants to the extent they reach  specific targets that were set at the beginning of the financial year. The cash 
bonuses are inclusive of superannuation. 
 
Given the group has a LTI plan the board does not consider it appropriate to defer a portion of the STI. The board has 
discretion in the approval of STI outcomes.  
 
For the financial year ended 30 June 2016, STI payments representing 21% of fixed remuneration were made to Mr 
Horochuk, as determined by the remuneration committee with due regard to the performance of the EGM and the 
respective individual throughout the financial year. This STI payment is detailed in table 2 below, with the STI paid in 
July 2016. STI’s for the 2016 financial year have not yet been determined for the remaining senior executives as at 
the date of this report. 
 
LTI 
 
The LTI is the “at risk” component that takes the form of an equity based incentive designed to attract, motivate and 
retain high quality employees at the same time as aligning their interests with those of the group’s shareholders. LTI 
awards are made under the Performance Rights Plan (“PRP”) and give eligible employees rights to acquire shares in 
Perseus subject to vesting conditions. 
 
The company uses both total shareholder return (“TSR”) and individual achievement of a KPI rating of 3 or more over 
the vesting period as the performance measure for the LTI. TSR was selected as the LTI performance measure as it 
links rewards of the executives to the creation of long term shareholder wealth. Furthermore vesting only occurs if 
the group performs in the 50th percentile of its peer group or above, the greater the outperformance the greater the 
reward to the executive. 
 
The peer group chosen for comparison, having considered the following factors: ASX listing; TSX listing; commodity 
focus; geographic focus; and business development stage, is shown below.

Subject to the performance conditions, the vesting  and measurement periods for the rights range from one and a 
half to three years from the commencement of the period. The vesting schedule is as follows: 
 
Relative TSR over the vesting period 
Below the 50th percentile 
At the 50th percentile 
Between the 50th and the 75th percentile 
Above the 75th percentile 
 
TSR performance  and individual KPI performance  is monitored on an annual basis. If the hurdles are  not achieved 
during the performance period, the rights may lapse and no re-testing of rights is permitted. 
 
Table  7  provides  details of rights  awarded and vested during the year and table  5  provides  details of the value  of 
rights awarded, exercised and lapsed during the year. 
 
Where a participant ceases employment for any reason, any unvested rights will lapse and be forfeited, subject to 
the discretion of the board in the case of death, disability, retirement or redundancy. 
 
In  the  event  of  a  change  of  control  of  the  group  all  unvested  rights  automatically  vest  and  are  automatically 
exercised.

For all performance rights granted after 1 January 2014, based on the group’s performance over the relevant period 
up to 30 June 2016, Perseus is below the 50th percentile of the peer group. If the ranking remains unchanged at the 
end of the measurement period of each performance right tranche granted, then all performance rights would not 
vest regardless of achievement of minimum individual employee KPI rating requirements.

Under his employment contract with Perseus, Mr. Quartermaine is currently entitled to receive fixed remuneration 
including  a  base  salary  and  superannuation,  plus  variable  remuneration  including  performance  rights,  options  and 
cash bonuses determined under the STI/LTI plans and at the discretion of the board. A summary of these and other 
key terms of Mr. Quartermaine’s employment contract are described below and set out in table 3 below. 
 
Fixed  remuneration  –  Mr.  Quartermaine’s  annual  salary  is  set  at  $740,563  per  annum,  inclusive  of  statutory 
superannuation entitlements.  
 
Variable remuneration – Mr. Quartermaine is eligible to participate in the group’s STI and LTI scheme as described 
above.  
 
Statutory entitlements 
Mr. Quartermaine is entitled to 10 days sick leave per annum, 20 days of annual leave and long service leave of 13 
weeks after 10 years of service. 
 
Termination of contract 
Perseus  can  terminate  Mr.  Quartermaine’s  contract  without  notice  under  certain  circumstances  including  but  not 
limited to material breaches of contract, grave misconduct, dishonesty, fraud or bringing the group into disrepute. 
Mr. Quartermaine may terminate the contract by giving Perseus three months’ notice, whilst Perseus may terminate 
the contract by giving Mr. Quartermaine the greater of six months or a period that is not less than that specified by 
the  Fair  Work  Act  2009  (Cth)  and  the  National  Employment  Standards.  In  the  case  of  Perseus,  it  may  at  its  sole 
discretion,  terminate  the  contract  sooner  than  the  conclusion  of  the  notice  period  by  choosing  to  pay  Mr. 
Quartermaine in lieu of the notice period. 
 
If  the  terms  of  Mr.  Quartermaine’s  employment  contract  are  materially  changed  to  the  detriment  of  the  chief 
executive officer then he is entitled to receive an amount of money from Perseus that is equivalent to two months of 
his originally contracted gross base salary ($850,000 per annum prior to a 15% reduction taken by directors on 1 July 
2013) as for each year of employment by Perseus with a minimum payment equivalent to six months of his originally 
contracted gross base salary and a maximum of twelve months of his originally contracted gross base salary.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND AUDITORS 
 
Perseus’s  Constitution  requires  it  to  indemnify  directors  and  officers  of  any  entity  within  the  group  against 
liabilities  incurred  to  third  parties  and  against  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in  defending  civil  or  criminal 
proceedings,  except  in  certain  circumstances.    In  April  2014,  the  company  entered  into  Deeds  of  Indemnity, 
Access and Insurance with all persons who were an officer of the company at that time. Independent legal advice 
was received that the content of the deeds conforms with the Act and current market practice. The directors and 
officers of the group have been insured against all liabilities and expenses arising as a result of work performed in 
their respective capacities, to the extent permitted by law. The insurance premiums, paid during the year ended 
30 June 2016 amounted to $159,406, and relates to:
1.
costs and expenses incurred by the relevant officers in defending proceedings, whether civil or criminal 
and whatever the outcome; and
2.  other liabilities that may arise from their position, with the exception of conduct involving a wilful breach
of duty or improper use of information or position to gain a personal advantage.
To the extent permitted by law, the company has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of the 
terms of its audit engagement agreement against claims by third parties arising from the audit (for an unspecified 
amount). No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the financial year end. 
 
PROCEEDINGS ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY 
 
No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings 
on behalf of Perseus or to intervene in any proceedings to which Perseus is a party, for the purposes of taking 
responsibility  on  behalf  of  Perseus  for  all  or  part  of  the  proceedings.  No  proceeding  has  been  brought  or 
intervened in on behalf of Perseus with leave of the Court under section 237 of the Act. 
 
NON-AUDIT SERVICES 
 
During the year Ernst & Young, the group’s auditor, performed other non-audit services in addition to statutory 
duties.  The  non-audit  services  provided  do  not  undermine  the  general  principles  relating  to  auditor 
independence  as  set  out  in  APES  110  Code  of  Ethics  for  Professional  Accountants,  as  they  did  not  involve 
reviewing  or  auditing  the  auditor’s  own  work,  acting  in  a  management  or  decision  making  capacity  for  the 
group, acting as an advocate for the group or jointly sharing risks and rewards. Further information is set out at 
note 21 of the financial statements. 
 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
 
The  ASX  Corporate  Governance  Council  (CGC)  has  developed  corporate  governance  principles  and 
recommendations  for  listed  entities  with  the  aim  of  promoting  investor  confidence  and  meeting  stakeholder 
expectations. ASX listing rule 4.10.3 requires that listed entities disclose the extent to which they have followed 
the CGC’s recommendations and, where a recommendation has not been followed, the reasons why.

Perseus Mining Limited 
Directors’ report 
 
Yaouré  
All information in this report in the Annual Group Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Statement concerning the YGP are reported as Foreign Estimates as 
defined in the ASX Listing Rules in accordance with ASX Listing Rules 5.12.1 to 5.12.10 and as Historical Estimates as defined  under NI 43-101. The Foreign 
Estimates  and  Historical  Estimates  are  together  referred  to  as  “Estimates“.  The  Estimates  for  the  YGP  have  been  sourced  from  the  following  report  in 
accordance with NI 43-101: Technical Report and Prefeasibility Study of the YGP, Côte d’Ivoire. Document No 1494400100-REP-R0001-01 dated 14 May 2015. 
The  Estimates  have  been  classified  as  Inferred,  Indicated  and  Measured  under  NI  43-101.  The  classification  categories  are  considered  by  Perseus  to  be 
equivalent to the JORC categories of the same name (JORC 2012), thus the NI 43-101 compliant estimates are considered “qualifying foreign estimates“ for 
the purposes of the ASX Listing Rules. Perseus has reviewed the relevant Technical Reports for the YGP and believes the foreign estimates were conducted in a 
professional and competent manner and are relevant  for purposes of the  Company's decision regarding these properties. However, neither  Perseus nor its 
qualified persons have completed the work necessary to verify the Estimates and the estimates should not be relied upon. The Estimate for the YGP deposit is 
material to Perseus. The Mineral Resource Estimate is based on RC and diamond core drill holes, conducted by Amara since 2005. Drill holes were nominally 
spaced at 50x50m over the entire prospect,. A total of 630 RC holes for 59,096.65m and 405 DD holes for 116,383.35m were drilled. Resource wireframes 
were generated by combining manually digitzed sectional polygons. A standard block model was created with 12.5x12.5x10m parent block size and grade 
estimation was performed using a combination of Ordinary Kriging and Cubed Inverse Distance algorithms, both with top-cuts applied.The oxides of the YGP 
deposits have been partly mined in open pit heap leach operations by the Compagnie Minière d’Afrique (“CMA“) between 1999 and 2003, and between 2008 
and 2011 by Amara. Historic data from drilling prior to 2005, and grade control data from the mining operations were not included in the Mineral Resource 
Estimate. The depletion due to mining by CMA and Amara, as well as backfilling of the historic CMA open pits have been taken into account.Mineralogical 
and metallurgical test work was carried out on several ore types at variable grades. Investigations indicated that the ores are free milling and non-refractory 
at a grind size of approximately P80 = 75 μm. The ore is hard and amenable to direct cyanidation, with an overall gold recovery of approximately 90%. Open 
pit mining using conventional drill and blast methods was adopted taking into consideration oxide and fresh material.  Pits were optimised and then designed 
in  staged  cutbacks.  Suitably  sized  mining  equipment  was  adopted  with  total  material  movement  determined  based  on  the  plant  throughput  rate  with  an 
elevated  cut-off  strategy  in  the  early  years  of  production  to  maximise  grade.  Owner  mining  was  adopted.  The  process  plant  was  designed  for  a  6.5Mt/a 
capacity.  The  flowsheet  comprised  a  gyratory  crusher,  SAG  mill,  ball  mill,  gravity  concentration,  thickeners,  agitated  leach  tanks,  CIP  circuit,  elution  and 
electrowinning  to  produce  doré  gold  bars  for  refining.  Infrastructure  was  designed  to  match  the  overall  mining  and  processing  rates,  including  tailings 
storage facility, power and water supply, camp, offices, workshops and roads. Cost estimates were completed to +/-25%. A $1,250/oz gold price was used in 
the evaluation. 
A statement was made by Amara on 26 February 2016 updating the Mineral Resource and Ore/Mineral Reserve at the YGP.  An incomplete draft technical 
report was available to Perseus, but a fully compliant NI 43-101 document had not been completed.  Therefore the May 2015 NI 43-101 technical report is the 
basis of the Estimate.   
Perseus has commenced a feasibility study on the YGP including a NI 43-101 technical report, with completion expected in the middle of  2017.  The feasibility 
will  be  focussed  on  increasing  geological  information  by  carrying  out  closer  spaced  drilling  in  targeted  areas  than  has  been  completed  historically.    Also 
significant  additional metallurgical test work will be carried out, with a specific focus on comminution.  The new information will be  used to better define 
controls on mineralisation and thereby determine the tonnes and grade of the deposit with greater reliability and develop a geo-metallurgical model.  The 
mining method for the deposit can then be optimised along with the mining and processing rates.  The process plant design and associated infrastructure will 
then  be  finalised.  Quotes will  be  sought  from  suitably  experienced  mining  contractors  to  fully  evaluate  the  option  of  contract  mining  compared  to  owner 
mining. The feasibility will be funded from funds from the recent equity raising. 
 
 
Cautionary statement in respect of Yaouré  
The Estimates are historical/foreign estimates and are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. A qualified person has not completed sufficient work 
to classify the Estimates as current Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC code and the Company is not treating the Estimates as 
current.   It  is  uncertain  that  following  evaluation  and/or  further  exploration  work  the  Estimates  will  be  able  to  be  reported  as  Mineral  Resources  or  Ore 
Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code. It should not be assumed that quantities reported as “resources” will be converted to reserves under the JORC 
Code or any other reporting regime or that the Company will be able to legally and economically extract them.

For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
ABOUT THIS REPORT  
 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial  statements are  set  out  below. 
These  policies  have  been  consistently  applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless  otherwise  stated  in  note  26.  The  financial 
statements  are  for  the  consolidated  entity  consisting  of  Perseus  Mining  Limited  and  its  subsidiaries  (the  “group”  or  the 
“consolidated entity”). Perseus Mining Limited is a listed for-profit public company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. 
During the year ended 30 June 2016, the consolidated entity conducted operations in Australia, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.   
 
These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, other 
authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
Compliance with IFRS 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  group  also  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
 
Historical cost convention 
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the  historical  cost  convention,  as  modified  by  the  revaluation  of 
derivative instruments and available for sale financial assets. 
 
Critical accounting estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the  group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed 
in throughout the notes.  
 
Rounding 
The amounts contained in this financial report have been rounded to the nearest $1,000 (unless otherwise stated) under the 
option  available  to  the  company  under  ASIC  Corporations  (Rounding  in  Financial/Directors’  Reports)  Instrument  2016/191 
(Rounding Instrument). The company is an entity to which the class order applies.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES  
 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including the 
expectations  of  future  events  that  may  have  a  financial  impact  on  the  consolidated  entity  and  that  are  believed  to  be 
reasonable under the circumstances.  
 
The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting will, by definition, seldom equal 
the actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed in the notes indicated below.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
Description of segments
Perseus Mining Limited  
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
1. 
 
(a) 
 
Management  has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed  by the  executive  management  team 
and board of directors that are used to make strategic decisions. 
 
The group primarily reports on a geographical basis as its risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences 
in geographical areas in which it operates and this is the format of the information provided to  the executive management 
team and board of directors. 
 
The  group  operated  principally  in  three  geographical  segments  in  2016  being  Australia  and  the  West  African  countries  of 
Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The segment information is prepared in conformity with the group’s accounting policies.  
 
The group comprises the following main segments: 
 
Australia  
Ghana 
 
Côte d’Ivoire 
 
Revenue is derived from two external customers arising from the sale of gold bullion reported under the Ghana reporting 
segment. 
 
(b) 
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker.  The  chief  operating  decision  maker,  who  is  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the 
operating segments, has been identified as the executive management team and board of directors of the parent entity.

RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
(i) Revenue recognition  
Revenue  is  recognised  and  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  receivable.  Amounts  disclosed  as 
revenue are net of returns, trade allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The group recognises 
revenue when the amount can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. 
The following criteria are also applicable to specific revenue transactions: 
 
Gold bullion sales 
Revenue  from  gold  bullion  sales  is  recognised  when  there  has  been  a  transfer  of  risks  and  rewards  from  the  group  to  an 
external party, no further processing is required by the group, quality and quantity of the goods has been determined with 
reasonable  accuracy,  the  selling  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  and  collectability  is  probable.  The  point  at  which  risk  and 
rewards pass for the group’s commodity sales is upon dispatch of the gold bullion from the mine site. Adjustments are made 
for variations in commodity price, assay and weight between the time of dispatch and the time of final settlement. 
 
Interest income 
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
 
(ii) Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required 
to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
(i) Impairment of assets   
In determining whether the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or 
value-in-use against which asset impairment is to be considered, the group undertakes future cash flow calculations which 
are based on a number of critical estimates and assumptions, and reflect the life of mine (“LOM”) operating and capital cost 
assumptions used in the group’s latest budget and LOM plans:
(i)  Mine life including quantities of mineral Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for which there is a high degree of
confidence of economic extraction with given technology; 
Estimated production and sales levels;
(ii) 
(iii)  Estimate future commodity prices are based on brokers consensus forecast; 
(iv)  Future costs of production; 
(v) 
Future capital expenditure;  
(vi)  Future exchange rates; and/or 
(vii)  Discount  rates  based  on  the  group’s  estimated  before  tax  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  adjusted  when
appropriate to take into account relevant risks such as development risk etc.
Variations  to  expected  future  cash  flows,  and  timing  thereof,  could  result  in  significant  changes  to  the  impairment  test 
results, which in turn could impact future financial results. The expected future cash flows of the cash generating units are 
most sensitive to fluctuations in the gold price. 
 
(ii) Unit-of-production method of depreciation / amortisation  
The  group  uses  the  unit-of-production  basis  when  depreciating/amortising  life  of  mine  specific  assets,  which  results  in  a 
depreciation/amortisation  charge  proportional  to  the  depletion  of  the  anticipated  remaining  life  of  mine  production.  Each 
item’s  economic  life,  which  is  assessed  annually,  has  due  regard  to  both  its  physical  life  limitations  and  to  present 
assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which it is located. These calculations require the 
use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and estimates of future capital expenditure. 
The group amortises mine property assets utilising tonnes of ore mined and mine related plant and equipment over tonnes 
of ore processed.  
 
(iii) Deferred stripping expenditure  
The group defers stripping costs incurred during the production stage of its operations. Significant judgement is required to 
distinguish  between  production  stripping  that  relates  to  the  extraction  of  inventory  and  what  relates  to  the  creation  of  a 
deferred  waste  asset.  The  group  also  identifies  the  separate  components  of  the  ore  body.  An  identifiable  component  is  a 
specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. Significant judgement is required to 
identify  these  components,  and  to  determine  the  expected  volumes  of  waste  to  be  stripped  and  ore  to  be  mined  in  each 
component and a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any 
stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The group considers that the ratio of the expected waste to be stripped for an 
expected amount  of ore to be mined,  for a  specific component  of the ore body, is the most  suitable production measure. 
Furthermore,  judgements  and  estimates  are  also  used  to  apply  the  units  of  production  method  in  determining  the 
amortisation of the stripping activity asset(s).  
 
Changes in a mine’s life and design will usually result in changes to the expected stripping ratio (waste to mineral reserves 
ratio).  Changes  in  other  technical  or  economical  parameters  that  impact  reserves  will  also  have  an  impact  on  the  life  of 
component  ratio  even  if  they  do  not  affect  the  mine’s  design.  Changes  to  the  life  of  the  component  are  accounted  for 
prospectively.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE – continued
Perseus Mining Limited 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
3. 
 
RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the 
applicable  income  tax  rate  for  each  jurisdiction  adjusted  by  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  attributable  to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses. 
 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the 
reporting  period  in  the  countries  where  the  company’s  subsidiaries  and  associated  operate  and  generate  taxable  income. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation 
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities. 
 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Judgement  is  required  in  determining  whether  deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  the  statement  of  financial  position. 
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the 
group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future 
taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. 
To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the group to realise 
the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.  
 
Additionally,  future  changes  in  tax  laws  in  jurisdictions  in  which  the  group  operates  could  limit  the  ability  of  the  group  to 
obtain tax deductions in future periods.

Performance  rights,  first  issued  in  November  2012  (see  note  23)  and  granted  to  employees  under  the  terms  of  the 
company’s Performance Rights Plan approved by shareholders in November 2012, are considered to be potential ordinary 
shares  but,  as  they  are  anti-dilutive  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  they  have  been  excluded  from  the  calculation  of 
diluted earnings per share. Warrants issued in April 2016 (see note 24) to the shareholders of Amara, are also considered to 
be potential ordinary shares but, as they are anti-dilutive for the year ended 30 June 2016, they have been excluded from 
the calculation of diluted earnings per share.  
 
RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
(i) Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent, excluding any costs of

$12.5 million) related to a VAT refund receivable from the Ghana Revenue Authority (“GRA”). There are no non-current 
VAT  receivables  as  at  30  June  2016.  In  early  July  2016  two  cheques  from  the  GRA  totalling  GHS44.9  million  (US$11.4 
million) were received from the GRA for the VAT receivable.
(iii)  Allowance for doubtful debts are recognised against sundry debtors for estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by
reference to an analysis of the counterparty’s current financial position.
(iv)  At  30  June  2016,  the  group  has  US$9.5  million  (approximately  A$12.7  million)  (30  June  2015:  US$9.4  million 
(approximately A$12.3 million)) held in bank deposits which are subject to a lien and are collateral for a bank guarantee 
that  has  been  issued  to  the  Ghana  Environmental  Protection  Agency  in  relation  to  environmental  rehabilitation 
provisions concerning the EGM.
Past due but not impaired 
With  the  exception  of  $3.8  million  disclosed  above  which  is  fully  provided  for,  all  of  the  remaining  trade  and  other

Fair value and foreign exchange and credit risk 
Due to the short term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate their fair value. 
Long term receivables are evaluated by the group based on parameters such as individual creditworthiness of the customer 
and  specific  country  risk  factors.  The  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  is  the  carrying 
amount of each class of receivable mentioned above. 
 
The other receivable relating to a VAT refund from the GRA is immediately repayable on demand in Ghanaian Cedis (“GHS”), 
is unsecured and bears no interest. Since the authorisation of treasury credit notes by the GRA, payments of employment 
taxes,  withholding  taxes  and  royalties  have  been  offset  against  the  VAT  receivable.  During  the  year,  the  group  received 
GHS35.4 million (US$9.3 million) of Treasury Credit Notes to cover that part of the VAT refund that has been formerly audited 
and  approved.  In  early  July  2016  a  further  two  cheques  from  the  GRA  totalling  GHS44.9  million  (US$11.4  million)  were 
received from the GRA for the VAT receivable. 
 
Further information about the group’s exposure to these risks is provided in note 15. 
 
RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
(i) Trade and other receivables 
Trade  receivables  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  less  provision  for 
impairment. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 to 90 days. They are presented as current assets 
unless collection is not expected for more than 12 months after the reporting date. 
 
An  allowance  for  doubtful  debts  is  made  when  collection  of  the  full  amount  is  no  longer  probable.  Impairment  of  trade 
receivables is continually reviewed and those that are considered to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying 
amount directly.  The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other 
expenses. 
 
(ii) Loan and receivables  
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an 
active  market.  They  are  included  in  current  assets,  except  for  those  with  maturities  greater  than  12  months  after  the 
reporting  period  which  are  classified  as  non-current  assets.  Loans  and  receivables  are  included  in  receivables  in  the 
statement of financial position. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.

RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
Gold bullion, gold in circuit and ore stockpiles are physically measured or estimated and stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.  
 
Cost comprises direct material, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead  expenditure, the 
latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Costs are assigned to individual items of inventory on the 
basis  of  weighted  average  costs  in  getting  such  inventories  to  their  existing  location  and  condition,  based  on  weighted 
average  costs  incurred  during  the  period  in  which  such  inventories  were  produced.  Net  realisable  value  is  the  estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs of selling the final product. 
 
Inventories of consumable supplies and spare parts expected to be used in production are valued at weighted average cost. 
Obsolete or damaged inventories of such item are valued at net realisable value. 
 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Net  realisable  value  tests  are  performed  at  least  quarterly  and  represent  the  estimated  future  sales  price  of  the  product 
based  on  prevailing  spot  metals  prices  at  the  reporting  date,  less  estimated  costs  to  complete  production  and  bring  the 
product to sale. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the  stockpile, the 
number  of  contained  gold  ounces  based  on  assay  data,  and  the  estimated  recovery  percentage  based  on  the  expected 
processing method. Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys.

as an available for sale financial asset.
(ii)  During the year ended 30 June 2016, impairment of the investment in Manas was considered. The significant decline 
in the fair value of Manas’s shares was considered objective evidence of impairment and as such, an impairment of 
$0.7  million  was  made  and  is  shown  at  ‘impairment  of  available  for  sale  financial  assets’  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income. The investment in Manas is recognised at fair value 30 June 2016.

AVAILABLE FOR SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS – continued
Perseus Mining Limited 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
8. 
 
RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
(i) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the 
other  categories.  Investments  are  designated  as  available-for-sale  if  they  do  not  have  fixed  maturities  and  fixed  or 
determinable payments and management intends to hold them for the medium to long term 
 
Purchase and sale of investments are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have 
been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
 
When  securities  classified  as  available-for-sale  are  sold,  the  accumulated  fair  value  adjustments  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss as gains and losses on sale of available-for-sale financial assets. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are 
presented  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  arise.  Changes  in  value  of  non-monetary  securities  classified  as 
available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
 
Details on how the fair value of financial instruments is determined are disclosed in note 15. 
 
(ii) Impairment  
The group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in 
the fair value of a security below its cost is considered an indicator in determining whether the security is impaired. If any 
such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  the  cumulative  loss  –  measured  as  the  difference  between  the 
acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or 
loss – is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the profit or loss.

RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT  
(i) Assets under construction 
Where  a  decision  has  been  made  to  proceed  with  development  in  respect  of  a  particular  area  of  interest,  the  relevant 
exploration and evaluation asset is tested for impairment and the balance is then reclassified as ‘assets under construction’, 
and disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment.  
 
All subsequent expenditure incurred in the construction of a mine by or on behalf of, the group is accumulated separately for 
each area of interest in which economically recoverable reserves have been identified. This expenditure includes net direct 
costs of construction and borrowing costs capitalised during construction. On completion of development, all assets included 
in ‘assets under construction’ are reclassified as either ‘plant and equipment’ or ‘mine properties’. 
 
(ii) Property, plant and equipment  
Land and buildings and all other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it 
is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the  consolidated entity and the cost  of the 
item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
 
Land is not depreciated.

Estimated useful life (years)
Perseus Mining Limited 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
9. 
 
RECOGNITION & MEASUREMENT - continued 
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the  straight-line method to allocate their cost  net  of their residual values, 
over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
 
Item 
Plant and equipment 
Buildings  
 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. An 
asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount.  Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying 
amount.  These are included in profit or loss.   
 
(iii) Impairment of assets  
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment  or 
more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  they  may  be  impaired.  Other  assets  are  tested  for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
 
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash generating unit.  In 
estimating value in use, a pre-tax discount rate is used which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset.  
 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generated units). 
The group has three cash generating units, Edikan Gold Mine, the Sissingué Gold Project and the Yaouré Gold Project. Non-
financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end 
of each reporting period.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
(i) Mine Properties  
Accumulated  mine  development  costs 
‘mine  properties’)  are 
depreciated/amortised  on  a  unit  of  production  basis  over  the  economically  recoverable  reserves  of  the  mine  concerned, 
except in the case of assets whose useful life is shorter than the life of mine, in which case the straight line method is applied. 
The units of  measure for amortisation of  mine properties is tonnes of ore mined and  the amortisation of  mine properties 
takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with sanctioned future development expenditure. The EGM mine 
properties work in progress is assessed at the end of every month and when the work is completed it is transferred to mine 
properties and then amortised. 
 
The units of measure for depreciating mine related plant and equipment is tonnes of ore processed. 
 
(ii) Deferred stripping costs  
The group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the development and production phases of its surface mining 
operations. During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to the 
production  of  inventory  in  that  period  and  the  creation  of  improved  access  and  mining  flexibility  in  relation  to  ore  to  be 
mined in the future. The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping 
activity asset, where certain criteria are met. Once the group has identified its production stripping for each surface mining 
operation,  it  identifies  the  separate  components  of  the  ore  bodies  for  each  of  its  mining  operations.  An  identifiable 
component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. 
 
The stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost, which is the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the 
stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead 
costs. If incidental operations are occurring at the same time as the production stripping activity, but are not necessary for 
the  production  stripping  activity  to  continue  as  planned,  these  costs  are  not  included  in  the  cost  of  the  stripping  activity 
asset. The stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition to, or an enhancement of, an existing asset, being the mine 
asset,  and  is  presented  as  part  of  ’Mine  properties’  in  the  statement  of  financial  position.  This  forms  part  of  the  total 
investment  in  the  relevant  cash  generating  unit,  which  is  reviewed  for  impairment  if  events  or  changes  of  circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.   
 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Ore  reserves  are  estimates  of  the  amount  of  ore  that  can  be  economically  and  legally  extracted  from  the  group’s  mining 
properties.  The  group  estimates  its  Ore  Reserves  and  Mineral  Resources  based  on  information  compiled  by  appropriately 
qualified  persons  relating  to  the  geological  data  on  the  size,  depth  and  shape  of  the  ore  body  and  this  requires  complex 
geological judgements to interpret data. The estimation of recoverable reserves is based upon factors such as estimates of 
foreign  exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,  future  capital  requirements,  and  production  costs  along  with  geological 
assumptions  and  judgements  made  in  estimating  the  size  and  grade  of  the  ore  body.  Changes  in  the  reserve  or  resource 
estimates  may  impact  upon  the  carrying  value  of  exploration  and  evaluation  assets,  mine  properties,  property,  plant  and 
equipment, goodwill, provision for rehabilitation, recognition of deferred assets, and depreciation and amortisation charges.

Carrying amount at the end of the year 
 
The  expenditure  above  relates  principally  to  exploration  and  evaluation  activities.  The  ultimate  recoupment  of  this 
expenditure is dependent upon successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective 
areas of interest. The write-off of $17.9 million (30 June 2015: nil) is a result of writing-off the Dadieso licence in Ghana due 
to the assessed complexity of developing that area of interest and the Mampong, Grumesa and Kwatechi licences in Ghana 
due to those areas of interest being assessed as uncommercial to develop. 
 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest with current tenure are carried forward 
to the extent that: 
(i)
such  expenditures  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through  successful  development  and  exploration  of  the  area  of 
interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or 
exploration  and  evaluation  activities  in  the  area  of  interest  have  not  at  the  reporting  date  reached  a  stage  which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and 
significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest is continuing.
(ii)
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  initially  measured  at  cost  and  include  acquisition  of  rights  to  explore,  studies, 
exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities and an allocation of depreciation and amortisation of 
assets used in exploration and evaluation activities. General and administrative costs are only included in the measurement 
of exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to operational activities in a particular area of interest. 
 
In  the  event  that  an  area  of  interest  if  abandoned  or,  if  facts  and  circumstances  suggest  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an 
exploration and evaluation asset is impaired then the accumulated costs carried forward are written off in the year in which 
the assessment is made. 
 
Where  a  decision  has  been  made  to  proceed  with  development  in  respect  of  a  particular  area  of  interest,  the  relevant 
exploration and evaluation asset is tested for impairment and the balance is then reclassified as ‘assets under construction’. 
 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Management determines when an area of interest should be abandoned. When a decision is made that an area of interest is 
not commercially viable, all costs that have been capitalised in respect of that area of interest are written off. In determining

The provision for rehabilitation work relates to the EGM in Ghana and the historical heap leach operations at Yaouré in Cote 
d’Ivoire. The timing of settlement of these obligations cannot be established with any certainty. The group has commenced 
mining the EGM project area and many of the old pits identified for rehabilitation work will be subject to new mining. The 
provision  related to the EGM  has been reviewed and increased in line  with the additional development that has occurred 
since June 2015. 
 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
(i) Trade and other payables 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the group  prior to the end of the financial year that 
are  unpaid.  The  amounts  are  unsecured  and  are  usually  paid  within  30  days  of  recognition.  Trade  and  other  payables  are 
presented  as  current  liabilities  unless  payment  is  not  due  within  12  months  from  the  reporting  date.  They  are  recognised 
initially  at  their  fair  value  and  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective 
interest  method. 
 
(ii) Provisions 
Provisions  are  recognised  when  the  group  has  a  present  legal  or  constructive  obligation  as  a  result  of  past  events,  it  is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a  reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
 
Provisions  are  measured  as  the  present  value  of  management’s  best  estimate  of  the  expenditure  required  to  settle  the 
present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT – continued  
(iii) Employee benefits  
(a) Short term obligations  
Liabilities  for  short-term  employee  benefits  expected  to  be  wholly  settled  within  12  months  of  the  reporting  date  are 
recognised in other payables in respect of employees’ services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
 
(b) Other long-term employee benefit obligations 
The  liability  for  long  service  leave  which  is  not  expected  to  be  wholly  settled  within  12  months  of  the  reporting  date  is 
recognised  in  the  provision  for  employee  benefits  and  measured  as  the  present  value  of  expected  future  payments. 
Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary level, experience of employees' departures and periods of service. 
Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting period on  high quality corporate 
bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. 
 
(c) Retirement benefit obligations 
Contributions are made by the group to superannuation funds as stipulated by statutory requirements and are charged as 
expenses when incurred. 
 
(iv) Rehabilitation provision 
A  provision  for  restoration  and  rehabilitation  is  recognised  when  there  is  a  present  obligation  as  a  result  of  development 
activities undertaken, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the 
amount of the provision can be measured reliably. The estimated future obligations include the costs of abandoning sites, 
removing facilities and restoring the affected areas. 
 
The provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the 
restoration obligation at the balance date. Future restoration  costs are reviewed annually and any changes in the estimate 
are reflected in the present value of the restoration provision at each balance date. 
 
The  initial  estimate  of  the  restoration  and  rehabilitation  provision  is  capitalised  into  the  cost  of  the  related  asset  and 
amortised on the same basis as the related asset, unless the present obligation arises from the production of inventory in the 
period,  in  which  case  the  amount  is  included  in  the  cost  of  production  for  the  period.  Changes  in  the  estimate  of  the 
provision  for  restoration  and  rehabilitation  are  treated  in  the  same  manner,  except  that  the  unwinding  of  the  effect  of 
discounting on the provision is recognised as a finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset. 
 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Restoration and Rehabilitation provision  
The value of the current restoration and rehabilitation provision is based on a number of assumptions including the nature of 
restoration activities required and the valuation at the present value of a future obligation that necessitates estimates of the 
cost of performing the work required, the timing of future cash flows and the appropriate risk free discount rate. Additionally 
current  provisions  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  no  significant  changes  will  occur  in  relevant  legislation  covering 
restoration  of  mineral  properties.  A  change  in  any,  or  a  combination,  of  these  assumptions  used  to  determine  current 
provisions could have a material impact to the carrying value of the provision.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  in  full,  using  the  balance  sheet  full  liability  method,  on  temporary  differences  arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, 
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not 
accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined 
using  tax  rates  (and  laws)  that  have  been  enacted  or  substantially  enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  and  are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
 
Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  deductible  temporary  differences  and  unused  tax  losses  only  if  it  is  probable  that 
future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases 
of  investments  in  foreign  operations  where  the  company  is  able  to  control  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary 
differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT - continued 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where 
the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. 
 
Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in equity.

The group is party to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business in order to hedge exposure to future 
price and currency fluctuations in the primary commodity markets in which it operates.  This is done in accordance with the 
group's financial risk management policies. 
 
Forward metal contracts – cash flow hedges: 
The group uses cash flow designated USD forward metal contracts to hedge movements in USD precious metal prices on its 
anticipated sales of gold. At 30 June 2016 there were cash flow designated hedge contracts in place for 85,674 ounces of gold 
with settlements scheduled between September 2016 and March 2017 with a weighted average price of US$1,215/oz. The 
portion of the gain or loss on these hedging instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised and 
retained directly in equity. The ineffective portion will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
The  amount  reclassified  during  the  year  to  the  income  statement  was  a  gain  of  $17.8  million  (30  June  2015  gain:  $23.6 
million) 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value – gold forward contracts: 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include the change in value of gold forward contracts put in place during 
the  year  ending  30  June  2016.  The  group  uses  USD  forward  metal  contracts  to  hedge  movements  in  USD  precious  metal 
prices  on  its  anticipated  sales  of  gold.  The  risk  management  policies  related  to  these  contracts  are  provided  in  note  15. 
Movements  in  fair  value  between  inception  and  close-out  of  the  contract  are  taken  to  the  statement  of  comprehensive 
income. 
 
At 30 June 2016 the group held forward metal contracts for 30,516 ounces of gold on a spot deferred basis with a weighted 
average  price  of  US$1,316/oz.  Additionally,  at  30  June  2016  there  was  95,000  ounces  of  forward  metal  contracts  at  an 
average price of US$1,306/oz specifically to support the proposed Sissingué project finance debt facility.  On 1 July 2016, a 
further 5,000 ounces at US$1,333 in forward metal contracts were also added to the contracts entered into specifically to 
support the proposed Sissingué project finance debt facility.  When necessary, these contracts may be rolled over into new 
contracts at maturity, subject to counterparty credit approval. 
 
Risk exposures and fair value measurements 
Information  about  the  group’s  exposure  to  credit  risk,  price  risk  and  liquidity  risk  related  to  the  undiscounted  cash  flow 
exposure from derivative contracts is provided at note 15.

14.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – continued 
 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial  liability is classified in 
this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Liabilities in this category are classified as current liabilities if they are expected to be 
settled within 12 months; otherwise they are classified as non-current. 
 
(ii) Fair value measurement  
The group measures derivatives at fair value at each balance-sheet date.  
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
 
 
 
The principal or the most  advantageous  market must  be accessible by the group. The fair  value of an asset  or a  liability is 
measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest. 
 
A  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  a  market  participant's  ability  to  generate  economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in 
its highest and best use. 
 
(iii) Derivatives and hedging activities 
Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  subsequently 
remeasured  to  their  fair  value  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  The  accounting  for  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value 
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The 
group designates certain derivatives as either: 
 
  hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges); or  
  hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast
In the principal market for the asset or liability 
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
transactions (cash flow hedges).
At  the  inception  of  a  hedge  transaction,  the  group  formally  designates  and  documents  the  hedge  relationship  between 
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The 
group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are 
used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair  values or cash 
flows of hedge items. 
 
The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are  disclosed as above. Movements in 
the hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity are shown in the statement of changes in equity. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current  asset  or liability  when the remaining  maturity of the hedged item is more  than 12 
months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT – continued 
Where  forward  contracts  are  entered  into  and  continue  to  be  held  for  the  purpose  of  receipt  or  delivery  of  a  physical 
commodity  in  accordance  with  expected  purchase,  sale  or  usage  requirements,  the  contracts  are  outside  of  the  scope  of 
AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and are therefore off balance sheet.
(i) Fair value hedges 
Changes  in  fair  value  of  derivatives  that  are  designated  and  qualify  as  fair  value  hedges  are  recorded  in  the 
comprehensive income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of derivative contracts are recognised 
in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income  within  “sale  of  goods”  with  a  corresponding  offsetting  amount  to  the 
carrying amount of the asset or liability being the fair value movement of the hedged asset or liability. The gain or loss 
relating  to  the  ineffective  portion  is  recognised  immediately  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income  as  other 
income or expense.
(ii) Cash flow hedges 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in  reserves  in  equity.  The  gain  or  loss  related  to  the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss within other income or expense.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or 
loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion 
of derivative contracts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within “revenue”. However when the 
forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory) or a non-
financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are included in the measurement of the initial cost 
or carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast  transaction  is  ultimately  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  When  a  forecast  transaction  is  no  longer  expected  to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit or loss.
(iii) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Certain  derivative  instruments  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  any  derivative 
instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive 
income.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
The group makes judgements on the effectiveness of all derivative financial instrument entered into, including forward metal 
contracts,  metal  options  and  foreign  currency  option  contracts  in  accordance  with  the  above  accounting  policy. 
Management’s  assessment  is  that,  unless  otherwise  disclosed,  the  derivatives  have  been  highly  effective  in  offsetting 
changes in the fair value of the future cash flows against which they have been designated and as such are compliant with 
the hedge effectiveness requirements of AASB 139.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT – continued
Perseus Mining Limited 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
15. 
 
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price 
risk); credit risk; liquidity risk and equity price risk. The group therefore has an overall risk management program that focuses 
on the unpredictability of financial and precious metal commodity markets and seeks to minimise  potential adverse effects 
on the financial performance of the group. 
 
The group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed including sensitivity analysis in the 
case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks and aging analysis for credit risk. The group then uses derivative 
financial instruments such as forward metal and forward metal option contracts to hedge certain risk exposures. 
 
Financial risk management is carried out by the finance area of the group under policies approved by the board of directors 
with identification, evaluation and hedging of financial and commodity risks being undertaken in close co-operation with the 
group’s  operating  units.  The  board  provides  written  principles  for  overall  risk  management  as  well  as  written  policies 
covering specific areas such as use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity. 
 
Market Risk 
 
(i) 
The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US dollar and Ghanaian cedi. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions and recognised 
assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  a  currency  that  is  not  the  entity’s  functional  currency.  The  risk  is  measured  using 
sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting. The group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from the translation 
of  its  foreign  operations,  the  group’s  investments  in  its  subsidiaries  are  not  hedged  as  those  currency  positions  are 
considered  to  be  long  term  in  nature.  In  addition,  the  parent  entity  has  an  intercompany  receivable  from  its  subsidiary 
denominated in US Dollars which is eliminated on consolidation. The gains or losses on re-measurement of this intercompany 
receivable from US Dollars to Australian Dollars are not eliminated on consolidation as the loan is not considered to be part 
of the net investment in the subsidiary. 
 
The group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as 
follows:

Sensitivity 
The following table summarises the sensitivity of  financial instruments held at balance date to movement in the exchange 
rate  of  the  AUD  to  the  USD  with  all  other  variables  held  constant  and  the  AUD  to  the  GHS  with  all  other  variables  held 
constant, including the impact of the foreign exchange movement on the inter-company loan of $248.1 million (2015: $286.4 
million). The sensitivity is based on management’s estimate of reasonably possible changes over a financial year.

The group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. 
 
(ii) 
The  group  is  exposed  to  commodity  price  risk  for  its  future  gold  production.  These  risks  are  measured  using  sensitivity 
analysis and cash flow forecasting and to manage exposures the group enters into forward commodity price derivatives. 
 
The group’s policy is to hedge no more than 40% of anticipated gold sales in the subsequent 12 months and no more than 
30% of anticipated gold sales in the 6 months subsequent to that first 12 months.  
 
At the end of the reporting period the group has 85,674 ounces of forward metal contracts in place over approximately 28% 
of anticipated monthly gold production through to 30 June 2017. When necessary these contracts may be rolled over into 
new  contracts  at  maturity,  subject  to  counterparty  credit  approval.  The  group  held  forward  metal  contracts  for  30,516 
ounces  of  gold  on  a  spot  deferred  basis.  Additionally,  at  30  June  2016  there  was  95,000  ounces  of  hedging  contracted 
specifically to support the proposed Sissingué project finance debt facility.  
 
Balance date exposures and further details of current commodity price derivatives are provided at note 14.

(iii) 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. The group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates is diminished as the group has 
no interest bearing debt obligations.

Sensitivity 
If interest rates were to move up by 1% with all other variables held constant, then the pre-tax impact on the group’s profit 
as  well  as  total  equity  would  be  a  movement  of  $1.6  million  (30  June  2015:  $1.0  million),  a  1%  decrease  would  be  a 
movement of $1.3 million (30 June 2015: $0.3 million). 
 
Credit risk 
 
Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to perform as contracted under a financial 
instrument resulting in a financial loss to the group and arises from deposits with banks and financial institutions, favourable 
derivative financial instruments as well as  credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables and committed 
transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only independent parties with a minimum credit rating of ‘A’ are accepted. 
 
The carrying amount the group’s financial assets, represents the maximum credit exposure. 
 
The  group  restricts  the  exposure  to  credit  losses  on  derivative  instruments  it  holds  by  entering  into  master  netting 
arrangements with major counterparties with whom a significant volume of transactions are undertaken.  
 
Such an arrangement provides for a single net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event 
of default on any one contract. Master-netting arrangements do not result in an offset of balance-sheet assets and liabilities 
unless certain conditions for offsetting under AASB 132 apply. 
 
Although master-netting arrangements may significantly reduce credit risk, it should be noted that: 
(i)
Credit risk is eliminated only to the extent that amounts due to the same counterparty will be settled after the assets 
are realised; and 
The extent to which overall credit risk is reduced may change substantially within a short period because the exposure 
is affected by each transaction subject to the arrangement.
(ii)
At 30 June 2016, master netting arrangements reduced the credit risk on favourable contracts that have a  fair  value of  nil 
(2015: $18.4 million). 
  
Liquidity Risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, that as far as possible, it will always have sufficient  liquidity to meet  its liabilities when 
due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring  unacceptable  losses  or  risking  damage  to  the  group’s 
reputation. 
 
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash 
flows, matching maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities, and by ensuring that surplus funds are generally 
only invested in instruments that are tradable in highly liquid markets or that can be relinquished with minimal risk of loss.

Fair value hierarchy 
 
All  financial  instruments  for  which  fair  value  is  recognised  or  disclosed  are  categorised  within  the  fair  value  hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: 
 
Level 1 
Level 2
Quoted market prices in an active market (that are unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities 
Valuation techniques (for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable) 
Valuation  techniques  (for  which  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value  measurement  is 
unobservable)
Level 3
For financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. 
 
There were no transfers between categories during the period. 
 
The following table presents the group’s financial instruments measured and recognised at fair value at 30 June 2016 and 30 
June 2015.

Valuation techniques 
 
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available-
for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.  The quoted market price used for 
financial assets held by the group is the current bid price.  These instruments are included in level 1. 
 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is 
determined using valuation techniques.  These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is 
available  and  rely  as  little  as  possible  on  entity  specific  estimates.  The  valuation  techniques  include  forward  pricing  using 
present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward 
rate  curves  of  the  underlying  commodity.  If  all  significant  inputs  required  to  fair  value  an  instrument  are  observable,  the 
instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.  
 
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include;
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT – continued
  Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments. 

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the end of the 
reporting period.
  Other  techniques,  such  as  estimated  discounted  cash  flows,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  the  remaining
financial instruments.
The  net  fair  value  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  non-interest  bearing  financial  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  group 
approximate  their  carrying  values.  The  carrying  values  (less  impairment  provision  if  provided)  of  trade  receivables  and 
payable are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
Measurement 
At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value 
through  profit  or  loss,  transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  the  financial  asset.  Transaction 
costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. 
 
Fair value measurement  
The  group  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in  statement  of  financial  position  based  on  current/non-current  classification.  An 
asset is current when it is either: 
 

Expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period 
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after 
the reporting period
It is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
 
A liability is current when either: 
 
 
 
The group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. 
 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Measurement of fair values  
When  the  fair  values  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  recorded  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  cannot  be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair  value is measured using valuation techniques. The inputs to 
these models are taken from observable  markets  where possible, but  where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement  is 
required  in  establishing  fair  values.  Judgements  include  considerations  of  inputs  such  as  liquidity  risk,  credit  risk  and 
volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Equity price risk 
 
The  group’s  investments  in  Manas  and  Burey,  which  are  classified  as  available  for  sale  financial  assets,  is  susceptible  to 
market  price  risk  arising  from  uncertainties  about  future  values  of  the  investment  securities.  At  the  reporting  date,  the 
exposure to listed equity securities at fair value was $5.0 million (30 June 2015: $2.8 million). A decrease of 10% on the share 
price of Manas could have an impact of approximately ($0.03 million) on the income or equity attributable to the group and a 
decrease of 10% on the share price of Burey could have an impact of approximately ($0.46 million), depending on whether 
the decline is prolonged. An increase of 10% in the value of the listed securities would only impact equity by $0.03 million for 
Manas and $0.46 million for Burey and would not have an effect on the profit or loss. 
 
Capital management
Management controls the capital of the group in order to ensure that the group can fund its operations in an efficient and 
timely basis and continue as a going concern. 
 
There are no externally imposed capital requirements. 
 
Management effectively manages the group’s capital by assessing the group’s cash projections up to twenty four months in 
the future and any associated financial risks. Management will adjust the group’s capital structure in response to changes in 
these risks and in the market.   
 
There have been no changes in the strategy adopted by management to control the capital of the group since the prior year.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. If the company reacquires its own equity instruments for the 
purpose of reducing its issued capital, for example as the result of a share buy-back, those instruments are deducted from 
equity and the associated shares are cancelled. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss and the consideration paid 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax) is recognised directly in equity.

23.     SHARE BASED PAYMENTS – continued 
 
The expected life of the performance rights is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns 
that  may  occur.  The  expected  volatility  reflects  the  assumptions  that  the  historical  volatility  is  indicative  of  future  trends, 
which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Refer to table 4 of the remuneration report for the fair value of the 
performance rights at the grant date. 
 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
Share based compensation benefits are provided to employees, consultants and contractors via the Perseus Mining Limited 
Employee Option Plan and the Performance Rights Plan.  
 
The  fair  value  of  options  or  performance  rights  granted  under  the  Perseus  Mining  Limited’s  Employee  Option  Plan  or  the 
Performance Rights Plan is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total 
amount  to  be  expensed  is  determined  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the  options  or  performance  rights  granted,  which 
includes  any  market  performance  conditions  but  excludes  the  impact  of  any  service  and  non-market  performance  vesting 
conditions. 
 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specific vesting conditions 
are  to  be  satisfied.  At  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the  group  revises  its  estimate  of  the  number  of  options  or 
performance rights that are expected to become vested. The employee benefit expense recognised each period takes into 
account the most recent estimate. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is only conditional upon a 
market condition. 
 
If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified.  In  addition,  an  expense  is  recognised  for  any  modification  that  increases  the  total  fair  value  of  the  share-based 
payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the date of modification. 
 
If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised  for  the  award  is  recognised  immediately.  However,  if  a  new  award  is  substituted  for  the  cancelled  award  and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a 
modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

24.  ACQUISITION OF AMARA MINING PLC 
 
On  18  April  2016,  Perseus  completed  the  scheme  of  arrangement  (“Scheme”)  by  which  the  Company  acquired  all  of  the 
issued shares of Amara Mining plc (“Amara”). Under the Scheme, Amara shareholders have received 0.68 new Perseus shares 
and 0.34 unlisted, transferable Perseus warrants for every Amara share held. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe 
for one Perseus share at $0.44 for a period of 36 months.  
 
In accordance with the Scheme Document dated 18 March 2016, 286,101,744 shares and 143,050,770 warrants have been 
issued to the shareholders of Amara.  
 
The primary asset acquired was the Yaouré project in Côte d’Ivoire. 
 
The  transaction  has  been  accounted  for  by  Perseus  as  a  purchase  of  net  assets.    For  accounting  purposes,  the  acquisition 
date was determined to be 15 April 2016, the date at which Perseus obtained control of Amara. 
 
The  fair  value  of  the  assets  acquired  have  been  measured  indirectly,  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  equity  instruments 
granted as the fair value of those assets cannot be reliably measured directly. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of 
286,101,744  Perseus  shares  at  $0.44  per  share  (the  Closing  share  price  on  ASX  on  15  April  2016)  plus  the  fair  value  of 
143,050,770 Perseus warrants at $0.11 per warrant (based on a Black Scholes Warrants Valuation) and transaction costs of 
$2,529,190 equalling a total purchase price of $144,097,410. 
 
The purchase price was calculated as follows:

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
Perseus accounted for the acquisition of Amara as an asset acquisition as the primary asset, Yaouré, is an exploration stage 
asset. In particular, Perseus deemed that an integrated set of activities and assets that are capable of being conducted and 
managed to provide a return to investors were not present in Amara, and therefore the acquisition of Amara does not meet 
the definition of a business combination.    
 
Another key estimate and judgement made by the group in relation to the acquisition of Amara was for the valuation of the 
warrants. The fair value of the warrants was based on a Black Scholes Warrants Valuation model taking into account the 
various inputs on the date of acquisition. The group has made various assumptions on these inputs, consistent with the 
valuations performed in the Amara Scheme Document, which include share price ($0.44), volatility (40%), dilution, time to 
exercise (3 years), exercise price ($0.44) and risk free rate (1.98%) at the date of acquisition.

25.  DISPOSAL GROUP HELD FOR SALE  
 
The  Burkinabe  subsidiaries  that  that  were  acquired  by  Perseus  through  the  Amara  acquisition  have  been  presented  as  a 
disposal  group  held  for  sale.  The  decision  to  sell  the  assets  was  made  by  the  Amara  Board  on  4  December  2014  and 
negotiations are ongoing by Perseus to sell the Burkinabe assets. The subsidiaries held for sale are Kalsaka Mining SA, Cluff 
Gold Sega Sarl and Cluff Mining Burkina Sarl.  The disposal group has been treated as a discontinued operation. 
 
At 30 June 2016, the disposal group comprised the following assets and liabilities:
Assets of disposal group held for sale 
Property, plant and equipment 
Inventory 
Other receivables and recoverable taxes 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Total assets of disposal group held for sale

SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
There is no cumulative income or expenses included in other comprehensive income relating to the disposal group. 
 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT  
The group classifies assets (or disposal group) as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying amount of those assets 
will  be  recovered  principally  through  a  sale  transaction  within  12  months,  rather  than  through  continuing  use.  The  group 
measures assets (or disposal group) classified as held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell.  
 
26. 
 
Other  significant  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  are  set  out  in 
relevant  sections  of  the  notes  and  below.  These  policies  have  been  consistently  applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless 
otherwise stated. Where necessary, comparative information has been restated to conform with changes in presentation in 
the current year. 
 
(a) 
New and amended Standards and Interpretations adopted by the group  
In  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  the  group  reviewed  and  has  adopted  all  of  the  new  and  revised  Standards  and 
Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to its operations and effective from 1 July 2015, including: 
 
(i)
Basis of preparation
AASB  2013-9  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards  –  Conceptual  Framework,  Materiality  and  Financial 
Instruments 
Part A makes consequential amendments arising from the issuance of AASB CF 2013-1 Amendments to the Australian 
Conceptual Framework.  
Part  B  makes  amendments  to  particular  Australian  Accounting  Standards  to  delete  references  to  AASB  1031 
Materiality and also makes minor editorial amendments to various other standards. 
 
AASB 2013-9 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and has been adopted in 
this  financial  report.  The  group  has  applied  the  new  standard  and  its  application  has  had  no  impact  on  the 
composition  of  the  group  as  they  are  largely  of  the  nature  of  clarification  of  existing  requirements  and  additional 
disclosures introduced.

(i)
Basis of preparation – continued 
AASB 2015-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031 Materiality 
The  Standard  completes  the  withdrawal  of  references  to  AASB  1031  in  all  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and 
Interpretations, allowing that Standard to effectively be withdrawn.
AASB 2013-9 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015 and has no material impact on 
the composition of the group.
Accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective 
At the date of the authorisation of these financial  statements, certain new  standards,  amendments and  interpretations to 
existing  standards  have  been  published  but  are  not  yet  effective,  and  have  not  been  adopted  early  by  the  group. 
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the group’s accounting policies for the 
first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. 
 
(i)
AASB  9  Financial  Instruments  (December  2014)  is  a  new  standard  which  replaces  AASB  139.  This  new  version 
supersedes  AASB  9  issued  in  December  2009  (as  amended)  and  AASB  9  (issued  in  December  2010)  and  includes  a 
model  for  classification  and  measurement,  a  single,  forward-looking  ‘expected  loss’  impairment  model  and  a 
substantially-reformed approach to hedge accounting.
AASB  9 is effective  for annual periods beginning on or after 1  January  2018. However, the Standard is available for 
early adoption. The own credit changes can be early adopted in isolation without otherwise changing the accounting 
for financial instruments. 
 
Classification and measurement 
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for classification and measurement of financial assets compared 
with  the  requirements  of  AASB  139.  There  are  also  some  changes  made  in  relation  to  financial  liabilities.  The  main 
changes are described below. 
 
Financial assets 

Financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments  will  be  classified  based  on  (1)  the  objective  of  the  entity's  business 
model for managing the financial assets; (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.
  Allows  an  irrevocable  election  on  initial  recognition  to  present  gains  and  losses  on  investments  in  equity 
instruments  that  are  not  held  for  trading  in  other  comprehensive  income.  Dividends  in  respect  of  these 
investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or 
recycling on disposal of the instrument. 
Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing 
so  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistency  that  would  arise  from 
measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.

Financial liabilities 
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities are limited to the measurement of liabilities designated 
at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option. Where the fair value option is used for financial 
liabilities, the change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows: 
 

The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI) 
The remaining change is presented in profit or loss
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was caused by changes in the credit risk of liabilities elected to 
be measured at fair value. This change in accounting means that gains or losses attributable to changes in the entity’s 
own credit risk would be recognised in OCI.  These amounts recognised in OCI are not recycled to profit or loss if the 
liability is ever repurchased at a discount. 
 
Impairment 
The  final  version  of  AASB  9  introduces  a  new  expected-loss  impairment  model  that  will  require  more  timely 
recognition of expected credit losses. Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to account for expected credit 
losses from when financial instruments are first recognised and to recognise full lifetime expected losses on a more 
timely basis.

Hedge accounting 
Amendments to  AASB 9  (December 2009 & 2010 editions and AASB 2013-9)  issued in December 2013 included the 
new  hedge  accounting  requirements,  including  changes  to  hedge  effectiveness  testing,  treatment  of  hedging  costs, 
risk components that can be hedged and disclosures. 
 
Consequential  amendments  were also made to other standards as a  result  of AASB 9, introduced by AASB 2009-11 
and superseded by AASB 2010-7, AASB 2010-10 and AASB 2014-1 – Part E. 
 
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential amendments arising from the issuance of AASB 9 in Dec 2014. 
 
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing versions of AASB 9 (AASB 9 (December 2009) and AASB 9 (December 
2010)) from 1 February 2015 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on after 1 January 2015. 
 
The application date of this standard is 1 January 2018 and management has not yet assessed its impact on the group.

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer 
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
AASB  15  Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers  replaces  the  existing  revenue  recognition  standards  AASB  111 
Construction  Contracts,  AASB  118  Revenue  and  related  interpretations  (Interpretation  13  Customer  Loyalty 
Programmes, Interpretation 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets 
from  Customers,  Interpretation  131  Revenue—Barter  Transactions  Involving  Advertising  Services  and  Interpretation 
1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 incorporates the requirements of IFRS 
15 Revenue from contracts with customers issued by the IASB and developed jointly with the US Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (“FASB”)  
 
The core principle of AASB 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services 
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. An entity recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following 
steps: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Under AASB 15, an assessment of contractual arrangements is currently in progress and the group has not completed 
the  assessment  of  the  new  standard.  AASB  2015-8  amended  the  AASB  15  effective  date  so  it  is  now  effective  for 
annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Early application is permitted.  
 
AASB 16 Leases replaces AASB 117 Leases, Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, 
Interpretation 115 Operating Leases – Incentives and Interpretation 127 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions 
Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The Standard will provide a comprehensive model for the identification of lease 
arrangements and their treatment in the financial statements of both lessees and lessors.  
 
The new Standard introduces three main changes:  
 
  A  completely  new  leases  accounting  model  for  lessees  that  require  lessees  to  recognise  all  leases  on  balance
Enhanced guidance on identifying whether a contract contains a lease;
sheet, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets; and  
Enhanced disclosures.

Lessor accounting will not significantly change. 
 
The application date of this standard is 1 January 2019 and management has not yet assessed its impact on the group.

Subsidiaries
Perseus Mining Limited 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
26.     SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – continued 
 
(b) 
(i) 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Perseus Mining Limited (the 
‘company’ or ‘parent entity’) as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.  
 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the group. The group controls an entity when it 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through power over the entity. 
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date in which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from 
the date that control ceases. 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. 
 
Intercompany  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are  eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides  evidence of the impairment  of the asset  transferred. 
Accounting policies of the subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the group.  
 
Non-controlling  interests  in  the  results  and  equity  of  subsidiaries  are  shown  separately  in  the  consolidated  statement  of 
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position respectively. 
 
(ii) 
The group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity 
owners of the group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of controlling 
and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the 
adjustment  to  non-controlling  interest  and  any  consideration  paid  or  received  is  recognised  within  equity  attributable  to 
owners of the parent entity. 
 
When the group ceases to have control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured 
to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for 
the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint controlled entity or financial asset. In 
addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if 
the  group  had  directly  disposed  of  the  related  assets  or  liabilities.  This  may  mean  that  amounts  previously  recognised  in 
other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. 
 
If the ownership interest in a jointly-controlled entity or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is 
retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to 
profit or loss where appropriate. 
 
(c) 
(i) 
Items included in the financial statements of each entity within the group are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic  environment  in which  the entity operates (“the  functional currency”). The consolidated financial  statements are 
presented in Australian dollars, which is the company’s functional and presentation currency.

(b) 
(ii) 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of  such  transactions  and  from  the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in 
profit or loss, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or 
are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. 
 
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the statement of comprehensive income, within 
finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income on a net 
basis. 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost  in a  foreign  currency are translated using the exchange 
rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary 
items measured at fair  value is treated in line with the recognition of gain or loss on change in fair  value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss 
are also recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss, respectively). 
 
(iii) 
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that  have  a  functional  currency  different  from  the  presentation  currency  are  translated  into  the  presentation  currency  as 
follows:
Group companies
 
 

assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position are translated at the closing rate at the balance date; 
income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates; and 
all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  any  net  investment  in  foreign  entities,  and  of 
borrowings  and  other  financial  instruments  designated  as  hedges  of  such  investments,  are  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other  comprehensive income relating to that 
particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement. 
 
When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in 
the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a 
net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  and  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and  are  presented  in  the 
translation reserve in equity. 
 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

Borrowings
Perseus Mining Limited 
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
26.   SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – continued 
 
(d) 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.  Borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost.  Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in 
profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.  Fees paid on the establishment of loan 
facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probably that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn  down.  In  this  case,  the  fee  is  deferred  until  the  draw  down  occurs.    To  the  extent  there  is  no  evidence  that  it  is 
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
 
Borrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, 
cancelled  or  expired.    The  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  a  financial  liability  that  has  been  extinguished  or 
transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is 
recognised in profit or loss as other income or finance costs. 
   
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 
for at least 12 months after the reporting period.  
 
(e) 
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  associated  GST,  unless  the  GST  incurred  is  not 
recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of 
the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of 
GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  taxation  authority  is  included  with  other  receivables  or  other  payables  in  the 
statement of financial position. Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from 
investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating 
cash  flows.  Commitments  and  contingencies  are  disclosed  net  of  the  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the 
taxation authority.
Goods and Services Tax (GST)
27.  CONTINGENCIES 
 
(a)
Tax
Consistent with industry practice in Ghana, Perseus Mining (Ghana) Limited (“PMGL”) is currently undergoing a tax audit in 
connection with its 30 June 2010, 2011 and 2012 income tax returns. Various matters are currently being discussed as part of 
the audit process and to date the  GRA has not  issued PMGL with a  formal report  on its findings. Based on  management's 
understanding of the matters currently under discussion they do not believe that the group will ultimately have any material 
exposure as a result of the current tax audit. 
 
(b)
Litigation
Perseus inherited litigation following the completion of the merger with Amara relating to Amara’s Burkina Faso operations. 
The matter relates to a claim brought by Bayswater Construction & Mining Burkina sarl (“BCM”), the mining contractor for 
Amara’s Burkinabé subsidiaries’ historic mining operations which were conducted until mid-2014, against Amara in 2014 in 
Burkina Faso for Amara’s involvement in the non-payment of invoices by its subsidiaries and subsequent damages in a total 
amount  of  approximately  US$22  million.  Subsequent  to  the  claim,  about  US$8  million  was  paid  to  BCM  as  a  result  of  the 
liquidation of one of the Amara subsidiaries. Perseus is currently assessing the merits of  the claim and formulating Perseus’s 
strategy and potential defences. The outflow of economic benefits is not considered probable at present, and therefore no 
amount has been recognised as a liability. 
 
There were no other known contingent liabilities identified at 30 June 2016.

28.  COMMITMENTS 
 
(a)
Exploration expenditure commitments
With  respect  to  the  group’s  mineral  property  interests  in  Ghana  and  Côte  d’Ivoire,  statutory  expenditure  commitments 
specified  by  the  mining  legislation  are  nominal  in  monetary  terms.    However,  as  part  of  mineral  licence  application  and 
renewal requirements, the group submits budgeted exploration expenditure.  In assessing subsequent renewal applications, 
the mining authorities review actual expenditure against budgets previously submitted.  The group’s budget expenditures for 
future periods are shown below.  These amounts do not become legal obligations of the group and actual expenditure may 
and does vary depending on the outcome of actual exploration programs, and the costs and results from those programs.

We have audited the accompanying financial report of Perseus Mining Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true

the notes to the financial statements, that in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101
Presentation of Financial Statements, the financial statements comply with International Financial
Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and
fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
