<p><b> I. Mandate and introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 22/16, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee to prepare a research-based report on best practices and main challenges in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights in post-disaster and post-conflict situations. 
</p>
<p>2. At its eleventh session, in August 2013, the Committee established a drafting group 
</p>
<p>composed of the following experts: Chinsung Chung, Latif H&#252;seynov, Vladimir 
</p>
<p>Kartashkin, Katharina Pabel, M. Cecilia Rachel V. Quisumbing (Rapporteur), Anantonia 
</p>
<p>Reyes Prado (Chairperson) and Imeru Tamrat Yigezu. Subsequently, Karla Hanan&#237;a de 
</p>
<p>Varela, Kaoru Obata and Ahmer Bilal Soofi also joined the drafting group. 
</p>
<p>3. At its twelfth session, in February 2014, the Committee decided to appoint Ms. 
</p>
<p>Reyes Prado as Rapporteur and Mr. H&#252;seynov as Chairperson of the drafting group. At its 
</p>
<p>thirteenth session, in August 2014, the Committee designated Mr. Soofi as Chairperson of 
</p>
<p>the drafting group to replace Mr. H&#252;seynov. The Committee also recommended that the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council extend the time for the submission of the progress report, a 
</p>
<p>recommendation that the Council endorsed in its decision 26/116. The Committee therefore 
</p>
<p>presented the progress report to the Council at its twenty-seventh session.1 
</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to Council resolution 22/16, the Committee sought the views and inputs of 
</p>
<p>Member States and various stakeholders. Questionnaires were prepared and disseminated in 
</p>
<p>September 2013 to all Member States and to representatives of civil society and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders requesting information on experiences, best practices and main challenges 
</p>
<p>faced in the promotion and protection of human rights in post-disaster and post-conflict 
</p>
<p>situations. A total of 39 responses were received, including from countries that experienced 
</p>
<p>post-disaster and post-conflict situations (see paras. 48 &#8211; 70 below).  
</p>
<p>5. In February 2014, the Committee, pursuant to paragraph 2 of Council resolution 
</p>
<p>22/16, decided also to seek the views of United Nations agencies. No replies were, 
</p>
<p>however, received. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Scope 
</b></p>
<p>6. The title of the Committee&#8217;s mandate suggests commonalities between post-disaster 
</p>
<p>and post-conflict situations, which can be found in the fact that both can represent a critical 
</p>
<p>threat to the health, safety, security or well-being of a community or large group of people. 
</p>
<p>The Committee has therefore adopted a holistic human rights approach to post-disaster and 
</p>
<p>post-conflict situations, in terms of applicability of other branches of international law, 
</p>
<p>including international humanitarian law, refugee law and international criminal law, with a 
</p>
<p>view to strengthened protection. 
</p>
<p>7. A post-disaster or post-conflict situation starts immediately after a disaster has 
</p>
<p>occurred or after the end of a conflict. It ends once the right to life and the security, 
</p>
<p>physical integrity and dignity of the affected population is protected again and the 
</p>
<p>population has recovered its rights related to basic necessities of life, including economic, 
</p>
<p>social, cultural, civil and political rights. Some reflection is needed on the meaning of 
</p>
<p>recovery of civil life, namely whether the restoration of the status quo ante would suffice, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The members of the drafting group are grateful to Veronica Sagastume, Programme Coordinator of 
</p>
<p>Norwegian Church Aid in Guatemala, and leader in the ACT Alliance Forum in Guatemala, for her 
</p>
<p>important input during the drafting of the present report. </p>


<p>since disasters or conflicts severely affect those whose living conditions are already 
</p>
<p>precarious. Further thought is required on how to improve these living conditions. Special 
</p>
<p>attention should be paid to the early stage of post-disaster and post-conflict situations (not 
</p>
<p>excluding matters of transitional justice), because humanitarian activities are mainly 
</p>
<p>developed at that stage. A holistic human rights-based approach must be also considered in 
</p>
<p>the rehabilitation and reconstruction stages, as well as in resettlement processes. Protracted 
</p>
<p>crisis situations should also be considered.2 
</p>
<p>8. While humanitarian activities mostly foster the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights, and many good practices are highlighted in the present report, experience also shows 
</p>
<p>that humanitarian activities may be sometimes seriously flawed in terms of human rights. 
</p>
<p>The main challenges faced in the promotion and protection of human rights in post-disaster 
</p>
<p>and post-conflict situations are therefore also highlighted below. 
</p>
<p>9. A perspective that respects the protective normative framework and takes into 
</p>
<p>account a human rights-based approach must already be considered prior to the disaster, 
</p>
<p>and Governments should be aware of their responsibilities in the protection of their 
</p>
<p>populations. That affected persons understand their rights is equally important. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Definitions 
</b></p>
<p>10. Over the past decades, the world has witnessed a significant increase in the number 
</p>
<p>of disasters reported: from fewer than 100 per year reported in 1975 to more than 400 in 
</p>
<p>2010. The number of people affected and the economic damage caused by disasters have 
</p>
<p>also increased.3 Conflicts and natural disasters have multi-dimensional effects on human 
</p>
<p>rights. They create crises that affect the rights to life, health and security. Crops and 
</p>
<p>infrastructure are destroyed, having a long-term effect on livelihood, access to food and 
</p>
<p>water, education, health care and even access to justice and other basic services. A natural 
</p>
<p>disaster or conflict becomes an emergency4 when local families and communities cannot 
</p>
<p>cope with or recover from it on their own. 
</p>
<p>11. It has been estimated that complex, multi-causal crisis will become more common.5 
</p>
<p>Bearing in mind such a multi-dimensional scope, many terms need to be considered in 
</p>
<p>order to attain a better understanding of the theoretical and operative complexity of these 
</p>
<p>situations. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Terms used in the context of post-conflict situations</b> 
</p>
<p><i>International and non-international armed conflict</i>  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Protracted crisis situations are characterized by recurrent natural disasters and/or conflict, food crises, 
</p>
<p>breakdown of livelihoods and insufficient institutional capacity to react to the crises. Countries in 
</p>
<p>protracted crises thus need to be regarded as a special category with special requirements in terms of 
</p>
<p>interventions by the development community. See &#8220;Countries in protracted crisis: what are they  
</p>
<p>  and why do they deserve special attention?&#8221; in <i>The State of Food Insecurity in the World</i>, Food and 
</p>
<p>Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, 2010.  
</p>
<p> 3 International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, &#8220;Red Cross Red Crescent approach 
</p>
<p>to disaster and crisis management&#8221; (available from www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/vision-and-
</p>
<p>mission/disaster-and-crisis-management/).. 
</p>
<p> 4 Emergencies are traditionally categorized into rapid onset disasters, chronic conflicts, forgotten and 
</p>
<p>cyclical. 
</p>
<p> 5 &#8220;Conflict remains an important source of vulnerability, but other hazards and risks are gaining 
</p>
<p>prominence. Increasingly we will see climate change, urbanization, migration, access to food, and 
</p>
<p>technological disasters all acting at once and further compounding risks and vulnerabilities&#8221;.

<p>12. International humanitarian law makes a distinction between an international armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, whenever there is resort to armed force between two or more States, and non-
</p>
<p>international armed conflicts, which are protracted armed confrontations between 
</p>
<p>governmental armed forces and one or more non-State armed groups, or between such 
</p>
<p>groups only. The armed confrontation must reach a minimum level of intensity and the 
</p>
<p>parties involved must show a minimum degree of organization.6 
</p>
<p><i>Peacebuilding</i>  
</p>
<p>13. The term emerged in the 1970s in the work of Johan Galtung, who called for the 
</p>
<p>creation of peacebuilding structures to promote sustainable peace by addressing the root 
</p>
<p>causes of violent conflict and supporting indigenous capacities for peace management and 
</p>
<p>conflict resolution. Since then, the term has covered a multidimensional exercise and tasks 
</p>
<p>ranging from disarming warring factions to rebuilding political, economic, judicial and civil 
</p>
<p>society institutions.7 
</p>
<p><i>Post-conflict dialogue  
</i></p>
<p>14. A methodical approach, focused on the importance of bringing an armed conflict to 
</p>
<p>an end and moving to a peacebuilding programme. The establishment of dialogue with the 
</p>
<p>other party to the conflict is a part of reconciliation and peacemaking processes. 
</p>
<p>Representatives of the most vulnerable groups and affected people should be involved in 
</p>
<p>such dialogue. 
</p>
<p><i>Post-conflict situation</i>  
</p>
<p>15. A situation in which open warfare has come to an end. Such situations remain tense 
</p>
<p>for years or decades and can easily relapse into large-scale violence. They generate 
</p>
<p>enormous development challenges for the communities affected and for international 
</p>
<p>actors, in vital sectors as security, justice, economic policy, education, media, agriculture, 
</p>
<p>health, and environment.8 Rebuilding institutional infrastructure shattered during conflict is 
</p>
<p>as important as, if not more important than, physical infrastructure.9 
</p>
<p><i>Post-conflict reconstruction  
</i></p>
<p>16. A generic term referring to the rebuilding of society in the aftermath of a conflict. 
</p>
<p>Physical infrastructures have to be repaired or rebuilt, governmental institutions have to be 
</p>
<p>reformed, psychic traumas of civilians and combatants have to be treated, the economy has 
</p>
<p>to be restarted, refugees to be repatriated, reconciliation between belligerents has to be 
</p>
<p>initiated, justice to be delivered. Efforts of this type require sustained support from the 
</p>
<p>international community. 
</p>
<p><i>Post-conflict recovery  
</i></p>
<p>17. The long-term rebuilding of a society in the aftermath of violent conflict. It includes 
</p>
<p>political, socioeconomic and physical aspects, such as disarming and reintegrating 
</p>
<p>combatants, finding durable solutions for internally displaced persons, reforming

<p>governmental institutions, promoting trauma work and reconciliation, delivering justice, 
</p>
<p>restarting the economy and rebuilding damaged infrastructure. Related terms include war-
</p>
<p>to-peace transitions and post-conflict reconstruction. It should be noted that the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recovery&#8221; has a broader connotation than reconstruction, which implies an emphasis on 
</p>
<p>physical aspects.10 
</p>
<p><i>Post-conflict transition 
</i></p>
<p>18. The tenuous period immediately following the termination of conflict during which 
</p>
<p>humanitarian needs must still be met and programmes, such as those for disarmament, 
</p>
<p>demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation and for rebuilding infrastructure, remain at 
</p>
<p>an early stage. This period may also involve the temporary transfer of government 
</p>
<p>functions to a United Nations transitional administration, such as in the case of Kosovo and 
</p>
<p>Timor-Leste.11 
</p>
<p><i>Transitional justice  
</i></p>
<p>19. A transitional justice system is often extremely important after a conflict or situation 
</p>
<p>of violence. The States concerned should develop a strategy on transitional justice that 
</p>
<p>satisfies the rights of victims by means of reconciliation and reparation mechanisms. A 
</p>
<p>transitional justice strategy comprises a set of rules, public policies and institutions the goal 
</p>
<p>of which is to redress the legacy of a violent past. It consists of both judicial and non-
</p>
<p>judicial processes and mechanisms that include prosecution initiatives, facilitating 
</p>
<p>initiatives in respect of the right to truth, delivering reparations, institutional reform and 
</p>
<p>national consultations. In this regard, international assistance must focus on the 
</p>
<p>development of the national capacity to initiate and lead the process. Disarmament, 
</p>
<p>demobilization and reintegration initiatives should be coordinated with transitional justice 
</p>
<p>processes and mechanisms in a positively reinforcing manner.12 
</p>
<p>20. Post-disaster situations comprise both natural and man-made disasters. Natural 
</p>
<p>disasters or hazards13 are events brought about by natural hazards that seriously affect the 
</p>
<p>society, economy and/or infrastructure of a region, such as floods, earthquakes or 
</p>
<p>hurricanes that cause great damage or loss of life. Depending on population vulnerability 
</p>
<p>and local response capacity, natural disasters pose challenges and problems of a 
</p>
<p>humanitarian nature. By contrast, technological or man-made hazards, such as complex 
</p>
<p>emergencies or conflicts, famine, population displacement and industrial or transport 
</p>
<p>accidents14 are events caused by humans and occur in or close to human settlements. This

</p>
<p> 13 In the report of the Secretary-General on relief to development (A/60/89 &#8211; E/2005/79), the expression 
</p>
<p>&#8220;natural disasters&#8221; was purposely not used, as it conveys the mistaken assumption that disasters 
</p>
<p>occurring as result of natural hazards are wholly &#8220;natural&#8221; and therefore inevitable and outside human 
</p>
<p>control. Instead, it is widely recognized that such disasters are the result of the way individuals and 
</p>
<p>societies relate to threats originating from natural hazards. The nature and scale of threats inherent in 
</p>
<p>hazards vary. The risks and potential for disasters associated with natural hazards are largely shaped 
</p>
<p>by prevailing levels of vulnerability and measures taken to prevent, mitigate and prepare for disasters. 
</p>
<p>Thus, disasters are, to a great extent, determined by human action, or lack thereof. The expression 
</p>
<p>&#8220;disasters associated with natural hazards&#8221; should therefore be used, in accordance with the Hyogo 
</p>
<p>Framework for Action 2005-2015, adopted in January 2005 at the World Conference on Disaster 
</p>
<p>Reduction in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.

</p>
<p>hazard (www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/definition-of-hazard/). </p>


<p>can include environmental degradation, pollution, accidents and the impact of climate 
</p>
<p>change.15 
</p>
<p>21. In the present report, the term &#8220;natural disaster&#8221; includes both sudden and slow-
</p>
<p>onset natural disasters. It is important to understand, however, that the magnitude of the 
</p>
<p>consequences of sudden natural hazards is a direct result of the way individuals and 
</p>
<p>societies relate to threats originating from natural hazards. The magnitude of the 
</p>
<p>consequences is, thus, determined by human action or the lack thereof.16 
</p>
<p><b>B. Terms used in the context of humanitarian response 
</b></p>
<p><i>Humanitarian crisis 
</i></p>
<p>22. An event or a series of events representing a critical threat to the health, safety, 
</p>
<p>security and/or well-being of a community or other large group of people, usually over a 
</p>
<p>wide area. Armed conflicts, epidemics, famine, natural disasters and other major 
</p>
<p>emergencies may all involve or lead to a humanitarian crisis that extends beyond the 
</p>
<p>mandate or capacity of any single agency. An emergency is a large-scale crisis that destroys 
</p>
<p>the lives of individuals, wrecks communities and overwhelms their ability to cope.17<b> </b></p>
<p>23. Humanitarian crises can be grouped under three categories: Natural disasters 
</p>
<p>(earthquakes, floods, storms and volcanic eruptions); man-made disasters (conflicts, plane 
</p>
<p>and train crashes, fires and industrial accidents); complex emergencies (when the effects of 
</p>
<p>a series of events or factors prevent a community from having access to their basic needs, 
</p>
<p>such as water, food, shelter, security or health care). According to the International 
</p>
<p>Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, such &#8220;complex emergencies&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>typically characterized by extensive violence and loss of life, the displacement of 
</p>
<p>populations, widespread damage to societies and economies, the need for large-scale, multi-
</p>
<p>faceted humanitarian assistance, hindrance or prevention of humanitarian assistance by 
</p>
<p>political and military constraints, particularly in post-conflict situations, and significant 
</p>
<p>security risks for humanitarian relief workers in some areas.18 
</p>
<p>24. These three kinds of emergencies can have an impact on millions of people in a 
</p>
<p>number of countries. In addition, there are increasingly new concepts for categorizing 
</p>
<p>emergencies related to climate, technology and health pandemics. 
</p>
<p><i>Humanitarian action, humanitarian aid, humanitarian assistance  
</i></p>
<p>25. The terms &#8220;humanitarian action&#8221;, &#8220;humanitarian aid&#8221; and &#8220;humanitarian assistance&#8221; </p>
<p>are often used interchangeably in post-disaster or post-conflict situations where the 
</p>
<p>principles and rules of humanitarian response are applied. For instance, according to the 
</p>
<p>World Health Organization, humanitarian assistance can be divided into three categories: 
</p>
<p>direct assistance, which is the face-to-face distribution of goods and services; indirect 
</p>
<p>assistance, which is at least one step removed from the population and involves such 
</p>
<p>activities as transporting relief goods or relief personnel; and infrastructure support, which 
</p>
<p>involves providing general services, such as road repair, airspace management and power 
</p>
<p>generation that facilitate relief, but are not necessarily visible to or solely for the benefit of

<p>the stricken population.19 The European Union for its part interprets the term &#8220;humanitarian 
</p>
<p>aid&#8221; as including traditional responses to humanitarian crisis, that is, material relief 
</p>
<p>assistance and services as shelters, water and medicines; emergency food aid at short-term 
</p>
<p>distribution and supplementary feeding programmes; relief coordination, protection and 
</p>
<p>support services like coordination, logistics and communications; reconstruction relief and 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation, which involves repairing pre-existing infrastructure as opposed to longer-
</p>
<p>term activities designed to improve the level of infrastructure; and disaster prevention and 
</p>
<p>preparedness in terms of disaster risk reduction, early warning systems, contingency stocks 
</p>
<p>and planning.20 
</p>
<p>26. Irrespective of the terminology used, all humanitarian responses have the same 
</p>
<p>objective: to save lives, to alleviate suffering and to maintain and protect human dignity 
</p>
<p>during and in the aftermath of emergencies. They are guided by the principles of humanity, 
</p>
<p>impartiality, neutrality and independence. Furthermore, during emergencies, the timeliness 
</p>
<p>of humanitarian aid and the protection of vulnerable groups become vital, particularly at the 
</p>
<p>stage of rescue.

<p>27. Persons affected by and victims of conflicts and disasters include internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons, who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places 
</p>
<p>of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or man-
</p>
<p>made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border, 
</p>
<p>refugees, and stateless persons. </p>
<p>28. There are other groups of people who are particularly vulnerable in post-conflict and 
</p>
<p>post-emergency situations. &#8220;Vulnerable groups&#8221; refers to all those persons that can be at 
</p>
<p>risk and affected by the negative effects of disasters or conflicts. Their vulnerability will 
</p>
<p>depend on their social, economic, political, cultural and ethnic position. Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>action in all post-disaster or post-conflict settings should pay particular attention to women, 
</p>
<p>children, older persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, minorities and 
</p>
<p>LGBTI persons. It is also essential that affected populations are sensitized to the fact that 
</p>
<p>they are rights-holders, not mere beneficiaries of charitable action. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>29. In emergency, post-disaster and post-conflict situations, gender-based discrimination 
</p>
<p>increases the vulnerability of women and girls, including those with disabilities. Protection 
</p>
<p>activities established in this framework by national and international stakeholders should to 
</p>
<p>adopt a holistic approach to address these issues from an institutional perspective with an 
</p>
<p>impact on national policies and regulations, thus avoiding having to limit interventions to 
</p>
<p>specific activities that will only respond partially to the problem. 
</p>
<p>30. Women and girls must be one of the prioritized groups for humanitarian aid, relief 
</p>
<p>and recovery. Special protection approaches should be considered during the planning 
</p>
<p>process of the response and humanitarian aid. Women&#8217;s participation in humanitarian aid 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 World Health Organization, Humanitarian Health Action, Definitions: emergencies (available from 
</p>
<p>www.who.int/hac/about/definitions/en/). 
</p>
<p> 20 European Commission, Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, &#8220;Humanitarian aid&#8221;, 15 April 2014 
</p>
<p>(see http://ec.europa.eu/echo/en/what/humanitarian-aid). </p>


<p>decision-making must also be promoted and guaranteed. Mechanisms to prevent gender-
</p>
<p>based violence, sexual harassment and rape should be put in place, as should legal aid and 
</p>
<p>social assistance to victims of sexual and of gender-based violence. In situations of 
</p>
<p>international or non-international armed conflict, humanitarian aid and reconciliation 
</p>
<p>processes should take into account traditional practices of having women as spoils of war. 
</p>
<p>In addition, women from indigenous and minority communities face multiple forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and require specific protection measures against both gender-based 
</p>
<p>discrimination and racist attitudes. 
</p>
<p>31. In its resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, the Security Council set 
</p>
<p>out the international framework in this regard. In particular, it urged Member States to 
</p>
<p>ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national, regional 
</p>
<p>and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management, and 
</p>
<p>resolution of conflict, and called upon all actors involved, when negotiating and 
</p>
<p>implementing relevant agreements, to adopt a gender perspective, including, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>special needs of women and girls during repatriation and resettlement and for rehabilitation, 
</p>
<p>reintegration and post-conflict reconstructions. Effective legal frameworks must prohibit 
</p>
<p>and criminalize violence against women and girls, prevent violence and safeguard 
</p>
<p>survivors. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Children 
</b></p>
<p>32. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) recognizes that when an emergency 
</p>
<p>strikes, whether a sudden onset natural disaster or an armed conflict, children require 
</p>
<p>special protection to ensure their safety and well-being.21 The core commitments for 
</p>
<p>children in humanitarian action constitute the UNICEF central policy on how to uphold the 
</p>
<p>rights of children affected by humanitarian crises. In her report on the impact of armed 
</p>
<p>conflict on children, the independent expert appointed by the Secretary-General in 1994, 
</p>
<p>Gra&#231;a Machel, called for an end to the targeting of children in armed conflicts.22 In the 
</p>
<p>report, the independent expert highlighted the fact that millions of girls and boys were 
</p>
<p>victims of killing, maiming, torture, rape, sexual exploitation, abduction, forced labour and 
</p>
<p>other violations of the rights of the child in pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict 
</p>
<p>situations. She recognized that girls were more vulnerable, that the recruitment and use of 
</p>
<p>children in armed conflict was a violation of international law, as were the attacks on and 
</p>
<p>the military use of protected places that usually have a significant presence of children, 
</p>
<p>such as schools, hospitals and homes. In addition, she emphasized that the fact that children 
</p>
<p>were still being shamefully abused was &#8220;clear indication that we have barely begun to fulfil 
</p>
<p>our obligation to protect them&#8221;.23 Girls and boys are right-holders and therefore need to be 
</p>
<p>also involved in the humanitarian assistance process. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Older persons 
</b></p>
<p>33. Older persons are among the most affected during disasters and conflicts. 
</p>
<p>Disabilities, displacement, disease, malnutrition, discrimination and insecurity worsen the 
</p>
<p>living conditions of the elderly during post-conflict and post-disaster situations. The needs 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 See UNICEF, Child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse, Child protection in 
</p>
<p>emergencies at www.unicef.org/protection/57929_62178.html. 
</p>
<p> 22 A/51/306. 
</p>
<p> 23 Ibid., para. 313. </p>


<p>of older persons should therefore be included in immediate and long-term humanitarian 
</p>
<p>relief and assistance, as well as in humanitarian polices and guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>34. Persons with disabilities24 are disproportionately affected in situations of disaster 
</p>
<p>and conflict because many of the resources for humanitarian aid, shelter and assistance 
</p>
<p>become inaccessible for them. In addition, there is a direct correlation between 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons with disabilities and insufficient resources. Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>aid, rescue, relief and rehabilitation should therefore meet the needs of the whole 
</p>
<p>population and also include the participation of persons with disabilities in all stages of 
</p>
<p>emergency response. Disability in post-disaster and post-conflict situations also rises 
</p>
<p>because people are injured and need specialized assistance and resources.25 
</p>
<p><b> E. Indigenous peoples and minorities 
</b></p>
<p>35. Indigenous peoples26 and minorities27 have traditionally been excluded from 
</p>
<p>development. Their settlements are mainly in rural areas, which are prone to natural hazards 
</p>
<p>and high levels of poverty. This places them at risk in the event of disasters and conflicts. It 
</p>
<p>is important to recognize and better understand indigenous peoples and minorities, and to 
</p>
<p>boost their knowledge of mechanisms established for disaster risk reduction.28 
</p>
<p><b> F. LGBTI persons 
</b></p>
<p>36. Stigmatization and discrimination based on sexual orientation increase gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence in post-conflict and post-disaster situations, negatively affecting LGBTI persons 
</p>
<p>with regard to the provision of food assistance, shelter and humanitarian aid. 
</p>
<p><b> V. A human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>37. Human rights are the universal legal guarantees that protect individuals and groups 
</p>
<p>against actions and omissions interfering with fundamental freedoms, entitlements and 
</p>
<p>human dignity.29According to UNICEF, human rights principles and values are not only the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 24 See Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 1. 
</p>
<p> 25 See the report on the Panel Discussion on Disaster Resilience and Disability: Ensuring Equality and 
</p>
<p>Inclusion, United Nations Headquarters, 10 October 2013.

</p>
<p> 29 OHCHR, Frequently asked questions on a human rights-based approach to development cooperation, 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>foundation for development, but also for the response in emergencies. Human rights 
</p>
<p>principles of universality and non-discrimination mean that the promotion of social 
</p>
<p>inclusion, equality and justice should be central concerns.30 
</p>
<p>38. The human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework for the process of 
</p>
<p>human development that is normally based on international human rights standards and 
</p>
<p>operationally aimed at the promotion and protection of human rights. It seeks to analyse the 
</p>
<p>inequalities that lie at the heart of development problems and those in emergency situations, 
</p>
<p>as well as to redress discriminatory practices and the unjust distribution of power, which 
</p>
<p>impede development. 
</p>
<p>39. A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements, and 
</p>
<p>corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, working towards strengthening the 
</p>
<p>capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their 
</p>
<p>obligations. It is based on the premise that the empowerment of rights-holders and the 
</p>
<p>challenging of duty-bearers are in themselves important results. It recognizes every human 
</p>
<p>being both as a person and as a right-holder and envisages the guarantee of human rights 
</p>
<p>protection and accomplishment, mainly by the States and other actors in emergency 
</p>
<p>situations and humanitarian response. 
</p>
<p>40. A human rights-based approach requires that the following principles and standards 
</p>
<p>derived from human rights treaties guide all humanitarian response: 
</p>
<p>(a) Universality: human rights must be afforded to everyone, without exception; 
</p>
<p>(b) Indivisibility: human rights are indivisible and interdependent; 
</p>
<p>(c) Participation and consultation: people from all sectors have to participate in 
</p>
<p>the decisions to protect their rights and their opinions must be taken into account; 
</p>
<p>(d) Non-discrimination: human rights must be guaranteed without discrimination 
</p>
<p>of any kind, with due regard for the special needs of victims, particularly vulnerable 
</p>
<p>persons, especially in relation to policies and practices that may have a discriminatory 
</p>
<p>effect on, for instance, persons with disabilities owing to their lack of inclusiveness and 
</p>
<p>accessibility; 
</p>
<p>(e) Accountability: mechanisms of accountability should be created for the 
</p>
<p>enforcement of rights. A human rights-based approach in post-disaster and post-conflict 
</p>
<p>situations emphasizes measurable and enforceable obligations through mechanisms of 
</p>
<p>accountability, which helps to strengthen political commitment and justifications for 
</p>
<p>resource allocation, and improves incentives for the provision of social services without 
</p>
<p>discrimination.31 This approach therefore opens up international mechanisms of human 
</p>
<p>rights accountability and oversight in such contexts.32 Furthermore, accountability is a 
</p>
<p>process that helps to identify what works, so it can be repeated, and what does not, so it can 
</p>
<p>be revised. It is a way of checking that reasonable balances are fairly struck;33

</p>
<p> 33 A/HRC/7/11, para. 99. </p>


<p>(f) Transparency: Governments and humanitarian partners, both national and 
</p>
<p>international, must be transparent about all information and decision-making processes 
</p>
<p>relating to rights. Decision-makers wanting to manage emergency situations, however, 
</p>
<p>sometimes do not disclose certain information relevant to disaster mitigation. Governments, 
</p>
<p>should, in principle, disseminate all relevant information to the general public. Information 
</p>
<p>should not be distorted to prevent social panic. It is indeed foreseeable that, in the process 
</p>
<p>of disseminating information, some simplification would be not only inevitable but even 
</p>
<p>necessary. It is important to highlight, however, that, in such circumstances, such 
</p>
<p>government initiatives and accountability require records to be kept of the decision-making 
</p>
<p>process; 
</p>
<p>(g) Do no harm or do less harm: although aid can become part of the dynamics 
</p>
<p>of a conflict and may even prolong it, humanitarian organizations must strive to &#8220;do no 
</p>
<p>harm&#8221; or to minimize the harm they may be inadvertently doing simply by being present 
</p>
<p>and providing assistance.34 
</p>
<p>41. In the programme for reform (1997),35 and its second phase, an agenda for further 
</p>
<p>change (2001),36 the Secretary-General called upon United Nations agencies to make 
</p>
<p>human rights a cross-cutting priority for the United Nations system. In 2003, a group of 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 
</p>
<p>committed to integrating human rights into their national development cooperation 
</p>
<p>programmes by adopting a common understanding on a rights-based approach.37 In 
</p>
<p>November 2013, the Secretary-General launched the &#8220;Human Rights Up Front&#8221; initiative, 
</p>
<p>which aims at improving the United Nations response to safeguard human rights in 
</p>
<p>complex crises and prevent horrendous human suffering. The need for early action, and the 
</p>
<p>crucial role of responding early to human rights violations, is at the heart of the initiative. 
</p>
<p>Though framed in terms of the protection of human rights, it also includes the task of 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians, with the importance of preventive efforts being consistently 
</p>
<p>emphasized. Another central aspect is better organizational preparedness by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations. The Secretariat and United Nations agencies, funds and programmes are to ensure 
</p>
<p>that the United Nations System, both on the ground and at Headquarters, is appropriately 
</p>
<p>prepared &#8211; early on &#8211; to deal with evolving crisis situations. 
</p>
<p>42. There seems to be a cyclic process between human rights violations, humanitarian 
</p>
<p>crises and humanitarian response. Although this cyclic dynamic is not necessarily a lineal 
</p>
<p>process, some stages have been identified, both for conflicts and natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>According to OHCHR, when human rights violations are a consequence of conflict 
</p>
<p>situations, the sequence of events is as follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) Human rights violations as causes of conflict; 
</p>
<p>(b) Humanitarian crisis; 
</p>
<p>(c) New violations: consequences of conflict and humanitarian crises; 
</p>
<p>(d) Pre-existing human rights issues are exacerbated; 
</p>
<p>(e) Human rights promotion and protection as objective of peace agreements.38 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 34 The &#8220;do no harm&#8221; principle, developed by Mary B. Anderson in the 1990&#8217;s, has developed into an 
</p>
<p>approach, inspiring a series of training workshops for humanitarian workers.

</p>
<p> 38 See OHCHR, International Legal Protection of Human Rights in Armed Conflict (New York and 
</p>
<p>Geneva, 2011).  </p>


<p>43. Lastly, when human rights violations are a consequence of natural disasters, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR sees the sequence of events as follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) Natural disaster; 
</p>
<p>(b) Humanitarian crisis; 
</p>
<p>(c) Pre-existing human rights issues are exacerbated and new violations as 
</p>
<p>consequences of the disaster; 
</p>
<p>(d) Human rights inform planning and delivery of humanitarian response; 
</p>
<p>(e) Human rights integrated into emergency preparedness plans. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. International normative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. United Nations human rights framework and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>44. To increase the effectiveness and scope of human rights protection in post-disaster 
</p>
<p>and post-conflict situations, there is a need for a holistic and complementary approach 
</p>
<p>among the different branches of international law: international human rights law, 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, refugee law and international criminal law. The 
</p>
<p>international human rights legal framework is composed of specific treaties and soft law 
</p>
<p>that aim to protect people affected by natural disasters and conflicts. As protection is not 
</p>
<p>limited to survival and security in an emergency situation, all relevant guarantees with 
</p>
<p>regard to civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural ones, will 
</p>
<p>contribute to dignify the people affected. 
</p>
<p>45. Some of the key principles in relation with humanitarian assistance were formulated 
</p>
<p>by the General Assembly in its resolution 43/131 on humanitarian assistance for victims of 
</p>
<p>natural disasters and similar emergency situations, in which the Assembly reaffirmed the 
</p>
<p>sovereignty of affected States and their leadership in humanitarian assistance in their own 
</p>
<p>territories, stressed the important contribution made in providing humanitarian assistance 
</p>
<p>by governmental and non-governmental organizations, and urged States to participate 
</p>
<p>closely with affected countries in international efforts with a view to facilitating the transit 
</p>
<p>of humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>46. States therefore have the primary responsibility for coordinating humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance, and are at least under the moral duty to accept bona fide offers of assistance by 
</p>
<p>States or other relevant organizations. This emphasis on the States&#8217; role does not however, 
</p>
<p>go to the detriment of the role of local communities and the fact that planning for disaster 
</p>
<p>risk reduction should be rather de-centralized and concretized. 
</p>
<p>47. The Universal Human Rights Index documents a number of concrete 
</p>
<p>recommendations, made in the context of the universal periodic review in relation to 
</p>
<p>humanitarian action in situations of natural disasters, that relate primarily to strengthening 
</p>
<p>or improving measures for disaster reduction and to responding appropriately to 
</p>
<p>emergencies, given the vulnerability of certain countries. Other countries were asked to 
</p>
<p>continue their efforts to strengthen and to share their experience, lessons learned, methods 
</p>
<p>and best practices in prevention and humanitarian response applied and particularly 
</p>
<p>considering providing assistance in case of natural disasters and taking positive steps with 
</p>
<p>regard to climate change. Several recommendations relate to post-conflict situations and to 
</p>
<p>continuing implementation of the Security Council resolutions on women, peace and 
</p>
<p>security; ensuring the rights of children and women and women&#8217;s participation in 
</p>
<p>reconstruction and peacebuilding processes; improving access to education; intensifying 
</p>
<p>efforts to prevent, punish and eradicate all forms of violence against women; preventing </p>


<p>and combating widespread economic exploitation of children; and strengthening 
</p>
<p>institutional capacities in the protection and promotion of human rights in post-conflict 
</p>
<p>situations through the incorporation of a human rights-based approach into all policies and 
</p>
<p>practices. 
</p>
<p>48. In its resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, the Security Council 
</p>
<p>reaffirmed the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace 
</p>
<p>negotiations, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict 
</p>
<p>reconstruction, and stressed the importance of their equal participation and full involvement 
</p>
<p>in all efforts for maintenance and promotion of peace and security. It urged all actors to 
</p>
<p>increase participation of women and incorporate gender perspectives in all United Nations 
</p>
<p>peace and security efforts. It also called upon all parties to the conflict to take special 
</p>
<p>measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and 
</p>
<p>other forms of sexual abuse, in situations of armed conflict. It provided a number of 
</p>
<p>important operational mandates, with implications for Member States and United Nations 
</p>
<p>entities. 
</p>
<p>49. Similarly, article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities not 
</p>
<p>only enshrines obligations to ensure protection and safety of persons with disabilities in 
</p>
<p>situations of armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, but also requires an inclusive 
</p>
<p>approach for the design of disaster risk reduction policies accessible to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. 
</p>
<p>50. In recent years, attention has been drawn in particular to humanitarian aid and 
</p>
<p>assistance owing to emergencies provoked by armed conflicts and disasters around the 
</p>
<p>world, leading to the development of a specialized framework and mechanisms, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) Humanitarian policies, agreements, guidelines, documents and tools of the 
</p>
<p>Inter-Agency Standing Committee39 for humanitarian assistance, such as the Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response, the Guidelines on Mental Health 
</p>
<p>and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings, the Gender Handbook in Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Action, the Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural Disasters and the 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on Gender-Based Violence Interventions; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Sphere Project, a voluntary initiative that brings together a wide range of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian agencies around the common aim of improving the quality of humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance and accountability of humanitarian actors to their constituents, donors and 
</p>
<p>affected populations. Established in 1997, it is today a vibrant community of humanitarian 
</p>
<p>response practitioners. 
</p>
<p>51. Other important humanitarian mechanisms include: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Humanitarian Accountability Partnership, which has established concrete 
</p>
<p>norms, training, code of conduct, protection of sexual exploitation and abuse40 guidance and 
</p>
<p>certification; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005&#8211;2015: Building the Resilience of 
</p>
<p>Nations and Communities to Disasters;

</p>
<p>Nations and non-United Nations humanitarian organizations to explore ways of exploring 
</p>
<p>humanitarian partnerships;

<p>are not or no longer participating in hostilities (civilians, medical and other health 
</p>
<p>professionals, humanitarian personnel, the wounded, sick or shipwrecked, or prisoners of 
</p>
<p>war). The Conventions and the Protocols thereto call for measures to be taken to prevent or 
</p>
<p>to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law. They contain stringent 
</p>
<p>rules to deal with &#8220;grave breaches&#8221;. Those responsible for grave breaches must be sought, 
</p>
<p>tried or extradited, whatever their nationality. 
</p>
<p>53. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and 
</p>
<p>independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives 
</p>
<p>and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide 
</p>
<p>them with assistance. ICRC also endeavours to prevent suffering by promoting and 
</p>
<p>strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. Its work is based on 
</p>
<p>the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Additional Protocols thereto, its Statutes, the Statutes 
</p>
<p>of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the resolutions of the 
</p>
<p>International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. ICRC addresses the effects 
</p>
<p>of conflict by, for instance, focusing attention on refugees and displaced persons (in 
</p>
<p>complementarity with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</p>
<p>(UNHCR)), mine clearance, training armed forces in the use of legitimate force, doctrine 
</p>
<p>development and counselling. One of its main activities is also the search for missing 
</p>
<p>persons; in this area, it has formulated an international standard of ante- and post-mortem 
</p>
<p>using forensic DNA analysis. ICRC forms part of the International Red Cross and Red 
</p>
<p>Crescent Movement. Seven fundamental principles guarantee the continuity of the 
</p>
<p>Movement&#8217;s work: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, 
</p>
<p>unity and universality. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Regional institutions and mechanisms for humanitarian aid and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance 
</b></p>
<p>54. Various regional, subregional and national multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder 
</p>
<p>initiatives evaluate and implement humanitarian assistance and human rights law in post-
</p>
<p>disaster and post-conflict situations.

<p>55. In Africa, the initiatives implemented include Africa Humanitarian Action; the 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action for the Implementation of the Africa Regional Strategy for Disaster 
</p>
<p>Risk Reduction; the African Union Commission, which facilitates and coordinates the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Regional Strategy, the Programme of Action and the Hyogo 
</p>
<p>Framework for Action; the Africa Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction; periodic 
</p>
<p>high-level meetings of the African Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction and 
</p>
<p>the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment; regional economic communities; 
</p>
<p>and the Planning and Coordinating Agency of the New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Development (NEPAD). 
</p>
<p>56. Important initiatives in Asia include Asian Disaster Reduction and Response 
</p>
<p>Network and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center. 
</p>
<p>57. In Latin America, several intergovernmental bodies have been established, including 
</p>
<p>the Organization of American States, with the working group of the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Network for Disaster Mitigation; and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean 
</p>
<p>States, with the Risk, Emergency and Disaster Task Force Inter-Agency Work Group for 
</p>
<p>Latin America and the Caribbean. The following mechanisms and forums have also been 
</p>
<p>created: the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency; the Ibero-American 
</p>
<p>General Secretariat; the Coordination Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters in 
</p>
<p>Central America; and the Comprehensive Risk Management Policy for Central America. 
</p>
<p>58. In Europe, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, operated within the 
</p>
<p>Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, was established to ensure a 
</p>
<p>coordinated, more rapid response to disasters both inside and outside Europe, using the 
</p>
<p>resources of the 32 countries participating in the European Union Civil Protection 
</p>
<p>Mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National legal frameworks and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>59. Governments should not use humanitarian assistance for political purposes. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, political parties should not take advantage of an emergency to better position 
</p>
<p>themselves among the population. Political patronage should be avoided in post-disaster 
</p>
<p>and post-conflict situations; affected populations, like any other individual or community, 
</p>
<p>continue to have rights and to be voters. In this regard, the responses received from 
</p>
<p>Member States to the questionnaire concerning their legal frameworks and the mechanisms 
</p>
<p>for responding to emergencies resulting from disasters or conflicts from a rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach are described below. 
</p>
<p>60. Slovakia is working to ensure that the Act on State Security in times of War and 
</p>
<p>Hostilities, Martial Law and Emergency State allows for the distribution of vitally 
</p>
<p>important products and goods to citizens affected by a crisis. 
</p>
<p>61. In Colombia, Law No. 1523 stipulates that humanitarian assistance must be 
</p>
<p>provided on the basis of the principles of equality, timeliness, relevance and effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>Article 1 of the law stipulates that all individuals are to receive the same support and the 
</p>
<p>same treatment in situations of disaster and danger. A manual on the standardization of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance details more principles. 
</p>
<p>62. In Chile, the national civil protection and emergency system is based on the 
</p>
<p>Constitution of the State. To enforce the guarantees enshrined in the system, particularly 
</p>
<p>with regard to disasters, a number of relevant laws and regulations have been formulated. </p>


<p>63. In Mexico, as part of the national strategy to respond to humanitarian crises, the 
</p>
<p>General Civil Protection Act has been adopted to provide for the establishment of a national 
</p>
<p>mechanism for disasters from the viewpoint of integrated risk management, known as the 
</p>
<p>national system of civil protection (Sistema Nacional de Protecci&#243;n Civil). 
</p>
<p>64. In Japan, various measures have been taken to improve: its guidelines on nuclear 
</p>
<p>emergency preparedness and emergency response; the scope and extent of basic and 
</p>
<p>detailed health management surveys; dose limits of radiation; access to accurate 
</p>
<p>information on radiation and its health effects; transparency and accountability of the 
</p>
<p>nuclear industry and regulatory authority; and the participation of affected communities in 
</p>
<p>decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>65. In addition to the above good practices, it is equally important that national laws for 
</p>
<p>disaster risk reduction be enacted to make provisions for the concrete allocation of funds to 
</p>
<p>disaster risk reduction. Evidence abounds of the immediate and direct effects that natural 
</p>
<p>disasters and conflicts have on the economy of communities and countries, in addition to 
</p>
<p>their long-term impact. In most disasters, the bulk of immediate damage comes from 
</p>
<p>destroyed assets (stock), such as buildings, infrastructure, inventories and growing crops. 
</p>
<p>Disasters also generate short- and long-term losses in economic activity and income (flow) 
</p>
<p>in affected areas, as people and companies lose their means of production and access to 
</p>
<p>markets. Economic activity picks up gradually during the years of reconstruction, starting 
</p>
<p>with emergency response and humanitarian assistance. Capital assets can be regenerated 
</p>
<p>through reconstruction investment, which generates income as work progresses. Such 
</p>
<p>natural disasters as storms and droughts have, according to one study, a moderate but 
</p>
<p>negative, permanent impact on income growth.42 
</p>
<p>66. The above-mentioned examples would indicate that Africa and Latin America have 
</p>
<p>improved their multilevel and multisectoral work on emergency preparedness and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian response, the result of the effects they have had to face in the conflicts and 
</p>
<p>disasters experienced in recent decades. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation of the community and the persons affected 
</b></p>
<p>67. Humanitarian assistance is developed in a comprehensive framework where legal, 
</p>
<p>social, political, ethical and cultural relations need to be taken into account. In the legal 
</p>
<p>framework, the State is the duty-bearer while people and communities are rights-holders, 
</p>
<p>not just the recipients of aid. This issue is a central theme in education, formal and informal 
</p>
<p>processes linked to disaster prevention and reduction, rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
</p>
<p>Some initiatives could be put in place in this regard: 
</p>
<p>(a) Community participation programmes, which should be accessible to and 
</p>
<p>inclusive of rural, indigenous and displaced communities, women and girls and persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities; actions in the field of risk microzonation should consider community 
</p>
<p>involvement and identify the specific characteristics of the affected community; 
</p>
<p>(b) Specific school safety plans should be developed and include other forms of 
</p>
<p>institutions, such as special schools;  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2011, &#8220;Assessing economic impact of natural disasters: 
</p>
<p>A mix of stock-and-flow indicators&#8221; (see www.unescap.org/stat/data/syb2011/II-
</p>
<p>Environment/Natural-disasters.asp). </p>


<p>(c) Cultural patterns that allow women and men to participate equally in 
</p>
<p>decision-making processes at home and in the community on health and other issues need 
</p>
<p>to be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>68. Measures to rebuild local communities following their destruction by disasters are 
</p>
<p>essential. Affected populations are, as a result, forced to live in a totally new environment, 
</p>
<p>such as in temporary housing units, shelters and camps. It is recognized fact that, although 
</p>
<p>affected populations are expected to build a new community themselves, not all of them can 
</p>
<p>adjust to a new environment. 
</p>
<p>69. Individuals, as rights-holders, have the right to participate in the design and 
</p>
<p>evaluation of policies relating to their resettlement. The participation of victims and 
</p>
<p>affected persons ensures the transparency of administration and contributes to the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of humanitarian aid, relief and recovery actions. Local authorities have the 
</p>
<p>obligation to consult and involve the persons concerned during the early stages to avoid a 
</p>
<p>further gap in communication with beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p>70. The private sector and civil society also play and important role. States, for instance, 
</p>
<p>can promote prior agreements with companies in order to avoid price speculation and 
</p>
<p>shortages, and can also buy from local producers in order to improve the local economy. 
</p>
<p>Rising food prices hinder access to food to millions of people, even when products are 
</p>
<p>available. In addition, the final increase in food prices does not correspond to prices of 
</p>
<p>producers, who continue to earn very little from selling their crops, and thus perpetuates 
</p>
<p>their poverty and worsens their situation in emergencies. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender focus 
</b></p>
<p>71. One best practice identified from the responses received concerned the consideration 
</p>
<p>of gender issues in disaster responses; for example, the provision of personal hygiene kits, 
</p>
<p>food and water supplies, differentiated between men and women. 
</p>
<p>72. A gender-based approach takes into account the specific needs of women; for 
</p>
<p>example, more toilets need to be built for women because they usually carry their children 
</p>
<p>with them. While the &#8220;code of conviviality&#8221; establishes that common kitchen brigades 
</p>
<p>should be mixed to favour gender equality, shelters should have separate restrooms for men 
</p>
<p>and women, and a private room for intimate cleaning for women. Protection mechanisms 
</p>
<p>for gender-based violence and rape are another example. Women and girls, and in particular 
</p>
<p>those with disabilities, often are victims of not only rape and sexual harassment but also 
</p>
<p>trafficking and negative coping strategies. For example, they may be at a high risk of sexual 
</p>
<p>assault when they collect water or go to the restroom; good lighting is therefore essential. 
</p>
<p>73. As women, girls, older persons and children are also at risk of domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>centres for psychological assistance and legal aid ought to be in place. Shelters for women 
</p>
<p>and children survivors of violence could be considered part of humanitarian aid. 
</p>
<p>74. There is a need to develop thematic guidelines on female empowerment, and on 
</p>
<p>children and persons with disabilities in post-disaster and post-conflict situations. With 
</p>
<p>regard to children, special attention should be paid to former child soldiers and victims of 
</p>
<p>any form of violence. Secure playing areas for children and parents need to be put in place 
</p>
<p>in order to encourage solidarity and to ensure the mental health of affected persons. 
</p>
<p>75. Women&#8217;s involvement in the delivery of humanitarian aid supplies and 
</p>
<p>arrangements is important in order to avoid preferential treatment towards men and for 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s empowerment in the community. Women should not have to bear the burden of 
</p>
<p>caring alone for their families; they should not be sexually abused in return for food or 
</p>
<p>other kinds of assistance; they need to have the same access to services and assistance as </p>


<p>men; and it should not be forgotten that they often take care of their children and elderly 
</p>
<p>family members as well. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Respect for cultural values 
</b></p>
<p>76. Providing food and clothes requires taking into account traditional and cultural 
</p>
<p>practices. There is also a need to increase indigenous community awareness of support and 
</p>
<p>resilience, which are important for the recovery of livelihoods of the affected persons on 
</p>
<p>their own territory or on a new one. Information on universal design and accessibility 
</p>
<p>should also be considered and welcomed for persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>77. Humanitarian kits responding to cultural practices and the needs of the population in 
</p>
<p>terms of food, kitchen, home and cleaning are indispensable. Support programmes for 
</p>
<p>nutrition should be designed in accordance with cultural requirements relating to food and 
</p>
<p>the nutritional needs of women, girls, children, including those with disabilities, and 
</p>
<p>targeted populations. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Multilevel approach 
</b></p>
<p>78. Humanitarian aid is based on legal and operational frameworks at the international, 
</p>
<p>regional, national and local levels, which therefore also calls for a multilevel approach to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the decentralization of such an emergency response. 
</p>
<p>79. Since local governments and traditional authorities are normally the closest to the 
</p>
<p>affected populations, their experience and lessons learned should be considered for 
</p>
<p>emergency response planning and implementation. Municipal governments should make 
</p>
<p>reasonable efforts to ensure adequate and decent living conditions in shelters. To that end, 
</p>
<p>guidelines should be elaborated and published for managing shelters, and identify areas 
</p>
<p>where special attention is necessary in assisting vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>80. A regional approach is also necessary, given that regional organizations and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms have significant expertise and resources to offer when dealing with disaster 
</p>
<p>situations. Regional initiatives in humanitarian aid should also be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>81. Disaster prevention and disaster risk reduction include practices to prevent serious 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and to avoid the historical accumulation of violations of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights, including the right to food. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>82. The main challenge is to develop humanitarian responses and actions by States and 
</p>
<p>specialized, global and national initiatives that fully take into consideration the protective 
</p>
<p>legal framework granted by international human rights law, international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>and other relevant branches of international law. A human rights-based approach is 
</p>
<p>important because it insists on rights-holders and duty-bearers. By putting the needs of 
</p>
<p>victims at its centre, international humanitarian law is not less important. It further 
</p>
<p>strengthens the protection and assistance afforded to affected populations. They should 
</p>
<p>frame, with other relevant branches of international law, all humanitarian work related to 
</p>
<p>disasters and conflicts. Furthermore, both international humanitarian law and international 
</p>
<p>human rights law support the recognition and prosecution of grave human rights violations 
</p>
<p>or serious violations of international humanitarian law in the context of armed conflict. If 
</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance is not based on such a framework, there is a risk that this approach 
</p>
<p>will be too limited and not integrate all the basic needs of affected people in the wider </p>


<p>planning process, as well as the responsibility of the State to lead the recovery process. 
</p>
<p>There is also a risk that some important issues will be postponed to recovery and 
</p>
<p>reconstruction, and will thus not be included in the State&#8217;s development strategy. Another 
</p>
<p>key challenge is that reconstruction efforts, an essential part of recovery, are too often 
</p>
<p>neglected. 
</p>
<p>83. In the rush to provide humanitarian aid and save lives, less attention is paid to the 
</p>
<p>human rights protection that must be provided to people affected by disasters and conflicts. 
</p>
<p>In addition, not much attention is paid to the rights of vulnerable persons. 
</p>
<p>84. Access to water was identified as a significant challenge following disasters and was 
</p>
<p>described as fundamental to prevent rape. Women are most vulnerable when they are 
</p>
<p>required to walk long distances to reach water. In addition, there are difficulties in the 
</p>
<p>provision of water supply based on international standards for hygiene and clean water. 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s particular requirements should be assessed in the case of emergency response. 
</p>
<p>Lack of access to aid supplies, information, communication and services also needs to be 
</p>
<p>addressed if the inclusiveness of persons with disabilities in disaster risk reduction policies 
</p>
<p>is to be guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>85. States must step up their efforts in the prevention of domestic violence and gender-
</p>
<p>based violence in post-conflict and post-disaster situations. Information and comprehensive 
</p>
<p>assistance are needed to support women and children survivors of violence both in and 
</p>
<p>outside the emergency areas, for example in host communities. It is important to offer 
</p>
<p>special attention, which integrates a cultural approach, to displaced persons, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, LGBT persons, older persons and indigenous peoples. States, through the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the four pillars described in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) &#8211; 
</p>
<p>participation, protection, prevention, and relief and recovery &#8211; should promote the pivotal 
</p>
<p>role that women play in conflict management, conflict resolution and sustainable peace, 
</p>
<p>because they are still excluded from participation in peace processes. Procedures and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms should be developed to involve women in protection, prevention and relief and 
</p>
<p>recovery stages. Pursuant to Council resolution 1820 (2008), States are also required to 
</p>
<p>establish the framework and mechanism to protect women, girls and children from 
</p>
<p>violence, including sexual violence in situations of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>86. It is also important to avoid political favouritism so that relief is guaranteed for all 
</p>
<p>concerned, not just for political supporters. Governments should not use humanitarian 
</p>
<p>attention for political purposes, and political parties should not use emergency situation for 
</p>
<p>better positioning themselves among the population. 
</p>
<p>87. Other identified challenges include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Lack of awareness of the Operational Guidelines on the Protection of Persons 
</p>
<p>in Situations of Natural Disasters; 
</p>
<p>(b) Lack of adequate internalization of the duties and rights with regard to the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights in situations of natural disasters, essential for 
</p>
<p>their proper implementation; 
</p>
<p>(c) Poor decentralization of policies applied to disaster prevention and disaster 
</p>
<p>risk reduction; 
</p>
<p>(d) Lack of inclusiveness of and accessibility to at-risk groups, including women, 
</p>
<p>children, older persons, persons with disabilities and indigenous peoples, as well as the lack 
</p>
<p>of involvement and partnership with private actors. 
</p>
<p>88. Laws should be in place for disaster prevention and mitigation, and States should be 
</p>
<p>obliged to allocate the resources required to improve the living conditions of persons 
</p>
<p>affected by disaster and conflict. </p>


<p>89. In some States, constitutional rights may be limited, for instance when a state of 
</p>
<p>emergency has been declared. Even in states of emergency resulting from disaster or 
</p>
<p>conflict, however, the State must respect the core of human rights and ensure that the 
</p>
<p>specific legislations respects its own Constitution, international human rights treaties and 
</p>
<p>the rules contained in international declarations on humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>90. States invest financially in humanitarian disaster and conflict relief in a planned 
</p>
<p>way, avoiding budgetary risks that jeopardize public investment in normal times. The 
</p>
<p>establishment of national funds for recovery and reconstruction could be important 
</p>
<p>initiatives. 
</p>
<p>91. Local mechanisms for denouncing violations of human rights and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law in disaster and conflict situations should be put in place to ensure the 
</p>
<p>safety, security and freedom of the persons affected. Complaints and feedback systems can 
</p>
<p>be designed and implemented as participatory processes, as can democratic-based actions. 
</p>
<p>92.<b> </b>In recent times, the term &#8220;disaster prevention&#8221; has often been coupled with &#8220;disaster 
</p>
<p>mitigation&#8221; or &#8220;disaster risk reduction&#8221;. This may have been caused by the growing 
</p>
<p>awareness that &#8220;hazards are inevitable, and the elimination of all risks is impossible&#8221;.43 In 
</p>
<p>the case of disasters, too much emphasis on prevention in planning to address disasters 
</p>
<p>might lead to the dissemination of an unfounded belief in safety. To achieve the ultimate 
</p>
<p>and foremost goal of saving lives, more attention should be paid to preparedness, early 
</p>
<p>warning and risk reduction. 
</p>
<p>93. The first action for preparedness for a disaster would, therefore, be to search what 
</p>
<p>types of risks exist in a particular area of the country, and then to raise public awareness of 
</p>
<p>those risks. Unsound economic and urban development often leads to great loss of human 
</p>
<p>life by natural hazards, besides reducing the sustainability of development. The perspective 
</p>
<p>of risk reduction should therefore be incorporated into national development plans. 
</p>
<p>94. The main challenges in peacebuilding and transitional justice are the allocation of 
</p>
<p>inadequate funds and the awareness of the international community that the resilience of 
</p>
<p>livelihoods is fundamental for peacebuilding and understanding the interdependence of 
</p>
<p>civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Main conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Although</b> r<b>escue, relief and rehabilitation action should be compliant with 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, this is not always the case. A human rights-based approach includes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles of direct and intentional linkage to human rights; transparency; 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation, inclusiveness and consultation of those affected and beneficiaries; non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination; special attention to the needs of at-risk and marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the larger set of beneficiaries; and accountability and timeliness. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Humanitarian intervention should take into account legal, social, political, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethical and cultural relations. It is fundamental that the legal framework underline 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the State holds obligations and individuals and communities hold rights. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> To increase the effectiveness and scope of human rights protection in post-
</b></p>
<p><b>disaster and post-conflict situations, a holistic and complementary approach among 
</b></p>
<p><b>the different branches of international law is necessary.</b>

<p><b> X. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Member States should recall that the full respect of all human rights and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant branches of international law can ensure adequate protection in 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian action in post-conflict and post-disaster situations. Rights relating to the

<p><b>religious freedom and freedom of speech, personal documentation, political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation, access to courts, and freedom from discrimination ) and other economic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>social and cultural protection needs (such as access to education, to receive restitution 
</b></p>
<p><b>or compensation for lost property and to work ) should be protected and respected 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the design and implementation of concrete initiatives and mechanisms at all

<p><b>principles of universal design, accessibility and inclusiveness and </b>&#8220;<b>do no harm</b>&#8221;<b> must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be included in all humanitarian aid plans and mechanisms during the design, rescue, 
</b></p>
<p><b>relief and recovery phases. These programmatic and political issues allow for better 
</b></p>
<p><b>application of international human rights law and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards, and offer a comprehensive response to crises. Mechanisms for respect of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of the most vulnerable groups should be defined in preparedness for 
</b></p>
<p><b>disasters. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> States should also recognize the need of specific funding for emergency 
</b></p>
<p><b>response, relief and reconstruction. The allocation of funds for that purpose should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>a priority in the annual national budget. In addition, States should identify long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>development budgets </b>&#8211;<b> and not only with costs of recovery and reconstruction </b>&#8211;<b> to 
</b></p>
<p><b>avoid the accumulation of damage. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Special attention should be paid to the protection of human rights of vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, in particular women, children, older persons, displaced persons and persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>with disabilities. The vulnerability of children, particularly girls, is a priority when 
</b></p>
<p><b>planning prevention and humanitarian assistance. Attacks on places usually 
</b></p>
<p><b>frequented by children, such as schools, hospitals, parks and their own homes, should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be strongly condemned and avoided at all costs. The protection of such sites should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>a priority for United Nations peacekeepers. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> Since there are many cases of States occupying the territory of other States, it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>important to highlight that, in the event of armed conflict, the occupying force is 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for the respect of international humanitarian law and the protection of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of the population of the occupied State. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> Ensuring a human rights-based approach implies a high standard of 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability. States that do not effectively protect their population during and after 
</b></p>
<p><b>a conflict or a disaster should therefore be held accountable. </b></p>


<p>104.<b> Taking into account that rescue, relief and recovery actions will depend on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context on the ground, humanitarian action may sometimes be at risk of infringing or 
</b></p>
<p><b>violating the human rights of the affected people, thus contravening </b>the &#8220;do no harm&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>principle. For that reason, plans for emergency preparedness and humanitarian aid 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be based on the human rights framework in order to prevent the living 
</b></p>
<p><b>conditions of the affected population from worsening during the delivery of 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian assistance.
