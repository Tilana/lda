<p><b>  23/&#8230;Access to medicines in the context of the right of everyone to the 
 enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
 mental health 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health is a human right that derives from the inherent 
dignity of the human person, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 17/14 of 17 June 2011 and all previous 
resolutions and decisions on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health adopted by the Council, the General Assembly and 
the Commission on Human Rights<b>, </b>as well as Assembly resolution 67/81 of 12 December 
2012 on global health and foreign policy, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, which, inter alia, 
establishes that States should take, at the national level, all measures necessary for the 
realization of the right to development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity 
for all in their access to basic resources, such as health services, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full 
enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this 
goal is becoming increasingly remote, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the need for States, in cooperation with international organizations and 
civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to create 
favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and 
efficacious enjoyment of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical 
and mental health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the Agreement does 
not and should not prevent members of the World Trade Organization from taking 
measures to protect public health and that the Declaration, accordingly, while reiterating the 
commitment to the Agreement, affirms that it can and should be interpreted and 
implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of members of the World Trade 
Organization to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for 
all, and further recognizes, in this connection, the right of members of the Organization to 
use, to the full, the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement, which provide flexibility 
for this purpose, 
</p>
<p> <i>Regretting</i> the high number of people still without access to affordable, safe, 
efficacious and quality medicines, and underscoring that improving such access could save 
millions of lives every year, and noting with deep concern that more than one billion people 
still do not have access to essential medicines, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, in particular the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of 
poverty, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Concerned also</i> that the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases 
constitutes a heavy burden on society, with serious social and economic consequences, 
which represent a leading threat to human health and development, and recognizing the 
urgent need for greater measures at the global, regional and national levels to prevent and 
control such diseases in order to contribute to the full realization of the right of everyone to 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Human Rights 
Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007,
