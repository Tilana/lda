<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report is submitted in accordance with Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2001/57 and relates to the official visit paid to Ecuador from 24 April to 4 May 2006 
by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people. 
</p>
<p> Ecuador is a multi-ethnic and multicultural country of approximately 12 million 
inhabitants.  There are 14 officially recognized indigenous nationalities and the indigenous 
population ranges from less than 10 per cent to more than 30 per cent of the total population, 
according to various estimates.  While the 1998 Ecuadorian Constitution embodies specific 
collective rights for indigenous peoples and nationalities in various fields, these have yet to be 
incorporated into the corresponding secondary legislation, making their full implementation 
difficult. 
</p>
<p> The Government has established a number of State institutions to address the situation of 
indigenous peoples, creating opportunities for indigenous people to participate in the 
implementation of government policies.  Over the years, the State of Ecuador has recognized 
indigenous territories, particularly in the Amazon region, and has allowed communities to 
negotiate agreements governing the use of land and resources.  Indigenous organizations have 
played an important role in negotiating forms of social and political participation with the 
Government that have transformed them into a national political force. 
</p>
<p> Despite recent economic growth, the various indigenous economic, social and human 
development indicators remain below the national average.  In addition to accumulated problems 
of low income and unemployment in indigenous communities, the issue of emigration has arisen.  
To compound rural poverty, the situation of indigenous people living in urban areas, especially 
women, has become increasingly difficult.  Indigenous communities are also concerned about 
the possible harmful effects of the outcome of negotiations on a free trade agreement. 
</p>
<p> Indigenous access to basic social services such as education and health is limited.  
Bilingual intercultural education and health programmes for indigenous people have not borne 
the expected fruit, principally owing to the shortfall in budgetary and technical resources.  
</p>
<p> The lack of compatible legislation in the area of indigenous justice leads to instances of 
conflict between indigenous jurisdiction and ordinary justice.  The non-existence of an adequate 
ombudsman system, the lack of translators and the low level of intercultural sensitivity among 
justice practitioners worsen problems concerning indigenous people&#8217;s access to the justice 
system.</p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.2

</p>
<p> The gradual destruction of the indigenous habitat and the impact of extractive activities 
on the environment and the rights of indigenous peoples, mainly in the areas around the Amazon, 
the northern border and the Pacific coast, have raised great concern.  The situation of 
uncontacted or voluntarily isolated populations merits special attention, as they are adversely 
affected by the illegal felling of trees and other illicit activities in their territories.  Oil 
exploration activities on indigenous lands have likewise triggered resistance in some 
communities, as in the case of the Sarayaku people in the Amazon region, who have sought 
protection through the inter-American human rights system.  On the northern border with 
Colombia, concern has been voiced about the effects on the health of indigenous peoples of the 
aerial spraying of illicit crops and other acts originating from the internal conflict in Colombia. </p>

<p><b>Introduction and context 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001/57 of 24 April 2001, which 
established his mandate, and at the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people visited Ecuador 
from 25 April to 4 May 2006. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was, among other things, to better gain an understanding of the 
situation of the human rights of the indigenous peoples of Ecuador through discussions with 
various social players on issues such as the effects of the 1998 Ecuadorian Constitution, which 
recognizes the collective rights of indigenous peoples; their access to justice; their rights to land 
and natural resources; the impact of the oil industry on their communities; and concerns over 
negotiations on the free trade agreement with the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his gratitude to the Government of Ecuador 
and, in particular, to the Council for the Development of Ecuadorian Nationalities and Peoples 
(CODENPE) and its head, Dr. Lourdes Tib&#225;n, for their invitation and cooperation, in addition to 
the many indigenous organizations for their hospitality and information.  The Special Rapporteur 
also expresses his special gratitude to Dr. Diego Iturralde, of the Inter-American Institution for 
Human Rights, for his support throughout the mission.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited the provinces of Pichincha, Imbabura, Esmeraldas, 
Chimborazo and Pastaza, in addition to the capital, Quito.  In the capital, he met representatives 
of the Ecuadorian Government, including the President and members of the Cabinet, in addition 
to representatives from indigenous institutions such as CODENPE, the Department of Bilingual 
Intercultural Education (DINEIB) and the Department of Health for Indigenous Peoples 
(DNSPI). 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur also met the President of Congress; the President of the Supreme 
Court; the Constitutional Court; the Supreme Electoral Tribunal; the Office of the Ombudsman, 
and the National Department for the Indigenous Peoples (DINAPIN). 
</p>
<p>6. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur interviewed local authorities and representatives 
of indigenous nationalities and peoples, local indigenous community leaders and members of 
civil and grass-roots organizations.  In Imbabura, he met leaders of the Kayambi, Kitu-kara, 
Otavalo, Natabuela and Caranqui peoples.  In San Lorenzo (Esmeraldas), he met Aw&#225;, Chachi 
and &#201;pera leaders.  In Riobamba (Chimborazo) he met representatives from the Quechua, 
Waranka, Puruha, Ka&#241;ari, Chibuleo, Saraguro, Panzaleo and Salasaka peoples and nationalities.  
In Pastaza, in the Amazon region, he visited the Sarayaku community; in Puyo he interviewed 
representatives from the Shuar, Achuar, Huaorani, Z&#225;para, Shiwiar and Andoa communities 
from the provinces of Zamora Chinchip, Morona Santiago, Napo and Orellana.  In the capital, he 
spoke with representatives from the Cof&#225;n, Quechua, Shuar, Siona and Secoya communities 
from the border with Colombia. </p>

</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur also met representatives from the United Nations, international 
cooperation agencies, the business sector, non-governmental and civil society organizations and 
academic centres. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>8. Ecuador is a multi-ethnic and multicultural country of approximately 12 million 
inhabitants.  Its territory is often divided into four large regions:  the Pacific Coastal region, 
the Sierra (highland or Andean region), Amazonia (the most extensive region, yet containing 
barely 5 per cent of the population) and the Gal&#225;pagos archipelago. 
</p>
<p>9. In ethnic terms, there are mestizo, Afro-Ecuadorian, white and indigenous populations, 
the latter comprising 14 nationalities, of which the Quechua are the majority.  No specific figures 
are available for the total indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian population.  Depending on the 
definition used, the census records the indigenous population at 6 per cent, whereas other 
sources put it at between 35 and 45 per cent of the total.  In 9 of the country&#8217;s 22 provinces, 
indigenous people make up the majority or a significant minority of the population, while 
approximately 12 per cent live in the highly urbanized cantons of Quito and Guayaquil. 
</p>
<p>10. The 1998 Ecuadorian Constitution defines the State as a multicultural and multi-ethnic 
body (art. 1).  It lays down a significant range of specific collective rights for indigenous peoples 
and nationalities (arts. 83 and 84), and establishes various political and administrative bodies 
pertaining to such rights.  Indigenous rights cover such areas as cultural diversity, identity, 
territories, indigenous jurisdiction, official use of languages, health, education, economic issues, 
cultural heritage, indigenous women, and indigenous border peoples. 
</p>
<p>11. Various laws and executive decrees govern the realization and protection of some of 
these rights, such as the Criminal Code (1971), the Decentralization and Social Participation 
Act (1997), the Agrarian Development Act (1997), the National Human Rights Plan (1999), and 
the Regulations on Consultation and Participation in Oil Activities (2002). 
</p>
<p>12. Progress has been made on lands and territories.  The emergence on the social and 
political scene of the indigenous movement meant that, from 2002, the State began to return 
ancestral territories amounting to approximately 4 million hectares to the peoples of the coastal 
and Amazon regions, and began to recognize indigenous communal lands in the highland regions 
as inalienable, imprescriptible and not subject to seizure.  The National Institute for Agrarian 
Development (INDA) is involved in allocating these lands, which are not put on the free land 
market, and form the material basis of support for indigenous peoples.  Titling of collectively 
owned indigenous lands has permitted negotiations on the management of their natural 
resources. 
</p>
<p>13. Indigenous land ownership is not suitably covered by legislation.  This therefore 
frustrates efforts by communities and peoples to exercise their autonomy and to participate fully 
in the management of natural resources in their territories.  Various specialists believe that 
territorial reorganization is needed if this pending issue is to be resolved, while respecting the 
collective human rights of the indigenous peoples. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution includes some requests made during the long period of political 
organization of the Ecuadorian indigenous peoples, which first had repercussions at the national 
level during the 1990s.  These requests were made, among others, by the Confederation of 
Indigenous Nationalities (CONAIE), the Federation of Peoples of the Quechua Nationality of 
Ecuador (ECUARUNARI), the National Confederation of Rural, Indigenous and Black 
Organizations (FENOCIN), the Ecuadorian Federation of Evangelical Indigenous People 
(FEINE), and the Ecuadorian Indigenous Federation (FEI).  All these organizations, although not 
always acting in unison, share the main demands of Ecuador&#8217;s indigenous peoples and 
communities. 
</p>
<p>15. In 1998, an Indigenous Peoples Commission was constituted in the National Congress.  
Since its creation this had been led by an indigenous woman deputy, which facilitated both 
the 1998 ratification of the 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 
concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, and the debate and 
subsequent approval of the Indigenous Nationalities and Peoples Act.  In November 2002 after 
its adoption in full this was vetoed by the then president, Gustavo Noboa Bejarano. 
</p><p>16. The constitutional rights of indigenous peoples have not yet been incorporated into 
adequate secondary legislation, which has made the management of public policies, 
administration of justice and allocation of resources to these peoples difficult.  They are urging 
action in this respect and have even suggested the need to convoke a new Constituent Assembly 
on this issue.  An oft-cited example of the failure to develop proper legal arrangements is the 
lack of any regularization of indigenous land. 
</p>
<p>17. Recent advances include the establishment of CODENPE, a representative and 
participative authority, whose executive secretary holds the rank of a minister.  The 
establishment of DNSPI, DINEIB, the Ecuadorian Nationalities and Peoples Information and 
Research System (SIDENPE), the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Development Fund (FODEPI) and 
DINAPIN, as part of the Office of the Ombudsman, were also significant.  As these institutions 
were established by presidential or ministerial decree, they are not subject to government 
legislation, which weakens their ability to shape policies and generate resources for indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>III. HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF THE INDIGENOUS  
PEOPLES OF ECUADOR:  PRIORITY AREAS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Impact of oil exploration on indigenous communities 
</b></p>
<p>18. In the 1970s, oil exploration became one of the main economic activities and sources of 
foreign exchange earnings in Ecuador.  It is seen as an activity of national interest, through 
which the State can regularly meet its current and social expenditures.  The oil areas, particularly 
in the Amazon region, were divided into &#8220;blocks&#8221; and subsequently granted in concession to 
various transnational companies.  These activities have had considerable impact on the 
environment and living conditions of local peoples, particularly indigenous peoples, and 
provoked tension and conflict between some indigenous communities, oil companies and the 
State. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>19. A case in point is the indigenous Quechua community of the Sarayaku, in the Amazonian 
province of Pastaza.  In 1992, the ancestral lands of the Sarayaku in Pastaza were legally 
recognized by Ecuador.  Four years later, the State signed a participation contract with the 
Argentine oil company Compa&#241;&#237;a General de Combustibles (CGC) for oil exploration and 
development of over 200,000 hectares in block 23, 65 per cent of which comprises the ancestral 
land of the Sarayaku and other indigenous communities.  The Sarayaku community complain 
that the contract was signed without consultation or their prior informed consent and allege 
non-compliance with ILO Convention No. 169, ratified by Ecuador after the oil concession.  The 
Sarayaku also complain of non-compliance with an agreement between CGC, Pastaza police and 
indigenous organizations to respect Sarayaku ancestral territories.  They have protested and 
demanded that the company withdraw, although some members of other indigenous 
communities in Sarayaku territory wish to maintain a working relationship with the company 
that provides them with income and certain services.  This has further divided the community. 
</p>
<p>20. Sarayaku members complain that oil activities have polluted their rivers and affected the 
health of the region&#8217;s indigenous peoples.  In 2003, community leaders complained of threats, 
the militarization of the area and the permanent harassment of their members by the CGC private 
security services.  The case was brought to the attention of the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights, which asked the Government to take protective measures in favour of the 
community.  As no satisfactory response was received from the State and the threats continued, 
the Commission then referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which 
ordered provisional measures to protect the community.  These measures were upheld by the 
Court in its decision of June 2005, triggering a limited response from the Ecuadorian authorities. 
</p>
<p>21. Further complaints have been lodged concerning the placing of explosive charges in 
Sarayaku territory for seismic exploration by CGC and the destruction of holy places and 
plant life.  The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that some of these complaints had 
been upheld, but that removing the explosive charges would be too expensive.  In March 2006, 
in a new hearing before the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, government 
representatives proposed an amicable settlement with the Sarayaku, consisting of the voluntary 
withdrawal of CGC from block 23, recognition of and public apologies for human rights 
violations committed against the Sarayaku, the establishment of an economic fund for the 
central-south Amazon region, and reforms to the prior consent rules relating to oil operations.  
The proposal has been rejected pending a ruling by the Commission or Court.  The Ecuadorian 
Office of the Ombudsman, along with the Sarayaku community, has asked the State to comply 
with the measures laid down by the Commission and the Court, but the Special Rapporteur has 
been informed that this compliance is still pending. 
</p>
<p>22. Relations between the State, the oil companies (both national and transnational) and the 
indigenous communities are complex, requiring the full attention of the authorities and human 
rights defenders.  A director of the State oil company assured the Special Rapporteur that, in 
some regions, the companies are careful to comply with the law, adjust their activities to 
environmental and human rights requirements, and maintain satisfactory relationships with the 
indigenous communities in which they are based.  Nevertheless, he recognized that there are 
other regions in which this does not occur and where there is, in his own words, &#8220;chaotic chaos&#8221;.</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>23. Although the State company, PetroEcuador, offers open participation to the indigenous 
population in oil exploration projects, indigenous organizations complain that this has not always 
occurred in practice.  The Government also states that it played an important role in establishing 
tripartite dialogue between the companies, the State and the indigenous communities.  In 2002, 
after almost 15 months of negotiations, a consensus was achieved by which the oil companies 
would carry out environmental impact studies before each contract.  According to the 
Government, this has worked well.  For the last seven years, oil companies have contributed to a 
fund for indigenous development; however, indigenous organizations complain of cronyism and 
paternalistic practices. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur received statements from many indigenous communities 
stressing the negative effects on them of failure by such oil companies as Texaco, Occidental, 
Chevron, Repsol, Shell and Perenco to comply with human rights and environmental protection 
rules.  The Cof&#225;n complained about the degradation and pollution of their territories, the child 
health and nutrition problems caused by oil operations and the fact that the company is putting 
the communities affected under pressure.  In Orellana, 12 Quechua communities pointed to 
pressure and violations of their collective human rights by an oil company in block 7.  This is 
one of many cases demonstrating the incompatibility of the constitutional human rights of 
indigenous peoples and the oil concessions awarded by the State with the consent of some 
communities.  With no State social policy, the local indigenous population must make do with 
the minimal social services provided by the oil companies, and they complain that their 
collective right to prior, free and informed consultation, as guaranteed in the Constitution, is not 
respected.  In order to comply with the constitutional principle of consultation, the Consultation 
and Participation Act was adopted in 2002.  Indigenous organizations have requested that it be 
repealed, owing to its limitations and problems, in addition to the numerous conflicts provoked 
by its application in various regions. 
</p>
<p>25. Among the complaints made to the Special Rapporteur, contracts between oil companies 
and the armed forces for the provision of security services are particularly significant, as 
members of the security services have been accused of committing abuse and acts of violence 
against local indigenous populations.  The Minister of Defence assured the Special Rapporteur 
that these contracts had been suspended during his term in office.  Complaints continue, 
however, of violations of the human rights of indigenous peoples, including acts of persecution, 
torture, degrading treatment and the illegal detention of opposition organization leaders.  It is 
claimed that those responsible for these violations have gone unpunished. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Situation of indigenous peoples on the northern border 
</b></p>
<p>26. The border between Ecuador and Colombia includes a number of provinces on the coast, 
in the highlands and in Amazonia, inhabited by six indigenous peoples.  The Aw&#225; and Quechua 
live in the highlands, while the Cof&#225;n, Siona, Secoya and Quechua live in Amazonia.  The main 
problems for these communities arise from the implementation of Plan Colombia, drug 
trafficking, the expansion of palm and oil companies and the almost total lack of State 
institutions to protect and guarantee the rights of these indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>27. The Aw&#225; have been particularly affected.  In all, 3,500 Aw&#225;s live in Ecuador 
and 36,000 hectares of the approximately 120,000 hectares of their ancestral territories have been 
recognized.  They live in extreme poverty in the border provinces of Carchi, Esmeraldas and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>Imbabura.  In addition to lacking such basic services as electricity, telephone, drinking water and 
sewerage, they face pressure from logging companies on their forests; gold-mining companies, 
which have had concessions since the 1980s; and oil palm companies.  These activities are 
placing pressure on Aw&#225; resources, forcing many members of the community to emigrate to the 
cities. 
</p>
<p>28. Currently, the region&#8217;s most serious problem is the aerial spraying of illicit crops on the 
Colombian side of the border, using glysophate mixed with other products, under the auspices of 
Plan Colombia (see the report of the Special Rapporteur on Colombia, E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.2).  
Damage caused by this practice has affected Ecuador, particularly its indigenous communities, 
and has given rise to complaints by the Ecuadorian Government and to bilateral negotiations 
between the two countries.  International studies indicate that this practice has negative effects 
on environmental resources and the health of people and animals.  Skin and other diseases, 
pollution of rivers and aquifers, and other damage have been reported.  Furthermore, spraying 
has been seen as having serious effects on banana plantations and varieties of tuber crops, the 
local staple.  In addition, the population often uses untreated water from the river forming the 
border between the two countries. 
</p>
<p>29. In some communities in Sucumb&#237;os, short-cycle crops are disappearing fewer 
than 15 days after spraying.  It is stated that, four years after the spraying began, some banana 
varieties, yucca, maize, fruit trees and aromatic herbs have disappeared, or their yield has 
considerably diminished.  It is alleged that spraying has also had a negative effect on the health 
and food security of border populations by polluting their water sources and the aquatic life.  
Complaints have been made concerning large traces in many rivers, including the Mira river in 
the province of Esmeraldas, of the chemical product used for spraying in Colombia.  The 
situation of these river communities is a matter of concern, as they use the river for domestic 
purposes. 
</p>
<p>30. Some indigenous communities in the area, including the Aw&#225;, are vulnerable and this is 
particularly worrying.  In addition to the impact of spraying, they complain that their rights are 
being violated and that they are being subject to other abuses.  They protest that their rights to 
food and health have been affected by spraying.  Apparently, after spraying, the entire 
Sumac Pamba community was displaced and did not return to their place of origin.  As a 
consequence, it appears that the local wildlife, which provided a source of daily consumption, 
both for households and for recreational purposes, has died and various activities have been 
affected, as polluted water cannot be used.  Spraying appears to be destroying subsistence crops, 
diminishing soil quality and reducing yields, affecting both the economic activities of 
communities and the population&#8217;s access to adequate food.  In addition to the involuntary 
displacements caused by these activities, attention is also drawn to the lack of access to public 
services and the militarization of the border zone. 
</p>
<p>31. Another study carried out in Sucumb&#237;os province on children and education in schools 
concluded that, since the implementation of Plan Colombia, there has been an upsurge in armed 
conflict and violence in the area and the number of children in schools has halved.  Children go 
to school irregularly and teachers are working in precarious conditions as the area is one of high 
risk.  Conditions were unsanitary in 45 per cent of schools visited.  Children became ill for 
months on end owing to effects from spraying, and only half of the teachers had the necessary 
teaching materials. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>32. The Ecuadorian Government is concerned by the effects of these practices on the 
indigenous border population and has begun bilateral negotiations with the Colombian 
Government.  As a result, Colombia announced that it would suspend spraying, but this has 
not definitively ended the controversy.  Ecuador has requested a complete halt to spraying in a 
10-kilometre strip along the border.  Although technical studies on the environmental impact of 
spraying glysophate have provided various results, the Special Rapporteur has received 
testimony from members of affected communities which clearly indicates that, in the long term, 
the effects of such practices are considerable. 
</p>
<p>33. An international study undertaken in March 2006 concludes:  &#8220;a thoroughgoing 
investigation must urgently be launched into the situation affecting the Aw&#225; indigenous people, 
which is linked to the consequences of spraying, and to their abandonment by the State&#8221;.  The 
Aw&#225; request &#8220;a study to ascertain the effects of these spraying exercises, sufficient support for 
indigenous health, the creation of a health department for the Aw&#225; people, the denunciation of 
the land invasion, eviction and paramilitary threats made under the auspices of Plan Colombia 
and which affect Colombian and now Ecuadorian indigenous Aw&#225;s, and the conduct of 
continuous immunization campaigns&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. In 2004, a United Nations inter-agency mission was sent to study the problems affecting 
indigenous and non-indigenous populations on both sides of the border, leading to the 
preparation of a report for the Government of Ecuador.  In 2005, on the basis of this report, the 
United Nations established an inter-agency programme for peace and development on the 
northern border, in order to provide a coordinated framework for action in both countries.  
In 2006, at the request of the Ecuadorian Government, a United Nations technical mission 
examined the issue of glysophate spraying.  This report was sent to the Government of 
Colombia.  According to the latest information, Colombia has ceased spraying within a 
10-kilometre strip along the Ecuadorian border. 
</p>
<p>35. Drug trafficking has eroded the growing of environmentally friendly crops by introducing 
coca farming as an illicit survival strategy, i.e., traditional crops are giving way to the small-scale 
cultivation of coca.  The number of refugees from conflict zones in Colombia has increased.  
According to testimony received, the presence of soldiers, guerrillas and drug traffickers in the 
area bordering Colombia has had a negative impact on the living conditions of indigenous border 
peoples.  Acts of violence and harassment, particularly against women, are reported.  The sexual 
exploitation of women, young girls and teenagers, and trafficking in persons has increased 
alarmingly.  The number of indigenous Ecuadorian farmers, including minors, carrying out illicit 
planting on the Colombian side of the border has risen. 
</p>
<p>36. According to reports, the expansion of oil palm companies has progressively 
dispossessed communities of their ancestral territories.  One study shows that these companies 
currently own 60,000 hectares, of which 30,000 are under crops, and there are plans to acquire in 
total 150,000 hectares, using loans from Brazil.  The conflict in the zone specifically affects 
women and girls from communities living in areas directly and indirectly influenced by the 
northern border conflict. </p>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Uncontacted peoples and threats to their existence 
</b></p>
<p>37. Since the 1960s, the Huaorani (or Huao Tiriro), living in the north-east of the 
Ecuadorian Amazon, have been subject to growing pressure from oil and logging companies on 
the one hand and, on the other, the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), an evangelical 
organization from the United States of America.  In its work SIL promoted the development of 
economic activities which took advantage of the region&#8217;s natural resources.  Over this period, the 
State has also encouraged colonization of the area by introducing oil activities and extending the 
agricultural border.  These activities led to an increase in the non-indigenous population, which 
reached 80 per cent of the area&#8217;s population at the end of the twentieth century.  The swift 
transformation of this area took place against a backdrop of violent clashes with the native 
peoples of Amazonia, which steadily weakened the Huaorani family groups and led to the 
extermination of the Tetetes in the Aguarico-Napoas region. 
</p>
<p>38. In a few decades, these processes aggressively transformed the living conditions and 
culture of the Huaorani, who have only managed to rally in defence of their collective, territorial 
and economic rights in recent years.  As a consequence of this pressure, some clans separated 
from the central Huaorani group and retreated deeper into the jungle, rejecting all contact with 
the outside world.  Despite this, as a result of oil incursions in recent decades, some violent 
encounters have taken place, leading to deaths on both sides, but mainly among the Huaorani.  In 
addition to oil incursions, the illegal felling of timber species of high commercial value has put 
further pressure on the territories of these peoples living in voluntary isolation, in addition to 
increasing inter-ethnic tension. 
</p>
<p>39. In the 1990s, the State recognized 700,000 hectares of Huaorani land.  This was smaller 
than their traditional territory and included areas taken from the Yasun&#237; National Park.  The land 
allocated to the Huaorani also includes the Tagaeri-Taromenani people, who are uncontacted, 
semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, today also known as peoples in voluntary isolation.  In 1999, the 
Tagaeri-Taromenani area was decreed &#8220;untouchable land&#8221;, a conservation area where all types of 
extractive activity are prohibited in perpetuity.  The exact limits of this vast jungle region are yet 
to be determined and it is not clear how many people make up the indigenous population that this 
action aims to protect. 
</p>
<p>40. In this area, the State does not have a sufficient presence or a carefully designed 
management plan to be able to prevent the progressive incursion of Ecuadorian and Colombian 
settlers and illegal loggers, or resist the growth of what is termed international &#8220;eco-tourism&#8221;.  In 
recent decades, this situation has led to a series of violent clashes between the invaders (the 
majority of whom are also of Huaorani lineage) and the isolated groups.  In 2003, a massacre left 
at least 20 dead and in April 2006, during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, another violent 
encounter was reported, although the truth and scale of this has yet to be confirmed.  The land 
allocated to the Tagaeri-Taromenani borders similar land in neighbouring Colombia and Peru.  
Only concerted international action in the long term will be able to save these peoples from 
extinction.  At the time of finalizing this report, it has not been possible to obtain information to 
corroborate joint regional action in this field.</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>41. In 1995, the Organization of American States (OAS) suggested that the Government of 
Ecuador establish special measures to protect the Tagaeri-Taromenani.  According to 
information received by the Special Rapporteur, by 2006, the State had not fully complied with 
these recommendations or with the provisions contained in the 1999 executive decree that 
established the &#8220;untouchable&#8221; area, in which all types of extractive activities were prohibited.  
The Government is continuing to award oil concessions in &#8220;untouchable&#8221; land and permit the 
removal of timber species prohibited under the Convention on the International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). 
</p>
<p><b>D.  P&#225;ramos (heathlands) in the Andean region 
</b>42. Indigenous communities in the Ecuadorian highlands have a long history of harmonious 
and productive integration with the environment.  Their traditional forms of social and economic 
organization have enabled them to maintain a rural survival economy and satisfy their basic 
needs for many generations.  This balance has been lost in recent decades because of growing 
environmental degradation and demographic pressure on natural resources. 
</p>
<p>43. Environmental degradation in the Andean heathlands has affected the living conditions of 
the Quechua highland communities, in addition to their water, soil and forests.  The heathlands, a 
highly fragile ecosystem, are essential for water conservation, but are threatened, along with the 
communities who form part of this habitat.  &#8220;Ecological corridors&#8221; have been created for 
conservation, with participation from non-governmental and private international organizations.  
Regional indigenous organizations are calling for the right to be full participants in conservation 
and of forestation projects, demanding that the Government enact the corresponding legislation.  
Depletion of water sources in the heathlands is a severe problem for communities.  
Environmental degradation is impoverishing communities and encouraging emigration in search 
of alternative opportunities. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Population movements and social and economic conditions 
</b></p>
<p>44. The growing population density and the decline in agricultural, forest and water resources 
in the highlands, in addition to poverty and unemployment, have spurred emigration by rural 
people to the cities, lowland areas, particularly in eastern Ecuador, and abroad.  Many 
indigenous people emigrate to North America and Europe.  Migration is one of the country&#8217;s 
most serious issues, with major implications for human rights, as was noted in 2001 by the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants.  The situation of indigenous women is 
particularly distressing. 
</p>
<p>45. Various studies show that, recently, an increasing number of women are involved in 
international migration and more specifically, indigenous migration, as a response to, among 
other things, the incorporation of women into paid and productive activities.  This trend has also 
been observed in Ecuador.  Because of the discrimination from which they suffer, indigenous 
women migrants are particularly vulnerable, becoming easy prey for trafficking and slavery 
networks, in addition to numerous abuses in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>46. In 2003, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded that, 
despite legal and constitutional guarantees, indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples continued 
to suffer from discrimination, and also drew attention to double discrimination against women.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>In 2004, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed its concern that the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to improve health and safety in the workplace were insufficient, 
particularly in the mining sector and on banana plantations.  The Special Rapporteur was able to 
note in situ that these continue to be problems requiring immediate governmental action. 
</p>
<p>47. Poor working conditions on farms growing flowers for export represent another common 
problem.  Indigenous people make up the majority of workers and suffer health problems due to 
the lack of hygiene in the workplace.  Thousands of children and young people are exploited 
without State supervision and are thus particularly vulnerable.  In Cotopaxi, for example, there 
are farms where conditions are reminiscent of the worst periods of slavery, as workers are often 
paid a mere two or three dollars per day, for 20 hours&#8217; work. 
</p>
<p>48. The &#201;pera, Ecuador&#8217;s smallest ethnic group, live in Esmeraldas province and their 
current settlement dates back to the 1950s.  They have complained of a lack of land, as their 
400 members possess only 330 hectares.  Their principal water source, the Cayapa river, is 
polluted and drying up.  As a consequence, inhabitants of the community are suffering from 
various illnesses.  They also report a major shortfall in basic social services.  Although they 
received land, there have been no development projects to improve their situation and many 
community members are emigrating in search of other opportunities.  Furthermore, other &#201;pera 
are arriving from neighbouring Colombia, fleeing the armed conflict and placing further strain 
on the already precarious local family economy. 
</p>
<p>49. The Tsa&#8217;chila in Santo Domingo de los Colorados complain of the systematic loss of 
land, pollution of rivers and soil, a housing shortage, lack of bilingual intercultural education, a 
deficient health service and low health indicators, insufficient State support for development 
programmes and scanty municipal budgets.  They ask that the &#8220;development with identity&#8221; 
concept be promoted, to provide opportunities to communities and slow the migratory flow of 
their members. 
</p>
<p>50. The canton of Guamote, established in 1944, now has 35,600 inhabitants, of 
which 90 per cent are indigenous.  It has one of the highest illiteracy rates due to the lack of 
resources at the provincial and national levels.  In terms of health, the child mortality rate is high 
and there are serious health problems.  The people lack adequate technical assistance for 
production, and all of this has led to growing emigration. 
</p>
<p>51. Confronted with such problems, the State has promoted, among other measures, a 
development project for the indigenous and black peoples of Ecuador (PRODEPINE).  Its first 
phase lasted for four years (1998-2002), with an investment of $50 million from the 
United States of America.  The World Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD), indigenous and black organizations, and the national Government were all 
involved in this process.  This project was rejected by a CONAIE assembly because of its 
harmful interference in the organizational framework of indigenous nationalities and was 
discontinued. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Social welfare indicators 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Ministry of Housing states that Ecuador has a major deficit of some 1.1 million 
houses.  The supply of drinking water and the collection and disposal of solid waste are also in a 
state of crisis.  The Government has proposed to solve these problems by 70 per cent over the 
next 15 years, but it lacks the necessary resources.  A 2004 survey on indigenous health shows 
that the percentage of indigenous people with access to piped water is three times less than the 
rest of the population, as is the case with access to domestic sanitary facilities connected to 
mains sewerage.  In all, 23 per cent of indigenous homes lack sufficient food and 36 per cent 
find it difficult to meet food costs (this figure is higher than among mestizos).  Indigenous child 
mortality (aged under five) is 50 per cent greater than the national average (51 per thousand live 
births compared to 35 per thousand).  Chronic malnutrition among indigenous children is more 
than double that of mestizo children (46.7 per cent compared to 21.2 per cent). 
</p>
<p>53. DNSPI states that indigenous health has not received the attention it deserves under the 
Government&#8217;s general policies.  The problem is acknowledged, as is the need to take steps to 
resolve it, but the necessary resources are not allocated.  The Pan American Health 
Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are together promoting 
93 indigenous health initiatives designed to ensure that the Government&#8217;s health model is 
properly intercultural.  Only 0.25 per cent of the total State budget is allocated to this area. 
</p>
<p>54. The Andean Regional Office of the United Nations Development Fund for 
Women (UNIFEM) has developed a programme focusing on indigenous women, in particular on 
combating poverty, exclusion and violence; promoting gender equality in democratic processes 
and citizenship-building; and fighting against HIV/AIDS, through, among other measures, a 
project in Sucumb&#237;os and another with indigenous migrant women from the highlands. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Indigenous political participation and social movements 
</b></p>
<p>55. An intercultural election observation mission undertaken in various provinces during 
the 2004 local elections concluded that there was ill-treatment and ethnic discrimination within 
polling stations and that these problems remain a major factor in the political exclusion of 
indigenous peoples.  The study concludes that the Supreme Electoral Court is promoting 
discriminatory practices against the country&#8217;s indigenous citizens, given the lack of any specific 
policy to promote the rights of indigenous peoples within the electoral process. 
</p>
<p>56. Since 1996, the Pachakutik movement, the political wing of the indigenous organization 
CONAIE, has made gains at the local level.  In the May 2000 elections, it made its greatest 
electoral gain since it was founded and later briefly participated in the national Government.  In 
the 2006 electoral process, it again took part, putting forward its own candidate for the post of 
President of Ecuador. 
</p>
<p>57. Since November 2003, the Ecuadorian Government has negotiated a free trade treaty 
with the United States of America.  For the Government, most members of the business sector 
and part of the population, this treaty would solve the country&#8217;s numerous economic problems.  
Within indigenous organizations, however, there is concern over the impact that the treaty may 
have on the life of indigenous communities.  The Government&#8217;s negotiator informed the Special 
Rapporteur that he had endeavoured to raise some of the issues that trouble indigenous peoples </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>during the negotiations.  For example, he had conveyed their concerns about biodiversity and 
patents and there is reference in the draft treaty to the awareness of communities, who must be 
consulted and who must give consent, the first time such a provision has been included in this 
area.  In addition, he said that he was aware of the impact that the treaty could have on the 
countryside, particularly the land and water resources of indigenous small producers, which is 
why they will remain outside the scope of the treaty.  It is believed that some products for 
domestic consumption, produced primarily by coastal indigenous peoples, such as rice, soya or 
meat, would only be considered after 10 years, during which time the State should implement 
support policies for these small-scale producers. 
</p>
<p>58. In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur, indigenous organizations expressed their 
distrust of the treaty and their disagreement with the Government.  They fear that the effects on 
the indigenous economy, particularly small producers, will be disastrous, as has been the case in 
other countries.  They demand that the indigenous peoples are consulted in negotiations on the 
free trade treaty and that their needs are taken into account. 
</p>
<p>59. Indigenous protests against the free trade treaty during the first months of 2006 drew the 
attention of Ecuadorian society.  In March 2006, indigenous organizations again held large 
protests, taking to the streets and marching through cities, which included a march to Quito and a 
strike by indigenous local authorities.  They were demonstrating against both the Government&#8217;s 
policies on free trade and on other matters and against the powerful oil companies. 
</p>
<p>60. In response, the Government declared a state of emergency in various provinces and civil 
society organizations reported acts of repression and police brutality in various parts of the 
country (Imbabura, Pinchincha, Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Tunguraha, Ca&#241;ar, Pastaza and Zamora).  
Reports were also filed of numerous acts of ethnic discrimination against indigenous people 
(particularly women) that were recorded by the media.  There were also violent clashes between 
demonstrators and the forces of law and order, which led to injuries and arrests.  Some media 
outlets incited racial hatred against the indigenous population, accusing them of being 
responsible for social protest and conflict in Ecuadorian society.  After some weeks, the state of 
emergency was lifted, but social tensions concerning the free trade treaty, oil companies and 
government policies were still in evidence during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Administration of justice and indigenous justice 
</b>61. Under the Constitution, ombudsmen shall be appointed to protect the interests of 
indigenous communities and communities shall be entitled to use their mother tongue in any 
action against them.  The Constitution also states that indigenous authorities shall exercise 
judicial function by applying their own rules and procedures to solve internal conflicts in 
accordance with their customs or customary law.  There are no legal provisions stipulating the 
scope of the powers vested in the indigenous authorities under article 191 of the Constitution or 
the manner in which these are to be exercised, nor has any law been passed to harmonize these 
functions with the national system.  In 2002, a draft bill to harmonize and allocate 
responsibilities for the administration of justice was submitted to the National Congress, but, 
following an unfavourable report by the Civil and Criminal Specialized Standing Commission, 
the draft was shelved. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>62. The absence of legislation has not prevented indigenous communities from various 
regions invoking in practice their constitutionally established right to exercise their authority and 
what they consider their legal uses and customs and to do so more and more frequently, to 
resolve situations of a conflict of interest and to protect themselves from external aggression.  In 
this context, there have been numerous conflicts of jurisdiction between indigenous and legal 
authorities, apparent abuses by both authorities, instances of their taking the law into their own 
hands and even the formation of self-defence groups which claim that their actions are protected 
by indigenous customary law. 
</p>
<p>63. The President of the Supreme Court told the Special Rapporteur of the need to harmonize 
these two justice systems and cited various examples in which courts tried cases that had already 
been tried and resolved in the indigenous justice system.  Refusal to recognize these decisions 
based on customary law is a crucial aspect of the more general issue of the failure to develop 
legislation to implement innovative provisions of the Constitution.  He also spoke of the need to 
establish a court specifically for indigenous issues, in addition to a network of justices of the 
peace and judges in indigenous law.  Congress urgently needs to consider issuing regulations 
giving effect to the constitutional principle recognizing indigenous justice so that it may be 
harmonized with the ordinary system of justice. 
</p><p>64. DINAPIN has operated as part of the Office of the Ombudsman since 2000.  Its mission 
is to monitor and uphold the rights of indigenous nationalities, peoples and organizations in 
Ecuador through the dissemination, promotion and defence of those rights.  To carry out this 
task, DINAPIN has created a network of indigenous human and collective rights activists at the 
national level who, protected by the Ombudsman Act, defend and promote human and collective 
rights throughout Ecuador.  The Office of the Ombudsman is also developing other initiatives 
within its mandate, such as providing court-appointed lawyers, proposing solutions to 
intracommunity conflicts or securing the release of indigenous prisoners. 
</p>
<p>65. The difficulty of legislating in the area of indigenous justice and determining its scope 
represents a significant gap in private contracts negotiated by community representatives in 
foreign languages, such as Spanish or English, relating to specialized legal issues in the financial 
or intellectual property domain that affect indigenous people and territories. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  Bilingual intercultural education 
</b></p>
<p>66. DINEIB, established in 1987, is legally responsible for education programmes for 
indigenous peoples and nationalities.  It has the status of a national institution, although it lacks 
the necessary resources to perform all the tasks assigned to it.  Bilingual intercultural education 
is provided in 2,802 schools in 16 provinces, to some 123,400 pupils of 14 nationalities. 
</p>
<p>67. Nevertheless, not all indigenous children have access to schooling.  A 2003 study in 
Cotopaxi showed that 526 rural children did not go to school, as their homes were too far away.  
In State schools, the Government runs a school meals programme for indigenous children, but a 
study shows that more than 1.3 million children still do not receive breakfast and lunch regularly, 
the meals provided under the programme as an inducement to ensure their attendance at school.</p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>68. As a general rule, the so-called &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; schools (which are neither intercultural nor 
bilingual) have better resources, meaning that many parents prefer their children to attend 
these schools, leaving intercultural bilingual schools for poor indigenous people.  In terms of 
good-quality, culturally appropriate indigenous education, the Ecuadorian bilingual intercultural 
education programme is generally considered one of the most successful in Latin America, 
despite its aforementioned limitations. 
</p>
<p>69. During 2005, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) undertook various activities and projects on literacy and bilingual intercultural 
education, organizing two educational workshops to support native languages, in coordination 
with DINEIB and promoting the Literacy and Education Programme for Life in the canton of 
Cayambe.  Within the framework of an agreement between the Provincial Council of 
Chimborazo and the United Nations, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) undertook 
to facilitate children&#8217;s access to basic education, by implementing a programme to provide 
schoolbooks to 5,182 children aged 5. 
</p>
<p><b>J.  International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>70. Ecuador is carrying out a number of programmes explicitly targeting indigenous and 
Afro-Ecuadorian peoples through multilateral and bilateral cooperation.  These projects relate to 
bilingual intercultural education and, in conjunction with the German Agency for Technical 
Cooperation (GTZ), the training of indigenous university teachers.  The European Union is 
cooperating in the implementation of a credit scheme specifically targeting women in 
Chimborazo province, and another development project in Cotopaxi province, with the local 
provincial council and the Cotopaxi Indigenous and Campesino Movement (MICC).  The 
Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI), together with the organization 
CODENPE, is currently running a development project with 31 municipalities led by indigenous 
people (referred to as &#8220;alternative municipalities&#8221;). 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>71. In recent decades, the indigenous peoples of Ecuador have made important steps forward 
in securing recognition of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Constitutionally, 
Ecuador is a multicultural and multi-ethnic country, which recognizes a range of collective rights 
of the country&#8217;s 14 indigenous nationalities. 
</p>
<p>72. One of Ecuador&#8217;s principal challenges is to give full effect to the constitutional principles 
concerning indigenous rights through secondary legislation and regulations on various 
constitutional rights.  There are worrying delays in this field, given that the political instability of 
recent years has prevented the Government from adopting the necessary laws arising from the 
Constitution in this matter. 
</p>
<p>73. The same situation obtains among the various governmental authorities created by 
presidential or ministerial decree to tackle issues of particular concern to indigenous peoples, 
such as CODENPE, DINEIB, DNSI and DINAPIN.  These institutions, which enjoy the active 
participation of indigenous representatives, lack the necessary legislative support and budgetary 
resources to allow them adequately to meet the needs of these peoples. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>74. The situation of indigenous peoples is particularly sensitive where the administration of 
justice and the efforts to harmonize the ordinary system of justice with the indigenous justice 
system recognized in the Constitution are concerned. 
</p>
<p>75. Available data indicate that, as a rule, more indigenous people live in poverty and 
extreme poverty, and meet fewer indicators of social and human development than other sectors 
of the population.  In the inter-Andean corridors and the Andean heathlands, where demographic 
pressure on the land&#8217;s limited resources is greater, indigenous agricultural production and living 
conditions are precarious, causing growing emigration to the cities and abroad, a phenomenon 
that particularly affects indigenous communities.  Indigenous women and children are 
particularly vulnerable in this process. 
</p>
<p>76. Ecuador has made important steps forward in bilingual intercultural education and in the 
application of an intercultural approach to indigenous health, but these programmes are still 
weak, as they have insufficient institutional underpinning and lack resources.  International 
cooperation agencies and the United Nations are running some indigenous support programmes 
in these areas. 
</p>
<p>77. For some decades, the Ecuadorian economy has been highly dependent on oil exports.  
Oil operations are carried out primarily in indigenous territories, with negative effects on the 
environment and the communities&#8217; living conditions.  This situation has led to numerous 
conflicts between the State, oil companies and indigenous communities, who oppose the 
operations of these companies.  Indigenous people are calling for the full application of their 
right to consent, through a process of free, prior and informed consultation. 
</p>
<p>78. Similar conditions govern the situation among Amazonian communities, which are 
confronted by the activities - sometimes illicit - of, among others, mining and logging companies 
and oil palm plantations.  Among the indigenous nationalities on the northern border, this 
situation is further complicated by the aerial spraying of illicit crops, carried out in neighbouring 
Colombia under the auspices of Plan Colombia, which has negative effects on the Ecuadorian 
indigenous border populations.  Some indigenous populations are living in voluntary isolation in 
the forest in these regions, and their situation is particularly worrying.  Their survival and 
&#8220;untouchable&#8221; territory are threatened by such factors as pressure from illicit logging activities 
and the incursion of settlers. 
</p>
<p>79. The use of elements of the armed forces to secure the interests of oil, mining and logging 
companies operating in indigenous territories has triggered various abuses and complaints, and 
led to numerous incidents with the indigenous population, who complain of the militarization of 
their communal areas. 
</p>
<p>80. In March 2006, a large number of indigenous people suffered violations of their rights 
while protesting against the free trade treaty being negotiated by Ecuador with the United States 
of America.  This led to the declaration of a state of emergency in some provinces and the 
disproportionate use of the police against the demonstrators. </p>

</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>81.  <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the National Congress of Ecuador enact 
legislation concerning the collective rights of indigenous nationalities, peoples and 
communities, as established in the country&#8217;s Constitution, relating in particular to the 
administration of justice; indigenous territorial areas; rules governing such economic 
activities as oil operations, mining, logging, agriculture, fishing and tourism, in addition to 
others that affect natural resources in indigenous territories; bilingual intercultural 
education; conservation and preservation of the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples; 
respect and protection of peoples in voluntary isolation; the right to prior, free and 
informed consultation and consent in accordance with international law; indigenous health 
services; prevention and punishment of sexual offences; exploitation in conditions of 
servility, the forced and commercial exploitation of women and girls belonging to 
indigenous peoples and nationalities; extension of various social services to indigenous 
communities; biodiversity and environmental conservation and management; economic 
development plans and projects; an office for the human rights of indigenous peoples; and 
local, communal and regional forms of indigenous government.</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends strengthening the legal arrangements 
underpinning indigenous institutional structures in the various established bodies.  
Specifically, the Special Rapporteur recommends that DINEIB, the Department for 
Intercultural Health and CODENPE be given the appropriate legal status, and that the

</p>
<p><b>the impact of the internal conflict in Colombia, illicit drug production and trafficking 
activities, environmental degradation, the influx of indigenous refugees from Colombia and 
the situation of violence and insecurity in the area.  Concessions granted to oil and mining 
companies must be reviewed.  The State must shape public policies aimed at protecting the 
various sectors, peoples and communities who live on the northern border, with their full 
participation, including the right to free, prior and informed consultation. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Ecuador implement measures (including 
those under CITES) to ensure rigorous control of timber species in indigenous lands, in 
particular those inhabited by peoples in voluntary isolation, and coordinate actions with 
the various State authorities to ensure effective protection in the trade and export of all 
species.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Consultation, participation and recognition 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that all Ecuadorian authorities comply 
with the provisions of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the

Sarayaku community, including its rights, its land ownership and the life and physical 
integrity of all of its members.

concluding service provision contracts with oil companies that could damage the rights of 
the indigenous communities in whose territories they are operating. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Ecuador carry out a thoroughgoing 
investigation into accusations of abuse and violence against members of indigenous 
communities committed by some elements of the armed forces, under the auspices of the 
said contracts, and that those responsible are punished.  It is further recommended that 
any inappropriate arrangement between the aforementioned companies and the armed 
forces, which has its aim to protect the private economic interests of the companies and 
could damage the legitimate rights of the indigenous peoples and communities in the 
regions affected by the activities of the oil companies, be prevented. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Following the disproportionate response of the authorities to the social protest 
mounted by indigenous organizations during the state of emergency against the free trade 
treaty, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government carry out a 
thoroughgoing investigation into the events and punish, among others, those who abused 
the human rights of the indigenous demonstrators.</b> </p>

</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council call on the 
three countries involved in protecting the peoples living in voluntary isolation (Colombia, 
Ecuador and Peru) and the international community to pool forces and resources in order 
to protect and safeguard endangered indigenous peoples living in the Amazonian region.  
(The Special Rapporteur made a similar recommendation to the Colombian Government 
following his mission there in 2005.) 
</b>95. <b>In the &#8220;untouchable&#8221; area and the Yasun&#237; National Park, any oil activities shall be 
suspended and illegal logging shall be punished, in addition to any activity that disturbs the 
peace of peoples living in voluntary isolation.  Furthermore, an integrated programme for 
the restructuring of the local economy in Huaorani regions shall be drawn up, and real and 
effective controls shall be set in place to prevent the removal of timber from these 
territories. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Prompt steps should be taken to enact the necessary national legislation for the 
promotion, protection and safeguarding of the rights of peoples in voluntary isolation, in

heathlands in the region, and ensure respect for the lands and territories of indigenous 
peoples and nationalities.</b>
