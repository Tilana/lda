ARTICLE II
                                    THE LOANS
Section 2.01 Term Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Lender agrees on the Effective Date to make a Loan in dollars to
the Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Lender's
Commitment. The Commitments are not revolving and amounts repaid or prepaid may
not be re-borrowed under any circumstance. Any portion of the Commitments not
utilized by the Borrowers on or before 3:00 p.m. New York City time on the
Effective Date shall be permanently cancelled.
Section 2.02 Loans.
(a) Several Obligations. Each Loan shall be made on the Effective Date
as part of a single borrowing consisting of one or more Tranches, which shall be
allocated ratably to the Lenders' Loans in accordance with their respective
Commitments. The failure of any Lender to fund its Loan shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments are
several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to
fund its Loan as required.
18
<PAGE>
(b) Types of Tranches. Subject to Section 3.03, each Tranche shall be
an ABR Tranche or Eurodollar Tranche as the Borrowers may request in accordance
herewith. Each Lender at its option may fund any Eurodollar Tranches by causing
any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to fund such
Eurodollar Tranche; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect
the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Lender's Loan in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.
(c) Minimum Amounts; Limitations on Borrowings. At the commencement of
each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Tranche, such Tranche shall be in an
aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than
$1,000,000. At the time that each ABR Tranche is made, such Tranche shall be in
an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than
$1,000,000. Tranches of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time,
provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of four
Eurodollar Tranches outstanding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect to convert or continue
any Tranche if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Maturity Date.
(d) Notes. The Loan made by each Lender shall be evidenced by a single
promissory note of the Borrowers in substantially the form of Exhibit A, dated,
in the case of (i) any Lender party hereto, as of the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) any Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption, as of the effective date of the Assignment and Assumption, payable
to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to such Lender's funded
Loan as in effect on such date, and otherwise duly completed. The date, amount,
Type, interest rate and, if applicable, Interest Period of each Tranche
consisting of a portion of the Loan made by each Lender, and all payments made
on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its
books for its Note, and, prior to any transfer, may be endorsed by such Lender
on a schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof or on any
separate record maintained by such Lender. Failure to make any such notation or
to attach a schedule shall not affect any Lender's or the Borrowers' rights or
obligations in respect of its Loan or affect the validity of such transfer by
any Lender of its Note.
Section 2.03 Requests for the Loans Not later than 12:00 noon, New York
City time, three Business Days before the Effective Date, the Borrowers shall
request the Loans by notifying the Administrative Agent by telephone or fax (or
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the
Administrative Agent), and shall confirm such request by delivering to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders a written Borrowing Request in
substantially the form of Exhibit B and signed by the Borrowers. Such
telephonic, electronic or written request shall be irrevocable and shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the aggregate amount of the requested Loans;
(ii) whether any portion of such Loans is to be an ABR Tranche or
a Eurodollar Tranche;
19
<PAGE>
(iii) in the case of a Eurodollar Tranche, the initial Interest
Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the
definition of the term "Interest Period"; and
(iv) the location and number of the Borrowers' accounts to which
funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section
2.05.
If no election as to the Type is specified, then the entire portion of the Loans
shall be an ABR Tranche. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any
requested Eurodollar Tranche, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
Promptly following receipt of the Borrowing Request in accordance with this
Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly provide such Loan subject to and as set
forth in Section 2.05(a).
Section 2.04 Interest Elections.
(a) Conversion and Continuance. Each Tranche initially shall be of the
Type specified in the Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar
Tranche, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the Borrowing
Request. Thereafter, the Borrowers may elect to convert any Tranche to a
different Type or to continue such Tranche and, in the case of a Eurodollar
Tranche, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section
2.04. The Borrowers may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected Tranche, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders' Loans, and each such portion shall be
considered a separate Tranche.
(b) Interest Election Requests. To make an election pursuant to this
Section 2.04, the Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
election by telephone or fax (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent) (i) in
the case of a Eurodollar Tranche, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
three Business Days before the first day of the Interest Period related to such
Tranche and (ii) in the case of an ABR Tranche, not later than 12:00 noon, New
York City time, on the same Business Day of the proposed conversion or
continuation. Each such telephonic (or electronic communication) Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in substantially the form of Exhibit C and signed by the Borrowers.
(c) Information in Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic,
electronic communication and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Tranche to which such Interest Election Request applies
and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions
thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Tranche (in
which case the information to be specified pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(iii) and
(iv) shall be specified for each resulting Tranche);
20
<PAGE>
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Tranche is to be an ABR Tranche or a
Eurodollar Tranche; and
(iv) if the resulting Tranche is a Eurodollar Tranche, the
Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election,
which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest
Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Tranche but does not
specify an Interest Period, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Notice to Lenders by the Administrative Agent. Promptly following
receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise
each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each
resulting Tranche.
(e) Effect of Failure to Deliver Timely Interest Election Request and
Events of Default on Interest Election. If the Borrowers fail to deliver a
timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Tranche prior to
the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Tranche is
repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Tranche shall
be converted to an ABR Tranche. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof,
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) no outstanding
Tranche may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Tranche (and any
Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Tranche to, or
continuation of any Tranche as, a Eurodollar Tranche shall be ineffective) and
(ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Tranche shall be converted to an ABR Tranche
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
Section 2.05 Funding the Loans.
(a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make its Loan on the
Effective Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New
York, New York time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrowers by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to accounts of the Borrowers maintained with
Citibank Texas, N.A., Midland, Texas or any Lender and designated by the
Borrowers in the Borrowing Request.
(b) Presumption of Funding by the Lenders. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Effective Date that
such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's
Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made its Loan
available on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In
such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its Loan available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is made available to the Borrowers to but
21
<PAGE>
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of
such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest
rate applicable to ABR Tranches. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan.
Section 2.06 Termination. The Commitments shall terminate at 3:00 p.m., New
York, New York time on the Effective Date.
Section 2.07 Total Reserve Value. Subject to interim adjustment under
Section 8.14 and Section 9.13, the initial Total Reserve Value shall be
$249,019,860. In connection with each semi-annual redetermination, the Borrowers
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, no later than March 1st and September
1st of each year, setting forth in sufficient detail Borrower's calculation of
Total Reserve Value as of the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1,
commencing March 1, 2006. In addition, the Borrowers may, by notifying the
Administrative Agent thereof, and the Administrative Agent may, at the direction
of the Majority Lenders, by notifying the Borrowers thereof, each elect to
require the Total Reserve Value to be determined one additional time on a
specified "as of" date between such regular determinations (which shall be the
first day of a calendar month following the date of such notice), in which event
the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, no later than three months
after such specified date reflecting the Total Reserve value as of such
specified date. The Borrowers shall calculate the Total Reserve Value based upon
the applicable definitions of this Agreement, and provide with each such
certificate the Reserve Report and other information used by the Borrowers in
calculating the Total Reserve Value. In addition to the foregoing, the Total
Reserve Value shall be subject to further adjustment from time to time in
accordance with Section 6.01(n), Section 8.13(c) and Section 9.13(d).
Upon receipt of such certificate, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
review such certificate and, within ten (10) Business Days, confirm to the
Borrowers and the Lenders that (i) the calculations used to determine the Total
Reserve Value were based upon the pricing and other requirements set forth in
the definition of Total Reserve Value, (ii) no mathematical or other errors or
omissions have been made in such calculation and (iii) the engineering analysis
used to determine the Total PV was based upon estimated production, pricing and
costs acceptable to Administrative Agent. If facts under (i), (ii) or (iii) are
ascertained to exist, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall cooperate
to promptly calculate the proper amount of the Total Reserve Value. Otherwise,
upon confirmation of such amount as the Total Reserve Value, such amount will be
the Total Reserve Value until next adjusted or redetermined in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.
Section 2.08 Subordination of Loans. The Loans, the Notes, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, the rights and remedies of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent hereunder and thereunder and the Liens created thereby are
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Lenders hereby agree that the
Administrative Agent is authorized to sign the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf
of all Lenders to this Agreement.

of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower or
any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document is not paid when due,
whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, then all Loans
outstanding, shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to two percent (2%) plus the rate applicable to ABR Tranches as
provided in Section 3.02(a), but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(d) Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on the principal amount
of each Tranche shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for

any Tranche, accrued interest on the principal amount prepaid shall be payable
on the date of such prepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Tranche prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Tranche shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.
(e) Interest Rate Computations. All interest hereunder shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), except that interest
computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate
Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
terms of this Agreement, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and be binding upon the parties hereto.
Section 3.03 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Tranche:

Agreement (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for
such Interest Period; or
23
<PAGE>
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Lenders that
the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect
the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining a portion of their Loans
included in such Tranche for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give prompt written notice thereof,
including the details of its determination, to the Borrowers and the Lenders by
telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Tranche to, or continuation
of any Tranche as, a Eurodollar Tranche shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any

ARTICLE IV
                PAYMENTS; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS
Section 4.01 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) Payments by the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or
of amounts payable under Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 or otherwise)
prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately
available funds, without defense, deduction, recoupment, set-off or
counterclaim. Fees, once paid, shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices specified in Section
12.01, as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section
5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 shall be made directly to the
Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be
due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient
funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all
amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of
principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising
any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of
any principal of or interest on its Loan resulting in such Lender receiving
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loan and accrued
interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the
Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
25
<PAGE>
the assignment of or sale of a participation in its Loan to any assignee or
participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
(as to which the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall apply). The Borrowers
consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
Section 4.02 Presumption of Payment by the Borrowers. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made
such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.
Section 4.03 Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender
shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section
2.05(b) or Section 4.02 then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy
such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied
obligations are fully paid.
Section 4.04 Disposition of Proceeds. The Security Instruments contain an
assignment by the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors unto and in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders of all of each of the
Borrower's or each Guarantor's interest in and to production and all proceeds
attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the Mortgaged
Property. The Security Instruments further provide in general for the
application of such proceeds to the satisfaction of the Indebtedness and other
obligations described therein and secured thereby. Notwithstanding the
assignment contained in such Security Instruments, until the occurrence of an
Event of Default, (a) the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they
will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such production nor take any
other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders, but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to
the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and (b) the Lenders hereby authorize the
Administrative Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause such
proceeds to be paid to the Borrowers and/or their Subsidiaries.

           INCREASED COSTS; BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS; TAXES; ILLEGALITY
Section 5.01 Increased Costs.
26
<PAGE>
(a) Eurodollar Changes in Law. If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender, including any such amount for
Eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as "Eurocurrency Liabilities" in
Regulation D of the Board); or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any
other condition affecting this Agreement or any Eurodollar Tranche consisting of
any portion of the Loan of such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Tranche (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then
the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in
Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loan made by
such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding
company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers
will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) Certificates. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the
case may be, as specified in Section 5.01(a) or (b) shall be delivered to the
Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.
(d) Effect of Failure or Delay in Requesting Compensation. Failure or
delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section
5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such
compensation.
Section 5.02 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Tranche other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Tranche into an ABR Tranche other than on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto or (c) the failure to borrow,
convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Tranche on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall
compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event. In the case of a Eurodollar Tranche, such loss, cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
principal amount of its Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate
27
<PAGE>
that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of
such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would
have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest
which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate
which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period,
for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the
eurodollar market.
A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the
Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after
receipt thereof.
Section 5.03 Taxes.
(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of any Borrower or any Guarantor under any Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if any Borrower or any Guarantor shall be required to
deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum
payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 5.03), the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or such Guarantor shall make such
deductions and (iii) such Borrower or such Guarantor shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law.
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall pay
any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.
(c) Indemnification by the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender on or with respect to any payment by or
on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section 5.03) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate of the Administrative Agent or a Lender as
to the amount of such payment or liability under this Section 5.03 shall be
delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower or a Guarantor to a
Governmental Authority, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment
or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.
28
<PAGE>
(e) Foreign Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which any Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the
time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrowers as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
reduced rate.
Section 5.04 Designation of Different Lending Office. If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 5.01, or if the Borrowers are required to
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loan hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts
payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03, as the case may be, in the
future and (b) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense
and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers agrees
to pay such reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection
with any such designation or assignment.
Section 5.05 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its
applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain any
portion of its Loan as part of any Eurodollar Tranche either generally or having
a particular Interest Period hereunder, then (a) such Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent thereof and such Lender's
obligation to make such portion of its Loan as part of such Eurodollar Tranche
shall be suspended (the "Affected Portion") until such time as such Lender may
again make and maintain such portion of its Loan as part of such Eurodollar
Tranche and (b) the Affected Portion which would otherwise be made by such
Lender shall be made instead as an ABR Tranche (and, if such Lender so requests
by notice to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the Affected Portion
then outstanding shall be automatically converted into an ABR Tranche on the
date specified by such Lender in such notice) and, to the extent that Affected
Portion is so made as (or converted into) ABR Tranches, all payments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Affected Portion
shall be applied instead to its ABR Tranche.

any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by,
any Governmental Authority or any other third Person (including shareholders or
any class of directors, whether interested or disinterested, of any Borrower or

recording and filing of the Security Instruments as required by this Agreement
and, (ii) release of existing Liens and (iii) those third party approvals or

organizational documents of any Borrower or any Subsidiary or any order of any

any, generated at any and all Property of any Borrower or any of their
Subsidiaries have in the past been transported, treated and disposed of in

substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment, and, to
the knowledge of the Borrowers, all such transport carriers and treatment and
disposal facilities have been and are operating in compliance with Environmental

agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its Property, and possesses
all licenses, permits, franchises, exemptions, approvals and other
authorizations granted by Governmental Authorities necessary
35

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(b) Neither of the Borrowers nor any of their Subsidiaries is in
default nor has any event or circumstance occurred which, but for the expiration

Subsidiaries to Redeem or make any offer to Redeem all or any portion of any

Affiliate to be incurred with respect to any Plan. No ERISA Event with respect
to any Plan has occurred.
(e) Full payment when due has been made of all amounts which either of
the Borrowers, any of their Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate is required

each Borrower's most recently ended fiscal year, exceed the current value of the
assets (computed on a plan termination basis in accordance with Title IV of
ERISA) of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term "actuarial
present value of the benefit liabilities" shall have the meaning specified in
section 4041 of ERISA.

disclosed to the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
restrictions to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other
matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the reports, financial
statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of
either of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender or any of their Affiliates in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or under any
other Loan Document (as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
37

material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, each of the Borrowers represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time. There is no fact peculiar to any Borrower
or any of their Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or in the future is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect and which has not been set forth in this Agreement or the Loan
Documents or the other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of any Borrower or any of
their Subsidiaries prior to, or on, the date hereof in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrowers have not provided the
independent petroleum engineers that prepared the Reserve Reports with any
information that was incorrect or misleading in any material respect at the time
it was delivered.
Section 7.13 Insurance. Each Borrower has, and has caused all of their
Subsidiaries to have, (a) all insurance policies sufficient for the compliance
by each of them with all material Governmental Requirements and all material
agreements and (b) insurance coverage in at least amounts and against such risk
(including, without limitation, public liability) that are usually insured
against by companies similarly situated and engaged in the same or a similar
business for the assets and operations of each of the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders have been named as
additional insureds in respect of such liability insurance policies and the
Administrative Agent has been named as additional loss payee with respect to
Property loss insurance.
Section 7.14 Restriction on Liens. Neither of the Borrowers nor any of
their Subsidiaries is a party to any material agreement or arrangement, or
subject to any order, judgment, writ or decree, which either restricts or
purports to restrict its ability to grant Liens to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders on or in respect of their Properties to secure the Indebtedness and
the Loan Documents.
Section 7.15 Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.15 or as

Section 7.17 Properties; Titles, Etc.
(a) Each of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries has good and
defensible title to its Proved Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the most
recently delivered Reserve Report and good title to all its personal Properties,
in each case, free and clear of all Liens except Liens permitted by Section
9.03. After giving full effect to the Excepted Liens, any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries specified as the owner owns the net interests in production
attributable to the Hydrocarbon Interests as reflected in the most recently
delivered Reserve Report, and the ownership of such Properties shall not in any
material respect obligate the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries to bear the
costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of
each such Property in an amount in excess of the working interest of each
Property set forth in the most recently delivered Reserve Report that is not
offset by a corresponding proportionate increase in any Borrower's or any of
their Subsidiaries' net revenue interest in such Property.
(b) All material leases and agreements necessary for the present
conduct of the business of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries are valid and
subsisting, in full force and effect, and there exists no default or event or
circumstance which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both
would give rise to a default under any such lease or leases, which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(c) The rights and Properties presently owned, leased or licensed by
the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries including, without limitation, all
easements and rights of way, include all rights and Properties necessary to
permit the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries to conduct their business in all
material respects as of the date hereof.
(d) All of the material Properties of the Borrowers and each of their
Subsidiaries that are reasonably necessary for the operation of their businesses
are in good working condition and are maintained in accordance with prudent
business standards.
(e) Each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
Property material to its business, and the use thereof by such Borrower and such
Subsidiary does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any
such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries either own or have valid licenses or other rights to use all
databases, geological data, geophysical data, engineering data, seismic data,
maps, interpretations and other technical information used in their businesses
as presently conducted, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements
governing the use of the same, which limitations are customary for companies
engaged in the business of the exploration and production of Hydrocarbons, with
such exceptions as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 7.18 Maintenance of Properties. Except for such acts or failures to
act as could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the
Oil and Gas Properties (and Properties unitized therewith), to the Borrowers'
knowledge prior to taking over operations and as to all non-operated Properties,
have been maintained, operated and developed in a good and workmanlike manner
and in conformity with all Government Requirements and in conformity with the
provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts comprising a part of the
Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and agreements forming a part of the
Oil and Gas Properties. Specifically in connection with the foregoing, except as
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (a) no Oil
and Gas Property is subject to having allowable production reduced below the
full and regular allowable (including the maximum permissible tolerance) because
of any overproduction (whether or not the same was permissible at the time) and
(b) none of the wells comprising a part of the Oil and Gas Properties (or
Properties unitized therewith) is deviated from the vertical more than the
maximum permitted by Government Requirements, and such wells are, in fact,
bottomed under and are producing from, and the well bores are wholly within, the
Oil and Gas Properties (or in the case of wells located on Properties unitized
therewith, such unitized Properties). All pipelines, wells, gas processing
plants, platforms and other material improvements, fixtures and equipment owned
in whole or in part by the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries that are
necessary to conduct normal operations on Properties currently operated by the
Borrowers or, to the Borrowers' knowledge prior to taking over operations and as
to all non-operated Properties, are being maintained in a state adequate to
conduct normal operations, and with respect to such of the foregoing which are
operated by the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, in a manner consistent
with the Borrowers' or their Subsidiaries' past practices (other than those the
failure of which to maintain in accordance with this Section 7.18 could not
reasonably be expect to have a Material Adverse Effect).
Section 7.19 Gas Imbalances, Prepayments. As of the date hereof, except as
set forth on Schedule 7.19 or on the most recent certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 8.12(b), on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or pay or
other prepayments which would require the Borrowers or any of their Domestic
Subsidiaries to deliver Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties at
some future time without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor
exceeding 100,000 Mcf of gas (on an Mcf equivalent basis) in the aggregate.
Section 7.20 Marketing of Production. Except for contracts listed and in
effect on the date hereof on Schedule 7.20, and thereafter either disclosed in
writing to the Administrative Agent or included in the most recently delivered
Reserve Report (with respect to all of which contracts the Borrowers represent
that they or their Subsidiaries are receiving a price for all production sold
thereunder which is computed substantially in accordance with the terms of the
relevant contract and are not having deliveries curtailed substantially below
the subject Property's delivery capacity), no material agreements exist which
are not cancelable on 60 days notice or less without penalty or detriment for
the sale of production from the Borrowers' or their Subsidiaries' Hydrocarbons
(including, without limitation, calls on or other rights to purchase,
production, whether or not the same are currently being exercised) that (a)
pertain to the sale of production at a fixed price and (b) have a maturity or
expiry date of more than six (6) months from the date hereof.

agreements relating thereto (including any margin required or supplied) and the

Acquisition, (c) to refinance existing indebtedness, if any, (d) for the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, and for
general corporate purposes. The Borrowers and their Subsidiaries are not engaged
principally, or as one of its or their important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of
buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation T, U or X of
the Board) or for the purpose which would constitute this transaction a "purpose
credit" within the meaning of Regulation U. No part of the proceeds of any Loan
will be used for any purpose which violates the provisions of Regulations T, U
or X of the Board.
Section 7.23 Solvency. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (a) the aggregate assets (after giving effect to amounts that could
reasonably be received by reason of indemnity, offset, insurance or any similar
arrangement), at a fair valuation, of the Borrowers and the Guarantors, taken as
a whole, will exceed the aggregate Debt of the Borrowers and the Guarantors on a
consolidated basis, as the Debt becomes absolute and matures, (b) each of the
Borrowers and the Guarantors will not have incurred or intended to incur, and
will not believe that it will incur, Debt beyond its ability to pay such Debt
(after taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by each
of the Borrowers and the Guarantors and the amounts to be payable on or in
respect of its liabilities, and giving effect to amounts that could reasonably
be received by reason of indemnity, offset, insurance or any similar
arrangement) as such Debt becomes absolute and matures and (c) each of the
Borrowers and the Guarantors will not have (and will have no reason to believe
that it will have thereafter) unreasonably small capital for the conduct of its
business.
Section 7.24 Acquisition Documents. The copies of the Acquisition Documents
previously delivered by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent are true,
accurate and complete and have not been amended or modified in any material
manner, other than pursuant to amendments or modifications previously delivered
to the Administrative Agent. No party to any Acquisition Document is in default
in respect of any material term or obligation thereunder. The consideration paid
or to be paid for the assets subject of the Acquisition represents "reasonably
equivalent value" for such assets.

prepared by or under the supervision of the chief engineer of the Borrowers who
shall certify such Reserve Report to be true and accurate and to have been
prepared in accordance with the procedures used in the immediately preceding
January 1 Reserve Report.
(b) With the delivery of each Reserve Report, the Borrowers shall
provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a certificate from a
Responsible Officer certifying that in all material respects: (i) the
information contained in the Reserve Report and any other information delivered
in connection therewith is true and correct, (ii) the Borrowers or their
Subsidiaries owns good and defensible title to the Proved Oil and Gas Properties
evaluated in such Reserve Report and such Properties are free of all Liens
except for Liens permitted by Section 9.03, (iii) except as set forth on an
exhibit to the certificate, on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or
pay or other prepayments in excess of the volume specified in Section 7.19 with
respect to their Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in such Reserve Report that
would require any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries to deliver Hydrocarbons
either generally or produced from such Oil and Gas Properties at some future
time without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor, (iv) none of
their Proved Oil and Gas Properties have been sold since the date of the last
Total Reserve Value determination except as set forth on an exhibit to the
certificate, which certificate shall list all of its Proved Oil and Gas

Section 8.13 Title Information.
(a) On or before the delivery to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders of each Reserve Report required by Section 8.12(a), the Borrowers will
deliver title information in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative
Agent covering enough of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such Reserve
Report that were not included in the immediately preceding Reserve Report, so
that the Administrative Agent shall have received together with title
information previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, satisfactory title
information on at least 80% of the total value of the Proved Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report.
(b) If the Borrowers have provided title information for additional
Properties under Section 8.13(a), the Borrowers shall, within 60 days of notice
from the Administrative Agent that title defects or exceptions exist with
respect to such additional Properties, either (i) cure any such title defects or
exceptions (including defects or exceptions as to priority) which are not
permitted by Section 9.03 raised by such information, (ii) substitute acceptable
Mortgaged Properties with no title defects or exceptions except for Excepted
Liens (other than Excepted Liens described in clauses (e), (g) and (h) of such
definition) having an equivalent value or (iii) deliver title information in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent so that the
Administrative Agent shall have received, together with title information
previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, satisfactory title information
on at least 80% of the value of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such
Reserve Report.
(c) If the Borrowers are unable to cure any title defect requested by
the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to be cured within the 60-day period or
the Borrowers do not comply with the requirements to provide acceptable title
information covering 80% of the value of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in
the most recent Reserve Report, such default shall not be a Default, but instead
the Administrative Agent and/or the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
exercise the following remedy in their sole discretion from time to time, and
any failure to so exercise this remedy at any time shall not be a waiver as to
future exercise of the remedy by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders. To the
extent that the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders are not reasonably
satisfied with title to any Mortgaged Property after the 60-day period has
elapsed, such unacceptable Mortgaged Property shall not count towards "the 80%
requirement", and the Administrative Agent may send a notice to the Borrowers
and the Lenders that the Total Reserve Value shall be reduced by an amount as
determined by the Majority Lenders to cause the Borrowers to be in compliance
with the requirement to provide acceptable title information on 80% of the value
of the Proved Oil and Gas Properties. This new Total Reserve Value shall become
effective immediately after receipt of such notice.
Section 8.14 Additional Collateral; Additional Guarantors.
(a) In connection with each redetermination, the Borrowers shall
review the Reserve Report and the list of current Mortgaged Properties (as
described in Section 8.12) to ascertain whether the Mortgaged Properties
represent at least 80% of the total value of the Oil
49
<PAGE>
and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently completed Reserve Report after
giving effect to exploration and production activities, acquisitions,
dispositions and production. In the event that the Mortgaged Properties do not
represent at least 80% of such total value, then the Borrowers shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, grant, within thirty (30) days of delivery of the
certificate required under Section 8.12(b), to the Administrative Agent or its
designee as security for the Indebtedness a second-priority Lien interest
(subject to a Lien under the Senior Revolving Credit Documents and provided that
Excepted Liens of the type described in clauses (a) to (d) and (f) of the
definition thereof may exist, but subject to the provisos at the end of such
definition) on additional Oil and Gas Properties not already subject to a Lien
of the Security Instruments such that after giving effect thereto, the Mortgaged
Properties will represent at least 80% of such total value. All such Liens will
be created and perfected by and in accordance with the provisions of deeds of
trust, security agreements and financing statements or other Security
Instruments, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent or its designee and in sufficient executed (and
acknowledged where necessary or appropriate) counterparts for recording
purposes. In order to comply with the foregoing, if any Subsidiary places a Lien
on its Oil and Gas Properties and such Subsidiary is not a Guarantor, then it
shall become a Guarantor and comply with Section 8.14(b).
(b) In the event that (i) the Borrowers determine that any Subsidiary
is a Material Domestic Subsidiary or (ii) any Domestic Subsidiary incurs or
guarantees any Debt, then the Borrowers shall promptly cause such Subsidiary to
guarantee the Indebtedness pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement. In connection
with any such guaranty, the Borrowers shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to,
(A) execute and deliver a supplement to the Guaranty Agreement executed by such
Subsidiary, (B) pledge all of its Equity Interests of such Subsidiary and (C)
execute and deliver such other additional closing documents, certificates and
legal opinions as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent or
its designee.

will cause its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate to promptly furnish, to the
Administrative Agent (a) promptly after the filing thereof with the United

each annual and other report with respect to each Plan, if any, or any trust
created thereunder, (b) immediately upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any

Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or the PBGC with respect thereto, and

Affiliates to, (i) satisfy in full and in a timely manner, without incurring any
late payment or underpayment charge or penalty and without giving rise to any
lien, all of the contribution and funding requirements of section 412 of the
Code (determined without regard to subsections (d), (e), (f) and (k) thereof)
and of section 302 of ERISA (determined without regard to sections 303, 304 and
306 of ERISA), and (ii) pay, or cause to be paid, to the PBGC in a timely

of any service, with any Affiliate (other than the Guarantors and Wholly-Owned

Lenders or restricts any Subsidiary from paying dividends or making
distributions to any Borrower or any Guarantor, or which requires the consent of

Borrower will, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, allow gas

(on an Mcfe equivalent basis) in the aggregate.
Section 9.19 Swap Agreements. Neither Borrower will, and will not permit
any Subsidiary to, enter into any Swap Agreements with any Person other than

Agreements then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already
hedged pursuant to other Swap Agreements) do not exceed, as of the date such
Swap Agreement is executed, 85% of the reasonably anticipated projected

period during which such Swap Agreement is in effect for each of crude oil and
natural gas, calculated separately, for terms not extending beyond November 15,
2010, (b) Swap Agreements in respect of interest rates with an Approved
Counterparty, as follows: (i) Swap Agreements effectively converting interest

borrowed money which bears interest at a floating rate and (c) Swap Agreements
listed on Schedule 7.21 hereto. In no event shall any

the Administrative Agent a copy of such amendment, modification or supplement).
Section 9.21 Anti-Layering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither Borrower will, and neither Borrower will permit any
Subsidiary to, incur, create, assume or suffer to exist any Debt if such Debt is
subordinate or junior in ranking in right of payment to the Senior Revolving
Credit Agreement, unless such Debt is expressly subordinated in right of payment
to the obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI
                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Section 11.01 Appointment; Powers. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan
Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.
Section 11.02 Duties and Obligations of Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any
fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred
and is continuing (the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan
Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote
any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable law; rather, such term is used merely as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties), (b) the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except as provided in Section 11.03, and (c) except as
expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to
or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates
in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge
of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Borrowers or a Lender, and shall not be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith
or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or
document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in ARTICLE VI or
elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to
be delivered to the Administrative Agent or as to those conditions precedent
expressly required to be to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction, (vi) the
existence, value, perfection or priority of any collateral security or the
financial or other condition of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries or any
other obligor or guarantor, or (vii) any failure by the Borrowers or any other
Person (other
61
<PAGE>
than itself) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or the performance or observance of any covenants, agreements or other
terms or conditions set forth herein or therein.
Section 11.03 Action by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in
writing as directed by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 12.02) and in all cases the Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan
Documents unless it shall (a) receive written instructions from the Majority
Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
12.02) specifying the action to be taken and (b) be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders. If a
Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite
Lenders in the written instructions (with indemnities) described in this Section
11.03, provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have
received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any
action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is
contrary to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders or the Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 12.02), and otherwise the Administrative
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or under any other document or instrument referred
to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith
INCLUDING ITS OWN ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE, except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.
Section 11.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by
the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement
made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper
Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon and the Borrowers
and the Lenders hereby waive the right to dispute the Administrative Agent's
record of such statement, except in the case of gross negligence or willful
misconduct by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note as the holder
62
<PAGE>
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof permitted hereunder shall have been filed with
the Administrative Agent.
Section 11.05 Subagents. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all
its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more
sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and
any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights
and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions
of the preceding Sections of this ARTICLE XI shall apply to any such sub-agent
and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent,
and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent.
Section 11.06 Resignation or Removal of the Administrative Agent. Subject
to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as
provided in this Section 11.06, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time
by notifying the Lenders and the Borrowers, and the Administrative Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation or removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in Houston, Texas, or
an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the
Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such
successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this ARTICLE XI and Section 12.03 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Section 11.07 Administrative Agent as Lender. Each bank serving as an
Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not an agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an agent hereunder.
Section 11.08 No Reliance. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and each
other Loan Document to which it is a party. Each Lender also acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
63
<PAGE>
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries of this
Agreement, the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for
herein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Borrowers or their
Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Borrowers (or any of its Affiliates)
which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates. In this regard, each Lender acknowledges that Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.
is acting in this transaction as special counsel to BNP Paribas only in respect
of this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in any legal
opinion or any Loan Document. Each other party hereto will consult with its own
legal counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in connection with the Loan
Documents and the matters contemplated therein.
Section 11.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, the
Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall
then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Indebtedness
that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary
or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent under Section 12.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding;
and
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Section 12.03.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Indebtedness or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative
Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

any and all releases of Liens, termination statements, assignments or other

other disposition of Property to the extent such sale or other disposition is
permitted by the terms of Section 9.12 or is otherwise authorized by the terms
of the Loan Documents.

Section 12.02 Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect
to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps
to enforce such right, power or privilege, under any of the Loan Documents shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege under any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the
Borrowers therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by Section 12.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not
be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof nor any Security
Instrument nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers

modify Section 2.07 without the consent of each Lender, (ii) reduce the

principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or any other Indebtedness hereunder or under any other Loan Document,

the Maturity Date without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,

pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of

determination or grant any consent hereunder or any other Loan Documents,
without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any supplement to Schedule 7.15 (Subsidiaries) shall be effective
simply by delivering to the Administrative Agent a supplemental schedule clearly
marked as such and, upon receipt, the Administrative Agent will promptly deliver
a copy thereof to the Lenders.

THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT
THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES ARE

<PAGE>

assert, and the Borrowers hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any

instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use
of the proceeds thereof.
(e) All amounts due under this Section 12.03 shall be payable promptly

Section 12.04 Successors and Assigns.
The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrowers without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in
accordance with this Section 12.04. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants
(to the extent provided in Section 12.04(d)) and, (to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 12.04(b)(ii),
any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:
(A) the Borrowers, provided that no consent of the Borrowers
shall be required for an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and
(B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of
the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that
is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of
the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date
the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to
the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such
consent of the Borrowers shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing;
69
<PAGE>
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement;
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and
(iii) Subject to Section 12.04(b)(iv) and the acceptance and
recording thereof, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section
5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03). Any assignment or transfer
by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
with this Section 12.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with Section 12.04(d).
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments and principal
amounts of the Loans, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and
any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. In connection with any changes to the Register, if necessary, the
Administrative Agent will reflect the revisions on Annex I and forward a copy of
such revised Annex I to the Borrowers and each Lender.
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section
12.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section
12.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this Section 12.04(b).
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant")
70
<PAGE>
in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the proviso to Section 12.02 that affects such Participant. In
addition such agreement must provide that the Participant be bound by the
provisions of Section 12.03. Subject to Section 12.04(c)(ii), the Borrowers
agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01,
Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.04(b). To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 12.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 4.01(c) as though it were a Lender.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
     payment under Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 than the applicable Lender would
     have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
     such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant
     is made with the Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant that would
     be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
     benefits of Section 5.03 unless the Borrowers are notified of the
     participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
     benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 5.03(e) as though it were
     a Lender.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 12.04(d) shall not apply to any such
pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no
transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender or any
grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment
or grant would require the Borrowers and the Guarantors to file a registration
statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the "Blue Sky" laws of any
state.
Section 12.05 Survival; Revival; Reinstatement.
(a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by
the Borrowers herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement
71
<PAGE>
and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such
other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent
or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Maturity Date in respect
of the Loans has not occurred. The provisions of Section 5.01, Section 5.02,
Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive and remain in full
force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
provision hereof or thereof.
(b) To the extent that any payments on the Indebtedness or proceeds of
any collateral are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in
possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or
equitable cause, then to such extent, the Indebtedness so satisfied shall be
revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and
the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' Liens, security interests, rights,
powers and remedies under this Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue
in full force and effect. In such event, each Loan Document shall be
automatically reinstated and the Borrowers shall take such action as may be
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to effect such
reinstatement.
Section 12.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an
original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract.
(b) This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter
agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute
the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral
or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES
HERETO AND THERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO
UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
(c) Except as provided in Section 6.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 12.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and the invalidity
of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 12.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (of whatsoever
kind, including, without limitations obligations under Swap Agreements) at any
time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of
any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries against any of and all the obligations
of such Borrower owed to such Lender now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not such Lender
shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 12.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender or its Affiliates may have.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
UNITED STATES FEDERAL LAW PERMITS ANY LENDER TO CONTRACT FOR, CHARGE, RECEIVE,

LENDER IS LOCATED. CHAPTER 346 OF THE TEXAS FINANCE CODE (WHICH REGULATES
CERTAIN LOAN ACCOUNTS AND REVOLVING TRI-PARTY ACCOUNTS) SHALL NOT APPLY TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES.
(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS
SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS OR OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS (HOUSTON DIVISION), AND, BY EXECUTION

MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN
SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THIS SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION IS NON-EXCLUSIVE
AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE A PARTY FROM OBTAINING JURISDICTION OVER ANOTHER PARTY IN
ANY COURT OTHERWISE HAVING JURISDICTION.
73

(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY
OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF
COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT THE
ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.01 OR SUCH OTHER ADDRESS AS IS SPECIFIED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12.01 (OR ITS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION), SUCH SERVICE TO

PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST
ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

Section 12.10 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
Section 12.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (e) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or

containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 12.11, to
(i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any Swap
74
<PAGE>
Agreement relating to the Borrowers and their obligations, (g) with the consent
of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 12.11 or (ii)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than the Borrowers. For the purposes of this Section
12.11, "Information" means all information received from the Borrowers or any
Subsidiary relating to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary and their businesses,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers or a
Subsidiary; provided that, in the case of information received from the
Borrowers or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly
identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 12.11
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person
has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Section 12.12 Interest Rate Limitation. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it.
Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as to any
Lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of
America and the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be
mandatorily applicable to such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in any of the Loan Documents or any agreement entered into in connection with or
as security for the Notes, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of all
consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender that
is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender under any
of the Loan Documents or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Notes
shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such
applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically and if
theretofore paid shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the
Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Indebtedness
shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the
Borrowers); and (ii) in the event that the maturity of the Notes is accelerated
by reason of an election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of
Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or
permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under
law applicable to any Lender may never include more than the maximum amount
allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in
this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically by such Lender as of
the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be
credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the
extent that the principal amount of the Indebtedness shall have been or would
thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrowers). All sums
paid or agreed to be paid to any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of
sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such
Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the stated term
of the Loans evidenced by the Notes until payment in full so that the rate or
amount of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum
amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (i)
the amount of interest payable to any Lender on any date shall be computed at
the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.12
and (ii) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of
interest otherwise payable to such Lender would be less than the amount of
interest payable to such Lender
75
<PAGE>
computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender, then the amount
of interest payable to such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest
computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable to such Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such
Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been payable to
such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving
effect to this Section 12.12. To the extent that Chapter 303 of the Texas
Finance Code is relevant for the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable to a Lender, such Lender elects to determine the applicable rate
ceiling under such Chapter by the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect.
Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code does not apply to the Borrowers'
obligations hereunder.
Section 12.13 EXCULPATION PROVISIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO

AGREEMENT AND IS FULLY INFORMED AND HAS FULL NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS,

THE ADVICE OF ITS ATTORNEY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS; AND THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT CERTAIN OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS RESULT IN ONE PARTY ASSUMING THE LIABILITY INHERENT
IN SOME ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION AND RELIEVING THE OTHER PARTY OF ITS
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES AND COVENANTS THAT
IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY EXCULPATORY PROVISION
OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD
NO NOTICE OR KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH PROVISION OR THAT THE PROVISION IS NOT
"CONSPICUOUS."
Section 12.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in
Section 1.16 of the Intercreditor Agreement, this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, and the agreement of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder are solely
for the benefit of the Borrowers, and no other Person (including, without
limitation, any Subsidiary of the Borrowers, any obligor, contractor,
subcontractor, supplier or materialsman) shall have any rights, claims, remedies
or privileges hereunder or under any other Loan Document against the
Administrative Agent or any Lender for any reason whatsoever. Except as
expressly provided in Section 1.16 of the Intercreditor Agreement, there are no
third party beneficiaries.

                                   LITIGATION
Darrell Jackson v. Parallel Petroleum Corporation, Cause No. 05-0414969,
In the 106th Judicial District Court of Gaines County, Texas
This is a dispute over irrigation wells allegedly damaged by Defendant
Parallel Petroleum Corporation's ("Parallel") oil well drilling activities.
Specifically, Plaintiff Darrell Jackson ("Jackson") filed suit against Parallel
in the 106th District Court of Gaines County, Texas alleging that Parallel -- in
drilling and completing the McConnell-Clarke # 8 and # 6 oil wells -- damaged
Jackson's #20-1 water well. Furthermore, Jackson alleges that Parallel -- in
drilling and completing the PKC "A" #8 oil well -- damaged Jackson's #20-2 water
well. Based on Jackson's First Amended Original Petition, the rationale behind
Plaintiff's case is that Parallel's activities have reduced the production
capacities of said water wells. As this case is still in the initial phases of
discovery, Plaintiff has yet to produce any firm evidence supporting his claims.
Plaintiff brings suit on the following causes of action: negligence, gross
negligence, negligence per se, and breach of contract. Plaintiff seeks an award
of economic damages, exemplary damages, costs of court, attorneys' fees, and
such other relief that he may be entitled to at law. To date, no discovery
requests have been served on Defendant. Parallel's first combined set of
discovery is expected to be served on Jackson within the next few weeks.
