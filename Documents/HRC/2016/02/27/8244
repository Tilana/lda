<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the human rights situation

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In its resolution 18/19, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide a progress report on the situation of 
human rights to the Council at its nineteenth session. The Office of the High Commissioner 
(OHCHR) therefore deployed a delegation to visit Yemen from 20 to 27 December 2011 to 
gather first-hand information concerning human rights developments in the country and to 
report on the implementation of the recommendations made to the Government and other 
parties by OHCHR following its previous assessment mission (A/HRC/18/21).  
</p>
<p> During the reporting period, force was used in the context of armed confrontations 
between Government forces and armed opposition groups, between non-State armed 
groups, and by Government forces against unarmed civilians exercising their right to 
peaceful assembly. Despite a relative lull from early December 2011 following the 
adoption of the agreement in accordance with the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council, political, tribal and sectarian tensions continue and the prospect of degeneration 
into civil strife remains high. Large parts of the country, including entire governorates and 
substantial parts of Sanaa and Ta&#8217;izz, appear to be under the partial or total control of non-
State armed groups. The ongoing unrest is contributing to an increasingly dire humanitarian 
situation as a result of restricted access to health services, food, water, fuel, electricity and 
schooling. Economic activities have ground to a halt in many sectors, and many Yemenis 
have lost their livelihood. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> During extensive meetings and consultations held with representatives of the 
Government and civil society in Sanaa and Ta&#8217;izz, the delegation noted that some positive 
steps had been taken by the Government. The adoption of an agreement in accordance with 
the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which led to the formation of a transitional 
Government and paves the way for presidential elections to be held on 21 February 2012, 
brought relative calm and raised the prospect of a peaceful resolution. The Government 
adopted a decision on 15 November that establishes a framework for the implementation of 
resolution 18/19 and the recommendations made in the report of the OHCHR assessment 
mission, including the establishment of a national commission of investigation. Moreover, 
the Government recently released the majority of those detained in connection with the 
protests. 
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, the delegation also noted that Yemenis peacefully calling for greater 
freedoms, an end to corruption and respect for the rule of law continued to be victimized by 
the excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force in situations where non-lethal 
measures should have been used. Furthermore, insufficient steps have been taken to 
investigate allegations of serious human rights violations. The national commission of 
investigation has not yet been established. 
</p>
<p> The delegation observed that, in Sanaa, armed opposition groups continued to bring 
weapons into areas of public protest, thereby endangering the lives of the civilians living in 
or frequenting these areas. Testimonies further indicated that civilians residing in or passing 
through areas controlled by armed opposition groups in Sanaa and Ta&#8217;izz were subjected to 
routine harassment, intimidation and at times assault at the hands of armed personnel under 
the command of armed opposition groups.  
</p>
<p> The delegation noted the continued use of children under the age of 18 by both 
security forces and armed opposition groups. Children were seen by the delegation doing 
security checks and participating in other military activities. It also received information 
suggesting that civilians were still being detained by Government security forces without 
due process and that armed opposition groups continued to illegally detain civilians 
sympathizing with the Government or security personnel.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.<b> </b>In its<b> </b>resolution 18/19, the Human Rights Council called upon the Government of 
Yemen and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to develop a 
framework for continued dialogue and strengthened cooperation in the field of human 
rights, and the international community to support this cooperation, and requested the 
Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) to present a progress report on the human 
rights situation in Yemen to the Council at its nineteenth session. The Council also invited 
OHCHR to coordinate with donors on ways to assist the Government of Yemen and non-
governmental organizations with capacity-building for the establishment of a national 
human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>2. On 24 November 2011, the High Commissioner requested authorization from the 
Government of Yemen to send a delegation from OHCHR on a mission to that country, to 
prepare the progress report for the Human Rights Council. The Government responded 
favourably on 15 December 2011 and the delegation conducted the mission from 20 to 27 
December. The mandate of the mission, as agreed by the Government, was:  
</p>
<p> (a) To conduct an assessment of the human rights situation; 
</p>
<p> (b) To obtain information from a wide range of actors, including the Government 
of Yemen, non-governmental and civil society organizations, victims and witnesses, and 
the United Nations country team. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Modalities of work 
</b></p>
<p>3. The mission was conducted in close coordination with the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator in Yemen, whose support throughout the mission was highly appreciated. The 
Government of Yemen facilitated the mission, thus allowing the delegation to meet with 
officials, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Human Rights, the 
Minister for the Interior, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Legal Affairs and the 
Military Committee for Achieving Security and Stability. Delegation members also met 
with the Governor of Ta&#8217;izz, members of Parliament, representatives of non-governmental 
organizations, journalists, lawyers, doctors, human rights defenders, victims and their 
relatives, diplomats and the United Nations country team. The delegation commends the 
Government for its assistance and coordination and was appreciative of the support 
received from all interlocutors throughout the mission. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report follows up on the report of the assessment mission of OHCHR 
(A/HRC/18/21),, which provided information pertaining to the human rights situation from 
the start of the unrest in early 2011 to July of that year. The present report provides an 
updated assessment of the overall human rights situation in Yemen, particularly with regard 
to the recommendations made by OHCHR in its mission report and by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 18/19.  
</p>
<p>5. The mission delegation visited Sanaa and Ta&#8217;izz. The sites visited included the 
location of demonstrations, places where violence had occurred, and hospitals. Owing to 
time and security restrictions, the delegation was unable to visit other parts of the country; 
it did, however, receive scores of reports and documents, and met with a large number of 
people who provided first-hand information about numerous other locations.  
</p>
<p>6. The documentation received has been archived for appropriate future use. </p>


<p><b> III. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political context and recent developments on the ground 
</b></p>
<p>7. During the period under review, Yemen continued to witness varied levels of 
violence throughout the country, ranging from sporadic outbursts of violence to situations 
of protracted armed confrontation. Force was used in the context of armed confrontations 
between Government forces and armed opposition groups, between non-State armed 
groups, and by Government forces against unarmed civilians exercising their right to 
peaceful assembly. After a relative lull in early December following the adoption of an 
agreement paving the way for a transitional government and presidential elections, political, 
tribal and sectarian tensions continue and the prospect of degeneration into civil strife 
remain high. Large parts of the country, including entire governorates and substantial parts 
of Sanaa and Ta&#8217;izz, appear to be under partial or total control of non-State armed groups. 
The ongoing unrest is contributing to an increasingly dire humanitarian situation by 
restricting public access to health services, food, water, fuel, electricity and schooling. 
Economic activities have ground to a halt in most sectors, and many Yemenis have lost 
their livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>8. On 21 October, the Security Council adopted resolution 2014 (2011), its first on 
Yemen, in which it strongly condemned the continued human rights violations by the 
Yemeni authorities and the human rights abuses perpetrated by other actors, and stressed 
that all those responsible for violence, human rights violations and abuses should be held 
accountable. The Council also demanded that the Yemeni authorities ensure that their 
actions comply with obligations under applicable international humanitarian and human 
rights law, and that all opposition groups refrain from violence and cease the use of force to 
achieve political gains.  
</p>
<p>9. The Government of Yemen and leading members of the opposition signed an 
agreement on 23 November in Riyadh. The agreement, on the implementation mechanism 
for the transition process in Yemen in accordance with the initiative of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council, paved the way for a transition process leading to early elections on 21 
February 2012. The Vice-President was selected as the consensus candidate to be leader ad 
interim during the process.  
</p>
<p>10. A number of steps were taken to carry out the first phase of the agreement. Firstly, 
Prime Minister Basendwa oversaw the formation of a new Government of national unity &#8211; 
a coalition of the General People&#8217;s Congress, the Joint Meeting of Parties opposition 
</p>
<p>coalition and independent figures that were sworn into the new 34-member Cabinet on 10 
December by Vice-President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The new Cabinet includes only 
three female ministers, despite pledges in the agreement to improve women&#8217;s 
representation. Secondly, the Vice-President established the Military Committee for 
Achieving Security and Stability, consisting of senior security officials from both 
Government forces and forces supporting the opposition. While the Committee has to date 
focused its work on Sanaa, it undertook a brief visit to Ta&#8217;izz. 
</p>
<p>11. The signing of the above-mentioned agreement for the transition was accompanied 
by widespread protests and criticism by activists and human rights groups. In particular, 
there was strong opposition to the provision, in the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, of a 
broad amnesty for the President and his associates. Activists and rights groups called for 
accountability for crimes committed, in particular since the beginning of the unrest. Violent 
clashes ensued, initially in Sanaa, then in Ta&#8217;izz. During the visit, the delegation noted a 
general situation of calm in Sanaa, as Government security forces gradually withdrew from </p>


<p>throughout the city. The violence resumed, however, with the killing of unarmed protesters 
in Dar Salm, at the entrance to Sanaa, on 24 December.  
</p>
<p>12. During the reporting period, Sanaa witnessed sporadic outbreaks of violence and 
frequent use of lethal force by Government security forces. On 18 and 19 September, 
security forces opened fire on protesters. In the following days, coinciding with the return 
of President Saleh from Saudi Arabia on 23 September, violent clashes between Republican 
Guard and Central Security Forces against soldiers loyal to defected General Ali Mohsen 
resulted in the killing of dozens of civilians caught in the crossfire. During the clashes, 
numerous civilians were arbitrarily arrested; according to information provided to the 
mission, at least four people were subjected to torture while in detention. The awarding, on 
7 October, of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Yemeni human rights defender, Tawakkul 
Karman, together with two other women from Liberia, was celebrated by large 
demonstrations across Yemen, which were met with violence by security forces, especially 
in Ta&#8217;izz. 
</p>
<p>13. On 24 December, Government security forces and individuals wearing civilian 
clothes attacked protesters using batons, water cannon and live ammunition, allegedly 
killing at least nine people and injuring dozens. The protesters had set off from Ta&#8217;izz and 
were participating in the &#8220;march of life&#8221; protest. 
</p>
<p>14. Violent clashes in Ta&#8217;izz had begun on 29 and 30 May when Government forces 
used live ammunition against peaceful protesters in Freedom Square. In response, anti-
Government groups mobilized in and around Freedom Square and took control of a large 
part of the city. This resulted in a marked increase of violence, with Government forces 
attacking areas occupied by anti-Government groups loyal to Sheikh Hamood al-Mikhlafi 
and Sadiq Serhan (affiliated to General Ali Mohsen&#8217;s First Armoured Division) from afar, 
using such heavy weaponry as tanks, mortar shells and machine guns. The anti-Government 
groups retaliated, using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to attack Government 
forces positions, including civilian buildings temporarily used by Government forces. 
</p>
<p>15. The region of Arhab, a sparsely populated yet highly exposed area some 20 
kilometres north of the capital and largely under the control of armed opposition groups, 
witnessed intermittent violent clashes between the Republican Guard and armed tribesmen. 
In August, fierce fighting between Government forces and their opponents resulted in the 
killing of several soldiers and at least 20 rebel fighters, according to reports. Throughout 
the reporting period, military planes reportedly carried out several attacks, bombing targets 
and killing an unknown number of people. According to testimonies and reports received 
during the mission, the attacks on Arhab were carried out by Government forces in 
coordination with tribal allies, with the use of the air force, tanks, long-range missiles, 
heavy artillery and snipers. Eyewitnesses alleged the widespread destruction of public and 
private infrastructure and described the continued attacks as constituting a siege, severely 
restricting the population&#8217;s right to freedom of movement and at times denying them 
humanitarian access. Figures concerning the exact number of people killed or injured could 
not be verified.  
</p>
<p>16. Similar patterns of violence were witnessed in other localities across the country. 
Most parts of the governorate of Abyan and a number of towns in the governorate of 
Shabwa remain under tight control of armed men from Ansar al-Sharia, a group allegedly 
linked to Al-Qaida. The delegation heard allegations that Ansar al-Sharia imposed a strict 
interpretation of Islamic law, which had resulted in at least one public execution of a 15-
year-old following a summary trial that did not comply with international human rights 
standards. A religious teaching centre in Dammaj, a village in the northern governorate of 
Saada, became a flashpoint of violence between followers of Abdelmalek al-Houthi and 
Salafi militia. The former claimed that Salafi students in that area had not respected an 
agreement to lay down their weapons. A number of attempts by activists or tribal and </p>


<p>political figures to mediate between the groups had failed. Confrontations were also 
witnessed in Jawf and Hajja governorates, and led to a general increase in the use of 
sectarian rhetoric across the area amounting to incitement to war. The entire governorate of 
Saada and neighbouring governorates of Hajja and Jawf were reportedly under the control 
of Houthi militia, with negative consequences for the enrolment of girls in schools, freedom 
of expression and access for humanitarian agencies.  
</p>
<p>17. At the end of December, employees and students of a number of public institutions, 
ministries and public corporations, as well as certain military units throughout the country 
(including the national airline carrier, banks and education facilities) started to forcibly 
evict their heads from their positions on the basis of allegations of corruption. Dozens of 
managers and officials were subjected to public humiliation or physical violence, and most 
of them no longer have access to their places of employment. The new Government called 
for an end to this practice, but was unable to stop it or to provide protection to those 
affected, whose due process rights were ignored. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>18. Yemen is party to eight of the nine core international human rights treaties.1 In 
reviewing the State&#8217;s implementation of its treaty obligations, the human rights treaty 
bodies have noted that violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights 
persist on a considerable scale. The treaty bodies have also expressed deep concern at the 
limited progress made in implementing their observations and recommendations, as well as 
a lack of cooperation with the treaty bodies themselves.2 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>19. A wide range of human rights violations was documented across the country during 
the period under review. The main allegations related to the continuous use of lethal and 
disproportionate force against mostly peaceful protesters by Government forces and 
affiliated groups, and the prevailing impunity for most perpetrators of such violations. 
Moreover, clashes involving different configurations of Government and anti-Government 
forces and armed tribesmen continued with a general disregard for civilian life. The 
members of the mission were unable to obtain precise figures concerning the number of 
people killed or injured. The figures received from various sources varied considerably and 
did not always make a distinction between the killings and/or injury of unarmed protesters 
and other civilians from fighters from all armed groups and forces. 
</p>
<p>20. Information was received during the mission from Government sources and some 
civil society organizations according to which a significant number of Government security 
personnel were killed during confrontations with armed opposition groups in Ta&#8217;izz. Many 
members of the armed forces, paramilitary and police units have lost their lives or been 
severely injured in recent months. Information was also received concerning the killing of 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Yemen is not party to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance. 
 2 The treaty bodies often refer to &#8220;widespread&#8221; and &#8220;continuing&#8221; violations. The Committee for 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that the State&#8217;s report was &#8220;not complete in its coverage 
of all the rights laid down in the Covenant&#8221; and that &#8220;the State's replies to the list of issues did not 
</p>
<p>provide a systematic response&#8221; (E/C.12/YEM/CO/2). The Committee against Torture noted with 
concern that &#8220;the conclusions and recommendations it addressed to Yemen in 2003 have not been 
</p>
<p>sufficiently taken into consideration&#8221; (CAT/C/YEM/CO/2). </p>


<p>at least five security officers in Ta&#8217;izz. Bombings and shootings in Aden by alleged 
members of Ansar al-Sharia have targeted security officials. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation noted the continuous mobilization of armed opposition groups in 
areas where public protests were taking place. They also noted with concern the widespread 
enlistment of children within the armed ranks of Government and anti-Government forces. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights violations allegedly committed by Government security 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces 
</b></p>
<p>22. The mission documented widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings and 
excessive use of force by security forces and affiliated groups against civilians and civilian 
targets. Uniformed security forces and plain-clothed armed men reportedly opened fire on 
demonstrators at street level and from rooftops on a number of occasions throughout the 
reporting period. The criminal proceedings initiated following the events of 18 March in 
Sanaa, when security forces opened fire on protesters, killing approximately 50 civilians, 
have been slow, with only four hearings of the trial of 78 defendants. The same applies for 
the investigation of the incident of 29 May, when Freedom Square in Ta&#8217;izz was attacked 
and burned. Prosecutors in Ta&#8217;izz expressed their readiness to investigate and prosecute 
those responsible, but complained of a lack of cooperation by most victims and their 
families. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation requested the Government to provide information on (a) any 
disciplinary measures taken against officers accused of excessive use force or of 
committing other forms of serious human rights violations against civilian targets; (b) 
progress made in the establishment of a national commission to investigate human rights 
violations; (c) any information on the establishment of a national commission to provide 
compensation and reparations; (d) progress in investigating the incidents in Dar Salm, 
where at least nine protesters were shot dead by security officers or individuals associated 
with them on 24 December; and (e) any progress made in other investigations tied to the 
current unrest. At the time of drafting the present report, the delegation had not received 
any written information from the Government on the above issues.  
</p>
<p>24.  During the violence of 18 and 19 September in Sanaa, members of the Central 
Security Forces3 reportedly opened fire on protesters in the neighbourhood of Al-Qa&#8217;, 
killing as many as 30 civilians. On 23 October, security forces and plain-clothed armed 
men reportedly opened fire on protesters in the neighbourhood of Zubairy, killing five 
protesters. On 24 November, members of the Central Security Forces, in conjunction with 
plain-clothed armed men, reportedly attacked protesters near Sanaa&#8217;s Change Square using 
live ammunition, killing as many as five civilians and injuring dozens. On 25 November, 
security forces attacked protesters marching from Change Square through Zubeiry street. 
Security forces reportedly attacked the protesters with water cannon and teargas, while 
plain-clothed armed gunmen opened fire, killing one protester and injuring several others. 
</p>
<p>25. The excessive use of force was documented in relation to the events of 24 
December, when security forces attacked thousands of protesters who had set off from 
Ta&#8217;izz in what became known as the &#8220;march of life.&#8221; The delegation interviewed numerous 
eyewitnesses, who provided consistent accounts that security forces unjustifiably resorted 
to the use of live ammunition in Dar Salm, at the entrance of Sanaa, killing at least nine 
civilians and injuring many more. The delegation was visiting the field hospital, set up by 
opposition groups in Change Square, just as some of those who had been killed or wounded 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See A/HRC/18/21, paras. 22-27. </p>


<p>at Dar Salm were brought in for emergency treatment. One of the protesters killed had been 
shot in the neck, while another had been shot in the face. Both cases and witness accounts 
clearly suggest that security forces resorted to the use of lethal weapons in circumstances 
where their lives were not in danger. 
</p>
<p>26. Following the above-mentioned events, the Government claimed that it allowed 
protests to take place and only resorted to the use of force if their forces were being 
attacked or if protesters attacked a high-security location. It remains unclear whether this 
was the case for the above-mentioned attacks. 
</p>
<p>27. The delegation received information indicating that some protesters challenged 
security officers by trying to force their way into an area of Sanaa that was off limits, 
according to a plan prepared under the direct instruction of the Minister for the Interior, 
forcing security officers to intervene to redirect them towards the previously agreed upon 
route leading to Change Square. According to witnesses, many security forces conducted 
themselves in accordance with the law and resorted to non-lethal methods to counter the 
protesters, for example through the use of batons and water cannon. Witness statements and 
documentation indicate that the security forces had no justification for resorting to the use 
of lethal means. Evidence of this is the fact that no serious injuries or casualties were 
reported by the security forces. Moreover, the &#8220;march of life&#8221; started out from Ta&#8217;izz days 
earlier and the Government had sufficient time to ensure that security officers were 
properly instructed on circumstances that might justify the use of lethal force.  
</p>
<p>28. In Ta&#8217;izz, four peaceful protesters were allegedly shot dead by Government security 
forces in Freedom Square on 18 and 19 September, and three women died on 11 November 
from tanks shelling Freedom Square from near the Thawra hospital. On the same day, tanks 
opened fire on Al-Rawdha, and nine shells reportedly hit Al-Rawdha hospital, resulting in 
the death of a female patient and the injury of others. Patients had to be evacuated to the 
basement. According to several reports and witnesses, more than 50 civilians, including 
women and children, had been killed in Ta&#8217;izz since early October as a result of the 
excessive use of force by Government forces. Rights groups also reported cases in which 
peaceful protesters were arbitrarily arrested. Witnesses reported that security forces targeted 
any grouping of more than a few individual on the streets of Ta&#8217;izz during that time. 
</p>
<p>29. Various sources provided conflicting accounts of the events from July to December 
2011 in Ta&#8217;izz. Security officials described repeated attempts by armed opponents to seize 
the city and expel public security and army units, in addition to killings of supporters of the 
General Peoples&#8217; Congress and occupation of public buildings, which compelled them to 
resort to force to maintain Government authority. They insisted that force was used only 
when necessary and with great care to preserve the life of civilians, and denied that 
indiscriminate shelling ever took place, stating that their opponents were also to blame for 
the shelling and targeted killings of security personnel and civilians. At the same time, 
human rights defenders, opposition groups and leaders of armed opposition groups reported 
incidents of massive violence unleashed repeatedly from a &#8220;security belt&#8221; around and above 
the city (during the fighting, heavy guns were positioned on Ta&#8217;izz citadel, which has 
commanding views over the surrounding area) with dozens of tanks and other weapons 
involved. This also hampered movement and access to emergency medical services. The 
delegation collected witness accounts and documents indicating that, whatever the 
precautions taken, a large number of unarmed civilians had been killed. The use of artillery 
and tanks, which are not available to the armed opposition, was certainly responsible for the 
high human toll and mass displacement. 
</p>
<p>30. Similar allegations emerged from Al-Hodeidah, where security forces were alleged 
to have opened fire on protesters on 23 October, injuring as many as 30 people. On 5 
November, one person was allegedly killed and 28 injured as a result of the excessive use </p>


<p>of force by security forces. The delegation obtained limited information concerning the 
circumstances of these attacks. 
</p>
<p>31. The delegation received information regarding cases of individuals allegedly 
tortured while in Government custody in detention centres in Sanaa. At least two of the 
cases concerned people held in secret detention centres controlled by the Central Security 
Services. The delegation interviewed two victims with visible signs of torture and who 
claimed to have been subjected to sexual abuse while in detention. In Ta&#8217;izz, the delegation 
met with civilian and security personnel who claimed to have been  tortured by armed 
opposition groups. 
</p>
<p>32. The delegation also noted the continued and widespread use of child soldiers within 
the ranks of forces under Government control. The Minister for Defence and the Minister 
for the Interior challenged the allegations, reiterating that the recruitment of children under 
the age of 18 into Yemeni forces was against the law. They did, however, pledge to 
investigate this matter and to promote measures to end the practice and to demobilize those 
who had already been recruited. The delegation was informed that the new Minister for 
Human Rights had personally written to a number of Cabinet members and leaders of 
armed groups requesting them to desist from using children in their forces. A children&#8217;s 
rights organization claimed that it had recorded statements against the recruitment of 
children from the same leaders, to be broadcast on television.  
</p>
<p>33. In the assessment mission conducted in June 2011, the delegation called on the 
Government to refrain from actions that deprived the population of such basic services as 
electricity, fuel and water, and to take action to help restore basic services. The partial 
removal of security barriers and checkpoints across Sanaa is a welcome development that 
enables a tangible yet limited return to normality. The delegation received a number of 
allegations concerning security forces targeting water and/or electricity providers; this 
information could not, however, be verified. The delegation also received information that 
the Government at times occupied structures destined for civilian use; for example, in 
Ta&#8217;izz, Government forces were alleged to have occupied the Thawra Hospital (the largest 
in the governorate of Ta&#8217;izz and responsible for providing health care for the vast majority 
of the inhabitants of Ta&#8217;izz) for several days and used a nearby health institute to position 
tanks engaged in shelling areas inhabited by civilians and Freedom Square.  
</p>
<p>34. In the assessment mission report, the delegation also advised the Government to 
devise a programme for the protection of all those affected by the long-standing conflict in 
Saada, particularly internally displaced persons. Progress in this regard has been hampered 
by the partial restrictions, imposed by the Houthi group holding de facto power in Sa&#8217;dah, 
on the activities of humanitarian agencies. One of them, M&#233;decins sans fronti&#232;res, was 
prevented from continuing its work and effectively expelled, under the apparently spurious 
justification that the building it was operating from was urgently needed. Humanitarian 
workers told the delegation that their deliveries were hampered by frequent disruptions and 
that they were also prevented from entering Dammaj, which was under siege by the 
Houthis. It should be noted, however, that the rate of return of people originating from 
Sa&#8217;dah who had fled to outside temporary camps or were staying in hosting households has 
been faster than expected. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights violations allegedly committed by armed opposition 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Security Council, in its resolution 2014 (2011), and the delegation that 
conducted the assessment mission in 2011 both recommended that armed opposition groups 
should remove all weapons, ranging from small firearms to rocket launchers, from public </p>


<p>areas of peaceful demonstrations, such as sit-ins and marches, and ensure that none of their 
supporters or those under their command opens fire from within peaceful demonstrations, 
thereby putting the demonstrators at risk of return fire.  
</p>
<p>36. In Sanaa, the delegation observed that armed opposition groups remained in control 
of large parts of the city. Change Square, the Old and New University areas and the north-
western part of Sixty street, which host the majority of protesters and opposition supporters, 
were largely under the control of the forces of the former Chief of the First Armoured 
Division, Ali Mohsen, who, after defecting from the Government, pledged to protect anti-
Government protesters. Armed groups loyal to Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar controlled Hasaba 
and Safwan quarters. The delegation found that areas of public protest, including Change 
Square and University Square, which had witnessed the largest protests in Sanaa, continued 
to host a range of weapons, including heavy weapons such as rocket-propelled grenades 
and other long-range weapons. Ad hoc security barriers manned by armed militias were 
heavily present throughout the areas of Sanaa occupied by armed opposition groups, which 
had removed some barriers following the signing of the agreement in accordance with the 
Gulf Cooperation Council initiative. 
</p>
<p>37. Another central recommendation made to armed opposition groups was that they 
ensure that no child under the age of 18 participated in checkpoint activities or in protecting 
protesters. In the areas occupied by armed opposition groups in Sanaa, the delegation 
observed the presence of uniformed children clearly under the age of 18 manning 
checkpoints and guarding areas.  
</p>
<p>38. The delegation also learned that many residents of areas controlled by armed 
opposition groups, particularly those perceived to be of opposing political views, continued 
to suffer from harassment and intimidation. Organizations representing residents of areas 
occupied by armed opposition groups provided the delegation with numerous testimonies 
and documents on harassment by factions of the armed security forces. The allegations 
included repeated mistreatment at security checkpoints, verbal and physical abuse, 
destruction of property and arbitrary house and car searches. According to testimonies, 
some people, particularly women and children, were forced to either confine themselves to 
home or to relocate altogether. The delegation was also informed that several homes had 
been occupied by armed forces and refitted for military use.  
</p>
<p>39. During the mission, the delegation noted signs of growing animosity in Change 
Square. Several clashes between anti-Government organizations of different political 
ideologies were reported, particularly following the arrival of protesters from Ta&#8217;izz taking 
part in the &#8220;march of life&#8221;. Witnesses referred to harassment and other acts of intimidation, 
none of which resulted in killing or serious injury. 
</p>
<p>40. The delegation also met with civil society organizations representing women. They 
told of the conditions faced by women who reside and spend time in some of the occupied 
areas; for example, female students at the University of Sanaa were increasingly forced to 
relocate or avoid these areas altogether, since they refused to let themselves to be subjected 
to checks habitually carried out by male security personnel.  
</p>
<p>41. In Ta&#8217;izz, the delegation received information about dozens of security personnel 
and others affiliated to the Government who had been detained by armed groups. The 
Governor&#8217;s son was among those detained and was only released following the intervention 
of foreign ambassadors. The delegation also received information indicating that armed 
groups had abducted a number of security personnel in Ta&#8217;izz. The abductors were alleged 
to have tortured some of their detainees or prevented them from receiving medical care. 
The delegation raised these issues with opposition leaders and asked them to release all 
individuals in their detention.  </p>


<p>42. The delegation had recommended that armed opposition groups should refrain from 
attacking targets that provide basic services and supplies, including electricity, fuel, water, 
medical supplies and health and education facilities. In Sanaa, basic services in areas 
controlled by armed opposition groups appear to be disrupted by the occupation. At the 
time of the visit, the Old University of Sanaa was closed and several elementary and 
secondary schools, shops and businesses had been partially or entirely closed. Public 
transport was scarce or non-existent, and the cost of transport, electricity, gas and other 
goods had increased two- or three-fold. Attacks on public infrastructures continued; a gas 
pipeline was bombed on 15 October in retaliation against the extrajudiciary killing of 
alleged Al-Qaida members, including two children under 18 years, in Shabwah 
governorate; and the electricity line from Mareb to Sanaa was repeatedly sabotaged (twice 
in 24 hours in January 2012). Convoys of refined oil products were also targeted, although 
the situation improved after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provided crude oil. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other issues of particular concern 
</b></p>
<p>43. The delegation received various reports of violations of child rights. Children were 
reportedly still subjected to the same extreme violence as many adults, including killings, 
injury and/or recruitment by security forces. Information received by the delegation 
indicated that children had been directly involved in the violence, having been seen in 
uniform patrolling the streets and serving at Government checkpoints. Furthermore, 
children were forced out of school, used in demonstrations or killed, wounded or displaced 
by the fighting. Numerous schools were damaged or vacated by Government forces or 
armed groups, thus depriving thousands of children of education. According to children&#8217;s 
agencies, in Ta'izz, 32 schools were closed for as long as two months after the start of the 
civil unrest. Of some 100 schools, 12 were occupied either by armed forces or armed 
groups. At the time of drafting of the present report, all schools in Ta&#8217;izz had been 
reopened, despite the continued protests against the Director General of Education and 
some headmasters. Humanitarian agencies also reported alarming increases in documented 
cases of malnutrition in children, with figures revealing that families had to reduce the 
number of meals per day even for children less than 5 years of age. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to freedom of expression, the delegation met with media organizations 
that expressed concern at the gravity of the challenges faced by journalists. More than 320 
cases of violations affecting journalists had been reported since January 2011; they 
included 44 cases of harassment, threats, assault (including during the events in Dar Salm 
on 24 December), illegal arrest and detention, the vast majority of which were allegedly 
committed by Government security forces. The journalist Abdelhakim Thu&#8217;il was detained 
incommunicado by National Security from 14 October and only released in mid-December. 
A former head of the official Saba news agency claimed to have received direct threats 
from a relative of the President. The headquarters of Al-Sa&#8217;ida television station in Safwan, 
Sanaa, were burned down in October during heavy clashes in the area. There were also 
cases of attacks and unlawful detention by armed opponents of the Government in Sanaa 
and one incident in Saada. Unions also documented more than 90 cases of newspapers 
being confiscated at security checkpoints at the entrance to major cities and in certain 
districts of Sanaa. Incidents of deportation of reporters and blocking of websites were also 
reported. At the time of the mission, the delegation was informed that at least five 
journalists had lost their lives since the start of the unrest, four allegedly killed by 
Government snipers. 
</p>
<p>45. The marginalized Muhamasheen community (also referred to as <i>Al Akhdam</i>, 
meaning &#8220;servant&#8221; in Arabic) that are distinct by their African features, continued to face 
harassment at the hands of alleged members of armed opposition groups, who accused them 
of supporting the President. One of the Muhamasheen settlements in the Al-Rawdha area of </p>


<p>Ta&#8217;izz was caught in the crossfire and its inhabitants prevented from moving for days 
during the most violent episodes. Violence and the theft of solid waste-collection vehicles 
also prevented street-cleaning activities, one of the main sources of livelihood of the 
community. 
</p>
<p>46. According to the most recent update of the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Assistance, thousands of migrants, mostly Ethiopian, were stranded in 
northern Yemen, where they face extreme hardship; more than 30 were reported to have 
died in December alone. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Implementation of the recommendations of the Office of the 
High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>47. Some steps were taken to implement the recommendations made and contained in 
the OHCHR assessment mission (A/HRC/18/21). In the previous report, OHCHR 
recommended that the Government should release all prisoners detained for peacefully 
exercising their freedom of expression and assembly and who had not been charged with a 
criminal offence. The Military Committee for Achieving Security and Stability informed 
the delegation that the Government had detained 197 people since the start of the current 
unrest. According to the Committee, 66 of those detained remained in the custody of the 
Republican Guard, 10 were in the custody of the Military Police, one in the custody of 
Military Intelligence and another 80 were in the custody of the Ministry of the Interior. The 
Committee confirmed that most of the detainees were released as a gesture of good will, 
following the announcement of the release of all people detained in connection with the 
protests. The Committee stated that the 40 detainees still in custody were detained because 
they had been charged with serious crimes and would therefore be tried. The Committee 
confirmed having received a request from sources close to defected General Ali Mohsen to 
release a large number of supporters detained by the Government. The Committee added 
that it had reviewed the list and found that many of the names on it did not belong to those 
detained.  
</p>
<p>48. At the time of the mission, the Minister for Human Rights and the Minister for Legal 
Affairs informed the delegation that the blueprint for the establishment of a national 
commission of inquiry was being prepared and would soon be submitted to the Cabinet for 
approval. Both ministers provided assurances that the commission would operate 
independently and in accordance with international standards; its mandate would be to 
investigate any human rights violations committed in the context of the ongoing unrest; its 
commissioners would be people free of any political affiliation and appointed on the basis 
of merit and standing; and that the commission would also devise programmes for the 
awarding of compensation and reparations to victims. They noted, however, that the issue 
of prosecution was at risk of being left out altogether in view of the possible adoption of an 
amnesty law.  
</p>
<p>49. The delegation met with the Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Interior and 
representatives of the Military Committee for Achieving Security and Stability. It raised 
allegations made that civilians were being unlawfully detained in secret detention centres, 
and presented three names of people allegedly detained in undisclosed localities under the 
command of Central Security. The Committee assured the delegation that it would look into 
these individual cases. No information was received by the delegation. 
</p>
<p>50. The delegation also received information about the ongoing release of a number of 
people detained by Government forces in Ta&#8217;izz, some of whom had been transferred to 
Aden or Sanaa and were still awaiting release. </p>


<p>51. The delegation was also informed during a meeting with representatives of 
numerous ministries and public bodies forming a technical committee that President Saleh 
had announced an amnesty for security personnel on 27 November for the &#8220;mistakes&#8221; made 
during the events of 2011. None of the persons present could confirm whether the 
President&#8217;s announcement was of a formal nature or whether those benefitting from the 
amnesty had been identified. Several committees were at work in Sanaa and Ta&#8217;izz to 
evaluate material damages and offer compensation. Another committee established by the 
Governor of Ta&#8217;izz had started to offer what some called &#8220;blood money&#8221; or &#8220;burial 
allowance&#8221; to families of 22 civilian victims some 50 more cases were still under 
consideration. The Governor&#8217;s fund relies on both public monies and private contributions. 
</p>
<p>It is unclear how the work of the committee ensures consistency in other locations, such as 
Arhab, Sanaa or Aden, where many civilians died but no similar progress was reported. No 
additional information was made available concerning this issue. 
</p>
<p>52. Furthermore, OHCHR was informed by the technical committee chaired by the 
Ministry of Human Rights of the adoption on 15 November 2011 of Decree No. 238, which 
establishes a framework for the implementation of the recommendations made by OHCHR 
following its assessment mission. OHCHR welcomes and commends the adoption of the 
Decree, which calls on the Minister for Human Rights and the Minister for Legal Affairs to 
present the Cabinet with a blueprint for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into 
human rights violations, including programmes of compensation and reparation for victims. 
According to the delegation&#8217;s interlocutors, work on the blueprint is continuing under the 
new Government, even though no further progress was noted. 
</p>
<p>53. OHCHR recommended that the Government of Yemen should enhance cooperation 
with the United Nations, including through (a) the implementation of recommendations 
made by the treaty bodies, at the universal periodic review and by special procedures; (b) 
the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute; (c) the implementation of the 
recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed 
conflict.4 The delegation raised the above issues during its meetings with the Minister for 
Human Rights and the Minister for Legal Affairs, who expressed their support for greater 
cooperation with the United Nations, the implementation of treaty body recommendations 
and the ratification of the above-mentioned international obligations. The delegation 
learned that the new Cabinet was preparing a framework for implementing and 
operationalizing the above recommendations to be submitted to the new Government for 
approval. The above-mentioned steps had not, however, been implemented by the 
Government at the time of the mission. 
</p>
<p>54. OHCHR also recommended that the Government should strengthen its cooperation 
with OHCHR and expedite the establishment of a national human rights institution in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. OHCHR had on several occasions raised these issues 
with the Permanent Representative of Yemen in Geneva, who consistently expressed his 
Government&#8217;s willingness to create a framework for greater cooperation with OHCHR, 
including for the establishment of a national human rights institution. During the mission, 
both the Minister for Human Rights and the Minister for Legal Affairs expressed great 
interest in forging stronger ties with OHCHR and working towards the establishment of 
permanent representation of OHCHR in Yemen.  
</p>
<p>55. One of the central recommendations made by OHCHR for the armed opposition 
groups was the release of remaining detainees and the investigation of cases of torture and 
enforced disappearance perpetrated by individuals under their command. The Government 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A/65/820&#8211;S/2011/250. </p>


<p>claimed that forces under the command of Ali Mohsen had detained 491 civilians and 193 
soldiers, and that forces loyal to Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar were allegedly holding some 200 
people. The delegation met with Sheikh Hashim al-Ahmar, brother of Sheikh Sadeq al-
Ahmar and commander of their armed forces, who claimed that most of the people who the 
Government alleged were in their custody either did not exist or were not detainees, but 
rather people who had defected from the Government to join the forces of al-Ahmar. 
Sheikh Hashim al-Ahmar also stated that the majority of detainees in custody had been 
released following the Government&#8217;s decision to release most detainees arrested in 
connection with the demonstrations, and that less than 40 detainees remained in their 
custody. Sheikh Hashim pledged to provide detailed information about the names and exact 
number of detainees still in custody. However, no further information was received. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The delegation noted that Yemenis peacefully calling for greater freedoms, an 
end to corruption and respect for the rule of law continued to be victimized by 
</b></p>
<p><b>excessive and disproportionate use of force in situations where non-lethal measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should have been used. It observed that, in Sanaa, armed opposition groups continued 
</b></p>
<p><b>to bring a range of weapons into areas of public protest, thereby endangering the lives 
</b></p>
<p><b>of civilians living in or frequenting these areas. Testimonies further indicated that 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilians residing in areas controlled by armed opposition groups in Sanaa were 
</b></p>
<p><b>subjected to routine harassment, intimidation and, at times, assault at the hands of 
</b></p>
<p><b>armed personnel under the command of the armed opposition. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> During the reporting period, force was used in the context of armed 
confrontations between Government forces and armed opposition groups, between 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-State armed groups, and by Government forces against unarmed civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercising their right to peaceful assembly. The ongoing unrest contributed to an 
</b></p>
<p><b>increasingly dire humanitarian and economic situation.  
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The delegation also noted the continued presence of children under the age of 
18 years in the ranks of the security forces and armed opposition groups.  
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> The delegation received information from a variety of sources suggesting that a 
number of civilians continued to be detained by Government security forces without 
</b></p>
<p><b>due process and that armed opposition groups continued to detain illegally persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspected of sympathizing with the Government or belonging to the security forces. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> Despite the adoption of a decree establishing a framework for the 
implementation of recommendations made by during the OHCHR assessment 
</b></p>
<p><b>mission, including the establishment of a national commission of investigation, no 
</b></p>
<p><b>concrete progress has been made in investigating incidents of excessive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disproportionate use of lethal force, arbitrary arrest, enforced disappearance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture. Given the slow or lack of progress in implementing the above-mentioned 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, the High Commissioner reiterates most of the same 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations</b>. 
</p>
<p>61.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Yemen seize the 
opportunity presented by the formation of a new Government to </b>restore citizens&#8217; trust 
</p>
<p><b>in the State and to re-establish the rule of law in the country through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the following measures: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take immediate action to end attacks against civilians and civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>targets by security forces, in full compliance with the State</b>&#8217;s obligations under </p>


<p><b>international human rights law; in particular, firearms and lethal force should only be 
</b></p>
<p><b>used as a last resort when lives are under a direct threat; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Launch a transparent and independent national investigation, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with relevant international standards, into credible allegations of serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations committed by the Government security forces, including, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>not limited to, the killing of civilians, excessive use of force against civilians, arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention, and torture and ill-treatment, and ensure that all perpetrators are held 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Provide all victims and/or families who have suffered harm, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>but not limited to death or physical injury as a result of unlawful acts committed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government security forces or their affiliates, with reparation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that no amnesties that prevent the accountability of persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for serious human rights violations, including war crimes and crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>against humanity, are allowed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Take immediate measures to end the use and recruitment of children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and demobilize those who have already been recruited, and cooperate with the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations for their integration into their communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Release remaining detainees and publish the names of persons released, 
</b></p>
<p><b>of those still detained and the justification for their continued detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Refrain from any action that is intended to deprive the population of 
</b></p>
<p><b>basic services such as electricity, fuel and water, and take urgent action to restore 
</b></p>
<p><b>basic services and access to basic supplies, in particular electricity, fuel, water, 
</b></p>
<p><b>medical supplies and facilities, and educational facilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Enhance cooperation with the United Nations, including by means of 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing recommendations made by United Nations treaty bodies, at universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review sessions and by the special procedures;  extending a standing 
</b></p>
<p><b>invitation to all thematic special procedures mandate holders; ratifying the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disappearance and the Rome Statute; and implementing the recommendations made 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Secretary-General in his report on children and armed conflict;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 18/19, develop a 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework for continued dialogue and strengthened cooperation in the field of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights with OHCHR, with the support of the international community;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Clarify the reporting lines of national and political security forces and 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish closer monitoring of their activities by the judiciary and Parliament. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that armed opposition groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Remove all weapons, from small firearms to rocket launchers, from 
</b></p>
<p><b>public areas where peaceful demonstrations, such as sit-ins and marches, are held, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ensure that none of their supporters or those under their command opens fire 
</b></p>
<p><b>from within peaceful demonstrations, thereby putting demonstrators at risk of return 
</b></p>
<p><b>fire;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that no children under the age of 18 years, whether among their 
</b></p>
<p><b>supporters or under their command, participate in checkpoint activities or in 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting protesters;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Cease acts of violence, harassment, threats and all attempts at 
</b></p>
<p><b>intimidation of demonstrators who express opposing points of view; </b> </p>


<p><b>(d) Ease restrictions on movement, including by removing manned 
</b></p>
<p><b>checkpoints and facilitating the work of humanitarian agencies;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Release all persons held in places of detention under opposition control, 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide names of those released and those still in detention and ensure that they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>treated humanely;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(f) Cooperate with investigations into abuses that may have been committed 
</b></p>
<p><b>by armed men under opposition command;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(g) Refrain from attacking targets that provide essential services to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian population, vacate all public buildings and withdraw from public and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>properties.</b> 
</p>
<p>63.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Call on all parties in Yemen to refrain from the use of violence and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolve their political or sectarian differences through open, transparent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive dialogue with the support of the international community;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Encourage international, independent and impartial investigations into 
</b></p>
