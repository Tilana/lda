<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report presents the findings and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products 
and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights deriving from his visits to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
from 4 to 8 August 2008, and to the Netherlands, from 26 to 28 November 2008. 
</p>
<p> The two country visits were undertaken as part of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s efforts to 
examine the effects on the enjoyment of human rights of the movement and dumping of toxic 
and dangerous products and wastes from the vessel <i>Probo Koala</i>, in Abidjan, on and around 
19 August 2006. The <i>Probo Koala</i> had been chartered by the commodity trading company 
Trafigura and had docked in Amsterdam prior to its journey to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, where the waste 
from the ship was dumped in various sites in the district of Abidjan. 
 With regard to the Netherlands, the visit focused on events surrounding the aborted 
offloading of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> in the port of Amsterdam, the reloading of the 
waste, and the subsequent departure of the ship. The Special Rapporteur also assessed the actions 
taken by the Dutch authorities after the dumping in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that improved measures have been taken to avoid the 
recurrence of similar incidents in the Netherlands.<b> </b>He encourages public authorities to ensure 
rigorous inspection and, where necessary, the detention of ships, such as the <i>Probo Koala</i>. The 
Netherlands should also continue to provide support to the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to allow 
the latter to monitor and address effectively the long-term human health and environmental 
effects of the incident. 
</p>
<p> The scope of the visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire included a review of procedures followed prior to 
and during the offloading and dumping of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> and an assessment of 
remedial action taken by the Government after the incident. The Special Rapporteur identified an 
urgent need to tackle outstanding issues, in particular with regard to decontamination, health care 
and compensation. He encourages the Ivorian authorities to take further action to protect the 
right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health and the right to a healthy environment of all affected victims and their families. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s review of the role of Trafigura in the dumping of the waste from 
the <i>Probo Koala</i> was focused on the company&#8217;s responsibility to respect human rights. In this 
regard, he recommends that Trafigura continue to fund and support outstanding remedial work in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. In its overall operations, Trafigura should also ensure that timely and reliable 
information is disclosed regarding its activities and the nature and composition of the waste that 
these activities generate. In addition, Trafigura should provide adequate information, in a timely 
manner, on the potential environment, health and safety impact of its activities and 
systematically ensure that waste is treated in an environmentally sound manner, including by 
rigorously assessing appropriate port reception facilities and balancing commercial interests with 
human rights and environmental requirements. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights conducted a country visit to 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, from 4 to 8 August 2008, and to the Netherlands, from 26 to 28 November 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. The two country visits were undertaken as part of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s efforts to 
examine the effects on the enjoyment of human rights of the movement and dumping of toxic 
and dangerous products and wastes from the vessel <i>Probo Koala</i>, in Abidjan, on and around 
19 August 2006. The <i>Probo Koala</i> had been chartered by commodity trading company Trafigura 
and had docked in, inter alia, Amsterdam, prior to its journey to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The findings of 
both visits are therefore presented in one comprehensive report. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Forests, the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights, the Ministry of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, the Ministry of 
Town and Urban Sanitation, the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene, the Prime Minister&#8217;s 
Office, the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, the Governor of the District of 
Abidjan, the Executive Bureau of the National Human Rights Commission of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the 
Public Prosecutor, the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire Anti-Pollution Centre, the President of the International 
Commission of Enquiry on Toxic Waste in the District of Abidjan, the President of the National 
Commission of Enquiry on Toxic Waste in the District of Abidjan, the National Office of Civil 
Protection, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Autonomous Port of Abidjan, the 
United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI), the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, the chief of the village in Akou&#233;do, civil society and victims. The Special Rapporteur 
also had the opportunity to visit some of the sites where waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> was 
discharged in the districts of Abobo, Akou&#233;do, Route d&#8217;Alepe and Vridi. 
</p>
<p>4. During his visit to the Netherlands, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Transport and its inspectorate, the Ministry of 
Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment and its inspectorate, the Amsterdam City Council, 
the Mayor of Amsterdam, the Port of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Port Services, Saybolt 
International, as well as parliamentarians of the Standing Committee on the Environment, the 
Public Prosecutor, academics, lawyers and members of civil society. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur met with the director of Trafigura and his lawyer, as well as with an external adviser 
appointed by Trafigura to conduct an independent inquiry into the <i>Probo Koala</i> incident. Prior to 
the visit to the Netherlands, the Special Rapporteur had already met with Trafigura 
representatives in Geneva on 10 September 2008. 
</p>
<p>5. Both missions were carried out at the invitation of the respective Governments. The 
Special Rapporteur wishes to thank both the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the Government 
of the Netherlands for their invitations and for their cooperation during the visits. 
</p>
<p>6. In relation to the visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Special Rapporteur would like to thank the 
Ministry of Environment, Water and Forestry for having taken the lead in the organization of the 
mission to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. He would also like to express his appreciation to UNOCI and its </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Division for their tireless efforts and support throughout his visit. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to express his sincere gratitude to civil society representatives, 
including victims and associations representing their interests, who took the time to meet and 
speak with him during and in relation to his visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p>7. With regard to the visit to the Netherlands, the Special Rapporteur thanks the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs for its leading role in the organization of the visit. He also gives special thanks to 
the Standing Committee on the Environment, for its commitment and cooperation during his 
visit. 
</p>
<p>8. The present report provides an account of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings and 
recommendations deriving from the two visits. Following an overview of the specific objectives 
of the visits and relevant international standards used by the Special Rapporteur as a framework 
for analysis, the Special Rapporteur briefly describes the sequence of events leading up to the 
dumping of wastes from the vessel <i>Probo Koala</i> in Abidjan, its impact on the enjoyment of 
human rights and the response by relevant duty-bearers and other stakeholders. He concludes the 
report with a set of recommendations for action still to be taken so that the rights of victims and 
their families can be realized. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PURPOSE OF THE VISITS AND FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS 
</b></p>
<p>9. The specific purpose of the two country visits was essentially threefold: 
</p>
<p> (a) To examine the adverse effects on the full enjoyment of human rights resulting from 
the movement and dumping of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i>; 
</p>
<p> (b) To assess the response by relevant duty-bearers and other stakeholders on the basis 
of their obligations and responsibilities under international human rights and environmental law; 
</p>
<p> (c) To identify lessons learned and to recommend additional measures in order to ensure 
the full realization of the victims&#8217; right to an effective remedy and reparation. 
</p>
<p>10. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the involvement of a range of States and third 
parties in the movement and dumping of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i>, he limits the report to 
an assessment of actions taken by the Government of the Netherlands, the Government of 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and Trafigura. These limitations are imposed by practical and financial constraints 
on the ability of the Special Rapporteur to make country visits, but also reflect his evaluation of 
the central role played by these stakeholders in the incident. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that the purpose of the visits was not to make 
inferences on the question of alleged liability of relevant stakeholders under criminal and civil 
law. He is aware that Trafigura is currently contesting the consequences of the dumping in legal 
proceedings in several countries, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the question of 
liability falls outside the scope of his mandate. Instead, the report focuses on the rights of victims 
of the incident. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>12. In order to assess the level of realization of their rights, the Special Rapporteur refers in 
particular to the following international human rights standards: 
</p>
<p> (a) The right to life, as enshrined in, inter alia, article 3 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) The right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, as set out in, inter alia, article 25 (a) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. Relevant principles that the Special Rapporteur also considers of great importance to 
ensuring a human rights-based approach to the management of toxic and dangerous products and 
wastes in general, and which he has taken into account in his analysis, are accountability, 
transparency, access to information and participation. These principles are grounded in the right 
to an effective remedy, the right to freedom of expression and the right to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs, as enshrined respectively in article 2, paragraphs 3, 19 and 25 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur has also taken into account relevant international environmental 
standards, because they govern, inter alia, the transportation of hazardous wastes and the 
prevention of marine pollution. In this regard, reference is made to the Basel Convention on the 
Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal of 1989, which 
establishes a prior informed consent procedure for such movements to take place and requires 
that all practicable steps are taken to ensure that hazardous or other wastes are managed in such a 
manner as to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects that may 
result from such wastes. Reference is also made to the International Convention for the 
Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto 
(MARPOL Convention). 
</p>
<p>15. Both C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the Netherlands are parties to the main international human rights 
treaties of relevance to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as well as to the above-mentioned 
international conventions on hazardous wastes and the prevention of pollution from ships. They 
are therefore duty-bound to implement and comply with their provisions. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises, such as Trafigura, these can be derived from an evolving body of norms 
both within and outside the international human rights system. They include the &#8220;protect, respect 
and remedy&#8221; framework developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises.<b>1</b> The 
framework emphasizes the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, 
including business, through appropriate policies, regulation and adjudication; the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights, which in essence means to act with due diligence to avoid 
infringing on the rights of others; and greater access to effective remedy, judicial and 
non-judicial (A/HRC/11/13). 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/HRC/8/5. </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>17. A relevant source of reference outside the framework of international human rights 
mechanisms are the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Guidelines are recommendations jointly addressed 
by Governments to multinational enterprises, which are called on to &#8220;respect the human rights of 
those affected by their activities consistent with the host government&#8217;s international obligations 
and commitments&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur believes that these principles and standards of good practice, and 
the &#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; framework developed by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General, provide an authoritative measure for assessing the human rights 
responsibilities of Trafigura and fulfilment of the duty to protect by both C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the 
Netherlands in relation to the movement and dumping of waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes that Trafigura is bound by the domestic 
legislation of the country in which it operates, and that such legislation may include rules and 
regulations implementing the provisions of the Basel Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>III. SUMMARY OF EVENTS PRIOR AND UP TO  
THE DUMPING OF WASTE IN ABIDJAN 
</b></p>
<p>19. The account of events described below and leading up to the dumping of waste in Abidjan 
in August 2006 is by no means exhaustive. It merely serves as a basis for analysis of the effects 
of the incident on the enjoyment of human rights and related responses by relevant duty-bearers 
and other stakeholders in line with their international human rights obligations and 
responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>20. As noted above, the waste discharged in Abidjan originated from the vessel <i>Probo Koala</i>. 
This type of ship generally transports ores, hydrocarbons or any type of bulk cargo. It has two 
slop tanks designed for the storage of cargo residues, tank purging water and hydrocarbon 
mixtures. Apart from hydrocarbons, the <i>Probo Koala</i> was also authorized to transport liquid 
sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which could be used for removing mercaptans<b>2</b> from blend 
stocks and gasolines and for the cleaning and breakdown of fuel residue. 
</p>
<p>21. The <i>Probo Koala</i>, which sails under a Panamanian flag, was chartered by Trafigura in 
October 2004. Trafigura is one of the world&#8217;s largest commodity trading enterprises in the 
energy sector. Its operations include every aspect of the sourcing and trading of crude oil, 
petroleum products, renewable energies, metals, metal ores and concentrates for 
industrial consumers. Trafigura employs 1,900 staff in 42 countries and had a turnover 
of 73 billion United States dollars in 2008. 
</p>
<p>22. According to information received from Trafigura, gasoline blend stocks were transferred 
to the <i>Probo Koala</i> in the Mediterranean between April and June 2006. The blend stocks were 
treated with caustic soda in order to reduce the level of mercaptans, which prevent the blending 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Sulphur-containing organic compounds. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/26/Add.2

</p>
<p>of oil products into a tradable commodity. Trafigura reports that, after this &#8220;onboard&#8221; caustic 
washing, the <i>Probo Koala</i>&#8217;s slop tanks contained a mixture of water, blend stock and caustic 
soda. 
</p>
<p>23. On 30 June 2006, on its way to the port of Paldiski in Estonia to unload part of its gasoline 
cargo, the <i>Probo Koala</i> docked at the port of Amsterdam to refuel and to discharge the content 
of its slop tanks. On the night of 2 July 2006, a vessel operated by Amsterdam Port Services, a 
specialized waste de-slopping company with expertise in the unloading and handling of a wide 
range of vessel-specific waste, including MARPOL slops, collected the first part of the waste 
from the <i>Probo Koala</i>&#8217;s slop tanks. 
</p>
<p>24. Strong odours emanating from the waste prompted Amsterdam Port Services to take a 
sample, which revealed a significantly higher chemical oxygen demand than it was permitted 
and able to process on its premises, in addition to a high quantity of mercaptans, which was 
causing the foul stench. Given that treatment would be more complex and costly and that it could 
only be done in Rotterdam, Amsterdam Port Services gave Trafigura a revised cost estimate 
accounting for the higher level of toxicity revealed by sample analysis (from &#8364;20 per m3 to &#8364;900 
per m3). Trafigura rejected the quote and requested to reload the waste. 
25. On 5 July 2006, Amsterdam Port Services proceeded to re-embark the waste, after which 
the <i>Probo Koala</i> set sail for Paldiski, where, between 9 and 13 July, it reportedly unloaded 
3,300 tons of gasoline and loaded approximately 26,000 metric tons of unleaded gasoline, bound 
for Lom&#233; and Lagos, Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>26. On 19 August 2006, the <i>Probo Koala</i> berthed in Abidjan. Through its subsidiary, Puma 
Energy C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, and with the assistance of its shipping agent in Abidjan, WAIBS, 
Trafigura had arranged unloading and treatment of its slop waste with a newly created company, 
Tommy Ltd. The company had made an offer of $30 per m3 for waste falling under the 
MARPOL Convention and $35 per m3 for chemical slops, after which Trafigura instructed 
WAIBS to make arrangements for the discharge of the waste and to coordinate the operation 
with Tommy Ltd. 
</p>
<p>27. Tommy Ltd. rented 12 trucks, which dumped the waste at various sites in the district of 
Abidjan between the evening of 19 August and the morning of 20 August 2006. A report by 
the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team,<b>3</b> deployed upon request by 
the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Abidjan, indicates that, on the night 
of 14 September, further dumping of the same hazardous waste may have taken place. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the Ivorian Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene, there were 18 dumping 
points in 8 sites. Additional sites have also been reported. None of the dumping sites had proper 
facilities for the treatment of chemical waste. Suffocating odours originated from the dumping 
sites.

<p> A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  IMPACT ON THE ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>29. Residents in areas close to the dumping sites were directly exposed to the waste through 
skin contact and the breathing in of volatile substances. In addition, secondary exposure 
reportedly occurred through contact with surface water, groundwater and eventually through the 
consumption of food grown on or extracted from contaminated land and water. 
</p>
<p>30. On 20 August 2006, thousands of individuals visited health-care centres complaining of 
nausea, headaches, vomiting, abdominal pains, skin reactions and a range of eye, ear, nose, 
throat, pulmonary and gastric problems. Some residents were allegedly forced to flee their homes 
and many businesses forewent commercial earnings for a significant period of time following the 
contamination. Widespread public demonstrations were held in the district of Abidjan. During 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, non-governmental organizations informed him 
that the demonstrations were often dispersed violently. 
</p>
<p>31. According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 were hospitalized and there were more 
than 108,000 medical consultations resulting from the incident.<b>4</b> During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit, non-governmental organizations informed him that the figures may well be higher, taking 
into account additional deaths and long-term health consequences that had been reported. An 
assessment by the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene concluded that there were 
63,296 probable and 34,408 confirmed cases of exposure to the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i>. In 
this regard, the impact of the dumping of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> on the enjoyment of 
human rights mainly concerns the right to life and the right to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur considers that loss of life as a result of the movement and dumping 
of toxic waste constitutes a violation of the right to life. In interpreting the right to life under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights Committee stressed that 
the expression &#8220;inherent right to life&#8221; could not properly be understood in a restrictive manner, 
and that the protection of that right requires States to take positive measures.<b>5</b> In combination 
with the general legal obligation arising from article 2 of the Covenant, which requires States to 
take legislative, judicial, administrative, educative and other appropriate measures in order to 
fulfil their legal obligations under the Covenant,<b>6</b> the Special Rapporteur argues that the right to 
life imposes on States a duty to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safe and sound 
management of toxic and dangerous products and wastes throughout their life cycle. 
Furthermore, failure by States parties to take appropriate measures to prevent, investigate, punish 
and redress the loss of life caused by toxic and dangerous products and wastes is a violation of 
the right to life. 
</p>
<p>

page 10 
 
</p>
<p>33. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, similar State obligations would also arise in relation 
to the negative effects on human health of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes. In this respect, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
emphasized that the improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene, as a 
component of the right to health, comprised the prevention and reduction of a population&#8217;s 
exposure to harmful substances, such as radiation and harmful chemicals or other detrimental 
environmental conditions that have a direct or indirect impact on human health.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the existence of a causal link between the 
alleged violations of the rights to life and health, on the one hand, and the waste offloaded and 
dumped from the <i>Probo Koala</i>, on the other, has not yet been fully established. In this regard, he 
once again stresses that he does not in any way intend to prejudge future determinations by 
courts seized of this matter. While not being in a position to make conclusive inferences on the 
exact composition and toxic nature of the waste in question, the Special Rapporteur would 
nevertheless like to make the observations below. 
</p>
<p>35. Firstly, the Special Rapporteur has taken note of information received from Trafigura 
stating that the characteristics of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> could have resulted in a highly 
unpleasant smell, but could not have led to the widespread injuries, illnesses and deaths alleged. 
36. Secondly, the Special Rapporteur is aware that the analysis of samples taken in 
Amsterdam, when the <i>Probo Koala</i> docked there, and in Abidjan in the aftermath of the incident 
showed that the waste dumped from the <i>Probo Koala</i> was petrochemical. According to the 
United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team that visited C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire shortly 
after the incident, this kind of waste &#8220;can be harmful to humans and the environment if serious 
exposure takes place&#8221;.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Thirdly, the Special Rapporteur observes that a mission to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, mandated by the 
Basel Convention secretariat in response to a request for technical assistance from C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
concluded that, &#8220;based on available information, the <i>Probo Koala</i> wastes exhibit the hazard 
characteristics of the Basel Convention&#8221;.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>38. On the basis of the above considerations and taking into account the immediate impact on 
public health and the proximity of some of the dumping sites to areas where affected populations 
reside, the Special Rapporteur considers that there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that 
the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste 
from the <i>Probo Koala</i>. Hence, there are sufficient grounds for considering the actions of relevant 
stakeholders prior to, during and after the dumping from a human rights perspective, in addition 
to the consideration of relevant standards in relation to the movement of hazardous wastes and 
marine pollution.

<p><b>V. RESPONSES BY THE NETHERLANDS,  
C&#212;TE D&#8217;IVOIRE AND TRAFIGURA 
</b></p>
<p>39. Given the alleged adverse effects on the enjoyment of human rights resulting from the 
dumping of waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i>, the Special Rapporteur considered the actions taken by 
the Netherlands, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and Trafigura prior to, during and after the dumping in order to 
assess the fulfilment of relevant duties and responsibilities under international human rights law, 
as described above. </p>
<p><b>A.  The Netherlands 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Rapporteur focused on two aspects: (a) procedures followed during the aborted 
discharge of the waste and the subsequent permission for the ship to sail to Estonia; and 
(b) actions taken by the Government after the dumping in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in particular in terms of 
determining the facts and taking of measures to ensure prevention of any such incidents in the 
future. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to the first aspect, the Special Rapporteur notes that national and European 
legislation is in place to implement the provisions of both the Basel Convention and the 
MARPOL Convention. The national laws concerned are the Environmental Management Act 
and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships Act. The Environmental Management Act falls 
within the remit of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and its 
inspectorate. The Prevention of Pollution from Ships Act comes under the competency of the 
Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management and its inspectorate. 
</p>
<p>42. Relevant legislation at the level of the European Union includes Council Regulation (EEC) 
No. 259/93, as subsequently amended, on the supervision and control of shipments of waste 
within, into and out of the European Community, which transposes the Basel Convention 
obligations into European Union legislation. The Special Rapporteur notes that regulations are 
binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all States members of the Union without the 
need to be transposed into national law. 
</p>
<p>43. The circumstances surrounding the discharge of waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> were 
unusual. Firstly, as mentioned in the summary of events, uncertainty arose over the exact 
composition and toxic nature of the waste after part of the waste had been offloaded from the 
vessel in Amsterdam. Secondly, an extensive discussion ensued among relevant authorities on 
the question of whether Amsterdam Port Services was technically the holder of the waste and 
therefore required to dispose of it in an environmentally sound manner. The situation was further 
compounded by the absence of an agreement between Trafigura and Amsterdam Port Services 
on the higher cost for treatment of the waste following the analysis of a waste sample and the 
subsequent request made by Trafigura to reload the waste, a situation that may have created 
doubts as to the applicable legal framework. 
</p>
<p>44. Under such circumstances, inspection of the vessel and a sample analysis to determine the 
origin and exact composition of the waste would have been necessary to identify the applicable 
legal framework. Although the Special Rapporteur did receive information on hydrogen sulphide </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>readings, which indicated that there was no danger to human health, in addition to a sample 
taken by the Netherlands Forensic Institute, an inspection of the vessel by national police and 
measurements by a surveying company, it is his understanding that relevant inspectorates did not 
carry out any further inspections and that the possibility of detaining the <i>Probo Koala</i> was not 
fully considered. 
</p>
<p>45. The Environmental Management Act and Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 did 
nevertheless offer possible grounds to prevent the return of the waste already offloaded and the 
departure of the ship. In particular, the Environmental Management Act prohibits the discarding 
of industrial or hazardous waste by transferring it to another person not been authorized to 
receive it in accordance with section 10.37, paragraph 2, of the Act. This clearly hinges on the 
question of whether Amsterdam Port Services had accepted the offloaded part of the waste and 
whether reloading it would constitute a transboundary movement under Council Regulation 
(EEC) No. 259/93. In addition, the Regulation only allows the movement of hazardous waste to 
another State member of the European Union if consent is given, while exportation to countries 
that are not members of OECD is prohibited.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>46. The Prevention of Pollution from Ships Act requires the captain of a ship to deliver the 
residues of certain categories of noxious substances specified in annex II to the MARPOL 
Convention to a port reception facility. 
</p>
<p>47. Although the Special Rapporteur accepts the complexity of the legal framework and the 
uncertainty regarding its proper application in the case in question, he regrets that none of these 
provisions were ultimately invoked to prevent the reloading of the waste and the departure of the 
<i>Probo Koala</i>, particularly considering that the captain was alleged to have made conflicting 
claims about the nature of the waste. 
</p>
<p>48. With regard to the remedial action taken by the Government after the dumping had taken 
place in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Special Rapporteur has taken note of several fact-finding initiatives 
undertaken at the levels of local and central government. They include: (a) an inquiry conducted 
by the Hulshof Commission, set up by the Municipality of Amsterdam (see paragraph 73 below); 
(b) a factual account and summary of relevant legislation prepared by the Inspectorate of the 
Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment; and (c) an advisory opinion issued 
by the Dutch parliamentary counsel. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiatives taken by the Government to set up an 
inter-ministerial working group to coordinate follow-up to the <i>Probo Koala</i> case. According to 
information received by the Special Rapporteur, such initiatives include the preparation of a 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  Council decision 97/640/EC concerned the approval, on behalf of the Community, of the 
</p>
<p>amendment to the Basel Convention, as laid down in decision III/1 of the Conference of the 
Parties. By that amendment, all exports of hazardous waste destined for disposal from countries 
listed in annex VII (Parties and other States which are members of OECD, the European 
Community and Liechtenstein) to the Convention to countries not listed therein were prohibited, 
with effect from 1 January 1998. </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>protocol on &#8220;unusual situations&#8221;, which would clarify responsibilities and decision-making 
processes, and a study on better harmonization of different legal frameworks involved. The 
Special Rapporteur also appreciates the efforts made to improve cooperation and coordination 
between different inspectorates in this context. 
</p>
<p>50. As financial considerations appear to have played a key role in the decision to reload the 
waste back on to the <i>Probo Koala</i>, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Netherlands to 
consider creating a fund or another financing mechanism in the implementation of its follow-up 
initiatives. Such a funding tool would ensure the proper discharge and treatment of toxic and 
hazardous waste in the Netherlands in situations where disagreements over payment arise, where 
the carrier of the waste is unwilling to pay for environmentally sound disposal of such waste and 
where inaction could determine a serious risk of serious or irreversible damage to human health 
and the environment. Upon judicial determination of liability, the carrier of the waste would be 
required to reimburse the costs incurred. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is nevertheless satisfied that improved measures have been taken 
to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. In this regard, he was informed that a similar incident 
occurred in 2007 with another vessel allegedly chartered by Trafigura. In that case, the 
inspectorate of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment took samples and 
the waste was processed in a plant for toxic waste after the results of an analysis of the samples 
taken by the inspectorate had become available and permission was given by the local authorities 
to process the waste. Significantly, the waste collector and Trafigura agreed on the processing of 
the waste. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur also notes the investigation conducted by the Public Prosecutor, 
which has resulted in judicial proceedings against Trafigura, the captain of the <i>Probo Koala</i>, 
Amsterdam Port Services and the municipality of Amsterdam. These proceedings are currently 
ongoing. 
</p>
<p>53. At the international level, the Special Rapporteur is aware of the support provided by the 
Netherlands for the deployment of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination 
team in the aftermath of the dumping in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in 2006. The Netherlands has contributed 
financially to a project implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 
with counterparts from the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests. The 
project focuses on the preparation of a hazardous waste management plan for the district of 
Abidjan and capacity-building of the waste management regime in the port of Abidjan, including 
the transfer of technology to strengthen the technical capacity of the Ivorian Anti-Pollution 
Centre. 
</p>
<p>54. The Basel Convention Regional Centre for French-speaking countries in Africa, based in 
Senegal, is also implementing a regional component of the UNEP project with the aim of 
building institutional capacity in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and other countries. This includes technical 
assistance to develop norms and regulations to eliminate loopholes at the national level, with the 
overall objective of enhancing capacity to monitor and control the transboundary movement of 
hazardous waste and chemicals. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>55. Further assistance by the Government of the Netherlands, in particular in the form of 
technical expertise, to help the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire deal with outstanding health-care, 
decontamination and other issues would be useful and necessary. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire included a review of procedures followed 
prior to and during the dumping of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i>, and an assessment of the 
remedial action taken by the Government after the incident. The latter included issues such as 
decontamination, access to health care, compensation, and access to justice, which the Special 
Rapporteur considers essential for the realization of the right to an effective remedy and 
reparation for victims of the dumping. 
</p>
<p>57. Articles 19 and 28 of the Constitution of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire guarantee the right to a healthy 
environment. The import of wastes and hazardous wastes into C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is prohibited by law 
No. 88-651 of 7 July 1988 and framework law No. 96-766 of 3 October 1996. Under these laws, 
the unauthorized importation of hazardous wastes and noxious substances is a criminal offence.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>58. Despite the above-mentioned legal safeguards, the dumping of the waste from the 
<i>Probo Koala</i> revealed a weakness of and disregard for administrative procedures to prevent 
unauthorized importation of hazardous waste. With regard to the discharge of waste in the port 
of Abidjan, noted flaws include the granting of a licence to Tommy Ltd. to operate in the port 
without rigorous assessment and scrutiny of its application. With regard to the inspection of 
ships, the authorities did not verify the nature of the waste and its potential impact on human 
health and the environment prior to the discharge of the waste. In this regard, the Rapporteur 
notes that the Ivorian Anti-Pollution Centre does not have a permanent presence in the port of 
Abidjan and is not in a position to conduct systematic inspection of ships docking in the port. 
59. With regard to remedial action after the dumping, a crisis committee was set up led by the 
Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests, and an official announcement was made to the 
public about the exact coordinates of the polluted sites, the need to stay away from these sites 
and the availability of health centres for health checks. The Minister for Environment, Water and 
Forests also contacted the Basel Convention secretariat, an inter-ministerial committee on toxic 
wastes was created and a national toxic waste abatement plan was launched to address urgent 
health, environmental and economic issues. The crisis, and the enormous social unrest that it 
caused, led to the resignation of the Government on 6 September 2006. 
</p>
<p>60. With regard to health care, the Special Rapporteur has taken note of information received 
from the Government that free medical treatment was provided in approximately 50 access 
points, including public and private health institutions, and in mobile units. During his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that the access points often lacked proper equipment and 
</p>

</p>
<p>medication to treat patients. In addition, many people, especially those living near the dumping 
sites, still experience health problems. Adverse effects on childbirth and child health, including 
miscarriages and stillbirth, have also been reported. The monitoring of the long-term effects on 
human health and care for the most vulnerable therefore remains necessary. 
</p>
<p>61. With regard to decontamination, clean-up operations were assigned by the Government to 
S&#233;ch&#233;, a French group that intervened through Tredi International, its subsidiary. Tredi extracted 
9,300 tons of contaminated soils and liquids from the district of Abidjan, which were shipped to 
France and incinerated at a special factory owned by Tr&#233;di.<b>10</b> The Special Rapporteur was told 
that eight sites had been decontaminated in this manner. Full decontamination has, however, not 
yet taken place. 
</p>
<p>62. The Government has called on victims to register on an official list to receive 
compensation. Disputes have however arisen about the accuracy of the list, which was based on 
information provided by State hospitals. Many people were, however, not registered, as they had 
sought medical care in clinics that were not certified by the State or through traditional healers. 
In addition, some victims could not register because they did not have official identity cards. 
</p>
<p>63. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that some victims had been 
compensated. Others have not received any or only limited compensation. Affected businesses, 
in particular in the Vridi industrial area, also claimed to have received inadequate compensation. 
The slow pace of the process, a lack of transparency and limited recognition of victims and 
acknowledgement of their suffering are of particular concern in this context. 
</p>
<p>64. In February 2007, the President of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire signed an out of court settlement with 
Trafigura. On the basis of the settlement, Trafigura paid $198 million to cover damages suffered 
by the State, reimbursement for decontamination costs and compensation for victims. The State 
agreed to indemnify directly any individual claiming to have suffered harm. Victims&#8217; 
associations appear not to have been consulted before the agreement was signed. This is a matter 
of serious concern, particularly since the settlement required the State to waive all current or 
future action for liability and damages. The Special Rapporteur also received complaints about 
inequitable distribution and an overall lack of clarity in the subsequent use made of the 
settlement payment. 
</p>
<p>65. With regard to access to justice, the Public Prosecutor conducted an investigation into the 
incident, which led to the prosecution of several individuals. However, in March 2008, the Court 
of Appeal ruled that there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against Trafigura. 
In October 2008, the owner of Tommy Ltd. and a representative from the shipping agent WAIBS 
received prison sentences of 20 and 5 years respectively for their role in the incident; seven other 
individuals were acquitted. Personal injury group litigation is still ongoing before the High Court 
of Justice in the United Kingdom. In this class action, over 20,000 victims allege they were 
injured by exposure to the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> as a result of actions by Trafigura. 
66. In relation to the verification of facts and the disclosure of the truth about the incident, the 
Special Rapporteur has taken note of the reports issued by both the national and international </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>commissions of inquiry on the toxic waste in the district of Abidjan, and encourages the 
Government to follow up on their recommendations. The Special Rapporteur notes that these 
reports have not been widely disseminated. 
</p>
<p>67. Some measures have been taken with a view to preventing the dumping of waste in the 
future. In particular, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative to prepare a hazardous waste 
management plan for the district of Abidjan in the context of the above-mentioned project (see 
paragraph 50 above) carried out with the assistance of UNEP. Further capacity-building of 
relevant institutions in this area is necessary. At the same time, effective prevention can only be 
realized if these initiatives are accompanied by institutional reform and a strengthening of 
independent supervisory powers in the area of waste management. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Trafigura 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s review of the role of Trafigura in the dumping of the waste from 
the <i>Probo Koala</i> was focused on the company&#8217;s responsibility to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>69. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (see paragraph 17 above) emphasize 
that companies are expected to comply with national laws and to respect the principles of 
relevant international instruments. The policy framework for business and human rights 
developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights 
and transnational corporations and other business corporations provides that, in addition to 
compliance with national laws, the baseline responsibility of companies is to respect human 
rights.<b>11</b> This responsibility exists independently of States&#8217; duties<b>12</b> and even where national law 
is absent.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>70. The exercise of this responsibility requires due diligence, a process whereby companies not 
only ensure compliance with national laws, but also become aware of, prevent and address 
adverse effects on human rights. The scope of due diligence is determined by the country context 
in which business activities take place; the impact that business activities may have on human 
rights within that context; and the extent to which relationships associated with these activities 
might contribute to abuse.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur considers that the due diligence test in the <i>Probo Koala</i> case rests 
on the questions of whether Trafigura took all the necessary precautions to prevent any possible 
adverse impact on human rights of the discharge of its waste, and of whether it could have

</p>
<p>reasonably known that its actions or omissions would contribute to a human rights violation. In 
the view of the Special Rapporteur, these precautions needed to be particularly stringent in the 
case of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, given the prevailing climate of insecurity and weak rule of law in the 
country as a result of the crisis, which started in 2002. Several political agreements aimed at 
resolving this crisis have been signed and implemented, the most recent of which being the 
Ouagadougou Political Agreement of 4 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>72. Within this framework, the Special Rapporteur has identified the following specific 
elements of due diligence in relation to the dumping of the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> in 
Abidjan: 
 (a) Full disclosure of and clarity on the composition of the <i>Probo Koala&#8217;s</i> slop tanks and 
destination for disposal prior to the unloading of the waste; 
</p>
<p> (b) Evaluation of port reception capacities and waste disposal facilities in terms of 
environmentally sound waste treatment prior to the unloading of the waste; 
</p>
<p> (c) Remedial action after the dumping of the waste. 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to the first element, the Special Rapporteur has taken note of alleged 
inconsistencies in the way the <i>Probo Koala</i> and its shipping agent communicated the content and 
nature of the slops to port authorities in Amsterdam. According to the report of the Hulshof 
Commission (see paragraph 48 above) received by the Special Rapporteur, the content of the 
<i>Probo Koala&#8217;s</i> slop tanks was variously described as a &#8220;mixture of tank washing, petrol and 
caustic soda&#8221;, &#8220;oily tank washings and cargo residues&#8221;, &#8220;watery cleaning liquids&#8221; and &#8220;waste 
from steam degreasing&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur also notes that, at a later stage, after having left 
Amsterdam and upon berthing in Abidjan, Trafigura characterized the waste as &#8220;chemical waste 
water&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;MARPOL waste water&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>74. In addition, the high chemical oxygen demand was apparently not known when the 
<i>Probo Koala</i> docked in Amsterdam and was only detected on the basis of the sample taken by 
APS. Similarly, there was reportedly a lack of clarity around the destination for the discharge of 
the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i> after its stop in Amsterdam. In this regard, the terms &#8220;next 
convenient opportunity&#8221; and &#8220;to sea for orders&#8221; were used, while initially &#8220;Paldiski, Estonia&#8221; 
had been indicated. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that this may not be 
uncommon in such transactions, the discretion with which different descriptions were used 
appears to be broad and not conducive to transparent decision-making on the treatment of 
potentially toxic waste. 
</p>
<p>75. With regard to the assessment of appropriate port reception facilities, the analysis carried 
out after the vessel berthed in Amsterdam revealed that the waste could not be treated there and 
that only the port of Rotterdam had adequate treatment facilities. Under these circumstances, the 
Special Rapporteur considers that the onus would be on Trafigura to show in what way the port 
of Abidjan would be equally or better equipped to process the waste. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/26/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>76. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur is aware of Trafigura&#8217;s assertion that the port of 
Abidjan is widely regarded as an appropriate location to discharge slops falling under the 
MARPOL Convention. According to information received from Trafigura, approximately 
30,000 tons of hydrocarbon residues and waste waters were discharged from ships in Abidjan 
between 1 January and 6 September 2006. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur observes that Trafigura&#8217;s claims on this issue are not supported by 
the findings of the above-mentioned technical assistance mission to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire mandated by 
the Basel Convention secretariat, which found that &#8220;the Abidjan port is not equipped with the 
necessary facilities for the offloading and treatment of wastes covered by the MARPOL 
Convention. The mission was unable to confirm whether the port was in fact authorized to 
receive such wastes&#8221;.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>78. At the time of the events, the port of Abidjan reportedly had only one experienced 
de-slopping service provider, the company Ivoirienne des techniques des &#233;nergies (ITE). While it 
is not unusual for a commodity trader such as Trafigura to work with several companies for the 
discharge and treatment of its waste, the exercise of due diligence would seem to suggest that 
ITE was the only viable option in this particular case. 
</p>
<p>79. With regard to the decision to contract Tommy Ltd. to discharge the waste, the Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges information received from Trafigura that its subsidiary, Puma Energy, 
contacted the shipping agent WAIBS, which in turn identified Tommy Ltd. as being able to deal 
with the slops. Reportedly, the port of Abidjan confirmed that Tommy Ltd. was registered and 
copies of relevant licenses and authorizations had been provided to Puma Energy. Furthermore, 
WAIBS and Tommy Ltd. were informed of the composition of the waste, including its chemical 
oxygen demand. Tommy Ltd. stated that it would assume full responsibility for the operation.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>80. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, these elements do not amount to a full evaluation of 
reception capacities in the port of Abidjan aimed at ensuring environmentally sound waste 
treatment. In this regard, further information at the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s disposal suggests that 
Tommy Ltd. was only created shortly prior to the arrival of the <i>Probo Koala</i> and had neither 
previous experience with waste treatment nor adequate facilities, equipment and expertise to 
treat waste. It is of concern to the Special Rapporteur that these shortcomings do not appear to 
have been taken into consideration by Trafigura. 
</p>
<p>81. At the very least, due diligence should have triggered additional inquiries into 
Tommy Ltd.&#8217;s capacity to treat waste in an environmentally sound manner, particularly in the 
light of the fact that Tommy Ltd. informed Trafigura that it would discharge the waste from the 
<i>Probo Koala</i> &#8220;in a place out of the city, called Akou&#233;do, which is properly equipped to receive 
any type of chemical product&#8221;.<b>10</b> The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity during his visit to 
Abidjan to visit Akou&#233;do. It is a municipal waste dump existing alongside poor communities 
living on subsistence farming and in extremely precarious conditions. Nearby residents live on 
recycling garbage for personal use or reselling. Akou&#233;do was not in any way equipped to treat 
the waste from the <i>Probo Koala</i>.

</p>
<p>82. With regard to the third element of due diligence, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
Trafigura sent two senior executives, in addition to a team of medical experts, a geologist and a 
refining engineer to Abidjan in the immediate aftermath of the incident to conduct an impact 
assessment and to assist with the handling of the crisis. Trafigura also declared that it would fully 
cooperate with the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the United Nations Disaster Assessment 
and Coordination team investigating the incident. 
</p>
<p>83. In November 2006, Trafigura commissioned an independent inquiry into the events, which 
led to an interim report, but was not concluded in order not to prejudice the outcome of legal 
proceedings in the United Kingdom.<b>16</b> In the context of the above-mentioned settlement 
agreement, an environmental audit was also carried out. In April 2008, Trafigura agreed to pay 
an additional &#8364;7.6 million for remedial work and other health-care, education and environmental 
projects. 
84. While the Special Rapporteur generally welcomes the efforts made by Trafigura to provide 
redress, he encourages it to continue to fund and support outstanding remedial work. In addition, 
the Special Rapporteur is greatly concerned by reports that the company has filed or threatened 
to file libel lawsuits against various civil society and media institutions that have reported on the 
<i>Probo Koala</i> incident in a critical manner. Such lawsuits may have the effect of stifling 
independent reporting and public criticism. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur considers that 
Trafigura, as a public figure in this case, should show restraint. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of the Netherlands and 
relevant State actors: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Harmonize and strengthen existing legislation on the prevention of marine 
pollution and environmental management in order to ensure more rigorous inspection and, 
where necessary, the detention of ships for a reasonable period of time, in particular in 
cases of inconsistent or incorrect declarations regarding cargo and waste on board; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Consider the creation of a financial mechanism that would ensure the proper 
discharge and treatment of toxic and hazardous waste in the Netherlands; such a 
mechanism would need to be developed in accordance with the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle 
and presuppose reimbursement by the carrier of the waste upon a judicial determination of 
liability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Continue to provide support to the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to enable the 
latter to effectively monitor and address possible long-term human health and 
environmental effects of the incident. 
</b></p>
<p>

adequate medical assistance to victims, including treatment of new and long-term 
manifestations of illnesses as a result of the dumping; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Take additional measures to intensify the dispensation of compensation to all 
victims and to complete this process as a matter of urgency in a clear and transparent

<p><b> (f) Ensure full access to information for those affected on measures taken to 
address possible long-term adverse effects on health and the environment of the incident. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Trafigura: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) In relation to the <i>Probo Koala</i> incident, continue to provide financial assistance 
to the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in order to address outstanding issues related to

<p><b> (b) In its overall operations, ensure that reliable information is disclosed in a timely 
manner regarding its activities and the nature and composition of the waste that these 
activities generate; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Provide adequate information in a timely manner on the potential 
environmental, health and safety impact of its activities, and systematically ensure that 
waste is treated in an environmentally sound manner, including by rigorously assessing 
appropriate port reception facilities and balancing commercial interests with human rights

</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Develop a corporate accountability and human rights policy and management 
framework, including annual reporting on social, environmental and economic effects.</b></p>

</p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the international community, including 
United Nations entities, and donors: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Continue to provide support to the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and relevant 
State actors in addressing possible long-term human health and environmental effects of 
the incident, with a particular focus on decontamination, health care and compensation, 
and promoting the rights of victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Continue to assist the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and other States, as

products and wastes.
