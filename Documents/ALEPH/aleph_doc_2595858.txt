Consolidated Financial Statements.
Octavio Alvídrez, Chief Executive Officer of Fresnillo plc, said:
"We have had a solid first half operationally, with silver and gold production up 6% and 23% respectively. Silver
production was driven by another strong performance at Saucito following the ramp-up of Saucito II and the plant
optimisation, higher grades at Ciénega, and higher ore grades and production at the Fresnillo mine. We continue to
progress the turnaround at Fresnillo, consolidating the improvements already made. Gold production was driven by
increased output from our open pit mines, Herradura and Noche Buena. I am confident we are well-placed to meet our
2016 silver production guidance of 49-51 million ounces, and our recently increased 2016 gold production guidance of
850-870 thousand ounces.
The first half saw construction of the leaching plant at our new San Julián mine completed. As previously reported, we
expect to re-start feeding ore to the mill in the coming days, post a minor issue with the lubrication system. Phase 2 of
this project remains on track for commissioning by year end. Looking further forward, the first half also saw Board
approval for the resumption of the Pyrites plant project, thanks to improved market conditions, and the approval of the
Centauro Extension project at Herradura, encompassing a second line to the Dynamic Leaching Plant.  I am also
pleased to report that our ongoing exploration activity yielded interesting drill results at San Julián, Guanajuato and
Fresnillo.
Precious metals prices have performed strongly since the start of the year, and our mines have seen increased
production, resulting in robust financial results. However, we are maintaining our cautious approach, with strict
operational and financial discipline, and investment decisions will continue to be evaluated on a project by project basis
against key criteria. This is in line with our Contingency Plan, which we put in place early this year and which remains in
place. Our strategic objectives remain unchanged and we will continue to take a long-term view, focusing on balancing
profitable growth with returns, whilst maintaining a solid financial position.
Thanks to this conservative approach we remain well placed to create value throughout price cycles, with our high
quality, low cost assets and significant growth pipeline, combined with our balance sheet strength. "
Commentary on the Group's results
Fresnillo plc's operating results were driven by a strong performance from Herradura, with higher speeds of recovery
and an increase in ore processed following the commissioning of the second Merrill Crowe plant in late 2015. Higher
speeds of recovery at Noche Buena also contributed to the increased gold production. In silver, regained access to the
higher grades areas at the San Carlos and San Alberto veins led to higher ore grades and production at Fresnillo, whilst
Saucito continued to perform strongly following the ramp-up of Saucito II and the plant optimisation. Ciénega saw a
decrease in gold production resulting from lower grades, but an increase in silver production mainly due to higher silver
grades at the Rosario and Las Casas areas.
Increased volumes of gold, silver, lead and zinc sold and our cost reduction initiatives, coupled with the benefit of
external variables including the recovery of the gold price and the devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange
rate, positively impacted the Group's financial results in the first half of 2016.
Total revenues increased 17.9% half on half to US$886.9 million in the first six months of 2016 mainly as a result of
increased sales volumes and the higher gold price during the period; which was partly offset by higher treatment and
refining charges resulting from the increased volumes of lead and zinc concentrates produced.
Adjusted production costs of US$299.7 million decreased by 5.2% compared to the first half of 2015. This decrease was
mainly explained by the favourable effect of the 19.3% devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar, lower energy
prices and the positive impact of our cost reduction initiatives. These factors more than compensated for the additional
production costs recorded resulting from the increased ore throughput at Herradura and Saucito. However, cost of sales
of US$492.5 million increased slightly by 2.9% over the first half of 2015 mainly due to the decrease in inventories at
Herradura following the increased processing capacity achieved with the commissioning of the second Merrill Crowe
plant; and to a lesser extent a decrease in inventories at Noche Buena.
Similarly, cost per tonne across all our mines decreased, reflecting the benefit of the devaluation of the average Mexican
peso/US dollar exchange rate and the efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives achieved.
The increase in revenues, which more than offset the slight increase in cost of sales resulted in a 44.1% increase in
gross profit to US$394.4 million in the first half of 2016.
Administrative expenses decreased by 20.9% as a result of a decrease in non-recurring engineering and construction
services provided by Peñoles related to new projects, the lower cost of services provided by third parties and the
positive effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar on administrative expenses denominated in
pesos.
As part of our Contingency Plan, exploration expenses of US$52.1 million also decreased over the first half of 2015 as a
result of a slower pace of drilling.
The higher gross profit and lower administrative and exploration expenses resulted in a 49.1% increase in EBITDA, with
the EBITDA margin rising from 42.3% in the first half of 2015 to 53.4% in the same period of 2016.
In the first half of 2016, net finance costs included US$13.9 million as a result of the interest recognised in the income
statement in relation to the US$800 million debt facility raised in November 2013. In addition, a non-cash loss of
US$136.6 million was recognised in respect of the gold hedging programme put in place to protect the investment made
in the acquisition of the 44% stake of Newmont in Penmont.
During the period, there was a positive revaluation of the Silverstream (US$109.9 million) due most significantly to the
higher forward silver price and the decrease in the reference discount rate (LIBOR).
The 9.9% spot devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar in the six months to 30 June 2016 had an adverse
effect on the value of peso-denominated net current assets when converted to US dollars, resulting in a foreign
exchange loss of US$8.6 million in the first half of 2016.
Profit from continuing operations before income tax increased by 87.4% from US$136.1 million to US$255.1 million in
the first half of 2016.
Income tax expense increased 51.6% to US$73.7 million as a result of higher profits generated in the first half of 2016.
The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining right, was 28.9%, and 35.1% including the effects of the special
mining right.
Net profit for the period was US$165.6 million, a 116.9% increase over the first half of 2015.
Cash flow generated by operations, before changes in working capital, increased by 50.9% to US$475.2 million in the
first half of 2016 as a result of higher profits.
Capital expenditure totaled US$198.8 million, a decrease of 13.2% over the first half of 2015. Investments during the
period included construction at the San Julián project, leaching pads at Herradura and development at Fresnillo and
Ciénega.
Other uses of funds during the period were income tax and profit sharing paid of US$67.9 million (US$33.5 million in
1H15) and dividends paid of US$24.8 million (US$22.1 million in 1H15).
The Group maintained a strong balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (together defined as
"short-term funds") as at 30 June 2016 amounted to US$701.2 million, a 47.4% increase compared to the US$475.7
million in short term funds at the end of June 2015 and a 40.2% increase over the year-end total of US$500.1 million.
Taking into account the short-term funds of US$701.2 million and the US$796.5 million amortised cost of the Senior
Notes, Fresnillo plc's net debt was US$95.3 million as at 30 June 2016.
The Board of Directors has declared an interim dividend of 8.6 US cents per share totaling US$63.4 million which will
be paid on 9 September 2016 to shareholders on the register on 12 August 2016. This decision was made after a
comprehensive review of the Company's and Group's financial situation, assuring that the Group is well placed to meet
its current and future financial requirements, including its development and exploration projects. Fresnillo plc's existing
dividend policy, which takes into account the profitability of the business and underlying earnings, as well as our capital
requirements and cash flows while maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover, remains in place. To reiterate the
policy, a total dividend of between 33 and 50 percent of profit after tax is paid out each year in the approximate
proportion of one-third to be paid as an interim dividend, two-thirds to be paid as a final dividend.
Growth
Fresnillo plc remains committed to disciplined and sustainable profitability. Our high quality growth pipeline allows us to
focus on projects with the potential to be developed into world class low-cost mines. During the first half, construction of
the leaching plant at our San Julián mine was completed on time and on budget. As previously reported, we expect to
re-start feeding ore to the mill in the coming days, post a minor issue with the lubrication system at the mill. Phase 2, the
flotation plant, remains on track for commissioning in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As a result of the improved market conditions in the first half of 2016 and the Group's solid financial position, the Board
approved the resumption of the Pyrites plant project. The Centauro Extension project was also approved during the
period, encompassing a second line at the Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura. We expect the commissioning of both
projects in 2018.
In exploration, interesting drill results were obtained at San Julián, Guanajuato and Fresnillo, whilst channel sampling
and mapping of cross-cuts at the Centauro Deep and Orisyvo advanced exploration projects continued.
We continue to expect full year 2016 capital expenditure and total exploration investment of around US$600 million and
US$135-140 million respectively, as spend will be weighted towards the second half of 2016.
Outlook
Our proven strategy remains consistent: we invest through the cycle, balancing growth with returns. Our operating mines
provide a solid platform for growth, which we are set to deliver through our development projects and our investment in
exploration to extend our growth pipeline. This is achieved within the context of a maturing sustainability framework.
Precious metals prices have seen a strong recovery since the start of the year, particularly post the UK referendum on
departing the European Union. However, the sustainability of any rally in gold and silver prices will always remain
uncertain. We therefore maintain our Contingency Plan which was put in place at the beginning of the year. To that end,
growth projects will continue to be evaluated against a range of metrics before final investment decisions are made:
operational circumstances, technical justification, the pricing backdrop, and our financial position.
Our high quality, low cost assets, and significant quality growth pipeline, combined with our balance sheet strength,
leave us well placed to perform throughout the cycle.
We remain on track to meet our 2018 silver production target of 65 million ounces, having already surpassed our 2018
gold target of 750 thousand ounces.

First half 2016 silver production (including Silverstream) increased 6.1% on 1H15, mainly as a result of: i) the higher ore
grades at Fresnillo as a result of regained access to the higher ore grade areas of the San Carlos and San Alberto veins;
ii) higher silver ore grades at the Rosario and Las Casas areas of Ciénega; and iii) increased ore throughput at Saucito.
First half 2016 gold production increased 23.0% on 1H15, due to higher volumes of ore processed and higher speeds of
recovery at Herradura, as well as higher speeds of recovery at Noche Buena. These factors were partially offset by the
lower ore grade at Ciénega due to the depletion of some high grade stopes, lower ore grades at the Rosario and Las
Casas areas and increased dilution due to the narrowing of some veins.
First half by-product lead production increased 17.7% on 1H15 mainly as a result of higher ore grades at Fresnillo and
Ciénega and increased ore throughput at Saucito.
First half by-product zinc production increased 24.2% on 1H15 as a result of higher ore grades at Fresnillo and Ciénega
and increased volumes processed and recovery rates at Saucito.
As a result of our first half results and our confidence in second half performance, we have raised our full year gold
guidance to 850-870 koz from 775-790 koz. We remain on track to meet our 2016 silver production guidance of 49-51
moz (including Silverstream).

First half silver production increased 5.8% on 1H15 as a result of higher ore grades (up 6.6%) due to the regained
access to higher grade areas at the San Carlos and San Alberto veins. This more than offset the lower ore processed
due to a reduction in the availability of mining equipment caused by maintenance delays during the second quarter, and
preparation of additional production stopes. Steps have been taken to solve these problems, and equipment availability
is back to normal rates.
The turnaround plan at Fresnillo continues to progress, and the medium term trend remains positive, despite the
expected short term fluctuations as we consolidate the improvements already made. We expect full year silver
production at this mine to show an increase of around 6% compared to 2015.
In the second half of 2016 we expect an average silver ore grade of around 235 g/t.
First half by-product gold and lead production increased 36.7% and 36.2% respectively on 1H15 as a result of a higher
ore grades.
First half by-product zinc production increased 33.5% on 1H15 due to a higher ore grade and recovery rate.

First half silver production increased slightly on 1H15 due to higher ore throughput as a result of increased ore
processed following the ramp up of Saucito II which started operations in December 2014, increased ore throughput
from the West and Central Jarillas areas, and the capacity increase achieved with the installation of vibrating screens.
These factors more than compensated for the expected lower ore grade due to the unusually high ore grades at the
Jarillas vein in 1Q15.
In the second half of 2016 we expect an average silver ore grade of around 295 g/t.
First half by-product gold production decreased 6.4% on 1H15 as a result of a lower ore grade and recovery rate, partly
offset by increased ore processed.
First half by-product lead production increased 3.8% on 1H15 mainly as a result of increased ore processed.
First half by-product zinc production increased 14.4% on 1H15 as a result of a higher recovery rate and increased ore
processed.

First half gold production decreased 19.3% on 1H15 as a result of: i) a lower ore grade resulting from the depletion of
higher gold ore grade veins at Ciénega and lower grades at the Rosario and Las Casas areas; ii) increased dilution
resulting from the narrower veins at the East and West areas; and iii) lower volume of ore processed due to the
extraction of harder mineral from the Rosario, Las Casas and Carmen areas.
In the second half of 2016 we expect an average gold ore grade of around 1.9 g/t.
First half silver production increased 16.9% on 1H15 as a result of the high silver grade development ore from the
Rosario and Las Casas areas.
In the second half of 2016 we expect an average silver ore grade of around 135 g/t.
First half by-product lead production increased 19.5% on 1H15 as a result of a higher ore grade and to a lesser extent, a
higher recovery rate.
First half by-product zinc production increased 29.7% on 1H15 due to a higher ore grade.

First half gold production increased 32.2% on 1H15 due to a higher overall speed of recovery and increased ore
processed following the commissioning of the second Merrill Crowe plant in 4Q15. The latter allowed the elimination of
the bottleneck in processing volumes of rich solution coming from the leaching pads and the dynamic leaching plant
(DLP), and enabled us to further reduce inventories at the pads to 120koz. These factors more than compensated for the
expected lower ore grade as material is deposited from higher banks in line with the mine plan and to control haulage
costs.
In the second half of 2016 we expect an average gold ore grade of around 0.75 g/t.

First half gold production increased 41.4% on 1H15 due to a higher speed of recovery as a result of the new mineral
layers at the leaching pads and higher ore grade due to richer banks being processed, which more than compensated
for the lower ore deposited.
In the second half of 2016 we expect an average gold ore grade of around 0.49 g/t.
Growth Projects
As a result of the recovery in precious metals prices in the first half of 2016 and the Group's solid financial position, the
Board approved resumption of the Pyrites project, expected to increase silver and gold recovery rates by processing
tailings, both historical and ongoing, from the Fresnillo and Saucito mines. The Board also approved the Centauro
Extension project during the first half, encompassing the construction of the second line of the Dynamic Leaching Plant
at Herradura. Investment in these projects was considered within the Group's financial planning, therefore we continue
to expect capital expenditure for the full year 2016 to be in the region of US$600 million.  Below we provide an update
on each of our growth projects.
San Julián
The construction of phase 1 at the San Julián project has been completed on time and on budget. However, as
previously reported, after a few days of feeding mineral to the mill a minor technical failure occurred resulting in a
malfunctioning of the lubrication system of the mill.
The milling facility issue has been addressed, and the Group expects production to re-start in the coming days. Mine
preparation and development continued whilst this issue was being addressed, allowing us to stockpile material for
future processing.
Construction of the flotation plant (phase 2) continued as planned during the first half, and we continue to expect
commissioning in 4Q16.
This US$515 million silver-gold project has an expected average production of 10.3 million ounces of silver and 44,000
ounces of gold per year once at full capacity.
Pyrites Plant at the Saucito mine
During the first half, detailed engineering works for this project continued, environmental permits were obtained,
preparation of the site commenced, and we began to place orders for major equipment.
This US$155 million project is expected to increase silver and gold recovery rates by processing tailings, both historical
and ongoing, from the Fresnillo and Saucito mines. The Pyrites plant is expected to be concluded in 2018 and average
annual production is estimated at 3.5 million ounces of silver and 13,000 ounces of gold at full capacity.
Centauro extension (previously Mega Centauro)
This project is the natural evolution of the main Centauro pit at Herradura, encompassing the expansion of the pit as well
as the construction of a second line at the dynamic leaching plant (DLP) which will enable more efficient processing of
the sulphides which occur deeper in the pit.
Board approval was granted in April, and the project is now at the basic engineering stage, with initial equipment orders
placed and preparation of the land in progress.
The pre-operative capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$110 million, with commissioning expected in
2018. Considering the natural expansion of the Centauro pit, average annual gold production at the Herradura mine is
expected to be approximately 390 koz.
Below we provide an update on other projects which are expected to contribute to our medium and long term growth, but
have not yet been approved by the Board and are subject to ongoing internal review.
Optimisation projects
Fresnillo optimisation project
During the first half of 2016 we analysed alternative options for carrying out the expansion works without interrupting
normal operations at the beneficiation plant. We continued to work on the optimal equipment sizing to provide the plant
with sufficient capacity to process the higher lead and zinc grades expected in the future. The final stage in this
optimisation project would be the installation of vibrating screens to increase the milling capacity to 9,000 tonnes per
day. Capital expenditure for this project is estimated at US$30 million and the expansion is expected to result in an
additional annual average production of 3 million ounces of silver upon commissioning, expected in 2018.
Ciénega optimisation project
Following the positive results of our extensive exploration campaign at the Cebollitas cluster, alternative options
continue to be evaluated for the Ciénega optimisation project.
This US$55 million project is currently expected to commence production in 2019, with average annual production
estimated at an additional 15 thousand gold ounces and 1.3 million silver ounces.
Advanced exploration projects
Juanicipio
During the first half, construction of the ramp continued and further progress was made in the mine design and in
obtaining environmental permits. A feasibility study is expected to be presented for Board approval at the end of this
year. The US$305 million joint venture with MAG Silver Corp. (Fresnillo plc: 56%) is expected to be commissioned in
2018, and to produce an annual average of 10 million ounces of silver and 30 thousand ounces of gold. As previously
mentioned, this project will be developed on a stand-alone basis.
Centauro Deep
During the first half, further geological modelling was carried out and works on a pilot stope continued, in order to further
refine the model and more accurately determine the ore bodies. This will enable us to define the optimal mining method:
a bulk mining method with lower grades or a more selective mining method extracting only the higher gold grade
material. This US$130 million project is expected to commence production in 2020, and to produce an annual average
of 65 thousand ounces of gold, if the selective mining method is ultimately chosen.
Orisyvo
During the first half, we continued our evaluation of the economic viability of this project. This US$350 million project is
currently expected to commence production in 2021.
Exploration
In the first half of 2016, US$52.1 million of exploration expenses were recorded in the income statement, down 30.9%
over the first half of 2015 resulting from a slower pace of drilling. US$7.7 million were capitalised.
During the first half exploration drilling totalled 265 km, across the Fresnillo, Herradura, Guanajuato, San Julián,
Guazapares, Pilarica, and Huacravilca Districts, and 12km at other early stage prospects. Interesting drill intersections
with gold-silver values were obtained at San Julián, Guanajuato and Fresnillo; resources are expected to increase at
these projects in the year end estimates.
Targets were selected and prioritised around each of our mining operations and 30 surface rigs are presently carrying
out drilling.  Channel sampling and mapping of cross-cuts at the Centauro Deep and Orisyvo advanced exploration
projects continued in the period and updated resource models will be completed by year end.  Additional surface land
was acquired in key areas and additional negotiators have been assigned to intensify this process. Fresnillo Plc has six
teams of geologists prospecting and evaluating submittals in the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango and Jalisco in
Mexico, as well as Central Peru and Northern Chile. New targets have been identified and are either in negotiation or in
the permitting stage for parametric drilling.
Exploration spend is expected to increase in the second half, and we continue to expect total risk capital invested in
exploration for the full year 2016 of around US$135-140 million, compared to the US$151 million spent in 2015.
Reserves and resources estimates will be updated and audited by SRK at year end.
Health and safety, human resources, environment and community relations
Health
We strive to keep our people healthy and prevent occupational diseases. Our approach aims to pre-emptively identify
and manage the health risks to which our workforce is exposed. Fresnillo, Saucito and Penmont hold the "Healthy
Company" certification, an award from the Mexican health authorities for companies implementing best practices in
health and safety. We have no new cases of occupational diseases to report for the first half of 2016. Although the
frequency of accidents decreased, there was an increase in their average severity and duration of recovery. The
accident severity rate (Lost work days per 1,000,000 hours worked) increased from 132 in 2015 to 264 for the first half of
2016. The recovery duration rate (Lost work days / number of lost-time injuries + fatalities) increased from 43 in 2015 to
57 for the first half of 2016.
Preventive care and the promotion of healthier lifestyles can limit certain chronic diseases and enhance overall wellness
and fitness for work. Our Healthy Lifestyles programme supports healthy food habits and the prevention and control of
obesity-related diseases. Our health week was jointly organised with the National University Foundation, providing free
healthcare to the neighbouring communities of our Penmont, Fresnillo and Saucito operations.
Safety
We seek to instill a safety culture where our workers and contractors have the knowledge, competence and desire to
work safely. We regret two fatal injuries having occurred during the first half of 2016: one from a rock fall at Ciénega, and
a second caused by a mining explosive loader truck at San Julián. In the first half of 2016, our Total Recordable Injury
Frequency Rate (TRIFR) was 12.55 injuries per 1,000,000 hours (20.98 in 2015) and the Lost Time Injury Frequency
Rate (LTIFR) was 4.64 injuries per 1,000,000 hours (5.87 in 2015).
We launched the "Safety Folder", an initiative that reinforces controls, follow-up and the commitment of supervisors at
every level of the Company. We organised the first safety festival to engage our people and community in the Fresnillo
district, whilst as part of the Health and Safety Information system implementation, we reviewed and re-engineered our
Business Processes, identifying the software requirements necessary to support our enhanced processes.
Environment
Minimising the impact of our activities and being transparent and accountable regarding our environmental footprint are
key commitments. Our environmental management system ensures effective compliance with regulations. Fresnillo,
Ciénega and Penmont are certified in ISO 14,001, whilst Saucito has accomplished 90% of the requirements to obtain
the ISO 14,001 and clean industry certifications. In the Penmont district, the Herradura mine advanced to the second
level in the Clean Industry certification and the Noche Buena mine obtained the "Cyanide Code" certification. In the
reporting period we consumed 23.6 GWh of wind energy as part of our energy portfolio. We disclosed our environmental
performance in the water and climate change programmes of the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure
Project), and our Environment Information System has been adapted to match our business processes and operating
indicators.
Community Relations
Our communities are strategic partners. Having their trust requires effectively engaging them and being accountable for
our impacts, and we recognise that building trust is the only way to obtain and preserve our social licence to operate. As
part of our commitment we launched the "Silver Saves Lives (SSL)" initiative in the communities of San Julián and
Ciénega. SSL aims to raise awareness and donate rainwater collection systems to public schools. Moreover, the
community relations and land acquisition teams have enhanced collaboration in response to rising land access
challenges. The outcomes of reputation studies at all of our operations and at San Julián have been used to better
assess social risks and opportunities. During the first half of 2016, we organised nearly 200 activities with the
communities across our operations and exploration projects, and supported over 770 requests for contributions from the
communities.
People
We seek to attract, develop and retain the best people, and engage them over the long-term. In the first half of 2016,
Fresnillo plc's workforce totaled 4,229 employees (4,191 in 2015) and 5,902 contractors (3,840 in 2015). Total and
voluntary turnover rates are respectively 10.4% (9.21% in 2015) and 6.2% (5.39% in 2015). The percentage of women
and women executives are respectively at 8.49% (8.33% in 2015) and 3.42% (3.45% in 2015). In 2015, we launched a
programme to assess leadership potential and soft skill competencies (i.e. emotional intelligence) based on Hogan
tests. Test takers can check their evaluation and view suggestions to improve their competencies on our internal
website. In addition, we implemented new courses in our online campus to develop key competences identified in the
annual performance evaluations. Fresnillo plc is recognised as a Great Place to Work in Mexico, currently ranking 17th
among companies with more than 5,000 employees.
Maturity of the Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations System
We continue to make progress on the implementation of the Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations
(HSECR) System. We have a certified integrated ISO 14,001 - OHSAS 18,001 Management System for Health, Safety
and Environment at our Fresnillo, Ciénega and Penmont operations. As at December 2015 the HSECR System had an
overall maturity level of 92.3%. We are on track to meet our 100% maturity target by the year end, following the
introduction of best practices. The next independent assessment will be conducted in August by PWC.
During the first half of 2016 we engaged a number of NGO's and researched target setting approaches consistent with
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) recognised Fresnillo
plc's disclosure efforts: currently Fresnillo ranks 4th in Mexico and 11th in Hispanic America, based on CDP's disclosure
scores.

Fresnillo plc's financial results are highly dependent on operational performance, asset quality, skilled personnel and
management's execution capabilities. However, there are a number of macroeconomic variables affecting the financial
results which are beyond the Group's control. A description of these variables is provided below.
Precious metal prices
Gold and silver prices remained at low levels at the beginning of 2016 following the strengthening of the US dollar, an
interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve (FED) at the end of 2015 and the decline in oil prices. However,
precious metals prices gradually recovered due to expectations that the FED would not continue to increase rates as
fast as initially expected and increasing political and economic uncertainty in the US and the European Union. Prices
then increased significantly following the announcement that the United Kingdom had voted to leave the European
Union.  The net effect was that prices in the first half of 2016 remained at similar levels to those observed in the first half
2015, with the average realised gold price increasing 3.3% to US$1,245.6 per ounce and the average realised silver
price remaining flat at US$16.58 per ounce (-0.2%).
Average realised lead and zinc prices decreased by 7.7% and 11.0% respectively when compared to the first half of
2015.
Hedging
In the second half of 2014, Fresnillo plc initiated a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment
made in the Penmont acquisition. The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 oz of gold with
monthly maturities until December 2019.

Foreign exchange rates
The average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate devalued by 19.3% from $15.12 per US dollar in the first half
of 2015 to $18.04 per US dollar in the first half of 2016. This devaluation resulted in a favourable effect estimated at
US$22.2 million on the Group's production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately two thirds of
total costs) were lower when converted to US dollars.
The Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 30 June 2016 was $18.91 per US dollar, compared to the exchange
rate at 31 December 2015 of $17.21 per US dollar. The 9.9% spot devaluation had an adverse effect on the net
monetary peso asset position, which contributed to an US$8.6 million foreign exchange loss recognised in the income
statement.
Cost Inflation
In the first half of 2016, there was a net decrease in the weighted average input cost half on half, of 9.3% including the
favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate.
Labour
In the first half of 2016, unionised personnel received a 5.0% increase in wages in Mexican pesos and administrative
employees at the mines received a 4.5% increase. Taking into consideration the 19.3% devaluation of the Mexican peso
against the US dollar, personnel costs showed a 10.7% deflation in US dollar terms.

Weighted average of all operating materials-6.9%
Unit prices of the majority of key operating materials decreased in US dollars mainly due to the devaluation of the
Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate, resulting in a net weighted average decrease of 6.9%. However, unit prices
excluding the favourable effect of the devaluation remained stable half on half.
Electricity
The weighted average cost of electricity in US dollars decreased 28.6% from US$7.7 cents per kw in the first six months
of 2015 to US$5.5 cents per kw in the same period of 2016, reflecting the positive effect of the devaluation of the
Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate, and to a lesser extent, the lower average generating cost following the decrease
in fuel prices.
Diesel
The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars for the first six months of 2016 decreased by 19.6% to US$62.4 cents
per litre from US$77.6 cents per litre in the first half of 2015.
Contractors
Contractor costs are an important component of the Group's total costs denominated in Mexican pesos and include costs
incurred by contractors relating to operating materials, equipment and labour. In the first half of 2016, increases granted
to contractors in Mexican pesos, whose agreements were due for review during the period, ranged from 2.0% to 12.5%,
which represented an aggregate cost inflation of 4.3% for such contractors. However, these increases converted to
decreases (equivalent to -14.5% to -5.7%) when converted into US dollars, reflecting the 19.3% devaluation of the
average Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate. The weighted average decrease in contractor costs in US dollars was
3.7% including those who were not subject to review.
Maintenance
Unit prices of spare parts to provide maintenance decreased by approximately 6.3% in US dollars in the first half of
2016.
Others
Other cost line items included a 12.8% decrease in freight due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar
exchange rate, a 2.0% decline in insurance premium per unit and an average deflation of 8.2% for the remaining
components over the first half of 2015.
Treatment and Refining charges
The 2016 treatment and refining charges (TRCs) per tonne and per ounce are being negotiated with Met-Mex in
accordance with international benchmarks and will apply retrospectively from January 2016. Treatment and Refining
Charges in these Interim Financial Statements were assumed to be the same as those which were negotiated for the full
year 2015, a consistent approach taken to that in the comparative period.
Treatment charges for lead and refining charges per ounce of silver for the first half of 2016 decreased 3.5% and 1.9%
respectively. Treatment charges for zinc remained flat half on half.

factors driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and realised prices
Gold contribution to adjusted revenues continued to increase from 51% in the first half of 2015 to 56% in the first half of
2016, reflecting the increased volumes produced at the Herradura District and the change in relative prices. Despite the
increase in silver ounces produced at the Fresnillo District and Ciénega, silver contribution decreased from 40% in the
first half of 2015 to 36% in the same period of 2016. By-product lead and zinc sales represented the remaining 8% of the
Group's adjusted revenues.
Saucito continued to outperform following the ramp-up of Saucito II and the plant optimisation, thus remaining the main
contributor to silver adjusted revenues with a 50.5% share in the first half of 2016. Fresnillo's contribution to silver
adjusted revenues remained broadly unchanged at 36.9% in the first half of 2016, whilst Ciénega's contribution
increased to 11.1% from 8.9% in the first half of 2015, reflecting the increased silver production at San Ramón.
In terms of gold adjusted revenues, Herradura's contribution increased to 56.3%, reflecting the increase in gold
production and the reduction of inventories at the leaching pads.  Similarly, Noche Buena's contribution increased to
22.8% due to increased gold ounces produced resulting from higher speeds of recovery. However, Ciénega and
Saucito's contribution to gold adjusted revenues decreased to 8.0% and 8.7% respectively in the first six months of
2016.
The contribution by metal and by mine to the adjusted revenues is expected to change further over future periods as new
projects are incorporated into the Group's operations and as precious metal prices fluctuate.

4 Adjusted production cost is calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and the effects of exchange rate hedging.
Cost of sales of US$492.5 million increased by 2.9% over the first half 2015 as a result of the following combination of
factors:
· Adjusted production costs of US$299.7 million decreased 5.2% over the first half of 2015. The US$16.5 million
decrease was largely explained by the positive effect of the 19.3% devaluation of the average Mexican peso/US dollar
spot exchange rate estimated at US$22.2 million. In addition, lower ore throughput at Ciénega, Fresnillo and Noche
Buena decreased production costs by an estimated 2.4 million. This was partly offset by: i) additional production costs
related to the increased ore throughput at Herradura and Saucito estimated at US$13.3 million; and ii) an estimated
US$2.1 million increase in development and maintenance costs, mainly at the Fresnillo, Saucito and Ciénega mines. In
addition, each production cost component was affected by the below cost inflation/deflation (excluding the benefit of the
devaluation):
−      Personnel costs, excluding profit sharing, increased by US$2.1 million as a result of the 5.0% increase in wages in
Mexican pesos
−      Contractor costs rose by US$2.0 million due to the contract adjustments recorded during the first half of the year; up
2.0%-12.5% in Mexican pesos
−      Cost of energy decreased by US$6.4 million due to lower unit prices of electricity and diesel
−      Cost of operating materials decreased by US$3.0 million
−      Cost of maintenance decreased by US$2.0 million
· Depreciation increased by US$5.6 million mainly as a result of: i) a higher depletion factor at Herradura and Saucito
due to the higher production volumes; ii) increased depreciation at Herradura following the commissioning of the second
Merrill Crowe plant; and iii) additional mining works depreciated mainly at the Fresnillo mine.
· The variation in change in work in progress was an adverse effect of US$51.0 million half on half. Change in work in
progress resulted in a change of US$37.6 million in the first half of 2016. This was explained by the decrease in
inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura following the increased ore throughput and commissioning of the second
Merrill Crowe plant in 4Q15, which allowed the elimination of the bottleneck in processing volumes of rich solution
coming from the leaching pads and the dynamic leaching plant, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in inventories on the
leaching pads at Noche Buena. In contrast, change in work in progress resulted in a benefit of US$13.4 million in the
first half of 2015 as a result of the increase in inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura as part of the process to
normalise production at this mine.
· Profit sharing increased by US$4.0 million due to the higher profits generated.
· Mexican peso/US dollar hedging in production costs: In 2015, the Group entered into a combination of put and call
options structured as zero cost (collars) to hedge US$152.0 million of costs and expenses denominated in Mexican
pesos with average floor and cap exchange rates of $14.54 and $18.06 per US dollar respectively, resulting in a US$2.6
million loss recorded in the income statement. The total outstanding position using collar structures as of 30 June 2016
was US$46.0 million with monthly maturity dates throughout July and August 2016 with average floor and cap exchange
rates of $16.15 and $18.93 per US dollar respectively. These instruments guarantee a minimum exchange rate should
the market rate fall below the floor. Between the floor and cap exchange rates the Group sells US dollars at the market
rate, and when the Mexican peso per US dollar exchange rate goes above the cap rate, the Company is obliged to sell
US dollars at the contract rate. The Company decided that it will no longer be continuing with this programme, so has
not entered into further hedging contracts, but is maintaining the outstanding position to maturity.
· Reversal of the provision (US$14.5 million) recorded in December 2015 related to the decrease in the gold price below
the inventory carrying cost at Soledad-Dipolos as a result of the stronger gold price.
Cost per tonne and cash cost per ounce
Cost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine.
This indicator is calculated as total production costs, plus ordinary mining rights less depreciation, profit sharing and
exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total tonnage processed.

The 19.3% devaluation of the average Mexican peso against the US dollar and the lower unit prices of electricity
(28.6%) and diesel (19.6%) benefitted cost per tonne across the Group. These positive effects were mitigated by the
5.0% increase in wages in Mexican pesos for unionised workers and the increase in contractor fees. Factors affecting
cost per tonne at each mine are described below:
Fresnillo
Cost per tonne milled decreased by 9.8% over the first half of 2015 mainly due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso
and the lower cost of energy, together with lower maintenance costs resulting from the maintenance delays experienced
in the second quarter of 2016; and a decrease in the cost of operating materials mainly due to lower consumption of
steel balls and liners for the mill. This was partly offset by higher contractor costs resulting from the increased number of
contractors hired to accelerate development; and higher personnel costs due to increased headcount.
Saucito
Cost per tonne decreased by 5.4% mainly as a result the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the lower cost of energy,
together with lower maintenance costs and a lower unit price of operating materials. This was partly offset by increased
development recorded as costs in the first half 2016 income statement, whereas in 2015 a greater portion was
capitalised; and a larger number of contractors and personnel to increase development rates and volumes of ore hauled.
Ciénega
Cost per tonne milled decreased 17.2% mainly as a result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the lower cost of
energy, together lower consumption of electricity and sodium cyanide.  These positive effects were partly offset by an
increased number of contractors.
Herradura
Cost per tonne decreased 12.6% mainly due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the lower cost of diesel,
together with the decline in unit costs of operating materials, lower maintenance costs and the additional efficiencies
achieved from the increased ore throughput.
Noche Buena
Cost per tonne decreased by 4.5% as a result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the lower cost of diesel,
together with the decrease in unit costs of operating materials and maintenance of haulage trucks. This was partly offset
by the increased consumption of diesel and sodium cyanide; and increased contractor costs due to higher volumes
hauled.

5 Cash cost per ounce is calculated as total cash cost (cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges and mining rights less depreciation) less
revenues from by-products divided by the silver or gold ounces sold.
Fresnillo: US$3.56/oz (1H16) vs US$5.75/oz (1H15), (-US$2.19/oz; -38.1%)
The decrease in cash cost per ounce was primarily driven by higher by-product credits (gold, zinc and lead), lower cost
per tonne and higher silver ore grades. This was partly offset by higher treatment and refining charges resulting from the
increased volumes of lead and zinc concentrates produced.
Saucito: US$0.83/oz (1H16) vs US0.64/oz (1H15), (+US$0.19/oz; +31.2%)
Cash cost per silver ounce increased due to the expected lower silver ore grade and, to a lesser extent, lower by-product
credits and higher profit sharing. These negative factors were mitigated by the lower cost per tonne and lower treatment
and refining charges.
Ciénega: -US$121.68/oz (1H16) vs US$296.99/oz (1H15), (-US$418.67/oz; N/A)
The decrease in cash cost was primarily explained by higher by-product credits per gold ounce and lower cost per
tonne. This was partly offset by the lower gold ore grade, higher treatment and refining charges resulting from the
increased volumes of lead and zinc concentrate produced.
Herradura: US$485.23/oz (1H16) vs US$490.18/oz (1H15), (-US$4.95/oz; -1.0%)
Cash cost per gold ounce decreased mainly as a result of lower cost per tonne, offset by the expected lower gold ore
grade and higher profit sharing.
Noche Buena: US$778.38/oz (1H16) vs US$897.91/oz (1H15), (-US$119.53/oz; -13.3%)
The decrease in cash cost was driven by the reversal of the write down of gold inventories on the leaching pads
following the recovery of the gold price; a higher gold ore grade; and lower cost per tonne.

All-in sustaining costs are calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs,
community costs related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining
capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
The changes in all-in sustaining costs at each mine are explained below:
Fresnillo: All-in sustaining cost decreased due to a lower cash cost, a decrease in capitalised mine development works
and lower community and administrative costs.
Saucito: All-in sustaining cost declined due to lower capital expenditure.
Ciénega: The decrease in all-in sustaining cost was mainly driven by the decrease in cash cost.
Herradura: All-in sustaining cost decreased mainly due to the lower cost per tonne.
Noche Buena: The decrease in all-in sustaining cost was due to a decrease in capital expenditures and lower cash cost.
All-in sustaining costs are affected by ad hoc expenses recorded in each particular year, and therefore may significantly
vary year on year.
Gross profit
Total gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, increased by 44.1% to US$394.4 million in the first half of 2016.
The US$120.8 million increase resulted from: i) the positive effect of the increased volumes processed at Herradura
estimated at US$57.2 million; ii) the US$22.2 million favourable effect of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate
devaluation; iii) the US$19.2 million estimated positive effect of the increased gold ounces produced at Noche Buena;
iv) the favourable impact of the higher ore grades at the Fresnillo mine estimated at US$18.9 million; v) the US$15.5
million estimated benefit of the increase in gold price; vi) the reversal of the write down of inventories at Soledad-Dipolos
of US$14.5 million; vii) the US$6.9 million positive effect of hedging;  viii) the cost deflation estimated at US$6.2 million;
and ix) other favourable impacts estimated at US$0.9 million.
These factors were partly offset by: i) the expected lower ore grades at Herradura and Saucito, which had an estimated
adverse impact of US$19.4 million and US$8.1 million respectively;  ii) the US$7.7 million negative effect of the lower
lead and zinc prices; and iii) the increase in depreciation of US$5.6 million.
On a per mine basis, the increased gold production at Herradura resulted in a 49.4% increase in gross profit to
US$139.8 million, which represented 35.6% of the Group's consolidated gross profit, excluding hedging effects. Saucito
was the second most important contributor, generating US$121.6 million or 31.0% of the Group's gross profit, despite the
4.4% decrease over the first half of 2015. Fresnillo's gross profit rose 32.9%, reflecting the progress made in the
turnaround plan at this mine. However, its contribution to the consolidated gross profit remained relatively stable at 17%
in the first half of 2016. The increased revenues and lower costs at Noche Buena resulted in an increase in gross profit
to US$28.4 million, increasing this mine's contribution to the Group's gross profit from 0.4% in the first half of 2015 to
7.2% in the same period of 2016. Similarly, gross profit at Ciénega doubled during the first six months of 2016,
contributing 5.5% of the consolidated gross profit.

Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses decreased from US$33.4 million to US$26.5 million in the first half of 2016. The 20.9%
decrease was explained by a decrease in non-recurring engineering and construction services provided by Peñoles
relating to new projects, lower cost of services provided by third parties and the positive effect of the devaluation of the
Mexican peso against the US dollar in administrative expenses denominated in pesos.

result of a slower pace of drilling. An additional US$7.7 million was capitalised mainly related to exploration expenses at
Juanicipio project. However, Risk Capital Invested in Exploration is expected to increase in the second half of 2016
reaching a total in the range of US$135- US$140 million for the full year.

A key indicator of the Group's financial performance is EBITDA, which is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation,
less administrative, selling and exploration expenses. This indicator increased by 49.1% to US$474.0 million in the first
half of 2016 as a result of the higher gross profit and lower administrative and exploration expenses. Likewise, the
EBITDA margin increased from 42.3% in the first half of 2015 to 53.4% in the same period of 2016.
Silverstream revaluation effects
The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. In the first half of
2016, the revaluation of the Silverstream contract generated an US$88.2 million non-cash gain mainly as a result of the
higher forward price of silver, the decrease of the reference discount rate (LIBOR), and to a lesser extent, the impact of
the US dollar exchange rate against the Mexican peso. In addition, a US$21.7 million non-cash gain was generated by
the unwinding of the discount and the difference between payments received during the six months ended 30 June 2016
and estimated payments in the valuation model at 31 December 2015. The total effect recorded in the first six months of
2016 was US$109.9 million, which compared favourably against the US$1.8 million non-cash gain registered in the
same period of 2015.
The cumulative non-cash revaluation gains that have been recognised in the income statement since 2008 increased to
US$660.2 million in total; whilst cumulative cash received or receivable at the end of the first half 2016 from the
Silverstream contract totalled US$522.1 million.
It is expected that the Group will record further unrealised gains or losses in the income statement in accordance with
the cyclical behaviour of the silver price or changes in the assumptions used when valuing this contract. Further
information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the Balance Sheet section below and in notes 10 and 18 to
the Interim Financial Statements.
Finance costs and income
Finance costs decreased from US$19.8 million in the first half of 2015 to US$13.9 million in the same period of 2016
mainly due to an increase in the interest on the US$800 million principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes, that has been
capitalised as part of the San Julián project.
In addition, a US$136.6 million non-cash finance loss was generated by the mark-to-market time value of the
outstanding gold hedging programme put in place to protect the investment made in the acquisition of the 44% stake of
Newmont in Penmont. This compared negatively to the US$16.9 million non-cash finance gain generated in the first half
of 2015.
Foreign exchange
A foreign exchange loss of US$8.6 million was recorded in the income statement as a result of the realised transactions
in the period and the adverse effect of the 9.9% spot devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar in the six
months ended 30 June 2016 on the value of peso-denominated net monetary assets. This represented a 44.7%
decrease from the US$15.6 million foreign exchange loss recognised in the first half of 2015.
Taxation
Income tax expense increased by 51.6% to US$73.7 million as a result of the increase in profit generated in the first half
2016. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 28.9% which was in line with the 30% statutory tax
rate. Including the effect of the special mining rights, the effective tax rate was 35.1%. The effective tax rate is calculated
using forecasts of gold and silver prices; and foreign exchange rates for the second half of 2016.
Profit for the period
Profit for the period was US$165.6 million, which represented a 116.9% increase half on half as a result of the factors
discussed above.
Excluding the effects of the Silverstream valuation, profit for the period increased 18.0% to US$88.7 million in the first six
months of 2016.

*As disclosed in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2016 totalled US$581.2
million and short-term investments held in fixed-term bank deposits amounted to US$120.0 million. Cash and cash
equivalents at 30 June 2015 accounted for US$255.7 million and short-term investments amounted to US$220.0 million.
In the first half of 2016, cash generated by operations before changes in working capital totalled US$475.2 million, a
50.9% increase due to higher profits generated. In addition, working capital decreased by US$0.5 million as a result of
the net impact of the following factors:
·     A US$10.7 million increase in trade and other receivables which resulted mainly from an increase in the volume of
lead and zinc concentrates and dore sold to Met-Mex
·     A US$4.6 million decrease in ore inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura, and to a lesser extent, at Noche
Buena
·     A US$1.4 million decrease in prepayments and other assets
·     An increase in trade and other payables of US$5.2 million
Taxes and employee profit sharing paid of US$67.9 million increased by 102.7% over the first half 2015 due to higher
profits generated.
As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities for the first half of 2016 increased by 54.9% to
US$407.9 million.
The Group also received proceeds of US$20.1 million from the Silverstream Contract.
The Group purchased property plant and equipment for a total of US$198.8 million, a 13.2% decrease compared to the
first half of 2015. However, the Group expects to increase capital expenditures in the second half of the year, and
continues to anticipate a total spend of around US$600 million for the full year. Capital expenditures for the first six
months of 2016 are further described below:

*In addition to purchases of property, plant and equipment above, additions to property, plant and equipment on the
balance sheet include  capitalised depreciation (US$7.1 million).
Dividends paid to shareholders in the first half 2016 totalled US$24.8 million as a result of the final dividend of 3.35 US
cents per share paid in May 2016. Other uses of funds included the US$9.3 million net interest paid in the first half of
2016.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a net increase of US$201.8 million in cash, cash
equivalents and short term funds, which combined with the US$500.1 million balance at the beginning of the year and
the effect of the exchange rate (-US$0.7 million), resulted in cash, cash equivalents and short term funds of US$701.2
million as at 30 June 2016.
Balance Sheet
Fresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position with short term funds increasing to US$701.2 million as of
30 June 2016 from US$500.1 million at the beginning of the year. This represented a 47.4% increase compared to the
short term funds of US$475.7 million as of 30 June 2015, reflecting the ability of our mines to generate solid cashflow,
and, to a lesser extent, the higher average realised gold price.
Trade and other receivables (including income tax recoverable) decreased from US$305.7 million as of 31 December
2015 to US$278.4 million as at 30 June 2016 mainly due a decrease in recoverable taxes in the first half of 2016. This
was partly offset by higher volumes sold, which increased accounts receivables.
Inventories slightly decreased (1.5%) over the 2015 year-end figure to US$295.9 million, mainly as a result of the
decrease in gold inventories on the leaching pads of Herradura and Noche Buena This was partly offset by the reversal
of the write downs of inventories at Soledad-Dipolos.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$384.8 million at the beginning of the year to US$471.6
million as of 30 June 2016 reflects proceeds of US$23.0 million, (US$17.3 million in cash generated in respect of the
period and US$5.7 million receivable) and the revaluation effects of US$109.9 million in the Group's income statement.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment remained steady at US$2,157.6 million at 30 June 2016
(US$2,138.6 at 31 December 2015).
Fresnillo plc's total equity for the first half of 2016 was US$2,529.4 million, an increase of 6.5% when compared to the
figure at the beginning of the year, which reflected retained earnings from 2015.
Going concern
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position
are set out above in the Operational Review, with further detail in the Annual Report 2015. The financial position of the
Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review. In addition, the Group's objectives,
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; and its exposures to credit risk
and liquidity risk were set out in the Annual Report 2015. Details of its financial instruments and hedging activities as at
30 June 2016 are set out in note 18 to the interim report.
In making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered
the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2017 as at July 2016. In
addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with silver and gold prices reduced below current
expectations, whilst maintaining current budgeted expenditure, which resulted in our current cash balances reducing
over time to a small but adequate margin of liquidity towards the end of 2017.
The Directors have agreed with management's proposal to maintain the 'Contingency Plan' established at the beginning
of the year which has reduced or deferred capital and/or exploration expenditures as well as continuing with cost
reduction initiatives.
After reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management has
sufficient flexibility in potential adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing these interim financial statements.
Dividends
The Board of Directors has declared an interim dividend of 8.6 US cents per share totalling US$63.4 million which will
be paid on 9 September 2016 to shareholders on the register on 12 August 2016. This decision was made after a
comprehensive review of the Group's financial situation, assuring that the Group is well placed to meet its current and
future financial requirements, including its development and exploration projects.
Fresnillo's existing dividend policy remains in place, which takes into account the profitability of the business and
underlying earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows whilst maintaining an appropriate
level of dividend cover. To reiterate the policy, a total dividend of between 33 and 50 percent of profit after tax is paid out
each year in the approximate proportion of one-third to be paid as an interim dividend, two-thirds to be paid as a final
dividend.
The interim dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling to shareholders, unless a shareholder elects to receive
dividends in US dollars. The interim dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling with the dividend being converted into
UK pounds sterling on or around 16 August 2016.

Statement of directors' responsibilities
The Directors of the Company hereby confirm that to the best of their knowledge:

Fresnillo Group as required by DTR 4.2.4; and
(b) the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 (being an indication of
important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed
set of financial statements; and a description of the principle risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the
year) and DTR 4.2.8 (being related party transactions that have taken place in the first six months of the current financial
year and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the entity during that period and changes
since the last annual report).
On behalf of the board of directors of Fresnillo plc.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO FRESNILLO PLC
Introduction
We have been engaged by the Company to review the interim condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly
financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 which comprises the interim consolidated income statement, the
interim consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the interim consolidated balance sheet, the interim
consolidated cash flow statement, the interim consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related Notes 1 to 18.
We have read the other information contained in the half yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim condensed consolidated set of
financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard on Review
Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of
the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' Responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are
responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of
the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in Note 2a, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union. The interim condensed consolidated set of financial statements included in this half-
yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial
Reporting", as adopted by the European Union.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the interim condensed consolidated set of financial
statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
Scope of Review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410,
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries,
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim condensed
consolidated set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European
Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.

Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
1    Corporate Information
Fresnillo plc ("the Company") is a public limited company registered in England and Wales with the registered number
6344120.
Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. ("Peñoles") currently owns 74.99 percent of the shares of the Company and the
ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles.
Copies of Peñoles accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances
and transactions with Peñoles group companies is disclosed in Note 16.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2016 ("interim
consolidated financial statements"), were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 1 August
2016.
The Group's principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related
production. The primary contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. Further information about the Group's
operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in Note 3.
2       Significant accounting policies
(a)     Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
The interim consolidated financial statements of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been prepared
in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union (EU). They do not include all
the information required for full annual financial statements for the Group, and therefore, should be read in conjunction
with the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 as published in the
Annual Report 2015.
These interim consolidated financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the
Companies Act 2006.  The financial information for the full year is based on the statutory accounts for the financial year
ended 31 December 2015. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year, which were prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU up to 31 December 2015, has been delivered
to the Register of Companies.  The auditors' report in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006
in relation to those accounts was unqualified.
The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative
financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been
measured at fair value.
The interim consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or
US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except where otherwise indicated.
The impact of seasonality or cyclicality on operations is not considered significant on the interim consolidated financial
statements.
(b)     Basis of consolidation
The interim consolidated financial statements set out the Group's financial position as of 30 June 2016 and 31
December 2015, and its operations and cash flows for the periods ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015.
The basis of consolidation adopted in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements is consistent with
that applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
(c)     Changes in accounting policies and presentation
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with
those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
As at 31 December 2015, derivatives relating to the gold hedging programme initiated in 2014 that mature after one year
had been presented as current assets. During 2016, the Group restated the prior year comparatives and reclassified
these derivatives to non-current assets. The reclassification resulted in an increase in non-current assets and a
corresponding reduction in current assets by US$97.5 million as at 31 December 2015, with no impact on previously
reported profit, other comprehensive income, liabilities, equity, cash flow or earnings per share. In addition, there is no
tax effect and no impact on segmental disclosures.
New standards and interpretations as adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted "IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative - Amendments to IAS 1". The amendments clarify existing
requirements on materiality, aggregation and disaggregation in the preparation of financial statements and presentation
of the notes. This amendment had no impact in the financial information of the Group.
Other than the above mentioned amendments there was no significant new accounting standards or interpretations
required for the Group to adopt effective 1 January 2016.
The IASB and IFRS Interpretation committee have issued, and the EU have adopted, certain amendments resulting from
improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial
position or performance of the Group.  The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that
was issued but is not yet effective.
3    Segment reporting
For management purposes the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.
At 30 June 2016 the Group has six reportable operating segments which consist of the Group's six producing mines as
follows:
-  The Fresnillo mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, the world's largest primary silver mine;
-  The Saucito mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;
-  The Cienega mine, located in the State of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramon satellite
mine;
-  The Herradura mine, located in the State of Sonora, a surface gold mine;
-  The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the State of Sonora, a surface gold mine; and
-  The Noche Buena mine, located in State of Sonora, a surface gold mine.
The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group´s
chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this
information.
Substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.
Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and
making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain
adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the interim consolidated income statements, and certain costs included
within Cost of Sales and Gross Profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of
the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross Profit as per the interim consolidated
income statement. Other income and expenses included in the interim consolidated income statement are not allocated
to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm's length basis similar to
transactions with third parties.

1 The current income tax has been reduced by US$12.2 million (2015: nil) as a result of a credit granted to taxpayers in
respect of an excise tax (Special Tax on Production and Services, or IEPS for its acronym in Spanish) paid when
purchasing diesel used for general machinery and certain mining vehicles. The credit can be applied against either the
company's own corporate income tax or the income tax withheld from third parties. The credit is calculated on an entity-
by-entity basis and any amount paid in excess of the sum of corporate income tax and income tax withheld cannot be
credited in future fiscal periods. No deferred tax asset has therefore been recognised in relation to any excess.
2 The special mining right allows the deduction of payments for mining concession rights up to the amount of the special
mining right payable within the same legal entity.  In the six months ended 30 June 2016, the Group credited US$4.3
million (2015: US$4.1million) of mining concession rights against the special mining right. Prior to credits permitted
under the special mining right regime, the current special mining right charge would have been US$12.7 million. (2015:
US$9.0).
The total mining concession rights paid during the six month period were US$8.1 million (2015: US$9 million) and have
been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses. Mining concessions rights paid
in excess of the special mining right cannot be credited to special mining rights in future fiscal periods, and therefore, no
deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the excess.
The effective tax rate for corporate income tax for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is 28.89% (six months ended 30
June 2015: 35.69%) and 35.08% including the special mining right (six months ended 30 June 2015: 43.90%). The main
factor that reduced the effective tax rate below 30% is the IEPS tax incentive described above. This impact was partially
offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates as a result the appreciation of the US dollar against the Mexican peso.
During 2015 the Group clarified the treatment applied in the computation of the 2014 tax provision regarding the
deduction of certain mining-related expenditures. This resulted in an adjustment of US$29.9 million to the 2015 current
tax expense with an equal and opposite effect to the deferred tax expense.
8      Earnings per share
Earnings per share ('EPS') is calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders of the
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The Company has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As of 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015, earnings per share have been calculated as follows:
Earnings:
Six months ended 30 June
2016
(in thousands of US dollars)
2015
Profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company
167,036
Adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company90,093
76,499
75,267
Adjusted profit is profit as disclosed in the Interim Consolidated Income Statement adjusted to exclude revaluation
effects of the Silverstream contract of US$109.9 million gain (US$76.9 million net of tax) (2015: US$1.8 million gain and
US$1.2 million net of tax).
Adjusted earnings per share have been provided in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of the
Group, prior to the revaluation effects of the Silverstream contract, a derivative financial instrument.

9      Property, plant and equipment
The significant changes in property, plant and equipment during the six months ended 30 June 2016 are additions of
US$202.8 million (six months ended 30 June 2015: US$246.4 million) and depreciation and amortisation of US$172.4
million, of which US$7.1 million was capitalised as a part of the cost of other fixed assets (six months ended 30 June
2015: US$166.7 million, of which US$5.2 million was capitalised). Additions consist of capitalised interest, mine
development works at the underground mines, stripping activity at the surface mines, tailing ponds at Herradura and
Cienega, the construction of San Julian phase one facilities, and purchase of mine equipment such as scoops, trams
and trucks.
As of 30 June 2016 the Group has contractual commitments related to the construction and acquisition of property, plant
and equipment of US$124.1 million (31 December 2015: US$145.5 million)
10     Silverstream contract
Cash received in respect of the period of US$17.4 million (six months ended 30 June 2015: US$15.8 million)
corresponds to 1.9 million ounces of payable silver (six months ended 30 June 2015: 1.9 million ounces). As at 30 June
2016, a further US$5.8 million (30 June 2015: US$4.7 million) of cash corresponding to 437,431 ounces of silver is due
(30 June 2015: 440,115 ounces).
A reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance is shown below.

During the six months ended 30 June 2016, the most significant driver of the US$109.9 million of unrealised gains
recorded in the income statement (six months ended 30 June 2015: gain of US$1.8 million) was the updating of external
financial assumptions used to value the Silverstream contract. The most significant of these were an increase in the
forward price of silver and the decrease of the reference discount rate (LIBOR).

15   Contingencies
The contingencies in the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 as
published in the 2015 Annual Report, are still applicable as of 30 June 2016, including the El Bajio agrarian community
conflict as described below:
-        Minera Penmont ("Penmont") has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the
Unitarian Agrarian Court in respect of approximately 300 hectares where the Soledad-Dipolos mine is located (out of the
total 1,824 hectares which Penmont returned to the El Bajio community in July 2013). Remediation activities however
remain pending, since the agrarian members have not permitted Penmont physical access to the lands. Penmont will
continue to monitor this situation and reiterate its request before the Agrarian Court in order that access to the lands may
be permitted for remediation activities.
-        In connection with the foregoing matters, and as previously reported by the Company in prior years, members of the
El Bajio agrarian community have presented additional claims, including a separate claim before the Unitarian Agrarian
Court, alleging US$65 million in damages as well as requesting the cancellation of Penmont's mining concessions and
environmental permits within the El Bajio lands. The Unitarian Agrarian Court has now issued a final and definitive
ruling on the matter denying claimants their allegations, which is consistent with the Company's view, as previously
reported, that this lawsuit had no merit.
-        Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajio matter including
appeals that are pending as well as criminal complaints between the parties. There remains significant uncertainty as to
the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

b.       Fair value measurement
Fair value hierarchy
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: a) in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the
most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the
asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the interim consolidated financial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly
or indirectly observable
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
unobservable
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, other
than those with carrying amounts that are a reasonable approximation of their fair values, are as follows:

Valuation techniques
The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:
Option commodity contracts
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with
investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot
commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the
respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which
include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.
Option and forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with
investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable
spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the
respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant
inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.
Silverstream contract
The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model (for further information relating to the
Silverstream contract see Note 10). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a
number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of
the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced
and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the
Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the
recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the
expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions
and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and
sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable
silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by
Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels
which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.
Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs
described above, and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not
interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream contract is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future
inflation, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future exchange rate and the discount rate used to
discount future cash flows as explained in Note 10.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Silverstream contract valuation to reasonably possible change in
those inputs:

Interest-bearing loans
Fair value of the Group's interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Embedded derivatives within sales contracts:
Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are 'provisionally priced' and revenue is initially recognised using this
provisional price and the Group's best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal
content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery. This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative
and is separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the
quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as
these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to
this valuation.
At 30 June 2016 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was a gain of US$7.2 million (31
December 2015: gain of US$2.3 million). The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales
contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenue.
c.      Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk
associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group also enters into option contracts to
manage its exposure to commodity price risk.
