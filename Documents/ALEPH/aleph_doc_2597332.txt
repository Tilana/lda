Sales Revenue 
Group sales revenue increased 10.6% ($132.1 million) to $1,381.3 million, compared to the pcp, with growth from acquisitions 
delivering $203 million in revenue. Contributions from acquisitions made during the period included:
 
 
 

Jalco - a contract manufacturing, filling and packing business based in New South Wales, acquired in September 2015; 
Stowers Containment Solutions – a New Zealand based distributor of containment solutions, acquired February 2016; 
Power Plastics -  a New South Wales based manufacturer of rigid plastic containers, acquired in March 2016; and 
Ecopolymers - a plastics recycler based in Queensland, acquired in May 2016.
In addition, the full year impact of acquisitions made in the last financial year had a positive impact. Sales benefitted slightly 
from favourable currency translation and price increases largely associated with inflationary impacts. These benefits were partly 
offset by lower underlying net sales volumes, particularly in the dairy, agricultural and industrial sectors, generally subdued 
demand conditions across most other sectors, and net contract losses in the period.  
 
EBIT (before significant items) 
The Group reported EBIT (before significant items) of $162.5 million, up 6.6% ($10.0 million) versus the pcp.  EBIT was 
favourably impacted by acquisitions (+$10.3 million), the 2015 Efficiency Program ($6.6 million) and benefits delivered through 
property management, including property sales ($4.1 million) and lower lease related costs ($3.2 million).  These benefits were
Pact Group Holdings Ltd

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
 
partly offset by the EBIT impact of lower net sales volumes (-$9.5 million), and other costs, largely associated with facility start-
up costs in Australia (-$2.0 million) and Indonesia (-$0.7 million) and management transitions in the period (-$1.2 million).  
 
Focus on lowering the Group’s overall cost of production remains a key priority and during the year the Efficiency Program 
announced in 2015 was substantially completed. EBIT growth, delivered in challenging market conditions, once again 
demonstrates the resilience of the business and the benefits of diversification. 
 
EBIT margins in the underlying business were improved. Although group margins declined to 11.8% from 12.2%, this was 
primarily due to lower margins in the acquired businesses. Resin prices, in Australian dollar terms, were steady and costs were 
well controlled. 
 
Significant items 
Pre-tax significant items for the year were an expense of $11.5 million. This related to costs associated with the Efficiency 
Program announced in 2015 ($8.6 million) and acquisition costs ($2.9 million). The pre-tax significant items of $23.5 million in 
the prior year also related to the Efficiency Program ($20.8 million) and acquisition costs ($2.7 million).  
 
Net finance costs 
Net financing costs for the period were $30.5 million. The decrease in financing costs of $2.5 million compared to the pcp 
reflects the beneficial impact of the refinancing completed in June 2015, the securitisation program, also established in June 
2015, and reductions in market interest rates. 
 
Income tax expense and significant tax items 
The income tax expense for the year was $37.7 million and represents 28.5% of net profit before tax and significant items, 
broadly in line with the statutory tax rates payable across the Group’s main operating locations. This compares to $34.1 million 
in the pcp at a similar effective tax rate. 
 
The significant tax item for the year is a benefit of $2.2 million relating to the significant items noted above. In the prior year the 
significant tax item was a benefit of $6.0 million, also relating to the Efficiency Program and acquisition costs. 
 
Net profit after tax 
Group net profit after tax attributable to shareholders for the financial year was $85.1 million compared to $67.6 million in the 
pcp. Excluding significant items, net profit after tax attributable to shareholders was $94.3 million, an increase of $9.1 million 
over the pcp. 
 
BALANCE SHEET 
Net debt at the end of the financial year was $509.6 million, $69.3 million higher than the prior corresponding period. The 
increase in net debt primarily reflects funding requirements of $113.9 million for acquisitions made during the year, partly offset 
by the underlying cash generation of the business.  
 
The Group has retained a robust balance sheet.  At 30 June 2016 gearing (closing net debt / EBITDA) was 2.3 times, up from 
2.1 times in the pcp due to the funding requirements for acquisitions.  This remains well within management’s target range of 
less than 3 times.  
 
Total debt facilities comprise of a A$590.0 million facility and a NZ$180.0 million facility, each equally split between tranches 
maturing in July 2018 and July 2020. Average tenor is 3 years. Unused facilities at 30 June 2016 were $197.3 million.  
 
CASHFLOW 
Statutory operating cashflow including proceeds from the securitisation program was $160.8 million, $89.6 million lower than the 
pcp. The inflow from securitisation of trade debtors was $18.7 million in the financial year compared to $96.9 million in the pcp. 
Excluding securitisation inflows, statutory operating cashflow was $11.4 million lower than the pcp, primarily due to higher 
income tax cash payments.  
 
Payments for property, plant and equipment were $52.1 million compared to $43.4 million in the pcp. The increase includes 
capital expenditure in acquired businesses (mainly Jalco), expenditure relating to the integration of acquisitions and an initial 
$2.7 million in capital expenditure relating to the establishment of a crate pooling business in Australia. 
 
Payments for purchase of businesses and subsidiaries of $113.9 million includes Jalco ($76.1 million), Power Plastics ($15.0 
million), Stowers Containment Solutions ($13.9 million), Ecopolymers ($1.4 million) and a $7.2 million deferred payment relating 
to the Sulo acquisition from 2014.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
Pact Australia 
Pact Australia comprises the Group’s operations in Australia where it has operating sites in New South Wales, Victoria, 
Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia. Pact Australia contributed 74% of the Group’s total sales revenue in the year 
ended 30 June 2016.

EBIT before significant items 
EBIT Margin % 
 
Pact Australia achieved growth in both sales revenue and EBIT before significant items. 
 
Sales revenue grew by $138.0 million compared to the pcp, or 15.5%, positively impacted by acquisitions. Excluding 
acquisitions, volumes were lower. Growth in the materials handling sector was more than offset by softer demand in the 
agricultural and industrial sectors, impacted by unfavourable weather conditions, weaker mining markets, and the impact of net 
contract losses. 
 
EBIT (before significant items) of $95.6 million was up $9.3 million or 10.8% compared to the pcp. Earnings growth was 
delivered through acquisitions and efficiency benefits, including benefits delivered through the 2015 Efficiency Program, 
property sales and lower lease related costs.  These benefits more than offset the impact of lower underlying volumes and costs 
associated with management transition and facility start-up costs in the period.  
 
The EBIT margin of 9.3% was lower than the prior year, negatively impacted by lower margins in the acquired businesses, 
partly impacted by the costs of integration. Excluding acquisitions, underlying margins improved. 
 
Pact International 
Pact International comprises the Group’s operations in New Zealand, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and 
Thailand. Pact International contributed 26% of the Group’s total sales revenue in the year ended 30 June 2016.

EBIT Margin % 
 
Pact International achieved growth in EBIT before significant items despite slightly lower sales revenue. 
 
Sales revenue of $353.4 million was down $5.8 million, or 1.6%, versus the pcp. The business achieved higher volumes in the 
material handling sector, through the supply of household bins and industrial crates, and benefitted from the acquisition of 
Stowers, as well as overall favourable foreign exchange conditions in the year. These positive impacts were more than offset by 
lower volumes from weaker demand in the dairy and industrial sectors, and the impact to sales from ownership changes in 
South East Asia (from 100% owned to JV). 
 
EBIT (before significant items) at $66.8 million was up $0.7 million, or 1.1% compared to the pcp. Earnings growth was 
delivered through the contribution of the acquired Stowers business and efficiency savings. These benefits more than offset 
lower underlying sales volumes and start-up costs relating to the new Indonesian manufacturing facility, which was 
commissioned in December 2015. 
 
The EBIT margin of 18.9% improved from 18.4% in the pcp.

OTHER EVENTS OF SIGNIFICANCE 
 
Acquisitions 
On 1 September 2015 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Jalco Group Pty Limited 
(Jalco) and its controlled entities. Jalco is a leading supplier of contract manufacturing, filling and packing in the non-food FMCG 
sector. This acquisition is part of the Group’s overall strategy to deepen its existing FMCG customer relationships and to enter 
new areas of growth serving customers in this sector. Total purchase consideration was $80.1 million (including deferred 
settlement), and the acquisition was funded through Group debt facilities. 
 
During the year the Group also completed the acquisition of Power Plastics Pty Ltd (1 March 2016) for total purchase 
consideration of $25.2 million; the business assets of Stowers Containment Solutions Ltd (29 February 2016) for total purchase 
consideration of $13.9 million; and the business assets of Ecopolymers Pty Ltd (3 May 2016) for total purchase consideration of 
$2.9 million. 
 
Crate pooling 
On 16 May 2016 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement under which the Group will construct, own and 
operate crate pooling, washing and storage facilities to service Woolworths. This is a natural extension of the Group’s existing 
presence in the materials handling sector and continues the strategy of pursuing new revenue streams through organic growth.  
 
It is expected the establishment of the business, including the construction of crate washing facilities and the manufacture of 
crates, will cost approximately $70 million, with most of the capital expenditure spent in the 2017 financial year.  The new 
business is expected to commence operations early in the 2018 financial year.  
 
On 7 June 2016 the Group also announced that it was to purchase the assets, brands and trademarks of the Fruit Case 
Company, a New Zealand based crate pooling and hire company, for $16.9 million, continuing the Group’s strategic expansion 
into the materials handling sector. The acquisition completed on 1 July 2016. 
 
 
2017 OUTLOOK 
 
The outlook for the Group is for higher revenue and earnings (before significant items) in FY17, subject to global economic 
conditions. 
 
In the Directors’ opinion, any further disclosure of information would likely result in unreasonable prejudice to the Group.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
 
OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 
A key element of the Group’s strategy is to maximise long term shareholder value.  The Group seeks to deliver long term value 
through focus on three core areas:
 
 

Organic Growth – by protecting our core and growing with purpose; 
Efficiency – through operational excellence and the lowest cash cost of production; and 
M&A – growth through disciplined M&A in core sectors and close adjacencies.
Organic Growth 
The Group’s core business benefits from:
 
 
 
 
 

leading sector positions; 
a diverse customer base with long-term relationships; 
a highly diversified product portfolio; 
broad end-market reach; 
an extensive manufacturing and supply network; and  
world-class innovation.
Key to the Group’s ability to grow organically is its ability to leverage these differentiating characteristics to create a competitive 
advantage.  A core focus of the Group is innovation. Pact supplies some of the most innovative products in the market, 
supported by in-house innovation capability and extensive global licencing arrangements.  The Group’s commitment to 
innovation has been recognised through multiple industry and customer awards.  
 
Efficiency 
The Group is focussed on delivering operational excellence and the lowest cash cost of production. 
 
In 2015 the Group announced an Efficiency Program to eliminate excess capacity and align the Group with customers’ 
requirements and expected long term volumes. This program has now been substantially completed delivering benefits in the 
2016 financial year, with annual benefits of $15 million expected in the 2017 financial year.  
 
The strategic focus on efficiency will be enhanced going forward through the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
across the manufacturing footprint in a systematic and staged approach.  In addition, the Group will continue to review all areas 
of the business for efficiency opportunities in the pursuit of operational excellence. 
 
M&A 
The Group has a long track record of success in identifying value accretive acquisition opportunities, executing transactions in a 
disciplined and systematic manner, and delivering cost synergies and operational efficiencies through integration. Acquisitions 
have provided both product and customer diversity to the Group. 
 
M&A opportunities must meet strict assessment and evaluation criteria. Opportunities must be low risk and aligned with the 
Group’s core sectors or close adjacencies, and expected returns must meet a minimum financial hurdle of 20% return on 
investment by year three.  
 
Discipline in deal execution is provided by a centrally managed integration process.  A strict timeline for transition and the 
centralisation of common operational and back-office functions ensures cost synergies and efficiencies are realised early.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
 
BUSINESS RISKS 
 
There are various internal and external risks that may have a material impact on the Group’s future financial performance and 
economic sustainability. The Group makes every effort to identify material risks and to manage these effectively. 
 
The material financial risks include: 
 
Customer risks 
Customers are fundamental to the success of the business and, in recognition of this, Pact invests in the quality of its 
relationships with key material customers, and in producing products to customers required specification and standard. The loss 
of key material customers, a reduction in their demand for Pact’s products or a claim for non-performance can have a negative 
effect on the future financial performance of the Group. 
 
People risks 
Future financial and operational performance of the Group is significantly dependant on the performance and retention of key 
personnel, in particular Senior Management. The unplanned or unexpected loss of key personnel, or the inability to attract and 
retain high performing individuals to the business may adversely impact the Group’s future financial performance. In line with 
the manufacturing industry, Pact has an exposure to health and safety management incidents in the manufacturing operations. 
Failure to comply with health and safety legislation and industry good practice may result in harm to a person or persons, which 
may lead to negative operational, reputational and financial impacts. 
 
Competitor risks 
Pact operates in a highly competitive environment due to factors including actions by existing or new competitors, price, product 
selection and quality, manufacturing capability, innovation and the ability to provide the customer with an appropriate range of 
products and services in a timely manner. Any deterioration in the Group's competitive position as a result of actions from 
competitors may result in a decline in sales revenue and margins, and an adverse effect on the Group's future financial 
performance. 
 
Consumer preferences 
Changes in consumer preference for Pact’s products or adverse activities in key industry sectors which Pact and its customers 
service may be influenced by various factors. These industry sectors include consumer goods (e.g. food, dairy, beverages, 
personal care and other household consumables) and industrial (e.g. surface coatings, petrochemical, agriculture and 
chemicals) industry sectors. Factors which may influence these sectors include climate conditions, seasonality of foods, an 
increased focus in Australian and New Zealand supermarket chains on private brands, and reputation of products, substrates or 
technology in the wider industry sector. Demand for Pact's products may materially be affected by any of these factors which 
could have an adverse effect on the Group's future financial performance. 
 
Strategic acquisitions 
Pact’s strong growth over time has been aided by the acquisition of numerous businesses and assets. This growth has placed, 
and may continue to place, significant demands on management, information reporting systems and financial and internal 
control systems. Effective management of Pact’s growth, including identification of suitable acquisition candidates and effective 
management of integration costs will be required on an ongoing basis. If this does not occur then there may be an adverse 
effect on the Group's future financial performance. 
 
Foreign exchange rates 
Pact’s financial reports are prepared in Australian dollars. However, a substantial proportion of Pact’s sales revenue, 
expenditures and cashflows are generated in, and assets and liabilities are denominated in, New Zealand dollars. Pact is also 
exposed to a range of other currencies including the US dollar, Chinese yuan, the Philippines peso, the Indonesian rupiah and 
the Thai baht in relation to Pact’s business operations. Any depreciation of the Australian dollar and adverse movement in 
exchange rates would have an adverse effect on the Group's future financial performance. 
 
Supply chain 
The ability for the supply chain to meet the Group’s requirements including the sourcing of raw materials, is reliant on key 
relationships with suppliers. The price and availability of raw materials, input costs, and future consolidation in industry sectors 
could result in a decrease in the number of suppliers or alternative supply sources available to Pact. Additionally Pact may not 
always be able to pass on changes in input prices to its customers. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on the 
Group's future financial performance. 
 
Interruption to operations 
Pact operates across a diverse geographical footprint and situations may arise in which sites are not able to operate. Factors 
include emergency situations such as natural disasters, failure of information technology systems or security, or industrial 
disputes. Any of these factors may lead to disruptions in production or increase in costs, and may have an adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial performance. 
 
Compliance risks 
Pact is required to comply with a range of laws and regulations, and those of particular significance to Pact are in the areas of 
employment, work health and safety, property, environmental, competition, anti-bribery and corruption, customs and 
international trade, taxation and corporations.

For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Introduction 
This is the Consolidated Financial Report of Pact Group 
Holdings Ltd (“Pact” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the “Group”) and including the Group’s 
interest in associates and jointly controlled entities at the end 
of, or during the year ended 30 June 2016. This Consolidated 
Financial Report was issued in accordance with a resolution of 
the Directors on 24 August 2016.  
 
To make the Consolidated Financial Report less complex and 
more useful to readers, note disclosures have been 
reorganised into sections to allow readers to better understand 
the performance of the Group and how this links to Pact’s 
strategy outlined in the Operating and Financial Review.  
 
Information is only included in the Consolidated Financial 
Report to the extent the Directors consider it material and 
relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A 
disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example: 
 
the dollar amount is significant in size and/or by nature; 
 
the Group’s results cannot be understood without the 
specific disclosure; 
 
it is critical to allow a user to understand the impact of 
significant changes in the Group’s business during the 
period; and 
it relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations that is 
important to its future performance.
 
 
Developing this financial report requires management to make 
a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions to apply 
the Group’s accounting policies. Actual results may differ from 
these judgements and estimates under different assumptions 
and conditions and may materially affect financial results or the 
financial position reported in future periods. Key judgements 
and estimates, which are material to this report, are highlighted 
in the following notes: 
  Note 1.2   Taxation 
  Note 2.1   Business combinations 
  Note 2.2   Control and significant influence 
  Note 3.2   Estimation of useful lives of assets 
  Note 3.2   Recoverability of property, plant and equipment 
  Note 3.2   Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
  Note 3.4   Business reorganisation 
 
To assist in identifying key accounting estimates and 
judgements, they have been highlighted as follows:

to proactively manage any obligations.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE OF OFFICERS 
The Company’s Constitution requires the Company to indemnify current and former Directors, alternate Directors, executive 
officers and such other officers of the Company as the Board determines on a full indemnity basis and to the full extent 
permitted by law against all liabilities incurred as an officer of the Group. Further, the Company’s Constitution permits the 
Company to maintain and pay insurance premiums for Director and Officer liability insurance, to the extent permitted by law.
Consistent with (and in addition to) the provisions in the Company’s Constitution outlined above, the Company has also entered 
into deeds of access, indemnity and insurance with all Directors of the Company and the Company Secretary which provide 
indemnities against losses incurred in their role as Directors or Company Secretary, subject to certain exclusions, including to 
the extent that such indemnity is prohibited by the Corporations Act or any other applicable law. In addition, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with those of its current and former Directors and Secretaries 
involved in a potential transaction which provide indemnities against losses incurred in the event of breaches of their obligations 
under confidentiality deeds entered into by them for the purpose of such transaction, and in the course of their employment, 
subject to certain exclusions including to the extent that such indemnity is prohibited by the Corporations Act. The deeds 
stipulate that the Company will meet the full amount of any such liabilities, costs and expenses (including legal fees).
During the financial year the Company paid insurance premiums for a Directors and Officers liability insurance contract that 
provides cover for the current and former Directors, alternate Directors, secretaries, executive officers and officers of the Group. 
The Directors have not included details of the nature of the liabilities covered in this contract or the amount of the premium paid, 
as disclosure is prohibited under the terms of the contract.
Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s standard engagement letter with Ernst & Young (EY), it indemnifies EY against all 
claims by third parties and resulting liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal costs) arising 
out of, or relating to, the services provided by EY or a breach of the engagement letter. The indemnity does not apply in respect 
of any matters finally determined to have resulted from EY’s negligent, wrongful or wilful acts or omissions nor to the extent 
prohibited by applicable law including the Corporations Act 2001. 
PROCEEDINGS ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY 
No person has applied to the court under section 237 of the Corporations Act for leave to bring proceedings on behalf of the 
Company, or to intervene in any proceedings to which the Company is a party, for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf 
of the Company for all or part of those proceedings.
No proceedings have been brought or intervened in on behalf of the Company with the leave of the court under section 237 of 
the Corporations Act. 
NON-AUDIT SERVICES 
During the year, EY, the Company’s auditor, performed other assignments in addition to their statutory audit responsibilities.
Details of the amounts paid or payable to EY for non-audit services provided in respect of the Group during the year are as 
follows:

The Board has considered the position and, in accordance with the advice received from the Audit, Business Risk and 
Compliance Committee, is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of 
independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.
The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by EY, given the amounts paid and the type of work 
undertaken, did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:


all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit, Business Risk and Compliance Committee to ensure they do 
not impact the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor; and
none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110: Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including reviewing or auditing the auditors own work, acting in a management 
or decision-making capacity for the Group, acting as advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risk and 
rewards.

Governance
Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is delegated responsibility by the Board for managing 
appropriate remuneration policy and governance procedures including:


 


review and recommend to the Board appropriate remuneration policies and arrangements including incentive plans for 
the CEO and CFO; 
review and approve short term incentive plans, long term incentive plans, performance targets and bonus payments for 
the CEO and CFO; 
review the performance of the CEO; 
review the Senior Executives’ performance assessment processes to ensure they are structured and operate to realise 
business strategy; and 
review and recommend to the Board, remuneration arrangements for the Chairman and NEDs.
The Committee comprises four NEDS and meet as often as the Committee members deem necessary to fulfil the Committee’s 
obligations.  It  is  intended  they  meet  no  less  than  three  times  a  year.  A  copy  of  the  Committee’s  charter  is  available  at 
www.pactgroup.com.au.
Pact Group Holdings Ltd

DIRECTORS’ REPORT– REMUNERATION REPORT
Use of remuneration consultants 
To ensure the Committee is fully informed when making remuneration decisions it will seek remuneration advice where 
required.
Decisions to engage remuneration consultants are made by the Committee or the Board. Contractual engagements and briefing 
of the consultants is undertaken by the Chairman of the Committee and the remuneration recommendation is to be provided 
directly to the Chairman of the Committee.  
EY was engaged during the financial year to provide recommendations to the Group on the development of a Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP). EY provided recommendations on the structure of a LTIP including but not limited to the following 
components:
 
 
 
 
 
 

timing of awards; 
quantum of grants; 
eligibility of employees; 
type of equity instrument as an award vehicle; 
performance measures; 
vesting schedule; and 
the performance period.
The CEO and CFO had no involvement in the engagement or instruction of EY. The Company complies with the Corporations 
Act to ensure any remuneration advice or recommendation received is free from undue influence by the KMP to whom the 
advice or recommendation relates. The appointment of EY for the provision of this service did not impact on the independence 
of EY as auditors of the Company and the Group, as EY was not involved in the final design and implementation of the plan. 
The Company paid EY $29,612 for this review.

Executive remuneration arrangements
Remuneration principles and strategy 
Pact’s executive remuneration strategy is designed to attract, retain, reward and motivate high performing individuals through 
remuneration arrangements that are based on performance and experience, are competitive for companies of a similar size and 
nature, and are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration for executive KMP includes fixed remuneration, and benefits that are at risk, awarded only on the achievement of 
performance conditions. This includes a short term incentive plan (STI) for the CEO and CFO, and a LTIP for the CEO.
Fixed Remuneration 
Comprises base salary and company superannuation contributions. The Group’s strategy is to provide competitive fixed 
remuneration to attract high quality executives with the right experience, qualifications and industry expertise to manage the 
business.
STI 
An “at risk” component of remuneration paid in cash, awarded on the achievement of performance conditions (financial and 
non-financial) over a twelve month period, that is intended to drive performance against the Group’s short term objectives.
LTIP 
An “at risk” component of remuneration comprising the issue of Performance Rights awarded on the achievement of 
performance conditions over a three year period, that is intended to drive performance against the Group’s long term objectives.
The LTIP was introduced in 2016 as a component of the CEO’s remuneration. The Committee believes the LTIP appropriately 
incentivises and motivates the CEO in the achievement of longer term objectives which are aligned with shareholders interests. 
A review of whether broader participation in the LTIP, including participation by the CFO and other senior executives, will be 
undertaken by the Committee at a later date.     
Approach to setting remuneration 
Remuneration levels are considered annually through a remuneration review that considers market data, insights into 
remuneration trends, the performance of the Group and individual, and the broader economic environment. The target 
remuneration mix for the 2016 year was as follows(1):
Executive KMP remuneration component at target

the fair value of Performance Rights at grant date).

and 13 of the Remuneration Report).

that comprise 20% of the STI plan. 
Group  EBITDA  before  significant  items  is  considered  a  financial  measure  which  is  strongly  aligned  with  the  interests  of 
shareholders.  EBITDA is key indicator of the underlying growth of the business, and is strongly aligned with cashflow, which 
enables the payment of dividends to shareholders.  EBITDA can be reliably measured. 
LTIP 
The CEO participates in the LTIP, with an entitlement to performance rights equal to 100% of annual base salary with a vesting 
period of three years. 
Key features of the LTIP are outlined below:
Grant Value 
For the year ended 30 June 2016, 146,444 performance rights are expected to be granted based on the volume weighted 
average price (VWAP) of $4.78. The VWAP was based on the Pact Group share price over the five day period commencing 24 
November 2015. The number of performance rights are on a pro rata entitlement based on a commencement date of 1 
December 2015. The fair value of each right at the valuation date of 22 June 2016 is $3.85. 
The 2015 LTIP has been granted as one tranche, commencing on 1 December 2015.  Share based payments expense for 
FY2016 has been recognised from 1 December 2015. The expense is based on the fair value of the performance rights.  
The implementation of the LTIP, including the issuing of entitlements to shares or the vesting of shares under the plan, remains 
subject to the approval of the LTIP by shareholders at the Company’s AGM to be held in November 2016. In the event that the 
LTIP as currently proposed and set out in this report is not approved by shareholders at the AGM, it is the Board’s intention to 
replicate the LTIP, as closely as practicable, but replacing the issuing of entitlements in shares with entitlements to cash 
payments that ‘shadow’ the value of the shares that would otherwise have vested under the proposed plan.  
Performance Period 
The performance period for the LTIP is from 1 December 2015 to 30 June 2018. 
Performance Hurdles 
Vesting of this tranche will be subject to the following: 

The Company achieving its relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This hurdle was elected by the Committee as 
it is clearly aligned with returns to shareholders. TSR is calculated by measuring the return to shareholders based on the 
share price growth combined with the dividends declared over the three year performance period. 
TSR is then ranked on a relative basis with the TSR performance measured against the S&P/ASX 200 comparator group, 
excluding companies in the Financials, Metals and Mining sector. The peer group has been selected by the Board at the 
time of the grant. 
The percentage of rights subject to the relative TSR hurdle that vest, if any, will be determined by the Committee with 
reference to the percentile ranking achieved by the Company over the relevant Performance Period, compared to other 
entities in the relative TSR comparator peer group, as follows:


pro rata vesting between 50% to 100%
Vesting Schedule 
TSR Relative to peer group 
At or above the 75th percentile 
Between the 50th and 75th percentile 
At the 50th percentile 
Below the 50th percentile 
 Cessation of Employment 
If an executive resigns or is terminated for cause, any unvested LTIP awards are forfeited, unless otherwise determined by 
the Board. A “good leaver” will retain a pro rata number of Performance Rights based on time elapsed since the initial grant 
date. Any such Performance rights will be subject to the original terms and conditions, and discretion of the Board. 
Rights Attaching to Performance Rights 
Performance rights do not carry any dividend or voting entitlements prior to vesting. Shares allocated upon vesting of 
performance rights will carry the same rights as other ordinary shares. 
Clawback 
100% of the award can be forfeited where there has been any fraud, dishonesty, or breach of obligations, including a material 
misstatement of the Financial Statements. 
Change of Control Provisions 
In the event of change of control, the performance period end date will be brought forward to the date of change of control, 
and awards will vest based on performance over this shortened period (subject to Board discretion).

6.  Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements 
Remuneration policy 
The Committee seeks to set aggregate remuneration at a level that provides the Company with the ability to attract and retain 
non-executive directors (NEDs) of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost that is acceptable to shareholders.
The amount of aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the fee structure is reviewed annually against 
fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies (S&P/ASX 200 comparator group, excluding companies in the Financials, Metals 
and Mining sector).
The Company’s Constitution and the ASX Listing Rules specify that the NED fee pool shall be determined from time to time by a 
general meeting. Consistent with prior years, the total amount paid to NEDs must not exceed a fixed sum of $1,000,000 per 
financial year in aggregate. Raphael Geminder does not receive a fee for his position as Chairman and a NED of the Company.
Pact Group Holdings Ltd

DIRECTORS’ REPORT– REMUNERATION REPORT

committee or being the Chair of a committee recognises the additional time commitment required by NEDs who serve on 
committees.

Pact’s chief operating decision maker is the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO monitors results 
by reviewing two reportable segments, Pact Australia (PA) and Pact International (PI), focusing on reported EBIT (earnings 
before finance costs and loss on de-recognition of financial assets, net of interest income, tax and significant items). As required 
by AASB 8 Operating Segments, the results above have been reported on a consistent basis to that supplied to the CEO.

How Pact accounts for Revenue   
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when there has been a transfer of risks and rewards to the customer (through  
the execution of a sales agreement at the time of delivery of the goods to the customer), no further work or processing is 
required, the quantity and quality of the goods has been determined, the price is determined and generally title has passed. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.

Key Estimates and Judgements – Taxation  
Pact is subject to income tax in Australia and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Group’s tax charge requires 
management to determine whether it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to recoup deferred tax 
assets. 
 
Judgements and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence if final tax determinations or future actual 
results do not align with current judgements, this may have an impact to the carrying value of deferred tax balances and 
corresponding credits or charges to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position.

from the taxation authorities in the jurisdictions that Pact operates.
1.2 TAXATION (CONTINUED) 
 
How Pact accounts for taxation 
Income tax charges: 
  Comprise of current and deferred income tax charges and represent the amounts expected to be paid to and recovered 
  Are recorded in Equity when the underlying transaction that the tax is attributable to is recorded within Other 
 
Pact uses the tax laws in place or those that have been substantively enacted at reporting date to calculate income tax. For 
deferred income tax, Pact also considers whether these tax laws are expected to be in place when the related asset is realised 
or liability is settled. Management periodically re-evaluate their assessment of their tax positions, in particular where they relate 
to specific interpretations of applicable tax regulation. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on all assets and liabilities that have different carrying values for tax and 
accounting, except for: 
 

initial recognition of goodwill; and 
any undistributed profits of Pact’s subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures where either the distribution of those profits 
would not give rise to a tax liability or the directors consider they have the ability to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences.
against. This assessment is reviewed at each reporting date.
Specifically for deferred tax assets: 
  They are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that there is sufficient future taxable amounts to be utilised 
  They are offset against deferred tax liabilities in the same tax jurisdiction, when there is a legally enforceable right to do so.  

If acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, would be 
recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. The adjustment would either be 
treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period 
or in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Australian tax consolidated group 
Pact Group Holding Ltd and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries formed a tax consolidated group (Australian tax 
consolidated group), effective January 2014. A tax funding agreement is also in place such that Pact Group Holdings Ltd pays 
any taxes owed by the Group to the Australian Tax Office. 
 
The operation of the previously announced amendments to the income tax consolidated group legislation have been changed 
and deferred by the Government as outlined in the announcements in the 2016-17 Budget.  It is now intended that these rules 
should apply from 1 July 2016, rather than 13 May 2013, therefore eliminating any potential material negative impact on Pact’s 
financial position at 30 June 2016 but subject to the final form and content of the law if released. 
There has been no further information regarding the proposed changes since the 2016-17 Budget announcement.

Goodwill arising on acquisition  
 
(1)   On 1 September 2015 the Group purchased 100% of the issued capital of Jalco Group Pty Limited and the following
controlled entities: Jalco Automotive Pty Limited, Jalco Powders Pty Limited, Jalco Plastics Pty Ltd, Jalco Australia Pty 
Limited, Jalco Care Products Pty Limited, Packaging Employees Pty Limited, Jalco Cosmetics Pty Limited, and Jalco 
Promotional Packaging Pty Limited (Jalco) for a purchase consideration of $80.1 million.  Jalco is a leading supplier of 
contract manufacturing, filling and packing in the non-food FMCG sector. The acquisition is part of the Group’s overall 
strategy to deepen its existing FMCG customer relationships and to enter new areas of growth.
Goodwill of $43.9 million has arisen as a result of the purchase consideration exceeding the fair value of identifiable net 
assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to the Pact Australia reportable segment. This goodwill will not be deductible for tax 
purposes.
The fair value of Jalco’s trade and other receivables acquired amounted to $30.0 million. This was net of an immaterial 
impairment provision and it is expected that the stated fair value amount will be collected. 
 
From the date of acquisition to 30 June 2016 Jalco contributed $165.4 million of revenue and $7.4 million to the net profit 
before tax of the Group. If the combination had taken place at 1 July 2015, contributions to revenue for the year ended 30 
June 2016 would have been $38.0 million higher and the contribution to profit before tax for the Group would have been 
$2.6 million higher.
(2)   During the year, consistent with strategy to expand its customer and product portfolio, the Group acquired: 
  The business assets, business records and contracts of Stowers Containment Solutions Ltd for $13.9 million (NZ$15.0 million)
on 29 February 2016.
  100% of the shares in Power Plastics Pty Ltd for $25.2 million, consisting of a $15.8 million cash payment and the issue of
$9.4 million shares in the Company on 1 March 2016 (refer Note 4.2).
  The business assets, business records and contracts of Ecopolymers Pty Ltd for $2.9 million, consisting of a $1.4 million cash 
payment, $0.3m deferred consideration and the issue of $1.2 million shares in the Company on 3 May 2016 (refer Note 4.2).  
The provisional fair value of the trade and other receivables acquired through these acquisitions amounted to $7.0 million. 
None of the trade receivables were impaired and it was expected that the full contractual amounts would be collected.  
In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position provisional goodwill of $23.7 million has been recognised as a result of 
these acquisitions. This goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. 
From the dates of acquisition to 30 June 2016 the acquisitions contributed $11.7 million of revenue and $0.6 million to the net 
profit before tax of the Group. If the combination of the acquisitions had taken place at 1 July 2015, contributions to revenue 
for the 12 months would have been $29.1 million higher and the contribution to profit before tax for the Group would have 
been $2.9 million higher.
(3)  The difference between this balance and amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is the net cash 
acquired  as  part  of  the  transaction,  and  a  $7.2  million  deferred  payment  made  this  financial  year  relating  to  the  Sulo 
acquisition, and a $0.3 million payment for a non-controlling interest in Vmax Returnable Packaging Systems Pty Ltd.

(Australia) Pty Ltd including its subsidiary Sulo (NZ) Ltd from Plastics Group Pty Ltd for a total consideration of  
$31.4 million. Details of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and the goodwill arising are disclosed above. 
There have been no further adjustments to these amounts in the current period and final goodwill of $10.5 million has been 
recognised on acquisition.
(2)   During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group acquired the:
  drum recycling assets from Brazier Group Pty Ltd for $1.4 million on 23 December 2014. 
  business assets from Brackley Industries Pty Ltd for $5.4 million on 6 May 2015. Brackley is a supplier of consol

  the drum business assets of NCI for $3.4 million on 15 May 2015 by a cash payment.

(3)   The difference between this balance and amount recorded in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement is the net cash acquired
as part of the transactions.
Key Estimate and Judgement – Business combinations  
Certain assets and liabilities either given up or acquired as part of a business combination may not be normally traded 
in active markets, thus management judgement is required in determining the fair values. Management judgement is 
also required in ascertaining the assets and liabilities which should be recognised, in particular with respect to intangible 
assets such as brand names, customer relationships, patents and trademarks and contingent liabilities.
the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair 
value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree;
How Pact accounts for business acquisitions 
When Pact acquires a business, if it satisfies the conditions of being a business combination under AASB 3 Business 
Combinations, then: 
 
  where settlement of any part of the consideration is deferred, and if the impact of discounting is significant, the amounts 
payable in the future are discounted to their present value. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing 
rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms 
and conditions; 
assets given, shares issued or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange are recorded at fair value;  
acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred;  
transaction costs arising on the issue of any equity instruments are recognised directly in equity; 
if the cost of the business combination is in excess of the net fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired, the difference is recognised as goodwill. For impairment testing, this goodwill has been allocated to and tested at 
the level of their respective cash generating units (CGU’s), or group of CGU’s, in accordance with the level at which 
management monitors goodwill; and 
if the cost of acquisition is less than the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary, 
the difference is recognised as a gain in the income statement.

Key Estimate and Judgement – Control and significant influence  
Determining whether Pact can control or exert significant influence over an entity can at times require judgement. It 
requires management to consider whether Pact is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. In making such an 
assessment, a range of factors are considered, including if and only if the Group has: power over the investee (i.e. 
existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); exposure, or rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its 
returns.

FINANCIAL REPORT – NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.3 ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (CONTINUED)
How Pact accounts for investment in associates and joint ventures and jointly controlled entities 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. 
 
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the 
net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only 
when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
The Group uses the equity method to account for their investments in associates and joint ventures, where they consider they 
have significant influence but they do not have control. Generally significant influence is deemed if Pact has over 20% of the 
voting rights.
separately.
Investments in the associates are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of associates’ net 
assets.
Under the equity method: 
 
  Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment 
  The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
  When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured 
long-term receivables and loans, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.
Comprehensive Income, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with 
respect to the Group’s net investment in associates. Goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment in associates is 
not tested separately, rather the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment as a single asset.  The Group 
applies AASB 139: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to determine whether there is an indicator that the 
Group’s net investment in associates is impaired, after first applying equity accounting in accordance with AASB 128: 
Investments in Associates. The Group must apply judgement to determine whether there is objective evidence that one or more 
events have had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of its associates.

Group’s participation in the securitisation program. The program requires the Group (or an entity other than the bank) to be

a debtors securitisation program. This is a three year program established in June 2015 which allows Pact to sell 
receivables, at a discount, to a third party on a non-recourse basis.
all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to strict credit verification procedures, which may include an 
assessment of their independent credit rating, financial position, past experience and industry reputation; 
individual risks limits, which are regularly monitored in line with set parameters;
At 30 June 2016, trade receivables with an invoice value of $0.2 million (2015: $0.3 million) were impaired and fully provided 
for. The Group has a number of mechanisms in place which assist in minimising financial losses due to customer non-payment. 
These include: 
 
 
  monitoring receivable balances on an ongoing basis; and 
 
 
 
How Pact accounts for trade and other receivables 
Pact’s trade receivables are non-interest bearing, are recorded at the amount on the sales invoice and include Goods and 
Services Tax (GST). Trade receivables generally have 30 day terms from the end of the month. 
 
If there is a concern over the collectability of a specific receivable and objective evidence exists, then the amount recorded may 
be reduced by management’s best estimate of the potential impairment loss. Impairment losses incurred which were specifically 
provided for in previous years are eliminated against the provision for impairment. In all other cases, impairment losses are 
written off as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
 
Under the debtors securitisation program: 
  The Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of receivables within the program to a third party. 
  Receivables are sold at a discount under the debtors securitisation program and at the date of sale the receivable is 
derecognised and the discount is included as part of the loss on derecognition of financial assets in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. The costs associated with establishing the program are also recognised on a pro 
rata basis within the same account (refer to Section 4.1).
servicer is recorded as an offset to the loss on derecognition of receivables.
  The Group also acts as a servicer to the program to facilitate the collection of receivables. Income received for being a 
  At balance date, a liability is recognised if received collections have not been paid to other participants of the program.

(1)   Property  consists  of  the  following:  leasehold  improvements  of  $17.3  million  (2015:  $15.1  million)  and  accumulated 
depreciation of $6.5 million (2015: $4.9 million), and freehold property of $38.1 million (2015: $38.0 million) and accumulated 
depreciation of $10.0 million (2015: ($8.8 million).
Key Estimates and Judgements – Estimation of useful lives of assets  
The estimation of the useful lives of assets has been based on historical experience and lease terms. In addition, the 
condition of the assets is assessed at least once per year and considered against the remaining useful life. Adjustments 
to useful lives are made when considered necessary.
Key Estimates and Judgements – Recoverability of property, plant and equipment 
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group and 
to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. These include product and manufacturing performance, technology, 
social, economic and political environments and future product expectations. If an impairment trigger exists the 
recoverable amount of the asset is assessed.

FINANCIAL REPORT – NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3.2 NON-CURRENT ASSETS (CONTINUED) 
 
Property, plant and equipment (continued) 
 
How Pact accounts for property plant and equipment  
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost 
includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the item and subsequent costs incurred to replace parts that are 
eligible for capitalisation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Where 
assets are in the course of construction at the reporting date they are classified as capital works in progress. Upon completion, 
capital works in progress are reclassified to plant and equipment and are depreciated from this date.  
 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset with a finite life may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset 
generates cash inflows that are largely dependent on those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s value in use 
cannot be estimated to approximate its fair value. In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-
generating unit to which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses 
relating to continuing operations are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.  
 
An assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amounts are estimated. A 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case the carrying amount of the asset is 
increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
 
 
Goodwill and other intangibles 
The majority of Pact’s intangible assets and goodwill balance relates to Goodwill, with the remainder of the other intangibles 
balance comprising the carrying value of patents, trademarks and licenses. Other intangibles for the year were $2,472,000 
(2015: $2,849,000) and includes amortisation charges of $425,000 (2015: $202,000). These are recognised at cost and 
amortised over their useful live.

Key Estimate and Judgement – Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
The recoverable amount of each of the CGU’s has been determined based on value in use calculations using cash 
flow projections contained within next year’s financial budget approved by management and other forward projections. 
Management have used their current expectations and what is considered reasonably achievable when assigning 
values to key assumptions in their value in use calculations.
Pact Group Holdings Ltd

3.2 NON-CURRENT ASSETS (CONTINUED) 
 
The calculations of value in use for both Pact Australia and Pact International CGU’s are sensitive to the following assumptions:  
  Gross margins and raw material price movement – Gross margins are based on average budgeted (next years) margins 
which reflect current gross margins adjusted for any expected (and likely) efficiency improvements or price changes.  
  Cash Flows – Cash flows beyond the one year period are extrapolated using growth rates which are a combination of
volume growth and price growth. Rates are based on published industry research and economic forecasts relating to GDP 
growth rates. The long term growth rates are in the range of 2.3% - 6.0% (2015: 2.7% - 6.0%).
  Discount rates – The discount rates for each CGU are calculated using rates based on an external assessment of the 
Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital in conjunction with risk factors specific to the countries in which the CGU’s 
operate. Foreign currency cash flows are discounted using the functional currency of the CGU’s and then translated to 
Australian Dollars using the closing exchange rate. The pre-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections are in the 
range of 11.3% - 20.0% (2015: 11.0% -19.0%).
With regard to the assessment of value in use, management believes that no reasonable change in any of the above key 
assumptions would cause the carrying value of the CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
FINANCIAL REPORT – NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities;    
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses; and 
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
How Pact accounts for goodwill 
Goodwill is: 
 
 
 
 
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the CGU (or group of CGU’s), to which the goodwill relates. 
When the recoverable amount of the CGU (or group of CGU’s) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised.  
 
When goodwill forms part of a CGU (or group of CGU’s) and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal 
of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this manner is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and 
the portion of the CGU’s retained.

(1)  The Group leases buildings and plant and equipment such as office equipment and motor vehicles. The Group has
determined that it does not obtain all the significant risks and rewards of the buildings, office equipment and motor vehicles 
and has thus classified the leases as operating leases. Rental payments are generally fixed, but with inflation escalation 
clauses. These are accounted for through the fixed rent provision. Property leases generally provide the Group with a right 
of renewal at which time terms are renegotiated. There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these 
leases.
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases contracted for but not capitalised in the 
financial statements are payable as follows:

(1)   Business reorganisation - The business reorganisation program (announced in 2015) relates to the optimisation of business
facilities by eliminating excess capacity. That program is expected to be completed in 2017.
(2)   Fixed rent - Annual rentals for some of the property operating leases increase annually by fixed increments. The provision 
has been recognised to apportion these increments on a straight line basis over the minimum non-cancellable lease term.
(3)   Make good on leased premises - In accordance with the form of lease agreements, the Group may be required to restore 
leased premises to their original condition at the end of the lease term and upon exiting the site. The provision is based on 
the costs which are expected to be incurred using historical costs as a guide. During the year, the Group reduced its 
property make good provisions by $4.0m following a review of contractual obligations, actual make good expenditure 
incurred and the renegotiation of existing leases.
Key Estimates and Judgements – Business reorganisation  
Business reorganisation provisions are only recognised when a detailed plan has been approved and the business 
reorganisation has either commenced or been publicly announced, or contracts relating to the business reorganisation 
have been entered into. Costs related to ongoing activities are not provided for.
the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and  
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
How Pact accounts for other provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the following three criteria are met: 
 
 
 
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the reporting date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a financing cost.

borrowing amount less directly attributable transaction costs.
Initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
During the current and prior year, there were no defaults or breaches on any of the loan terms and conditions. 
 
 
How Pact accounts for loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are: 
 
  Subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is calculated based on the principal 
  Are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
 
Fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are determined by using a discounted cash flow method, 
applying a discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate at the end of the reporting period. As the underlying debt has a 
floating interest rate (excluding the impact of the separate interest rate swaps), the Group’s own performance risk at 30 June 
2016 was assessed to be insignificant.  
 
The carrying amount of the Group’s current and non-current borrowings materially approximates fair value. The computation of 
the fair value of borrowings is derived using significant observable inputs (Fair Value Hierarchy Level 2). 
 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Finance costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition of, 
or production of, a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset using the weighted average cost of 
borrowings.

What is the risk? 
Pact has variable 
interest rate debt, and 
therefore if interest 
rates increase, the 
amount of interest 
Pact is required to pay 
would also increase.
How does Pact manage this risk? 
  Utilises interest rate swaps to lock 
in the amount of interest that Pact 
will be required to pay.
  Considers alternative financing
and mix of fixed and variable 
debt, as appropriate.
Impact at 30 June 2016 
At 30 June 2016, the Group hedge cover is 44%  
(2015: 52%) of its long term variable debt excluding 
working capital facilities. 
 
Sensitivity analysis performed by management showed 
that a +1% in AUD interest rates would reduce net profit 
after tax by $1.1 million and reduce equity by $0.5m 
(2015: $0.5 million reduction in net profit after tax and 
$1.8m increase in equity). 
 
Sensitivity analysis performed by management showed

There are a number of financial risks the Group is exposed to that could adversely affect the achievement of future business 
performance. The Group’s risk management program seeks to mitigate risks and reduce volatility in the Group’s financial 
performance. Financial risk management is managed centrally by the Treasury Risk Management Committee. 
 
The Group’s principal financial risks are: 
 
 
  Foreign currency risk; 
  Liquidity risk; 
  Credit risk; and 
  Commodity price risk.
Interest rate risk;
Managing interest rate risk 
Pact seeks to manage its finance costs by assessing and, where appropriate, utilising a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. 
When variable debt is utilised it exposes the Group to interest rate risk.
(1)  The impact of a +/- 1% movement in interest rates was determined based on the Group’s mix of debt, credit standing with
finance institutions, the level of debt that is expected to be renewed and economic forecasters’ expectations.
Managing foreign currency risk  
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates to the Group’s (i) operating activities which are 
denominated in a different currency from the entities functional currency, (ii) financing activities, and (iii) net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries. 
 
The Group currently operates in six countries outside of Australia, with the following functional currencies:
Country of domicile 
Functional Currency
New Zealand 
NZD
Thailand 
THB
Singapore 
USD
China

FINANCIAL REPORT – NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.3 MANAGING OUR FINANCIAL RISKS (CONTINUED) 
 
As Pact has an Australian dollar (AUD) presentation currency, which is also the functional currency of its Australian entities, this 
exposes Pact to foreign exchange rate risk.
Impact at 30 June 2016
The Group has a significant exposure to the USD 
against the AUD and NZD from USD purchase 
commitments, while the Group’s exposure to sales 
denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the operating entity is less than 1%.  
 
At 30 June 2016, the Group has the majority of its 
foreign currency committed purchase orders hedged. 
 
Sensitivity analysis of the foreign currency contracts was 
performed to movements in the Australian dollar against 
the relevant foreign currencies, with all other variables 
held constant, taking into account all underlying 
exposures and related hedges. 
 
This analysis showed that a 10% movement in its major 
trading currencies would not materially impact net profit 
after tax or equity. 
There is no material impact from a change in FX rates in 
other functional currencies on net profit after tax or 
equity, if the movement was within +/- 10%.
What is the risk?
If transactions are 
denominated in currencies 
other than the functional 
currency of the operating 
entity, there is a risk of an 
unfavourable financial impact 
to earnings if there is an 
adverse currency movement.
How does Pact manage 
this risk? 
  Utilises forward 
foreign currency 
contracts to eliminate 
or reduce currency 
exposures of 
individual 
transactions once the 
Group has entered 
into a firm 
commitment for a 
sale or purchase.
As Pact’s overseas entities do 
not have an Australian dollar 
(AUD) functional currency, if 
currency rates move adversely 
compared to the AUD, then 
the amount of AUD-equivalent 
profit would decrease and the 
balance sheet net investment 
value would decline.
  Pact utilises
borrowing in the 
functional currency of 
the overseas entity to 
naturally hedge 
offshore entities 
where considered 
appropriate. The 
foreign currency debt 
provides a balance 
sheet hedge of the 
asset, while the 
foreign currency 
interest cost provides 
a natural hedge of the 
offshore profit.
How Pact accounts for foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the individual entity by applying the 
exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at reporting date.  
 
Non-monetary items that are measured at: 
  Historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. 
  Fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.  
 
As at the reporting date the assets and liabilities of the controlled entities with non-Australian dollar functional currency are 
translated into the presentation currency of Pact at the rate of exchange at the reporting date and their statements of 
comprehensive income are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the year (where appropriate). 
  
The exchange rate differences arising on the translation to presentation currency are taken directly to the foreign currency 
translation reserve, in equity.  
 
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation 
is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

4.3 MANAGING OUR FINANCIAL RISKS (CONTINUED) 
 
Managing liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the financial liabilities of the Group and the Group’s ability to meet its obligations to repay these 
financial liabilities as and when they fall due. Pact has a range of liabilities at 30 June that will be required to be settled at some 
future date.
What is the risk? 
The risk that Pact 
cannot meet its 
obligations to repay its 
financial liabilities as 
and when they fall 
due.
How does Pact manage this risk? 
  Having access to an adequate
amount of committed credit 
facilities.
  Maintains a balance between
continuity of funding and flexibility 
through the use of bank 
overdrafts, loans and debtor 
securitisation.
$197.3 million of unused credit within its syndicated 
facilitates; and 
$20.2 million unused overdraft facility.
Impact at 30 June 2016 
The Group is in a net current asset deficiency of  
$31.7 million at balance date, however it has: 
 
 
 
The Directors have assessed that due to the Group’s 
access to undrawn facilities and forecast positive cash 
flows into the future they will be able to pay their debts 
as and when they fall due, and therefore it is appropriate 
the financial statements are prepared on a going

4.3 MANAGING OUR FINANCIAL RISKS (CONTINUED) 
 
Managing credit risk 
Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to meet their obligations under a contract or 
arrangement.  The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and 
financing activities.  The Group manages this risk through the following measures: 
  Operating activities: The Group has in place a number of mechanisms to manage its exposure to customer credit risk, 
discussed in Note 3.1, including a debtor’s securitisation program where substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
receivables within the program are transferred to a third party.
  Financial activities: Restricting dealings to counterparties with high credit ratings and limiting concentration of credit risk.  
The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at the end of the reporting period is equivalent to 
the carrying amount as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
 
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities, mainly resin.  In managing this risk the Group is 
generally able to pass on the price risk contractually with customers through rise and fall adjustments. 
 
Utilising hedging contracts to manage risk 
As discussed above, the Group utilises interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its risks associated 
with  interest  rate  and  foreign  currency  fluctuations.  All  of  Pact’s  hedging  instruments  are  designated  in  cash  flow  hedging 
relationships, providing increased certainty over future cash flows associated with foreign currency purchases or interest payments 
on variable interest rate debt facilities. 
 
How Pact accounts for derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship 
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the 
Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The 
documentation includes: 
 
 

identification of the hedging instrument;  
the hedged item or transaction; and 
the nature of the risk being hedged; and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the 
exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are 
expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing 
basis to determine that they have actually been highly effective throughout the financial reporting period for which they 
were designated.
Derivative financial instruments are: 
  Recorded at fair value at inception and every subsequent reporting date. 
  Classified as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.  
 
The fair value of: 
  Forward currency contracts is calculated by using valuation techniques such as present value techniques, comparison to 
similar instruments for which market observable prices exist and other relevant models used by market participants. These 
valuation techniques use both observable and unobservable market inputs, which are not considered to be significant (Fair 
value hierarchy level 2).
instruments.
  Cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar 
 
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.  
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when the hedge transaction 
affects the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or 
when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts 
taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. 
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without 
replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity 
until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction to which the hedging instrument relates is not expected to occur, 
the amount is taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

How Pact accounts for employee benefits  
Provision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the reporting date. 
These benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave and long service leave.  
 
Benefits expected to be settled within twelve months of the reporting date are classified as current and are measured at their 
nominal amounts based on remuneration rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled.  
 
The liability for long service leave is recognised and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in 
respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Under this method 
consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. 
Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds (except for 
Australia where high quality corporate bond rates are used in accordance with the standards) with terms to maturity and 
currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.  
 
 
5.2 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS 
  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
An LTIP was introduced in FY2016 as a component of the CEO’s remuneration, comprising the issue of Performance Rights.  
The CEO is the sole participant in the LTIP for the current period and is entitled to performance rights equal to 100% of annual 
base salary with a vesting period of three years. The LTIP scheme commenced on 1 December 2015. Details of the LTIP can 
be found on page 9 of the Directors Report. 
For the year ended 30 June 2016, 146,444 performance rights are expected to be granted to the CEO. These rights were 
independently valued to establish the fair value in accordance with AASB2 Share Based Payments. The fair value of each right 
at the valuation date of 22 June 2016 is $3.85. A total share based payment expense of $127,312 in relation to the LTIP has 
been recognised in the current year. 
 
The key assumptions in the independent valuation were as follows:
Share price at valuation date 
Annualised volatility 
Annual dividend yield 
Risk free rate

Terms and conditions of property leases with related parties 
The Group leased 16 properties (13 in Australia and 3 in New Zealand) from Centralbridge Pty Ltd (as trustee for the 
Centralbridge Unit Trust), Centralbridge Two Pty Ltd, Centralbridge (NZ) Limited and Albury Property Holdings Pty Ltd 
(“Centralbridge Entities”), which are each controlled by entities associated with Mr Raphael Geminder and are therefore related 
parties of the Group (“Centralbridge Leases”). The aggregate annual rent payable by Pact under the Centralbridge Leases for 
the year ended 30 June 2016 was $6.6 million (2015: $6.6 million). The rent payable under these leases was determined based 
on independent valuations and market conditions at the time the leases were entered into.  
Of the Centralbridge Leases in Australia:



seven of the leases contain early termination rights in favour of the landlord to terminate the lease at the expiry of the 
6th and 9th term; 
two of the leases contain early termination rights in favour of the landlord to terminate the lease at the expiry of the 8th 
term; and  
two of the leases do not contain standard default provisions which give the landlord the right to terminate the lease in 
the event of default.
Except as set out above, the Centralbridge Leases in Australia are on arm’s length terms. 
Of the Centralbridge Leases in New Zealand, three of the leases contain early termination rights in favour of the landlord to 
terminate the lease at the expiry of the 6th and 9th term. With the exception of the early termination right, the Centralbridge 
Leases in New Zealand are on terms which are not uncommon for leases of commercial premises. 
 
Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties  
The purchases from and sales to related parties are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions. 
Outstanding balances at the end of the period are unsecured and interest free and settlement occurs in cash. There have been 
no guarantees provided or received for any related party receivables or payables. For the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group 
has not recorded any impairment of receivables relating to amounts owed by related parties (2015: nil).

Pact has a number of Australian entities that are part to a Deed of Cross Guarantee (Deed), representing the ‘Closed Group’, 
entered into in accordance with ASIC Class Order 98/1418. This Deed grants these entities relief from preparing and lodging 
audited financial statements under the Corporations Act 2001.   
 
The Closed Group is in a net current asset deficiency at balance date, however the Directors have assessed that due to the 
Group’s access to undrawn facilities and forecast positive cash flows into the future they will be able to pay their debts as and 
when they fall due (refer Note 4.3 Managing our financial risks).

circumstances which have arisen between 30 June 2016 and the date of this report that have significantly affected or may

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Pact Group Holdings
Ltd
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Pact Group Holdings Ltd, which comprises the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2016, the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from
time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of
the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 6.1,
the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial
Statements, that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity's internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.
