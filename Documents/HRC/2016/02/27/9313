<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Lithuania and in pursuance of his mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance visited Lithuania from 16 to 19 September 2007 to assess the situation of 
issues pertaining to his mandate. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with State authorities as 
well as with civil society, representatives of minority communities and victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concluded that there is a solid legal and institutional framework in 
place to tackle racism and discrimination in Lithuania, but that further steps need to be taken to 
ensure the full and complete application of existing legislation. He highlighted the existence of a 
historical multicultural tradition in Lithuania that will be useful to overcome the challenges that 
the country will face in the future. However, the Special Rapporteur found areas of concern, 
particularly regarding historical minorities like people of Russian descent and some vulnerable 
groups, notably Romas and non-European new migrants. In particular, he noted with concern the 
profound discrimination faced by the Roma community, particularly in the fields of employment, 
education and housing. Non-European minorities have also faced growing problems in terms of 
racist violence as well as hate speech. Contrary to traditional minorities, which have been present 
in the country for decades or centuries, these new migrants pose new identity problems that need 
to be overcome through the promotion of tolerance and multiculturalism. 
</p>
<p> Lithuania, as several Eastern European and Baltic countries, is currently at a turning point 
in history. After the restoration of its independence in 1990, Lithuania started its integration into 
the globalized world, a process that carries a number of challenges demanding constant vigilance 
by authorities and civil society alike. The most important challenge, shared by all Baltic States, 
is the balance between the continuity of a nation with profound historical roots and the dynamic 
of a new multicultural identity inherited from its recent history. Another pressing challenge is to 
prepare its society for the arrival of new waves of non-European migrants bearing different 
traditions, cultures and religions. This challenge is also an opportunity of enriching the 
Lithuanian society with more diversity, intercultural dialogue and interaction. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates several recommendations, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; State authorities should highlight their strong political will and commitment to fight all 
forms of racism and discrimination as well as their vigilance and sensitivity to the 
dynamics of multiculturalism and identity changes faced by its society; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The Government should promote a profound process of multiculturalism based on the 
recognition and respect for the cultural and religious diversity of its different 
communities, old and recent, and the strengthening of the unity of the nation. Education, 
in particular the writing and teaching of history based on this logic, should play a key 
role; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The Government should take steps to complement the legal framework that is in place 
with measures that fill the protection gaps that still exist. In particular, the Criminal 
Code should be amended to introduce a provision that makes committing an offence 
with a racist motivation or aim an aggravating circumstance allowing for a more severe 
punishment for perpetrators of these acts; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The Government should extend and reinforce its National Programme for the 
Integration of Roma in the Lithuanian Society, aiming at both promoting and respecting 
their cultural identity and at eradicating their social and economic marginalization, in 
particular poor housing conditions, the high number of dropouts and poor achievement 
of Roma children at school, and the difficulties that the Roma have in accessing 
employment. The programme should also have a strong component that focuses on 
non-Roma citizens, sensitizing Lithuanian society at large to Roma history and 
traditions, in order to eliminate the stigma and negative stereotypes with which the 
Roma are recurrently associated; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Civil society in Lithuania should further strengthen and reinforce its monitoring role for 
human rights violations, particularly in the realm of racism and discrimination. In 
particular, NGOs should strive to offer victims legal counsel and access to national and 
international institutions, including those at the regional level; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; In parallel with a political and legal strategy, the Government should adopt an ethical 
and cultural strategy that addresses the deepest roots of racism, xenophobia and 
intolerance and is built around the promotion of reciprocal knowledge of cultures, 
values and the dynamics of interactions and living together among the different 
communities. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur visited Lithuania (Vilnius, 
Trakai and Visaginas) from 16 to 19 September 2007. At the government level, he held meetings 
with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Education and Science, Culture, Social Security, 
the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior, representatives of its Migration and Police 
Departments, and the Director of the Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living 
Abroad. The Special Rapporteur also met with the President of the Supreme Court, the President 
of the Seimas (Parliament) and members of its Committee on Human Rights, the Ombudsperson 
for Children&#8217;s Rights, the Ombudsperson for Equal Opportunities, the Deputy Head of the 
Prosecution Service at the Office of the General Prosecutor and the Inspector of Journalist 
Ethics. At the local level, he also met with the Vice-Mayor of Visaginas. 
</p>
<p>2. Apart from the agenda with the Government and State institutions, the Special Rapporteur 
also had extensive meetings with representatives of civil society organizations that are active in 
the realm of racism and xenophobia, minority communities as well as victims of racism and 
racial discrimination. He visited Roma and Jewish communities in Vilnius and the Kara&#239;te 
community in Trakai. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Lithuanian National Museum in 
Vilnius. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of Lithuania for 
its cooperation and openness throughout the visit. He also wishes to thank the United Nations 
Country Team in Vilnius, in particular the staff of the United Nations Development Programme, 
for its outstanding support. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Historical and political context 
</b></p>
<p>4. Lithuania has existed as an independent political entity and internationally recognized 
nation for many centuries, with the first reference to Lithuania as a nation dating back to 1009. 
Lithuanian statehood first emerged with the creation of the Kingdom of Lithuania in 1253, which 
extended into modern-day Belarus and Ukraine, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. 
In the late fourteenth century, when Lithuania and Poland shared the same ruler, the 
Christianization of the country took place, influencing particularly the upper classes. Apart from 
Christianity and family links among royalty, a number of political factors made Lithuania and 
Poland converge, culminating in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that lasted until 1795. 
Polish influence in Lithuanian cultural and social life became stronger during this period. Polish 
became an official language in 1697, used particularly by the upper classes and the nobility. 
</p>
<p>5. Lithuania fell under Imperial Russia in 1795, shortly before the Napoleonic wars. After the 
French army&#8217;s withdrawal from the Baltics, Tsar Nicholas I put forward a policy of Russification 
of the region. The Lithuanian language and the Latin alphabet were banned in schools. 
Furthermore, with the widespread use of Polish by the upper classes, Lithuanian became 
relegated to being a language for the poor and lower middle classes. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>6. Historians speak of a Lithuanian national revival starting in the late nineteenth century, 
with disfavoured classes continuing to carry Lithuanian traditions and subsequently spreading to 
society as a whole. Writings started to praise the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and to refer to 
national heroes and cultural traditions. This movement, which was initially cultural, spilled over 
to politics, fostering the emergence of nationalist independence movements and organizations 
opposing Russian influence. With the start of the First World War, these nationalist movements 
gained strength and independence was acquired after the German defeat. Vilnius, however, 
remained under Polish control from 1920 until the start of the Second World War. 
</p>
<p>7. The history of Lithuania, as of the other Baltic countries, after the start of the Second 
World War bears profound consequences for contemporary issues. The Molotov-Ribbentrop 
pact, although originally assigning Lithuania to Nazi Germany&#8217;s sphere of influence, led to the 
first Soviet occupation in 1940-1941 and the creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Republic. Mass 
deportations of Lithuanians to Russia, particularly Siberia, took place in this period. Around 
60,000 persons are believed to been deported in 1940-1941. After the German invasion of the 
Soviet Union, Lithuania was quickly annexed to Nazi Germany and remained under German 
occupation until 1944. 
</p>
<p>8. Nazi occupation brought with it the consequences of the Holocaust. Lithuania used to be 
an important Jewish centre, from the end of the eighteenth century until the Second World War. 
It was home to some 160,000 Jews prior to the war, a number that increased to 250,000 after the 
arrival of Jewish refugees, particularly from Poland. Around 200,000 Jews, or 90 per cent of the 
Jewish population, were killed during the war. Following the Holocaust and the post-war 
emigration, only 4,000 live in Lithuania today. 
</p>
<p>9. Lithuania was reoccupied by the Soviet Union in 1944 and remained so until 1990. The 
first decade after the Second World War was marked by what many historians call an attempted 
Russification of Lithuanian society. In particular, several waves of mass deportations took place 
in these years. An estimated 780,922 people were killed, deported or forced to emigrate from 
Lithuania between 1940 and 1952, mainly to Siberia and Central Asia. One of the long-lasting 
effects of occupation was the change of the demographic situation within Lithuania, with the 
arrival of several minorities from other parts of the Soviet Union, including a sizeable Russian 
community. 
</p>
<p>10. After the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, Lithuania engaged in a 
rapprochement with its Western neighbours, both on economic and political grounds. On the 
economic front, far-reaching economic reforms started, including privatization, to move the 
country towards an open economy integrated in global markets. Lithuania gained membership in 
both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in 2004. 
EU membership in particular led to the implementation of several reforms aimed at adapting 
internal legislation to EU directives. This process had an important impact in policies aimed at 
the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Demographic, ethnic and religious composition  
</b></p>
<p>11. Lithuania has historically been a multicultural society with a core national identity. 
According to the 2001 census, Lithuania has a population of around 3.5 million, 83.5 per cent of  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>which is of Lithuanian origin. Other large ethnic groups are Poles (6.7 per cent), Russians 
(6.3 per cent) and Belarusians (1.2 per cent) and Ukrainians (0.7 per cent). A number of smaller 
communities are also present, including Jews, Latvians, Tatars, Germans and Roma.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Lithuania has historically been a country with high levels of emigration. In the first half of 
the twentieth century, migration to North and South America made Lithuania one of the 
European countries with the highest percentage of its population having emigrated. Forceful 
deportations during the Soviet occupation also led to the establishment of Lithuanian 
communities in Siberia and Central Asia. Following accession to the EU, important outward 
migratory dynamics started to emerge, as Lithuanians move to higher-wage markets in the 
United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and other EU member States. At present, an estimated 1.5 
to 2 million Lithuanians are believed to live abroad. 
</p>
<p>13. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in Lithuania, as 2.7 million 
Lithuanians (79 per cent of the population) identify themselves with this religious denomination. 
During communist rule, Catholicism was severely persecuted and became a symbol of national 
identity. Other sizeable religious groups are Russian Orthodox (4.1 per cent) and Protestants 
(1.9 per cent). Atheists amount to 9.5 per cent of the population. The Jewish and Muslim 
communities are numbered in the low thousands. A small but active community of Kara&#239;tes, a 
group of ethnic Turkic adherents of Kara&#239;te Judaism, is located in the city of Trakai.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Political and administrative structure 
</b></p>
<p>14. Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy whose head of government is the Prime Minister. 
Legislative power is unicameral and exercised by a Parliament (Seimas) composed of 
141 members, 71 of whom are directly elected, while the other 70 are elected on a proportional 
basis. To be represented in Parliament, parties need to obtain 5 per cent of the national vote. 
However, parties representing national minorities are exempt from this threshold. A multiparty 
system is in place and the Government is traditionally composed of coalitions. The higher 
instances of the judiciary are composed of a Supreme Court and a Court of Appeals as well as, 
for administrative matters, a High Administrative Court. Issues relating to conformity with the 
Constitution are dealt with by the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>15. The larger subnational administrative divisions are the counties (<i>apskritis</i>), which are ruled 
by governors (<i>apskrites vir&#353;ininkas</i>) appointed by the national Government. The counties are 
further subdivided into municipalities (<i>savivaldyb</i>&#279;<i>s</i>). Municipalities are governed by municipal 
councils that are elected through direct suffrage and are responsible for appointing mayors. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>16. Lithuania is party to most of the major international human rights instruments, including 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols, the 
</p>

<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).<b>3</b> Most notably, Lithuania has also 
recently ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the Council of 
Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. 
</p>
<p>17. At the European level, Lithuania has yet to become a party to other legal instruments that 
are relevant for questions of racism and discrimination, including Protocol No. 12 to the 
European Convention on Human Rights on general non-discrimination, the European 
Convention on Nationality, the Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Local Public 
Life at Local Level and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur carried out extensive meetings with authorities at the executive, 
legislative and judiciary branches to collect their views and opinions as well as information 
concerning government programmes, legislation, judicial decisions, etc. Additionally, an agenda 
for meeting with civil society organizations, communities and associations representing minority 
groups, victims of discrimination, journalists and student leaders was organized. 
</p><p>19. In order to objectively and comprehensively assess the situation of racism, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia, the Special Rapporteur structured his meetings with interlocutors 
around three questions: (a) Is there racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance in Lithuania?; (b) If so, who are their main victims and what are the main 
manifestations and expressions?; (c) What are or should be the governmental policies and 
programmes to fight these phenomena at the political, legal and cultural levels? 
</p>
<p>20. Chapter II of this report analyses the political and legal strategy adopted by State 
institutions in Lithuania, emphasizing the perceptions of State officials concerning racism and 
discrimination in the country. Subsequently, chapter III introduces the views of civil society 
organizations, representatives of minorities and victims of discrimination. This is followed by an 
analysis by the Special Rapporteur of chapter IV and his recommendations to both the 
Government of Lithuania and civil society organizations in chapter V.

Rights of the Child (CRC) and its two Optional Protocols. It has also signed the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocols. Lithuania is not a party of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families.

<p><b>II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK, PUBLIC POLICIES 
AND VIEWS OF STATE OFFICIALS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. The legal and institutional framework to 
combat racism and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>21. The general legal provision of equal treatment is established by article 29 of the 
Constitution, which states that &#8220;all persons shall be equal before the law, the court and other 
State institutions and officers&#8221; and that &#8220;a person may not have his or her rights restricted in any 
way, or be granted any privileges, on the basis of his or her sex, race, nationality, language, 
origin, social status, religion, conviction or opinions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. Under article 25 of the Constitution, incitement of racial, religious, national or social 
hatred, violence or discrimination is prohibited, are deemed incompatible with freedom of 
expression and considered as criminal actions. 
</p>
<p>23. Particular rights of national communities are also established by the Constitution. Under 
article 37, citizens belonging to ethnic communities are granted the right to foster their language, 
culture and customs. Article 45 establishes that &#8220;ethnic communities shall independently 
administer the affairs of their ethnic culture&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>The Law on Equal Treatment and the Equal Opportunities Ombudsperson 
</b></p>
<p>24. The broad provisions established in the Constitution are specified in the Law on Equal 
Treatment approved on 18 November 2003, entering into force on 1 January 2005. The purpose 
of the Law is to &#8220;ensure the implementation of human rights laid down in the Constitution&#8221; and 
&#8220;to prohibit any direct or indirect discrimination based upon age, sexual orientation, disability, 
racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs&#8221; (art. 1.1). The Law makes explicit reference to 
Lithuania&#8217;s human rights obligations laid down in both international and national instruments 
and spells out the specific responsibilities of State and municipal institutions, educational 
institutions, employers and consumer service providers. 
</p>
<p>25. Apart from containing a legal prohibition against discrimination, the Law on Equal 
Treatment also defines some positive measures that are to be taken by State authorities to redress 
potential discrimination. These include the drafting and implementation of &#8220;programmes and 
measures designated for ensuring equal treatment&#8221; and the provision of &#8220;assistance to the 
programmes of religious communities, associations and centres, other non-governmental 
organizations, public agencies and charity and sponsorship foundations, which assist in the 
implementation of equal treatment&#8221; (art. 3). 
</p>
<p>26. The Law on Equal Treatment expanded the role of the Equal Opportunities Ombudsperson, 
who is responsible to receive complaints from persons that allege being subject to discriminatory 
actions and to oversee the general implementation of the Law. Prior to 2005, the Ombudsperson 
was responsible primarily for issues of gender equality. However, since the adoption of the Law 
on Equal Treatment, its mandate was expanded to cover various forms of discrimination, namely 
on the basis of age, sexual orientation, disability, racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs. The </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>Ombudsperson is allowed to investigate complaints filed not only by citizens, but also foreigners 
and stateless persons. An important element of the Ombudsperson&#8217;s mandate is the power to 
initiate investigations at her discretion and not only in response to existing complaints. 
</p>
<p>27. After investigating a complaint, the Ombudsperson has an array of possible responses, 
including referring the case to investigative bodies, to recommend that an institution ceases to 
perform actions violating equal opportunities, to repeal a legal act violating equal opportunities, 
to impose administrative sanctions and to issue a warning about the offence committed. These 
recommendations are legally binding; non-compliance is liable and may lead to administrative 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p>28. Until September 2007, the Office of the Ombudsperson had received 20 complaints of 
discrimination based on ethnic origin, an increase relative to previous years. The majority of 
these cases concern discrimination by administrative State institutions and in the realm of 
employment. 
</p>
<p>29. The Ombudsperson informed the Special Rapporteur that a considerable part of her 
activities also refer to awareness-raising, particularly dissemination of information to people 
concerning their rights and training of public officials regarding non-discrimination. In this 
regard, the Office of the Ombudsperson has organized training courses for police officers, border 
security guards, the fire department, journalists and lawyers. In terms of awareness-raising, it is 
of particular importance to note that the year of 2007 has been declared Year for Equal 
Opportunities for All in Lithuania and that a number of activities in this realm have been 
organized by the Office of the Ombudsperson. 
</p>
<p><b>Law on National Minorities and the Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians 
Living Abroad 
</b></p>
<p>30. The general provisions of the Constitution are also complemented by the Law on National 
Minorities, which recognizes notably that &#8220;the cultural heritage connected with a national 
(ethnic) minority is an integral part of the cultural heritage of the Republic of Lithuania&#8221;. This 
Law, similarly to the Law on Equal Treatment, establishes a general prohibition on 
discrimination based on national or ethnic origin whilst defining positive actions to advance 
minority cultures. In particular, it ascertains the State obligation to promote the national 
consciousness and self-expression of minorities &#8220;to foster and develop the culture, language, 
customs and traditions of their nation or ethnic group and to preserve their national/ethnic 
identity&#8221; (art. 3.2). 
</p>
<p>31. The Law on National Minorities establishes a particular set of rights for persons belonging 
to national minorities, which includes the right to the State&#8217;s support in developing their national 
culture and education; the right to use the language of their national minority; the right to be  
taught the minority language or to receive instruction in this language; the right to receive and 
impart information and ideas in the minority language; the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or 
belief and to establish religious communities and associations; the right to use minority symbols 
and celebrate minority holidays. Furthermore, the Law also establishes the principle that in areas 
inhabited by a large number of persons belonging to a national minority, these persons may 
request to address State institutions in their minority language. Implementation of the Law is 
entrusted to the Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living Abroad. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>32. The Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living Abroad is responsible for 
the protection of rights of persons belonging to national minorities, safeguarding of their 
interests, attending to their needs and care for the preservation of national identity and heritage.<b>5</b> 
The Department is directly supported by an advisory Council of National Minorities, gathering 
representatives of some 20 communities, who make recommendations to the Department, the 
Seimas and the Government as a whole. The Department is also responsible for promoting 
Lithuanian culture abroad, particularly by supporting activities developed by the Lithuanian 
diaspora, which has some 1.5 to 2 million members worldwide. 
</p>
<p>33. Apart from policy consultation, one of the roles of the Department is to provide support, 
including funding, to initiatives developed by minority communities in Lithuania. A number of 
cultural centres that promote minority cultures are being supported by the Department around the 
country. In particular, the Special Rapporteur visited the Roma community centre in the outskirts 
of Vilnius, the Jewish Tolerance Centre in Vilnius, the Kara&#239;te Society in Trakai and a 
multicultural centre in Visaginas. In this regard, the Department is designed to promote a 
predominantly cultural strategy to promote integration and multiculturalism and foster minority 
cultures, thus complementing the legal measures that have been established to fight racism and 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Policies and measures to combat racism and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Government&#8217;s approach to national minorities was summarized by the Director of the 
Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living Abroad as an attempt &#8220;to build a new 
Lithuanian State with the minorities that live in Lithuania&#8221;. In particular, this Department ruled 
out any possibility of fostering integration by assimilation, emphasizing the importance of 
national minorities maintaining and promoting their cultural traditions within a multicultural 
State. 
</p>
<p>35. A number of different authorities at the Ministerial level have informed the Special 
Rapporteur about activities and programmes that are being developed in their particular mandate 
areas to fight racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. These include 
actions in the area of education, culture, social security and labour. 
</p>
<p>36. The Ministry of Education relies on a strategy, based on constitutional requirements, to 
promote education in the minority language. An explicit policy decision in this regard was that 
&#8220;the mother tongue of minorities should not be relegated to second place&#8221;, as expressed by the 
Minister herself. Under the Law on Education, in municipalities with a substantial national 
minority, upon the community&#8217;s request, education is granted in the minority language. In 
2006/07, in terms of language instruction, the number of secondary schools was the following: 
64 Polish and 17 Polish-Lithuanian; 44 Russian and 20 Lithuanian-Russian; 13 Polish-Russian 
schools; 5 Lithuanian-Russian-Polish schools; and 1 Byelorussian. Additionally, there is a 
Jewish and a German school that combine instruction in Lithuanian with Jewish or German 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4

</p>
<p>language courses, history and culture. In this period, 4.5 per cent of the student population were 
studying in Russian, and 3.4 per cent in Polish. Funding at minority schools is substantially 
higher than for Lithuanian schools, on the order of 10 per cent more per student. 
</p>
<p>37. As concerns the promotion of tolerance and intercultural dialogue, the Special Rapporteur 
was also informed that Lithuania, through its Ministry of Culture, has put in place a strategy that 
focuses on four main principles: the promotion of minority cultures; the implementation of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Convention on 
Cultural Diversity; the coordination of the European programme on dialogue among cultures; 
and the preparation of activities for 2009, when Vilnius will be the European capital of culture. 
For this particular celebration, the Ministry of Culture has planned a number of activities that 
emphasize the role of multiculturalism and intercultural dialogue as cornerstones of Lithuanian 
culture. Three broad principles are followed while implementing cultural policy: every member 
of society has the right to participate; Lithuanians and national communities have the right to 
preserve and foster their national culture; conditions are created to spread Lithuanian culture 
internationally and to familiarize Lithuanians with other nations&#8217; cultures.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>38. The Minister of Social Security and Labour highlighted the importance of implementing 
EU directives on race, equality of chances and labour market. In what concerns the labour 
market, these new directives will allow for NGOs and other associations to file formal 
complaints that lead to judicial proceedings in cases of discrimination. The Minister also 
emphasized the advocacy role played by her Ministry in order to raise awareness among the 
population, particularly employers, regarding existing norms and legislation on 
non-discrimination. A particular project that was mentioned concerned the integration of 
refugees in the labour market, where targeted actions to promote tolerance towards incoming 
refugees and asylum-seekers are being developed. Finally, the Ministry stressed that the 
Government of Lithuania&#8217;s social policy is based on the cross-cutting concept of social 
solidarity, which is closely connected to a vision of tolerance and respect for diversity. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Perceptions and reactions of State officials and government agencies 
</b></p>
<p>39. Most public authorities interviewed by the Special Rapporteur, including the Chairman of 
the Seimas, the President of the Supreme Court and various ministers, expressed the view that 
racism is not a widespread and structural phenomenon in Lithuania, but rather a problem 
reflected in isolated instances. In particular, these interlocutors emphasized that racism and 
discrimination do not exist in legislative or administrative acts in the country. The historical 
background of Lithuania as a multicultural society was emphasized in many of the meetings, 
where the underlying message was that this historical heritage contributes to a spirit of openness 
and respect for diversity. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur noted that many high-level authorities consider the existing legal 
instruments - in particular the Law on Equal Treatment and the Law on National Minorities - as 
an adequate framework to fight racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. The authorities have also praised the mandate and work of the Ombudspersons for 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Ibid., para. 347. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>Equal Opportunity, as well as the Ombudsperson for Children&#8217;s Rights, as important 
mechanisms to ensure that rights are protected and violations are punished. Many authorities, 
including the Minister of Justice, attributed an important role to the process of adapting 
Lithuanian legislation to the requirements of EU membership, in particular the internalization of 
the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, as positive steps that helped improve the legal and institutional 
framework in many areas, including racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>41. Insofar as the full implementation of existing legislation is concerned, many authorities 
highlighted their concern that there are still some shortcomings and room for improvement. In 
particular, they expressed the view that, since an important part of the legislative structure has 
been adopted very recently, it is important to focus on awareness-raising activities, particularly 
the training of public officials so that they are familiar with and compliant to existing laws. Some 
authorities also mentioned the need to spread information among the population at large 
concerning the legislation on racism and discrimination as well as the institutional mechanisms 
that are available to receive complaints and redress existing violations.  
</p>
<p>42.  Several of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors in State institutions remarked on the 
importance of putting the issue of racism and discrimination in its historical context. It was 
pointed out that Lithuanian national identity - particularly language and culture - was severely 
curtailed during the Soviet occupation. According to these statements, the Lithuanian policy was 
now to rely on a radically opposite policy, one that actively recognizes the rights of national 
minorities and that promotes their traditions.  
</p>
<p>43. Officials at the Ministry of Interior also expressed the view that an important policy that 
contributed to creating peaceful relations and tolerance between ethnic communities in Lithuania 
was the zero-option citizenship law after the restoration of independence. According to this law, 
every individual who was living in Lithuania before the restoration of independence in 1990 
(except former members of the Soviet military forces) was granted the option to become a 
Lithuanian citizen. This policy has virtually eliminated the problem of statelessness and managed 
to grant national minorities the full set of rights that stems from citizenship. 
</p>
<p>44. Some voices within Lithuanian State institutions expressed a more nuanced view 
concerning racism and discrimination in the country. In particular, the Office of the General 
Prosecutor acknowledged that discrimination exists in Lithuania, adding that it has been trying to 
interpret existing legislation in order to face this challenge. In particular, the concluding 
observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on the report 
presented by Lithuania (CERD/C/ LTU/CO/3) are taken into account when interpreting domestic 
legislation. According to the Office of the General Prosecutor, this includes the CERD 
recommendation that Lithuania adapt its legislation in order to introduce in its criminal law a 
provision that makes committing an offence with a racist motivation or aim an aggravating 
circumstance that allows for a more severe punishment (ibid., para. 7). The Special Rapporteur 
noted with interest that the Office of the General Prosecutor can initiate inquiries concerning 
incitement to racial hatred rather than just reacting to formal complaints. The Deputy General 
Prosecutor highlighted a number of concrete examples of grave issues that were the focus of his 
Office&#8217;s attention, including attacks against African students as well as a Chinese immigrant that 
were not duly registered as racist crimes, and emphasized the need to amend the Criminal Code 
following CERD&#8217;s recommendation.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur asked his counterparts about their views on the issue of racist 
violence, the effectiveness of the State in treating racism as an aggravating circumstance when 
racist crimes are committed and regarding the State&#8217;s role to curb incitement to racial hatred. In 
particular, he highlighted the ongoing discussions at the international level concerning the 
balance between freedom of expression and respect for other rights that are threatened by hate 
speech. 
</p>
<p>46. In this line, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court explicitly mentioned the provisions in 
the Criminal Code that establish criminal responsibility for incitement to racial, ethnic or 
religious hatred. However, he also highlighted that even though Courts are aware of this 
provision, they are rarely used due to the limited number of cases that reach them. He expressed 
his view that an important number of the cases of racist violence are acts of hooliganism and 
vandalism, which are problems that exist in most societies. 
</p>
<p>47. The Minister of Justice also referred to the legal prohibition to incite racial or ethnic hatred 
and exemplified some actions that have taken place in this regard, mentioning a draft law on the 
amendment of the Criminal Code, under consideration by the Parliament, which prohibits the 
public display of Nazi or Soviet symbols.  
</p>
<p>48. Authorities also referred to the role of the Seimas-appointed Inspector of Journalist Ethics 
to examine cases of hate speech contained in the media, including Internet sites. The Special 
Rapporteur met with the inspector to collect his views on this issue. The Inspector has the duty to 
investigate complaints of violations of professional ethics by journalists, editors and publishers, 
which includes cases of incitement to racial hatred published in the printed, audio-visual or 
digital media. The Inspectorate reaffirmed the view that there is no widespread discrimination in 
Lithuanian journalism and that very few cases of hate speech are brought to his attention. 
However, he highlighted some issues where the action of the Inspectorate is important. In 
particular, he referred to cases of journalistic articles regarding criminal cases that make an 
explicit reference to ethnic background when the perpetrator is a member of a minority 
community. He also recalled a recommendation issued by his Office requesting Lithuanian 
newspapers not to publish the cartoons of Prophet Mohammed that had originally appeared in a 
Danish newspaper in 2005. 
</p>
<p>49. Another aspect related to incitement to racial hatred concerns measures to prevent the 
emergence of political parties that promote an openly racist and xenophobic platform. In this 
regard, the Ministry of Justice oversees whether the political programmes of the parties are in 
conformity with national laws and international agreements, including the principle of 
prohibition of racial or ethnic discrimination. According to government officials, Lithuania&#8217;s 
democratic tradition and heritage of tolerance have in practice made it impossible that local 
political parties would promote racist platforms. 
</p>
<p>50. Several political leaders in the Seimas, including the Speaker and the President of the 
Committee on Human Rights, conveyed to the Special Rapporteur the information that political 
parties in Lithuania have not used any type of racist or discriminatory rhetoric in the past and 
that electoral campaigns across the ideological spectrum have not built on such a discourse. In 
this line, even nationalistic parties in Lithuania have refrained from engaging in such rhetoric, 
focusing rather on the foreign relations between Lithuania and its neighbours and not on local 
communities. </p>

</p>
<p><b>III.  VIEWS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMMUNITIES CONCERNED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Concerns in response to State policies and measures 
</b></p>
<p>51. Representatives of civil society organizations and representatives of ethnic minorities 
expressed a different view from that of State officials concerning racism and discrimination in 
Lithuania. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s civil society interlocutors, including human rights 
organizations that make systematic monitoring of racism, have expressed their concern regarding 
a marked increase of intolerance in Lithuania in the past years. In particular, they referred to the 
growing activity of extremists, including neo-Nazi groups, and their involvement in acts of 
physical and verbal aggressions that have taken place in some specific regions, including 
Klaipeda, where an important international university is located. 
</p>
<p>52. According to representatives of civil society, the most direct victims of intolerance are 
visually different minorities, especially non-European migrants, and the Roma community. 
Examples of physical attacks against individuals belonging to these minorities, including foreign 
students, have been brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention by NGOs, lawyers and victims 
themselves.  
</p>
<p>53. Although many civil society representatives expressed a positive assessment concerning 
the existing legal and institutional framework, they pointed to a number of areas where 
improvements could take place. In particular, a transposition of the full provisions of the 
European Union Race Directive was mentioned as a desired outcome that would guarantee 
additional protection to vulnerable groups and facilitate litigation of racism cases. Some NGOs 
also expressed their belief that Lithuania should make a declaration under article 14 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, allowing for 
individual petitions to CERD, in order to strengthen the legal mechanisms to fight racism and 
discrimination. Finally, on the domestic level, civil society organizations requested a 
strengthening of the role of the Ombudsperson, particularly the implementation of her 
recommendations. In their view, the enforceability of these recommendations and in particular 
the sanctions for non-compliance should be strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Views of the Roma community 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur visited the largest Roma settlement in Lithuania (Kirtimai), in the 
outskirts of Vilnius, to receive first-hand information concerning the situation of the Roma 
community. In the settlement, he visited a Roma Community Centre that is funded by the 
Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living Abroad and that functions as 
preparatory school for Roma children living in the area. The Special Rapporteur met with local 
community leaders, visited households and had discussions with a number of families in order to 
hear their concerns regarding their present situation.  
</p>
<p>55. During his visit to the Roma settlement, the Special Rapporteur noted the precarity of 
living conditions, especially housing, to which the community is exposed. In particular, he noted 
the lack of electricity and heating as well as drinking water and sanitation in many houses, 
reportedly due to an inability of some families to pay the fees for public utilities. These families 
often have to rely on firewood as a source of heating, which is subsidized by the municipal 
authorities. Some of the dwellings are also overcrowded, with several families living together. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>The community expressed serious concerns regarding past demolitions conducted by municipal 
authorities in 2004 that removed several houses from the settlement. The demolitions stopped 
after interventions by both the Seimas Ombudsman and the Equal Opportunities Ombudsperson, 
but concern was expressed about the uncertainty of housing rights in the future. Following the 
mission, the Special Rapporteur received the information that in December 2007, the Vilnius 
Regional Administrative Court issued a sentence granting reparations of 5,000 Litas 
(roughly 1,450 euros) for each of the 20 plaintiffs in the case concerning the demolitions 
in 2004. 
</p>
<p>56. The Roma community have denounced the widespread prejudice and discrimination that 
they face in various realms of social life in Lithuania. The main concern expressed by Roma 
leaders and families was discrimination in employment. According to some research-oriented 
NGOs, the unemployment rate among Roma citizens is several times higher than in the rest of 
the population. Individual cases of discrimination in employment were heard by the Special 
Rapporteur, particularly cases where Roma citizens were refused employment once the employer 
discovered their ethnic origin.  
</p>
<p>57. In education, the Roma community also has the lowest attainment rates, which was 
considered by local leaders as a matter of serious concern, especially when one considers that 
almost 50 per cent of Roma citizens are youth.<b>7</b> At the Kirtimai settlement, courses are offered 
for Roma children to prepare them to start mainstream school as well as additional classes for 
pupils that are already attending schools. Although the existence of such a preparatory school in 
Kirtimai is seen as a very positive development, members of the community mentioned that 
Roma children are often subject to prejudice once they start regular schools, pointing to the lack 
of multicultural training for both teachers and pupils in these schools. Roma children have higher 
dropout rates than any other minority, as well as poorer educational achievement. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur asked Roma representatives for their views concerning the 
Programme for the Integration of Roma into Lithuanian Society, implemented by the Department 
of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living Abroad. The general perception was that the 
programme was a positive step, particularly due to the formal recognition by State institutions of 
the difficult situation faced by the Roma community. Local leaders described the actions and 
projects designed by the department on a positive note and as important means to redress the 
situation. However, two major criticisms regarding the programme were raised. First, the 
programme was seen as insufficient to tackle the structural problems that the community faces, 
particularly regarding access to jobs. In particular, Roma leaders pointed out that the actions 
developed by the Department can only be successful if complemented by an engagement of the 
Vilnius municipal authorities, which are directly responsible for a number of practical issues 
concerning the Kirtimai settlement (e.g. land, access to basic services, schooling, etc). Second, 
Roma representatives felt that the community was not satisfactorily consulted or involved in the 
design and implementation of the programme and hence could not voice its major concerns and 
suggestions, which would have an impact on the effectiveness of State actions. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b> See ENAR Shadow Report 2006. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>59. One of the reasons why the Programme for the Integration of Roma into Lithuanian 
Society was criticized was its virtually exclusive focus on actions within the Roma community 
and a lack of attention to broader initiatives that need to take place at the heart of Lithuanian 
society to combat prejudice and further tolerance and respect. Ultimately, the issue that was 
constantly highlighted by Roma leaders in their discussions with the Special Rapporteur was the 
broad question of cultural mentality and acceptance by the Lithuanian society of the Roma as a 
distinct community that is the bearer of social and cultural traditions that need to be preserved. 
Their main demand, therefore, is that actions to improve the conditions of living of Roma 
citizens be linked to the promotion of tolerance and acceptance of cultural diversity within 
Lithuanian society.  
</p>
<p>60. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the new Roma Integration Programme for 
the period 2008-2010, which aims to focus on some of the problems outlined by the community, 
with a special emphasis on issues of employment, professional training, social exclusion and the 
building of tolerance towards the Roma community.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur noted with interest that one of the most popular singers in 
Lithuania today is a Roma. Although Roma communities in Europe have historically found in 
music one of the few avenues for expression and broad participation in society, which has not 
had a meaningful impact on the reversal of their marginalization and exclusion, the Special 
Rapporteur expressed his conviction that the success of a Roma musician as a national symbol in 
mainstream popular music in Lithuania could be an opportunity for authorities, society at large 
and the Roma community to deepen this expression of acceptance of diversity and engage in a 
profound discussion aimed at fostering new opportunities for educational, cultural and 
professional inclusion of Roma within Lithuanian society. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Views of non-European communities 
</b></p>
<p>62. Human rights NGOs and representatives of non-European minorities living in Lithuania 
expressed serious concern regarding discrimination and intolerance against visually different 
minorities. Although these minorities are, for now, small in number, they have voiced a 
preoccupation regarding recent acts of racist violence and hate speech directed particularly at 
Africans, including acts committed by neo-Nazi sympathizers. 
</p>
<p>63. Although isolated acts of violence have already taken place in Lithuania, non-European 
communities, particularly Africans, emphasized their concern regarding future trends and a 
potential increase in intolerance and racist aggressions. This fear is also related to the increase in 
the flow of international migrants after Lithuania&#8217;s accession to the EU, fostered by the country&#8217;s 
robust economic growth. Communities expressed the concern that, to date, non-European 
minorities have been rare in Lithuania. However, as the size of these communities grows, issues 
of identity and cultural diversity will become more important. Representatives of non-European 
minorities stressed that there is a lack of intercultural activities aiming specifically at new 
minorities, whose cultural customs and traditions are not as well known as those of traditional 
minorities. Community representatives also expressed concern regarding the rise of 
Islamophobia among some societal segments. 
</p>
<p>64. A case of racist aggression that was described to the Special Rapporteur concerned an 
African student in Klaipeda. He was allegedly subject to multiple forms of discrimination in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>public places, including physical attacks. In a particular case, he filed a complaint alleging that a 
controller on a bus had verbally harassed him by calling him &#8220;monkey&#8221;. According to the Office 
of the Ombudsman, this case was referred to the Office of the Prosecutor General for 
investigation of incitement to hatred and violence. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Views of the Jewish and Kara&#239;te communities 
</b></p>
<p>65. Lithuania was historically one of the most important Jewish centres in Europe. However, 
after the Nazi occupation and the Holocaust, the Jewish population virtually disappeared and 
only a small community of some 4,000 Jews remains, most of whom arrived in Lithuania after 
the war. According to members of the Jewish community, the Holocaust is still a very present 
and painful issue for Lithuanian society, particularly due to the involvement, during the war, of 
many local collaborators in widespread anti-Semitic violence. 
</p>
<p>66. The Jewish community expressed its satisfaction with some recent actions by the 
Government. One of the initiatives pointed out  by the community was a broad review of school 
textbooks, which took place 10 years ago, aiming to eliminate embedded prejudices and correct 
distortions concerning the history of Lithuanian Jewry, particularly during the Holocaust, and the 
issue of local collaborators. The community also noted with satisfaction the creation in 1998 by 
the President of the Republic of the International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes 
of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania. The work of the Commission was 
viewed by the Jewish community as an important means to raise awareness regarding the crimes 
committed against Jews and thus mobilize society against anti-Semitism. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur visited the Jewish Tolerance Center and Museum in Vilnius, 
which is the most important documentation centre for the history of Lithuanian Jewry. It receives 
around 12,000 visitors per year. The director highlighted the importance of raising awareness 
within Lithuanian society at large regarding the crimes committed during the Holocaust, 
including by local collaborators, as a means to maintain continuous vigilance regarding the 
threats posed by anti-Semitism in all its forms. By facing the difficult moments of the past, 
Lithuanians would also be better prepared to cope with the new challenges in the future, 
including the influx of migrants.  
</p>
<p>68. Some particular problems that were highlighted by the Jewish community concern the 
issue of property restitution, which is currently being settled by the courts. Concern was also 
expressed regarding the emergence of violent extremist anti-Semitic groups, which emulate the 
behaviour of such groups in neighbouring countries. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The multicultural experience of Visaginas 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur also visited the city of Visaginas, in the northeast of the country, 
which is considered as a successful experiment of multicultural integration. Although a small 
city, Visaginas has 47 different nationalities represented and only 14 per cent of its population is 
ethnically Lithuanian. Around half of the population is of Russian origin, many of whom moved 
to Visaginas to work in the construction and maintenance of a nuclear power plant that operates 
close to the city.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>70. Due to the multicultural character of the city, language issues come to fore. In this regard, 
the Special Rapporteur was informed by the Vice-Mayor of ongoing efforts to improve access by 
persons of non-Lithuanian origin to the full range of State services. This includes, for example, 
the possibility of addressing municipal institutions in Russian, including the Municipal Council. 
Ethnic minorities are also represented in the local political system - only a quarter of the 
members of the Municipal Council are ethnic Lithuanians. According to local authorities, despite 
the potential problems that would arise due to linguistic diversity, the actual experience is quite 
positive and encouraged most of the Visaginas population to become proficient in several foreign 
languages. 
</p>
<p>71. In Visaginas, the Special Rapporteur also visited the local community centre where 
national minorities develop an array of cultural activities, particularly involving children. In the 
community centre, the Special Rapporteur met representatives of the Russian, Ukrainian, Tatar 
and Jewish communities. They explained that the centre focuses on three main strategies. First, 
Sunday schools are made available for children belonging to minorities. Whereas the Russian 
community, due to its larger size, is able to have Russian-language education in regular schools, 
smaller minorities organize after-school lessons for their children. So far, classes for seven 
different minorities are available, not only for linguistic proficiency but also focusing on social 
studies, history and traditions of each minority. The second strategy is to go further than classes 
and also to meet the cultural needs of minorities through the creation of national associations that 
organize year-long activities and events, such as special celebrations organized by the Muslim 
community during Ramadan and music lessons for traditional folkloric music. Finally, the centre 
also serves as a means to enhance communications and consultation between the minorities and 
the national Government, particularly through the Department of National Minorities and 
Lithuanians Living Abroad. 
</p>
<p>72. The underlying message expressed both by local authorities and community leaders in 
Visaginas was that the different ethnic communities managed to become well integrated in the 
fabric of the local society whilst not only preserving but also strengthening their own particular 
identities. In this sense, Visaginas is an important test of the strength of Lithuania&#8217;s 
multiculturalism and the way it will meet its future challenges. Some Sri Lankan migrants had 
recently moved to the city for work, which points to the tendency of non-European migration in 
the future. Furthermore, the nuclear power plant, which is one of the main sources of income in 
the city, is scheduled to be deactivated in 2009, which has created some uncertainty and fears 
regarding the city&#8217;s future welfare. Although the existing network of intercultural relations in 
Visaginas offers a solid basis to tackle these challenges, constant vigilance by authorities and 
civil society will be required in the future. In this regard, Visaginas&#8217; successful experience in 
overcoming the challenges of globalization in times of more difficult economic conditions could 
serve as an example for other parts of the country as well as the region itself.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>73.  After carefully assessing the statements of government officials as well as those of 
representatives of civil society organizations, ethnic and religious minorities as well as other 
communities, the Special Rapporteur reached the following conclusions. 
</p>
<p>74. Lithuania has put in place a progressive and comprehensive legal strategy to address the 
issue of racism and discrimination. The Law on Equal Treatment became a holistic instrument to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>fight all forms of discrimination. In this regard, it offers an important degree of protection to 
potential victims of racism and discrimination, as well as providing opportunities for them to 
redress violations in different realms. The Law on National Minorities is also an important legal 
tool and a progressive instrument due to its formal recognition of the cultural autonomy of 
minority communities as well as its explicit embrace of multiculturalism, rather than 
assimilation, as the official State policy regarding integration. 
</p>
<p>75. Alongside its overarching legislation, Lithuania has managed to establish institutions that 
are well placed to provide effective remedies to racism and discrimination. The Special 
Rapporteur was particularly impressed by the quality of the work performed by the 
Ombudspersons on Equal Opportunities and Children&#8217;s Rights in attempting to correct and 
prevent violations of the Law on Equal Treatment. He also recognizes the awareness and 
vigilance of the Office of the Prosecutor General concerning new challenges that are emerging in 
the fight against racism in Lithuania, particularly regarding new migrants, and its proactive 
policy to initiate investigations of racist crimes and incitement to racial and religious hatred.  
</p>
<p>76. Apart from institutions operating on the legal realm, the Special Rapporteur was also 
encouraged by the work of other government bodies that focus on social and cultural policies 
towards vulnerable groups. In particular, he wants to highlight the central role played by the 
Department of National Minorities and its director to protect and promote the cultural traditions 
of national minorities. Despite the limited amount of funding, it has managed to develop creative 
and innovative policies to address the needs of minorities and promote multiculturalism, being 
clearly recognized by minority communities as a legitimate interlocutor. The Ministries of 
Education and Culture, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, also show a positive and creative 
contribution to the promotion of multiculturalism. It is especially relevant to highlight the 
Ministry of Culture&#8217;s activities in the realm of Vilnius&#8217;s selection as the European &#8220;Capital of 
Culture&#8221; in 2009, when a number of events to illustrate Lithuania&#8217;s diversity will be organized. 
</p>
<p>77. However, despite the existence of a progressive legal and institutional framework, there are 
still a few protection gaps that need to be corrected through the adoption of complementary 
legislation or amendments. In particular, a number of civil society interlocutors have pointed out 
that various cases of racist aggressions tend to be viewed by law enforcement agencies as acts of 
hooliganism or vandalism, thus disqualifying the racial motivation. This worrisome tendency to 
equate racial attacks with hooliganism was also noted by the Special Rapporteur in his meetings 
with a few State authorities, including the President of the Supreme Court. In order to correct 
this legal gap, and in line with recommendations made by other international bodies, it is 
important for Lithuania to amend its criminal code in order to recognize racism as an aggravating 
circumstance in racist crimes. Such a measure would help law enforcement agencies bring 
perpetrators to justice and act as an important legal deterrent for future aggressions. 
</p><p>78. A second frequently mentioned problem with the existing legal framework regards the full 
application of its provisions. Human rights NGOs and representatives of minorities pointed out 
cases where existing laws have not been fully applied or enforced. The most common example 
that was mentioned concerned instances that would characterize as incitement to racial hatred. 
Despite a clear constitutional prohibition of incitement to racial hatred, in practice very few cases 
have been brought to justice or they led to light punishment, often an administrative fine. The 
challenges in effectively prosecuting cases of hate speech, in particular the issues of intent and 
burden of proof as well as the question of the balance between freedom of expression and the full </p>

</p>
<p>enjoyment of other rights, are not distinctive features of Lithuania. However, law enforcement 
agencies and the judiciary need to tackle these issues more effectively in order to adequately 
comply with domestic legislation and international instruments. 
</p>
<p>79. The Roma community in Lithuania, as in many European countries, is a particularly 
vulnerable group, and subject to profound discrimination - not sanctioned by laws, but deeply 
rooted in the minds of many citizens - and thus requires concerted efforts by authorities at the 
national and local level. Apart from the provision of basic rights, especially good housing 
conditions, education and health, Lithuanian authorities should focus on broader actions that 
target not only the community itself, but society as a whole. One of the central causes of the 
marginalization of Roma citizens is intolerance and a lack of acceptance by society at large, 
which can only be redressed through a national strategy to promote cultural diversity and 
acceptance of multiculturalism. This strategy would also include activities that promote Roma 
culture as an enriching component of the national culture and deepen social and economic 
interactions between the Roma community and the population at large. 
</p>
<p>80. Lithuania, like several Eastern European and in particular Baltic countries, is currently at a 
turning point in history. Its society is profoundly marked by the historic legacy of Soviet 
domination and occupation, which affected, albeit to different degrees, all Baltic countries. The 
central challenge it faces is to build a democratic, egalitarian and interactive society, taking into 
account both the necessity to reassert the continuity of its national identity - shaken and eroded 
by occupation but deeply rooted in past history - and the recognition and respect for the rights of 
its minorities, comprising not only historically discriminated-against communities such as the 
Roma, but also the Russians and other minorities that arrived during the occupation. This new 
identity tension, with its political and cultural expressions, requires political vision, legal 
vigilance and cultural creativity to foster among communities a long-lasting sense of belonging 
and living together. Two principles should guide this process: respect for the historical truth and 
non-discrimination against minorities. History and geography are both central in this context. 
National and regional factors are particularly relevant as far as the Russian communities are 
concerned. The full respect of their rights - in terms of citizenship, language, culture and the 
eradication of any form of discrimination - is closely linked to their involvement and 
participation in the process of construction of a new multicultural nation that is fully respected 
by all countries in the region. As Lithuania&#8217;s economy becomes more exposed to the world, a 
steady influx of new waves of migrants, mostly non-European, will start. A mounting challenge 
that Lithuania faces is therefore to prepare its society for the arrival of different peoples bearing 
their own ethnicity, traditions, cultures and customs. The promotion of multiculturalism is 
therefore the most appropriate way to transform this challenge into an opportunity of enriching 
the Lithuanian society with more diversity and intercultural dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>State authorities in the executive, legislative and judiciary powers should highlight 
their strong political will and commitment to fight all forms of racism, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia in Lithuanian society and their vigilance about new 
challenges that arise from growing migration, multiculturalism and identity changes. It is 
especially important to firmly condemn any racist or xenophobic action or discourse, 
including by political parties and the media. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Lithuania has a strong heritage of multiculturalism that stems from the multi-ethnic 
Grand Duchy of Lithuania and continues to exist today. State authorities and civil society 
alike should build on these plural traditions to strengthen all actions against racism and 
discrimination and to promote a democratic multiculturalism that includes new minorities 
into Lithuanian society.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Government should take steps to complement the existing legal framework with 
measures that would fill the protection gaps that still exist. In particular, the Criminal 
Code should be amended to introduce a provision that makes committing an offence with a 
racist motivation or aim an aggravating circumstance, allowing for a more severe 
punishment for perpetrators of these acts. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Government should also strengthen the capacity of the Office of the 
Ombudsperson on Equal Opportunities to thoroughly investigate and act on allegations of 
racist crimes, incitement to racial hatred and all forms of racial and ethnic discrimination.   
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Government should develop best practices and general guidelines for the 
prosecution of cases of incitement to racial hatred, developing clear criteria for the 
threshold of evidence that is required to be presented and for the investigative conduct of 
law enforcement conditions. Whilst developing these guidelines, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government fully apply the prohibition to incite racial, religious or 
ethnic hatred established by article 25 of the Constitution, article 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 4 of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>As already pledged by a number of State authorities, including in the discussions of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Lithuania should proceed to 
make the voluntary declaration under article 14 of the Convention to recognize the 
competence of that Committee (CERD) to receive and consider individual communications 
of violations within its jurisdiction. 
</b>87. <b>The Government should also develop comprehensive programmes of multicultural 
training and qualification in public institutions, particularly for law enforcement officials. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The role of the Department of National Minorities and Lithuanians Living Abroad 
should be strengthened, both in terms of mandate and resources. The Department should 
expand its activities to promote cultural expressions of minority communities and rely on 
its distinctive vision of multicultural integration. In particular, besides working with 
traditional minorities, the department should be given the capacity to have a more specific 
focus on new religious and ethnic communities and their integration into Lithuanian 
society.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>As an integral part of the focus on new minorities, the Government should engage in 
efforts to prevent the emergence of Islamophobia as well as discrimination and prejudice 
against other religions, particularly those that were not historically present in Lithuania.   </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The Government should extend and reinforce its National Programme for the 
Integration of Roma in the Lithuanian Society, aiming at both promoting and respecting 
their cultural identity and at eradicating their social and economic marginalization, in 
particular poor housing conditions, the high level of dropouts and poor attainment of 
Roma children at school and the difficulties of Roma to access employment. The 
Programme should also have a strong component that focuses on non-Roma citizens, 
sensitizing Lithuanian society at large to Roma history and traditions, in order to eliminate 
the negative stigma and stereotypes with which Roma are recurrently associated. 
Furthermore, as many of the actions that are required to improve the living conditions in 
Roma settlements need to take place at the municipal level, Vilnius authorities should work 
in close collaboration with the national Government to follow its overarching priorities and 
legal obligations to grant the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights to the 
Roma community. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>In parallel with a political and legal strategy, the Government and civil society should 
adopt an intellectual, ethical and cultural strategy that addresses the deepest roots of 
racism, xenophobia and intolerance and is built around the promotion of reciprocal 
knowledge of cultures and values, the interaction among the different communities and the 
link between the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination and the long-term 
construction of a democratic, equalitarian and interactive multicultural society. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The process of building a multicultural society in Lithuania should be based on two 
principles: respect for the historical truth and non-discrimination against minorities. Due 
to historical and geographical factors, a focus on national and regional dynamics is also 
central. The success of this initiative will also depend on the active involvement and 
participation of minorities in the construction of a new multicultural nation that is fully 
respected by all countries in the region. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Civil society in Lithuania should further strengthen and reinforce its monitoring role 
for human rights violations, particularly in the realm of racism and discrimination. In 
particular, NGOs or alliances of NGOs should strive to offer potential victims with legal 
counsel and access to international instruments, both at the international and regional 
levels. This includes developing closer communication channels with treaty bodies, 
especially the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and special 
procedures, to bring to these mechanisms&#8217; attention allegations of violations taking place in 
the country.
