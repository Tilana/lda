EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
August 11, 2016
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
375 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10152
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the “Company”), confirms its
agreement (this “Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo Securities”), as
follows:
SECTION 1. Description of Securities.
The Company agrees that, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, it may issue and sell through Wells Fargo Securities,
acting as agent and/or principal, shares (the “Securities”) of the Company’s common stock, no par
value, (the “Common Stock”), having an aggregate sale price of up to $50,000,000 (the “Maximum
Amount”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto agree that
compliance with the limitations set forth in this Section 1 regarding the number and aggregate sale
price of the Securities issued and sold under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of the
Company, and Wells Fargo Securities shall have no obligation in connection with such
compliance. The issuance and sale of the Securities through Wells Fargo Securities will be
effected pursuant to the Registration Statement (as defined below) filed by the Company and
declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), although
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Company to use the Registration
Statement to issue the Securities. The Company agrees that whenever it determines to sell
Securities directly to Wells Fargo Securities as principal it will enter into a separate written
agreement containing the terms and conditions of such sale.
The Company has filed, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, with the
Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-210114), including a base
prospectus, relating to certain securities, including the Securities to be issued from time to time by
the Company, and which incorporates by reference documents that the Company has filed or will
file in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Act. The Company has prepared a
prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities (the “Prospectus Supplement”) to the
base prospectus included as part of such registration statement. The Company will furnish to
Wells Fargo Securities, for use by Wells Fargo Securities, copies of the prospectus included as
part of such registration statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, relating to
the Securities. The “Registration Statement”, as of any time, means such registration statement
1
as amended by any post-effective amendments thereto at such time, including the exhibits and
any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein at such time pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act and the
documents and information otherwise deemed to be a part thereof as of such time pursuant to
Rule 430B of the Securities Act (“Rule 430B”); provided, however, that the “Registration
Statement” without reference to a time means such registration statement as amended by any
post-effective amendments thereto as of the time of the first contract of sale for the Securities,
which time shall be considered the “new effective date” of the Registration Statement with respect
to the Securities within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 430B, including the exhibits and
schedules thereto at such time, the documents and information incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference therein at such time pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the
Securities Act and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof as of such time pursuant
to Rule 430B. The base prospectus, including all documents incorporated therein by reference,
included in the Registration Statement, as it may be supplemented by the Prospectus
Supplement, in the form in which such prospectus and/or Prospectus Supplement have most
recently been filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) is herein called
the “Prospectus.” Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents
incorporated by reference therein, and any reference herein to the terms “amend,” “amendment” or
“supplement” with respect to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to
refer to and include the filing after the execution hereof of any document with the Commission
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to
the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or to any amendment or supplement thereto shall be
deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR.
SECTION 2. Placements.
Each time that the Company wishes to issue and sell the Securities hereunder (each, a
“Placement”), it will notify Wells Fargo Securities by email notice (or other method mutually agreed
to in writing by the parties) containing the parameters in accordance with which it desires the
Securities to be sold, which shall at a minimum include the number of Securities to be issued (the
“Placement Securities”), the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any
limitation on the number of Securities that may be sold in any one day and any minimum price
below which sales may not be made (a “Placement Notice”), a form of which containing such
minimum sales parameters necessary is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Placement Notice shall
originate from any of the individuals from the Company set forth on Exhibit B (with a copy to each
of the other individuals from the Company listed on such Exhibit B), and shall be addressed to
each of the individuals from Wells Fargo Securities set forth on Exhibit B, as such Exhibit B may
be amended from time to time. If Wells Fargo Securities wishes to accept such proposed terms
included in the Placement Notice (which it may decline to do so for any reason in its sole
discretion) or, following discussion with the Company, wishes to accept amended terms, Wells
Fargo Securities will, as reasonably promptly as practical, issue to the Company a notice by email
(or other method mutually agreed to in writing by the parties) addressed to all of the individuals
from the Company and Wells Fargo Securities set forth on Exhibit B) setting forth the terms that
Wells Fargo Securities is willing to accept. Where the terms provided in the Placement Notice are
amended as provided for in the immediately preceding sentence, such
2
terms will not be binding on the Company or Wells Fargo Securities until the Company delivers to
Wells Fargo Securities an acceptance by email (or other method mutually agreed to in writing by
the parties) of all of the terms of such Placement Notice, as amended (the “Acceptance”), which
email shall be addressed to all of the individuals from the Company and Wells Fargo Securities
set forth on Exhibit B. The Placement Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if
applicable) shall be effective upon receipt by the Company of Wells Fargo Securities’ acceptance
of the terms of the Placement Notice or upon receipt by Wells Fargo Securities of the Company’s
Acceptance, as the case may be, unless and until (i) the entire amount of the Placement
Securities has been sold, (ii) in accordance with the notice requirements set forth in the second
sentence of this paragraph, the Company terminates the Placement Notice, (iii) in accordance
with the notice requirements set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph, the Company
issues a subsequent Placement Notice with parameters superseding those on the earlier dated
Placement Notice, (iv) this Agreement has been terminated under the provisions of Section 13 or
(v) either party shall have suspended the sale of the Placement Securities in accordance with
Section 4 below. The amount of any discount, commission or other compensation to be paid by
the Company to Wells Fargo Securities in connection with the sale of the Placement Securities
shall be calculated in accordance with the terms set forth in Exhibit C. It is expressly
acknowledged and agreed that neither the Company nor Wells Fargo Securities will have any
obligation whatsoever with respect to a Placement or any Placement Securities unless and until
the Company delivers a Placement Notice to Wells Fargo Securities and either (i) Wells Fargo
Securities accepts the terms of such Placement Notice or (ii) where the terms of such Placement
Notice are amended, the Company accepts such amended terms by means of an Acceptance
pursuant to the terms set forth above, and then only upon the terms specified in the Placement
Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable) and herein. In the event of a
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Placement Notice (as amended by
the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable), the terms of the Placement Notice (as amended by
the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable) will control. For the purposes hereof, “Business Day”
means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday or a day on which banks are
required to be closed in New York City.
SECTION 3. Sale of Placement Securities by Wells Fargo Securities.
Subject to the provisions of Section 6(a), Wells Fargo Securities, for the period specified in the
Placement Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable), will use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the
Placement Securities up to the amount specified, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of
such Placement Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable). Wells
Fargo Securities will provide written confirmation, including by email or fax transmission, to the
Company no later than the opening of the Trading Day (as defined below) immediately following
the Trading Day on which it has made sales of Placement Securities hereunder setting forth the
number of Placement Securities sold on such day, the compensation payable by the Company to
Wells Fargo Securities pursuant to Section 2 with respect to such sales, and the Net Proceeds (as
defined below) payable to the Company, with an itemization of the deductions made by Wells
Fargo Securities (as set forth in Section 6(b)) from the gross proceeds that it receives from such
sales. Subject to the terms of the Placement Notice (as amended by the corresponding
Acceptance, if applicable), Wells Fargo Securities may sell Placement Securities
3
by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 of
the Securities Act, including without limitation sales made directly on the NYSE, on any other
existing trading market for the Common Stock or to or through a market maker. Subject to the
terms of the Placement Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable),
Wells Fargo Securities may also sell Placement Securities by any other method permitted by law,
including but not limited to in privately negotiated transactions. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that (i) there can be no assurance that Wells Fargo Securities will be successful in selling
Placement Shares, and (ii) Wells Fargo Securities will incur no liability or obligation to the
Company or any other person or entity if it does not sell Placement Shares for any reason other
than a failure by Wells Fargo Securities to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Placement Shares as required under this
Section 3. For the purposes hereof, “Trading Day” means any day on which shares of Common
Stock are purchased and sold on the NYSE.
SECTION 4. Suspension of Sales. The Company or Wells Fargo Securities may, upon notice to
the other party in writing (including by email correspondence to each of the individuals of the other
party set forth on Exhibit B, if receipt of such correspondence is actually acknowledged by any of
the individuals to whom the notice is sent, other than via auto-reply) or by telephone (confirmed
immediately by verifiable facsimile transmission or email correspondence to each of the
individuals of the other party set forth on Exhibit B), suspend any sale of Placement Securities;
provided, however, that such suspension shall not affect or impair either party’s obligations with
respect to any Placement Securities sold hereunder prior to the receipt of such notice. Each of the
parties agrees that no such notice under this Section 4 shall be effective against the other unless it
is made to one of the individuals of the other party named on Exhibit B hereto, as such Exhibit B
may be amended from time to time.
SECTION 5. Representations and Warranties.
(a) Representations and Warranties by the Company. The Company represents and warrants to
Wells Fargo Securities as of the date hereof and as of each Representation Date (as defined
below) on which a certificate is required to be delivered pursuant to Section 7(o) of this
Agreement, as of each Applicable Time and as of each Settlement Date (as defined below), and
agrees with Wells Fargo Securities, as follows:
(1) Compliance with Registration Requirements. The Securities have been duly registered under
the Securities Act pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Registration Statement has
become effective under the Securities Act, or, with respect to any registration statement to be filed
to register the offer and sale of the Securities pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (a
“Rule 462(b) Registration Statement”), will be filed with the Commission and become effective
under the Securities Act no later than 10:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the date of
determination of the public offering price for the Securities, and no stop order preventing or
suspending the use of any base prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any
Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (as defined below), or the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement and no proceedings for such
4
purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are
contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional
information has been complied with.
At the respective times each of the Registration Statement, any Rule 462(b) Registration
Statement and any post-effective amendments thereto became or becomes effective and as of the
date hereof, the Registration Statement, any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement and any
amendments and supplements thereto complied and will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act. At the respective times, each prospectus and any amendment
or supplement thereto, at the time each was filed with the Commission, complied and will comply
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act. The conditions for the use of
Form S-3, as set forth in the General Instructions thereto, and the Registration Statement meets,
and the offering and sale of the Securities as contemplated hereby complies with, the
requirements of Rule 415 under the Securities Act (including, without limitation, Rule 415(a)(5)).
The Registration Statement, as of the date hereof and each effective date with respect thereto, did
not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Neither
the Prospectus nor any amendments or supplements thereto, as of their respective dates, and at
each Applicable Time and Settlement Date, as the case may be, included or will include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.
The representations and warranties set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph shall not
apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as
amended or supplemented, made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
the Company in writing by Wells Fargo Securities expressly for use therein. For purposes of this
Agreement, the only information so furnished in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus shall be Wells Fargo Securities’ name (the “Agent Information”).
The copies of the Registration Statement and any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement and any
amendments thereto, any other preliminary prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that
is required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 and the Prospectus and any
amendments or supplements thereto delivered and to be delivered to Wells Fargo Securities
(electronically or otherwise) in connection with the offering of the Securities were and will be
identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to
EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus relating to the Securities, as of its issue date and as of each
Applicable Time and Settlement Date, did not, does not and will not include any information that
conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus, including any incorporated document deemed to be a part thereof that has not
been superseded or modified, or included, includes or will include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted, omits
5
or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances, prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading. The foregoing sentence does
not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by Wells Fargo Securities
specifically for use therein.
At the time of the initial filing of the Registration Statement, at the time of the most recent
amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act
(whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), at the time the Company or
another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of
Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act) was not and is not an “ineligible issuer,” as defined in Rule
405 of the Securities Act; and, without limitation of the foregoing, the Company has at all relevant
times met, meets and will at all relevant times meet the requirements of Rule 164 for the use of a
free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405) in connection with the offering contemplated
hereby.
Each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
heretofore filed, when it was filed (or, if any amendment with respect to any such document was
filed, when such amendment was filed), conformed in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act, and any further documents so filed and incorporated after the date of this
Agreement will, when they are filed, conform in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act; no such document when it was filed (or, if an amendment with respect to any such
document was filed, when such amendment was filed), contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading; and no such document, when it is filed, will contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
(2) Prior Written Communications. Any offer that is a written communication relating to the
Securities made prior to the initial filing of the Registration Statement by the Company or any
person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of Rule 163(c) of the
Securities Act) has been filed with the Commission in accordance with the exemption provided by
Rule 163 of the Securities Act and otherwise complied with the requirements of Rule 163 of the
Securities Act, including without limitation the legending requirement.
(3) Independent Accountants. The accountants whose reports appear in the Prospectus or are
incorporated by reference therein, are, and during the periods covered by such reports were,
registered independent public accountants as required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).
(4) Financial Statements. The financial statements of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
6
Statement and the Prospectus, together with the related schedules (if any) and notes, present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the entities to which they relate at the dates
indicated and the results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods specified; the financial statements of
any other entities or businesses included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus, together with the related schedules (if any) and notes, present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of each such entity or business, as the case may be,
and its consolidated subsidiaries (if any) at the dates indicated and the results of operations,
changes in stockholders’ (or other owners’) equity and cash flows of such entity or business, as
the case may be, and its consolidated subsidiaries (if any) for the periods specified; and all such
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved and comply in all material respects with all applicable accounting
requirements under the Securities Act. The supporting schedules, if any, included or incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP, the information required to be stated therein. The financial
statements of the businesses or properties acquired or proposed to be acquired, if any, included,
or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein, have been prepared in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis and otherwise have been prepared in accordance with, in the case
of businesses acquired or to be acquired, the applicable financial statement requirements of Rule
3-05 or, in the case of real estate operations acquired or to be acquired, Rule 3-14 of Regulation
S-X. The summary financial data and selected financial data included, or incorporated by
reference, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly the information shown
therein and has been compiled on a basis consistent with that of the audited financial statements
of the Company included, or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus. The Company’s ratios of earnings to fixed charges and, if applicable, ratios of
earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends (actual and, if any, pro forma)
included, or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus have
been calculated in compliance with Item 503(d) of Regulation S K of the Commission. Any
information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus regarding “non-GAAP
financial measures” (as defined in Regulation G of the Commission) complies with Regulation G
and Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Commission, to the extent applicable. No other financial
statements or schedules are required by Form S-3 or otherwise to be included, or incorporated by
reference, in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. The interactive data in eXtensible
Business Reporting Language incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus fairly presents the required information and has been prepared in accordance with the
Commission’s rules and guidelines applicable thereto.
(5) No Material Adverse Change in Business. Since the respective dates as of which information
is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (in each case exclusive of any
amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement), except as
otherwise stated therein, (A) there has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial

in good standing in the State of Texas and in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is
required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business,

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of
the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the Prospectus under the caption
“Use of Proceeds”) and compliance by the Company with its obligations under this Agreement do

pursuant to, any Company Documents, except for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or Liens that
would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of (a) the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (b) any
applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government,
government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or

Adverse Effect, or which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
properties or assets thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement; the
aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective property or assets is the subject which
are not described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including ordinary routine
litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.
(15) Accuracy of Descriptions and Exhibits. The information in the Prospectus under the captions
“Business—Government Regulation,” “Business—Environmental Regulation,” and “Description of
Capital Stock,” and the information in the Registration Statement under Item 15, in each case to
the extent that it constitutes matters of law, summaries of legal matters, summaries of provisions of
the Company’s charter or bylaws
10
or other instruments or agreements, summaries of legal proceedings, or legal conclusions, is
correct in all material respects; all descriptions in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
of any Company Documents are accurate in all material respects; and there are no franchises,
contracts, indentures, mortgages, deeds of trust, loan or credit agreements, bonds, notes,
debentures, evidences of indebtedness, leases or other instruments, agreements or documents
required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be
filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which have not been so described and filed as
required.

marks, trade names, service names and other intellectual property (collectively, “Intellectual
Property”) reasonably necessary to carry on their respective businesses as described in the
Prospectus and as proposed to be conducted, except where failure to own or possess or have the
right to use would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice or is otherwise aware of any
infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or
of any facts or circumstances which would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate
to protect the interests of the Company or any of its subsidiaries therein, and which infringement or
conflict (if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

Prospectus, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act or

permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, “Governmental
Licenses”) issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies

Governmental Licenses would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
the Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such
Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a
11
Material Adverse Effect; all of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect,
except when the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental
Licenses to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of
proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses which,
individually or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

simple to all real property owned by any of them and good title to all other properties and assets
owned by any of them, in each case, free and clear of all Liens except such Liens as (a) are

subleases relating to real property and buildings or other improvements, such exceptions as are
not material and do not interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such property and
buildings or other improvements by the Company and its subsidiaries, and all such leases and
subleases are in full force and effect; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any
notice of any claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries under any of the leases or subleases mentioned above or
affecting or questioning the rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the continued
possession of the leased or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease except for
such claims which, if successfully asserted against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

knowledge of the Company, there are no events or circumstances that would reasonably be

its subsidiaries relating to Hazardous Materials or any Environmental Laws.

required to be paid by them and any
13
other assessment, fine or penalty levied against any of them, to the extent that any of the foregoing
is due and payable, except for any such tax, assessment, fine or penalty that is currently being

is no tax deficiency that, to the knowledge of the Company, has been, or would reasonably be

obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a
cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
(27) Accounting Controls and Disclosure Controls. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain

SECTION 6. Sale and Delivery to Wells Fargo Securities; Settlement.
(a) Sale of Placement Securities. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein
contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, upon Wells Fargo Securities’
acceptance of the terms of a Placement Notice or upon receipt by Wells Fargo Securities of an
Acceptance, as the case may be, and unless the sale of the Placement Securities described
therein has been declined, suspended, or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Wells Fargo Securities, for the period specified in the Placement Notice (as
amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable), will use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Placement Securities up
to the amount specified, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of such Placement Notice (as
amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable). The Company acknowledges and
agrees that (i) there can be no assurance that Wells Fargo Securities will be successful in selling
Placement Securities, (ii) Wells Fargo Securities will incur no liability or obligation to the
Company or any other person or entity if it does not sell Placement Securities for any reason other
than a failure by Wells Fargo Securities to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
its normal trading and sales practices to sell such Placement Securities as required under this
Section 6 and (iii) Wells Fargo Securities shall be under no obligation to purchase Securities on a
principal basis pursuant to this Agreement, except as otherwise agreed by Wells Fargo Securities.
(b) Settlement of Placement Securities. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Placement
Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable), settlement for sales of
Placement Securities will occur on the third (3rd) Trading Day (or such earlier day as is industry
practice for regular-way trading) following the date on which such sales are made (each, a
“Settlement Date”). The amount of proceeds to be delivered to the Company on a Settlement Date
against receipt of the Placement Securities sold (the “Net Proceeds”) will be equal to the
aggregate sales price received by Wells Fargo Securities at which such Placement Securities
were sold, after deduction for (i) Wells Fargo Securities’ commission, discount or other
compensation for such sales payable by the Company pursuant to Section 2 hereof and (ii) any
transaction fees imposed by any governmental or self-regulatory organization in respect of such
sales.
19
(c) Delivery of Placement Securities. On or before each Settlement Date, the Company will, or will
cause its transfer agent to, electronically transfer the Placement Securities being sold by crediting
Wells Fargo Securities’ or its designee’s account (provided Wells Fargo Securities shall have
given the Company written notice of such designee within one Business Day of a Placement) at
The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian System or by
such other means of delivery as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto which in all
cases shall be freely tradable, transferable, registered shares in good deliverable form. On each
Settlement Date, Wells Fargo Securities will deliver the related Net Proceeds in same day funds
to an account designated by the Company on, or prior to, the Settlement Date. The Company
agrees that if the Company, or its transfer agent (if applicable), defaults in its obligation to deliver
Placement Securities on a Settlement Date (other than as a result of the failure of Wells Fargo
Securities to initiate a DWAC with respect to such Placement Securities on the next Business Day
after the sale of Placement Securities), the Company agrees that in addition to and in no way
limiting the rights and obligations set forth in Section 10(a) and Section 10(d) hereto, it will (i) hold
Wells Fargo Securities harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense
whatsoever (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), as incurred, arising out of or in
connection with such default by the Company or its transfer agent and (ii) pay to Wells Fargo
Securities any commission, discount, or other compensation to which it would otherwise have
been entitled absent such default.
(d) Denominations; Registration. The Securities shall be in such denominations and registered in
such names as Wells Fargo Securities may request in writing at least one full Business Day
before the Settlement Date. The Company shall deliver the Securities, if any, through the facilities
of The Depository Trust Company unless Wells Fargo Securities shall otherwise instruct.
(e) Limitations on Offering Size. Under no circumstances shall the Company cause or request the
offer or sale of any Securities, if after giving effect to the sale of such Securities, the aggregate
offering price of the Securities sold pursuant to this Agreement would exceed the lesser of (A) the
Maximum Amount, (B) the amount available for offer and sale under the currently effective
Registration Statement, and (C) the amount authorized from time to time to be issued and sold
under this Agreement by the Company and notified to Wells Fargo Securities in writing. Under no
circumstances shall the Company cause or request the offer or sale of any Securities pursuant to
this Agreement at a price lower than the minimum price authorized from time to time by the
Company and notified to Wells Fargo Securities in writing. Further, under no circumstances shall
the aggregate offering price of Securities sold pursuant to this Agreement, including any separate
underwriting or similar agreement covering principal transactions described in Section 1 of this
Agreement, exceed the Maximum Amount.

shall not offer or sell, or instruct Wells Fargo Securities to offer or sell, any Securities through
Wells Fargo Securities as agent (and, by notice to Wells Fargo Securities given by telephone
(confirmed promptly by telecopy or email), shall cancel any instructions for any such offer or sale
of any Securities prior to the commencement of the periods referenced
20
below), and Wells Fargo Securities shall not be obligated to make any such offer or sale of
Securities, (i) during any period in which the Company is, or could be deemed to be, in
possession of material non-public information or (ii) except as provided in Section 6(f)(1) hereof, at
any time during the period commencing on the 10th Business Day prior to the time the Company
issues a press release containing, or shall otherwise publicly announce, its earnings, revenues or
other operating results for a fiscal period or periods (each, an “Earnings Announcement”) through
and including the time that is 24 hours after the time that the Company files a Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K (a “Filing Time”) that includes consolidated

that is 24 hours after the corresponding Filing Time, the Company shall first (i) prepare and deliver
to Wells Fargo Securities (with a copy to counsel to Wells Fargo Securities) a Current Report on
Form 8-K that includes substantially the same financial and related information (together with
management’s discussion and analysis thereof) that was included in such Earnings
Announcement (other than any earnings projections and similar forward-looking data and officers’
quotations) (each, an “Earnings 8-K”), and, prior to its filing, obtain the written consent of Wells
Fargo Securities to such filing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (ii) provide Wells Fargo Securities with the officers’ certificate, opinions and letters of
counsel and accountants’ letter specified in Section 7(o), (p) and (q), respectively, hereof,
(iii) afford Wells Fargo Securities the opportunity to conduct a due diligence review in accordance
with Section 7(m) hereof prior to filing such Earnings 8-K and (iv) file such Earnings 8-K with the
Commission, then the provision of clause (ii) of Section 6(f) shall not be applicable for the period
from and after the time at which the foregoing conditions shall have been satisfied (or, if later, the
time that is 24 hours after the time that the relevant Earnings Announcement was first publicly
released) through and including the time that is 24 hours after the Filing Time of the relevant
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the case may be. For
purposes of clarity, the parties hereto agree that (A) the delivery of any officers’ certificate, opinion
or letter of counsel or accountants’ letter pursuant to this Section 6(f) shall not relieve the
Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the case may be, including, without limitation, the
obligation to deliver officers’ certificates, opinions and letters of counsel and accountants’ letters
as provided in Section 7(o), (p) and (q), respectively, hereof, and (B) this Section 2(j) shall in no
way affect or limit the operation of clause (i) of Section 6(f) hereof, which shall have independent
application.
SECTION 7. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with Wells Fargo Securities as
follows:
(a) Registration Statement Amendments; Payment of Fees. After the date of this Agreement and
during any period in which a Prospectus relating to any Placement Securities is required to be
delivered by Wells Fargo Securities under the Securities Act (including in
21
circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the
Securities Act), (i) the Company will notify Wells Fargo Securities promptly of the time when any
subsequent amendment to the Registration Statement, other than documents incorporated by
reference, has been filed with the Commission and/or has become effective or any subsequent
supplement to the Prospectus has been filed and of any comment letter from the Commission or
any request by the Commission for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement
or Prospectus or for additional information; (ii) the Company will prepare and file with the
Commission, promptly upon Wells Fargo Securities’ request, any amendments or supplements to
the Registration Statement or Prospectus that, in Wells Fargo Securities’ reasonable opinion, may
be necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Placement Securities by Wells
Fargo Securities (provided, however, that the failure of Wells Fargo Securities to make such
request shall not relieve the Company of any obligation or liability hereunder, or affect Wells
Fargo Securities’ right to rely on the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
Agreement); (iii) the Company will not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or Prospectus, other than documents incorporated by reference, relating to the
Placement Securities or a security convertible into the Placement Securities unless a copy thereof
has been submitted to Wells Fargo Securities within a reasonable period of time before the filing
and Wells Fargo Securities has not reasonably objected thereto (provided, however, that the
failure of Wells Fargo Securities to make such objection shall not relieve the Company of any
obligation or liability hereunder, or affect Wells Fargo Securities’ right to rely on the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement) and the Company will
furnish to Wells Fargo Securities at the time of filing thereof a copy of any document that upon
filing is deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or Prospectus,
except for those documents available via EDGAR; and (iv) the Company will cause each
amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, other than documents incorporated by reference, to
be filed with the Commission as required pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) of
the Securities Act (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8) of the Securities Act).
(b) Notice of Commission Stop Orders. The Company will advise Wells Fargo Securities, promptly
after it receives notice or obtains knowledge thereof, of the issuance or threatened issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of
any other order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Placement Securities for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction or of the loss or suspension of any exemption from any such qualification,
or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings by the Commission for any of such purposes,
or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Securities Act concerning the Registration
Statement or if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the
Securities Act in connection with the offering of the Securities. The Company will make every
reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of any qualification of
the Securities for offering or sale and any loss or suspension of any exemption from any such
qualification, and if any such stop order is issued or any such suspension or loss occurs, to obtain
the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
(c) Delivery of Registration Statement and Prospectus. The Company will furnish to Wells Fargo
Securities and its counsel (at the expense of the Company) copies of the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference therein) and all amendments
and supplements to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, and
22
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, that are filed with the Commission during any period in
which a Prospectus relating to the Placement Securities is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act (including all documents filed with the Commission during such period that are
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), in each case as soon as reasonably practicable
and in such quantities and at such locations as Wells Fargo Securities may from time to time
reasonably request. The copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any
supplements or amendments thereto furnished to Wells Fargo Securities will be identical to the
electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to
the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
(d) Continued Compliance with Securities Laws. If at any time when a Prospectus is required by
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to be delivered in connection with a pending sale of the
Placement Securities (including, without limitation, pursuant to Rule 172), any event shall occur or
condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for Wells Fargo
Securities or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the
Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in
the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be
necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement
or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities
Act, the Company will promptly notify Wells Fargo Securities to suspend the offering of Placement
Securities during such period and the Company will promptly prepare and file with the
Commission such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or
omission or to make the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply with such requirements,
and the Company will furnish to Wells Fargo Securities such number of copies of such
amendment or supplement as Wells Fargo Securities may reasonably request. If at any time
following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or
development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted, conflicts or
would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or
included, includes or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or
would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances, prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly
notify Wells Fargo Securities to suspend the offering of Placement Securities during such period
and the Company will, subject to Section 7(a) hereof, promptly amend or supplement such Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
(e) Blue Sky and Other Qualifications. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts,
in cooperation with Wells Fargo Securities, to qualify the Placement Securities for offering and
sale, or to obtain an exemption for the Securities to be offered and sold, under the applicable
securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as Wells Fargo
Securities may designate and to maintain such qualifications and exemptions in effect for so long
as required for the distribution of the Securities (but in no event for less than one year from the
date of this Agreement); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any
general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in
securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect
of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
23
otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the Placement Securities have been so
qualified or exempt, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the
laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification or exemption, as the case may be, in effect
for so long as required for the distribution of the Placement Securities.
(f) Rule 158. The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are
necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an
earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to Wells Fargo Securities the benefits
contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
(g) Use of Proceeds. The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the
Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus under “Use of Proceeds.”
(h) Listing. During any period in which the Prospectus relating to the Placement Securities is
required to be delivered by Wells Fargo Securities under the Securities Act with respect to a
pending sale of the Placement Securities (including in circumstances where such requirement
may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act), the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Placement Securities to be listed on the NYSE.
(i) Filings with the NYSE. The Company will timely file with the NYSE all material documents and
notices required by the NYSE of companies that have or will issue securities that are traded on
the NYSE.
(j) Reporting Requirements. The Company, during any period when the Prospectus is required to
be delivered under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (including in circumstances where
such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act), will file all
documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act within the time
periods required by the Exchange Act.
(k) Notice of Other Sales. The Company will not, without (i) giving Wells Fargo Securities at least
five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice specifying the nature of the proposed sale and the date
of such proposed sale and (ii) Wells Fargo Securities suspending activity under this program for
such period of time as requested by the Company or as deemed appropriate by Wells Fargo
Securities in light of the proposed sale, (A) offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell,
grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or
indirectly, any Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or
repayable with Common Stock, or file any registration statement under the Securities Act with
respect to any of the foregoing (other than a shelf registration statement under Rule 415, a
registration statement on Form S-8 or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement) or
(B) enter into any swap or other agreement or any transaction that transfers in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or repayable with Common Stock,
whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (A) or (B) above is to be settled by
delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence
shall not apply to (x) the
24
Common Stock to be offered and sold through Wells Fargo Securities pursuant to this Agreement,
(y) Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan as it may be
amended or replaced from time to time and (z) equity incentive awards approved by the Board of
Directors or the compensation committee thereof or the issuance of Common Stock upon exercise
thereof.
(l) Change of Circumstances. The Company will, at any time during a fiscal quarter in which the
Company intends to tender a Placement Notice or sell Placement Securities, advise Wells Fargo
Securities promptly after it shall have received notice or obtained knowledge thereof, of any
information or fact that would alter or affect in any material respect any opinion, certificate, letter or
other document provided to Wells Fargo Securities pursuant to this Agreement.
(m) Due Diligence Cooperation. The Company will cooperate with any reasonable due diligence
review conducted by Wells Fargo Securities or its agents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, providing information and making available
documents and senior officers, during regular business hours and at the Company’s principal
offices, as Wells Fargo Securities may reasonably request.
(n) Disclosure of Sales. The Company will disclose in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in its
annual report on Form 10-K the number of Placement Securities sold through Wells Fargo
Securities, the Net Proceeds to the Company and the compensation payable by the Company to
Wells Fargo Securities with respect to such Placement Securities.
(o) Representation Dates; Certificate. On or prior to the date that the first Securities are sold
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and:
(1) each time the Company:
(i) files the Prospectus relating to the Placement Securities or amends or supplements the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus relating to the Placement Securities by means of a post-
effective amendment, sticker, or supplement but not by means of incorporation of documents by
reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus relating to the Placement Securities;
(ii) files an annual report on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act;
(iii) files a quarterly report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; or
(iv) files a report on Form 8-K containing amended financial information (other than an earnings
release, to “furnish” information pursuant to Items 2.02 or 7.01 of Form 8-K) under the Exchange
Act; and
(2) at any other time reasonably requested by Wells Fargo Securities (each such date of filing of
one or more of the documents referred to in clauses (1)(i) through (iv) and any time of request
pursuant to this Section 7(o) shall be a “Representation Date”),
25
the Company shall furnish Wells Fargo Securities with a certificate, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit F within three (3) Trading Days of any Representation Date. The requirement to provide a
certificate under this Section 7(o) shall be waived for any Representation Date occurring at a time
at which no Placement Notice (as amended by the corresponding Acceptance, if applicable) is
pending, which waiver shall continue until the earlier to occur of the date the Company delivers a
Placement Notice hereunder (which for such calendar quarter shall be considered a
Representation Date) and the next occurring Representation Date; provided, however, that such
waiver shall not apply for any Representation Date on which the Company files its annual report
on Form 10-K. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company subsequently decides to sell
Placement Securities following a Representation Date when the Company relied on such waiver
and did not provide Wells Fargo Securities with a certificate under this Section 7(o), then before
the Company delivers the Placement Notice or Wells Fargo Securities sells any Placement
Securities, the Company shall provide Wells Fargo Securities with a certificate, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F, dated the date of the Placement Notice.
(p) Legal Opinion. On or prior to the date that the first Securities are sold pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, within three (3) Trading Days of each Representation Date with respect to which
the Company is obligated to deliver a certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F for which
no waiver is applicable, the Company shall cause to be furnished to Wells Fargo Securities a
written opinion of Locke Lord LLP (“Company Counsel”), Maslon LLP, Minnesota counsel to the
Company, Pinsent Masons LLP, Scottish counsel to the Company, Loyens & Loeff Luxembourg
SARL, Luxembourg counsel to the Company and Maples and Calder, Cayman Islands counsel to
the Company and the General Counsel of the Company or other counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Wells Fargo Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to Wells Fargo Securities and its
counsel, dated the date that the opinion is required to be delivered, substantially similar to the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit E-1, Exhibit E-2, Exhibit E-3, Exhibit E-4, Exhibit E-5 and Exhibit
E-6 modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as then
amended or supplemented; provided, however, that in lieu of such opinions for subsequent
Representation Dates, counsel may furnish Wells Fargo Securities with a letter (a “Reliance
Letter”) to the effect that Wells Fargo Securities may rely on a prior opinion delivered under this
Section 7(p) to the same extent as if it were dated the date of such letter (except that statements in
such prior opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented at such Representation Date).
(q) Comfort Letter. On or prior to the date that the first Securities are sold pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, within three (3) Trading Days of each Representation Date with respect to which
the Company is obligated to deliver a certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F for which
no waiver is applicable, the Company shall cause its independent accountants (and any other
independent accountants whose report is included, or incorporated by reference, in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus) to furnish Wells Fargo Securities letters (the “Comfort
Letters”), dated the date of the Comfort Letter is delivered, in form and substance satisfactory to
Wells Fargo Securities, (i) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting
firm within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the PCAOB, (ii) stating, as of
such date, the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and
other matters ordinarily covered by accountants’ “comfort letters” to underwriters in connection
with registered public offerings (the first such
26
letter, the “Initial Comfort Letter”) and (iii) updating the Initial Comfort Letter with any information
that would have been included in the Initial Comfort Letter had it been given on such date and
modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended
and supplemented to the date of such letter.
(r) Opinion of Counsel for Wells Fargo Securities. On or prior to the date that the first Securities are
sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, within three (3) Trading Days of each
Representation Date with respect to which the Company is obligated to deliver a certificate in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit F for which no waiver is applicable, Wells Fargo Securities shall
have received the favorable written opinion or opinions of Latham & Watkins LLP, counsel for
Wells Fargo Securities, dated such date, with respect to such matters as Wells Fargo Securities
may reasonably request.
(s) Market Activities. The Company will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action designed to
cause or result in, or that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute, the
stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or
resale of the Securities or (ii) sell, bid for, or purchase the Securities to be issued and sold
pursuant to this Agreement, or pay anyone any compensation for soliciting purchases of the
Securities to be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement other than Wells Fargo Securities;
provided, however, that the Company may bid for and purchase its Common Stock in accordance
with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act; and provided further, that no such bids or purchases
shall be made by the Company during the three (3) Trading Days before or after any sale of any
Securities pursuant to this Agreement.
(t) Insurance. The Company and its subsidiaries shall maintain, or caused to be maintained,
insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is reasonable and customary for
companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries.
(u) Compliance with Laws. The Company and each of its subsidiaries shall maintain, or cause to
be maintained, all material environmental permits, licenses and other authorizations required by
federal, state and local law in order to conduct their businesses as described in the Prospectus,
and the Company and each of its subsidiaries shall conduct their businesses, or cause their
businesses to be conducted, in substantial compliance with such permits, licenses and
authorizations and with applicable environmental laws, except where the failure to maintain or be
in compliance with such permits, licenses and authorizations could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.
(v) Investment Company Act. The Company will conduct its affairs in such a manner so as to
reasonably ensure that neither it nor its subsidiaries will be or become, at any time prior to the
termination of this Agreement, an “investment company,” as such term is defined in the Investment
Company Act, assuming no change in the Commission’s current interpretation as to entities that
are not considered an investment company.
(w) Securities Act and Exchange Act. The Company will use its best efforts to comply with all
requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act as from time to time in
force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of, or dealings in, the Placement
Securities as contemplated by the provisions hereof and the Prospectus.
27
(x) No Offer to Sell. Other than a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) approved in advance in writing by the Company and Wells Fargo Securities in its
capacity as principal or agent hereunder, the Company (including its agents and representatives,
other than Wells Fargo Securities in its capacity as such) will not, directly or indirectly, make, use,
prepare, authorize, approve or refer to any free writing prospectus relating to the Securities to be
sold by Wells Fargo Securities as principal or agent hereunder.
(y) Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company and its subsidiaries will use their best efforts to comply
with all effective applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
(z) Regulation M. If the Company has reason to believe that the exemptive provisions set forth in
Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act are not satisfied with respect to the
Company or the Common Stock, it shall promptly notify Wells Fargo Securities and sales of the
Placement Securities under this Agreement shall be suspended until that or other exemptive
provisions have been satisfied in the judgment of each party.
SECTION 8. Payment of Expenses. The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident
to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, whether or not the transactions

provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim,
damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information.
(b) Indemnification by Wells Fargo Securities. Wells Fargo Securities agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration
Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning
31
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this
Section 10, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue
statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in
reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information.
(c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as
reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect
of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall
not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially
prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. Counsel to the indemnified parties
shall be selected as follows: counsel to Wells Fargo Securities and each person, if any, who
controls Wells Fargo Securities within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall be selected by Wells Fargo Securities; and counsel to the
Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may
participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel
to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be
counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own
counsel for Wells Fargo Securities and each person, if any, who controls Wells Fargo Securities
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their
own counsel for the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration
Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, in each case in connection with any one
action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or
body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or
contribution could be sought under this Section 10 or Section 11 hereof (whether or not the
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out
of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or
an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) Settlement Without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall
have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable,
documented fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable
for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 10(a)(1)(ii) effected without its written
consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying
party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such
32
indemnifying party shall have received notice in writing of the terms of such settlement at least 45
days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have
reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such
settlement.
SECTION 11. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 10 hereof is for any
reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party
shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and Wells Fargo
Securities on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if
the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of Wells Fargo Securities on the other hand in
connection with the statements or omissions.
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and Wells Fargo Securities on
the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the
Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and
the total commissions received by Wells Fargo Securities, in each case as set forth on the cover of
the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such
cover.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and Wells Fargo Securities on the other hand
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by the Company or by Wells Fargo Securities and the parties’ relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.
The Company and Wells Fargo Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 11 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
above in this Section 11. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 11 shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by
any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based
upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11, Wells Fargo Securities shall not be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities
purchased by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which Wells Fargo Securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
33
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 11, each person, if any, who controls Wells Fargo Securities within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as Wells Fargo Securities, and each director of the Company, each
officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
SECTION 12. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All
representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of
officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain
operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Wells
Fargo Securities or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive
delivery of the Securities to Wells Fargo Securities.
SECTION 13. Termination of Agreement.
(a) Termination; General. Wells Fargo Securities may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the
Company, as hereinafter specified at any time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of

change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any

Wells Fargo Securities, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce
contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in the Placement Securities has been
suspended or limited by the Commission or the NYSE, or if trading generally on the American
Stock Exchange, the NYSE or the Nasdaq Global Market has been suspended or limited, or

governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities
settlement or clearance services in the United States or in Europe, or (iv) if a banking moratorium
has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.

notice as hereinafter specified to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion at any time after
the date of this Agreement.

effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by Wells Fargo Securities
or the Company, as the case may be. If such termination shall occur prior to the Settlement Date
for any sale of Placement Securities, such Placement Securities shall settle in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement.
(g) Liabilities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 13, such termination shall be
without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 8 hereof, and except
that, in the case of any termination of this Agreement, Section 5, Section 10, Section 11,
Section 12, and Section 22 hereof shall survive such termination and remain in full force and
effect.

communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if
mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to Wells Fargo

of capital stock of each U.S. Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and non-assessable and, to our knowledge and except as otherwise disclosed in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus or as set forth in the Subject Instruments, are owned
by the Company, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens. As used in
this opinion, the term “U.S. Subsidiaries” means the Material Subsidiaries indicated as such on
Exhibit D to the Equity Distribution Agreement that are organized in the United States.
(3) The execution, delivery and performance of the Equity Distribution Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Equity Distribution Agreement and the
Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of the proceeds from
the sale of the Securities as described in the Prospectus under the caption “Use Of Proceeds”)
and compliance by the Company with its obligations under the Equity Distribution Agreement do
not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, constitute a
breach of, or default or Repayment Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any property or assets of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary pursuant to any material
Company Document except for such breaches, defaults or Liens that would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Organizational
Documents of the U.S. Subsidiaries or violate the Texas Business Organizations Code or any
current U.S. federal statute, rule or regulation that we have, in the exercise of customary
professional diligence, recognized as applicable to the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries or to
the transactions of the type contemplated by the Equity Distribution Agreement, nor will such
action breach or otherwise violate any existing obligation of or restriction on the Company or any
U.S. Subsidiary under any order, judgment, or decree known to us of any U.S. federal or Texas
court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary.
(4) The Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act; the
Prospectus has been filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) in the manner and within the time period
required by Rule 424(b) (without reference to Rule 424(b)(8)); any required filing of any Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 has been made
E-1
in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d); and, to our knowledge, no stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the
Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or
threatened by the Commission.
(5) The Registration Statement and any amendments thereto, as of their respective effective dates,
and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, as of their respective dates, (in
each case other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical
data included therein or omitted therefrom and the documents incorporated by reference therein,
as to which we have not been called upon to express an opinion), as of the respective dates they
were filed with the Commission or became effective, each appear on its face to be appropriately
responsive in all material respects to the applicable form requirements for registration statements
on Form S-3 under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(6) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
(other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included
therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we have not been called upon to express an opinion), as
of the respective dates they were filed with the Commission or became effective, each appear on
its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable form requirements
for such documents under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.
(7) The descriptions in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus of the Subject Instruments
are accurate in all material respects.
(8) To our knowledge and without investigation of any external dockets, except as otherwise
disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there is not pending or threatened
any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to which the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary
is a party, or to which the property of the Company or any U.S. Subsidiary is subject, before or
brought by any court or governmental agency or body which would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the properties or assets thereof or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in the Equity Distribution Agreement or the performance by the Company of its
obligations thereunder.
(9) The information in the Prospectus under the caption “Description of Capital Stock,” “Certain
U.S. Federal Income and Estate Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders,” “Business-
Government Regulation,” “Business-Environmental Regulation,” and the information in the
Registration Statement under Item 15, in each case to the extent that it constitutes matters of law,
summaries of legal matters, summaries of provisions of the Company’s charter or bylaws, any
Subject Instrument or other instruments or agreements, summaries of legal proceedings, or legal
conclusions, has been reviewed by us and is correct in all material respects.
(10) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or
decree of, any U.S. federal or Texas state court or
E-2
governmental authority or agency (other than under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
which have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the
various states, as to which we have not been called upon to express an opinion) is necessary or
required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Equity Distribution
Agreement or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities.
(11) The Company is not and, immediately after giving effect to the sale of the Securities as
contemplated in the Equity Distribution Agreement and the application of the net proceeds
therefrom as described in the Prospectus, will not be required to register as an “investment
company,” as such term is defined in the 1940 Act.
In addition, Locke Lord LLP shall include in its opinion or a separate letter the following language:
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company,
representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and your
representatives, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the
Prospectus Supplement, and related matters were discussed. The purpose of our professional
engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (the “Offering
Documents”) (except as and to the extent stated in paragraph 9 above), and we have not
undertaken to verify independently any of the factual matters in such documents. Moreover, many
of the determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Offering Documents involve
matters of a non-legal nature. Accordingly, we do not pass upon and do not assume responsibility
for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Offering Documents,
(except as and to the extent stated in paragraph 9 above). Subject to the foregoing and on the
basis of the information we gained in the course of performing services referred to above, we
advise you that nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that:
(a) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or
any such amendment was declared effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, or
(b) the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, as of their respective dates or on the date of this letter, included or includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading,
except in each case that we make no statement and express no belief with respect to financial
statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data included or incorporated by
reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto.
E-3
In the event that such opinion shall define the term “Registration Statement,” “Prospectus” or
“Issuer Free Writing Prospectus” (rather than indicating that such terms, as used in such opinion,
have the respective meanings given thereto in the Equity Distribution Agreement ), such opinion
shall define the terms “Registration Statement” to include the information deemed to be a part of
such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the Securities, shall define the term
“Prospectus” as the Prospectus in the form first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b),
and shall define the term “Issuer Free Writing Prospectus” as those documents in the respective
forms furnished to Wells Fargo Securities for use in connection with the offering of the Securities
and shall define the terms “Registration Statement” and “Prospectus” as including the documents
incorporated by reference therein.
In rendering such opinion, Company Counsel shall state that such opinion covers matters arising
under the laws of the State of Texas and the federal laws of the United States of America. In
rendering such opinion, Company Counsel may rely as to matters involving the laws of any other
state upon the opinion of local counsel satisfactory to Wells Fargo Securities; provided that such
opinion shall be addressed to Wells Fargo Securities, shall state that Company Counsel may rely
on such opinion as if it were addressed to them in rendering their opinion pursuant to the Equity
Distribution Agreement, shall be dated the same date as the opinion of Company Counsel, shall
be delivered to Wells Fargo Securities at the same time that the opinion of Company Counsel is
delivered, and shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Wells Fargo Securities. In
rendering such opinion, Company Counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal
conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the
Company and public officials. Such opinion may state that, whenever a statement therein is
qualified by the phrase “to our knowledge,” it is intended to indicate that no information has come
to the attention of those attorneys in such firm who are responsible for opinion letter (after such
inquiry with such attorneys in such firm, and review of such documents as they considered
necessary) that has given such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement.
Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject
to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without
limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).
