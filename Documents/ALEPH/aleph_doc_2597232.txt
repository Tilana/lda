CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Information Concerning Operation of the Board
Our board of directors has the responsibility for establishing our broad corporate policies and for our overall
performance. However, the board of directors is not involved in our day-to-day operations. The board of directors is
kept informed of our business through discussions with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and other officers,
by reviewing analyses and reports provided to it on a regular basis, and by participating in board of directors and
committee meetings. Our board of directors held 13 meetings during 2015, including telephonic meetings, and acted
by unanimous written consent 10 times, and all directors attended at least 75% of the total meetings of the board of
directors and the committees on which such director served during the fiscal year.
Our board of directors currently has four standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate
Governance, and Reserves. Actions taken by our committees are reported to the full board of
11
directors. Each committee conducts an annual evaluation of its duties and is expected to conduct an annual review of
its respective charter.

for audit committee members, under our corporate governance guidelines, and in accordance

an “audit committee financial expert” (as defined under SEC rules).
The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of Company risks relating to accounting matters, financial reporting
and related legal and regulatory compliance. The Audit Committee annually considers the qualifications and evaluates
the performance of our independent auditor and selects and engages our independent auditor. The Audit Committee

independent auditor. During these meetings, the Audit Committee receives reports regarding our books of accounts,
accounting procedures, financial statements, audit policies and procedures, internal accounting and financial controls,
and other matters within the scope of the Audit Committee’s duties. The Audit Committee reviews the plans for and
the results of audits for us and our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee reviews the independence of the independent
auditor, and considers and authorizes the fees for both audit and non-audit services provided by the independent
auditor. In 2015, our Audit Committee held four meetings.
Compensation Committee.  The members of our Compensation Committee are Tucker S. Bridwell,
Daniel A. Rioux, Michael A. Vlasic and Mark A. Welsh IV, with Mr. Vlasic serving as the

monitoring the compensation for our executive officers (our chief executive officer, president, each executive vice
president, and each senior vice president). The Compensation Committee also administers our First Amended and
Restated 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or Plan, and approves restricted stock, stock option, and performance

under our corporate governance guidelines, and in accordance with our nominating and
corporate governance committee charter.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying qualified candidates to be
presented to our board of directors for nomination as directors, ensuring that our board of directors and our
organizational documents are structured in a way that best serves our practices and objectives, and developing and
recommending a set of corporate governance principles. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may
consider candidates for our board of directors from any reasonable source, including a search firm engaged by the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee,

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more
than 10% of our common stock to file certain reports with the SEC concerning their beneficial ownership of our equity
securities. The SEC’s regulations also require that a copy of all such Section 16(a) forms filed must be furnished to
us by the executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders.
To our knowledge based solely on a review of copies of reports filed under Section 16(a) during the 2015 fiscal year
and furnished to us, our directors, executive officers and holders of 10% or more of our shares timely filed reports
required by Section 16(a), with the exception of one Form 5 filed late on behalf of Mr. Wilson relating to a gift of
11,000 shares to the Elijah B. Wilson Trust.
SECURITYHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Our board welcomes communications from our stockholders and other interested parties. Stockholders and any other
interested parties may send communications to our board, to any committee of our board, to the Lead Director, or to
any director in particular to: c/o Halcón Resources Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 1000 Louisiana St.,
Suite 6700, Houston, Texas 77002. Any correspondence addressed to our board, to any committee of our board, to
the Lead Director, or to any one of the directors in care of our offices is required to be forwarded to the addressee or
addressees without review by any person to whom such correspondence is not addressed.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Charter of Aircraft
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company occasionally charters private aircraft from unaffiliated air charter
companies. Floyd C. Wilson, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, indirectly owns
16
an aircraft which is managed by an independent air charter company unaffiliated with both Mr. Wilson and the
Company. The Company occasionally charters private aircraft, including the aircraft owned indirectly by Mr. Wilson,
from this company. The aircraft in the air charter company’s fleet, including the aircraft indirectly owned by
Mr. Wilson, are available to the public for charter based upon a standard fee schedule established by the air charter
company, with the fees dependent primarily upon the type and size of the aircraft utilized and the duration of the flight.
During 2015, the Company paid a total of approximately $0.5 million to the air charter company that manages
Mr. Wilson’s aircraft, all of which was related to the use of the aircraft indirectly owned by Mr. Wilson. Because the air
charter company establishes fees for the use of the aircraft in its fleet, Mr. Wilson does not receive any greater
benefit from the Company’s charter of the aircraft indirectly owned by him than he does if any third party were to
charter those aircraft. Any fees related to the charter of the aircraft are paid to the air charter company, which deducts
from revenues received from charter customers a variety of expenses incidental to use of the aircraft (such as
personnel, fuel and commissions) and recurring charges (such as for inspections, maintenance, storage and service).
The use of charter and Company-owned aircraft by Company personnel is governed by the Company’s Aircraft Policy.
Our policies do not require that a special committee of the Company’s independent directors approve the use of
aircraft chartered through an unaffiliated air charter company that independently establishes the amount charged under
arrangements that otherwise comply with our Aircraft Policy.
Related Party Transaction Review Policies and Procedures
A transaction or series of similar transactions to which we are a party in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000
and involves a director, executive officer, 5% stockholder or any immediate family members of these persons is
evaluated by a special committee of disinterested directors formed by our board of directors to evaluate such
transactions. In addition, our code of conduct provides that every employee should disclose any material transaction
or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest to upper management or the
Company’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has the authority to evaluate any such conflicts of interest and
recommend actions to be taken by our board in connection with such conflicts of interest or to report the existence of
any such conflicts of interest to the full board for it to take action.

(1)                                 Awards granted under the Plan provide only for a single estimated payout. Under
the Plan there are no minimum amounts payable for a certain level of performance and there are
no maximum payouts possible above the target. Thus, there are no thresholds or maximums (or
equivalent items) applicable to these awards.
(2)                                 Represents shares of restricted stock and stock options issued under the Plan.
The shares of restricted stock and stock options vest in three equal installments on each
anniversary of the date of grant, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant, in each
case, provided that the recipient has been continuously employed at such date.
(3)                                 The exercise price of each award is equal to the closing market price of our
common stock on the date of grant.
(4)                                 Represents the full grant date fair value determined in accordance with ASC
Topic 718. Please see the discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of these awards
in “Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Generally, the full grant
date fair value is the amount that we would expense in our financial statements over the award’s
vesting schedule. These amounts reflect our accounting expense, and do not correspond to the
actual value that will be recognized by the named executive officers.

(2)                                 Calculated based upon the closing market price of our common stock as of
December 31, 2015, the last trading day of our 2015 fiscal year ($1.26) multiplied by the number
of unvested awards at year end.
(3)                                 Represents unvested performance units at the threshold number of shares that
may be earned. Performance units vest in one installment on the third anniversary of the date of
grant; provided, the average of the adjusted closing prices of our common stock during the sixty
trading days preceding the vesting date is equal to or greater than $20.00.

(1)                     The value realized upon the exercise of the option award is determined by multiplying
the number of shares acquired on exercise by the difference between the closing price of our
common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option.

vesting, multiplied by the number of shares vested.
Employment Agreements
The initial term of employment of Mr. Wilson was for a term of two years from June 1, 2012, the effective date of his
employment agreement, which the Company elected to renew for an additional two years effective June 1, 2014. The
initial term of employment of each of Messrs. Herod, Mize, Cusack and Elkouri was originally until December 31,
2013, with automatic one-year extensions unless either party provides written notice thirty days prior to expiration of
the initial term or any extension. Our failure to renew an executive’s employment agreement will be considered a
termination without cause under each employment agreement.
Board Representation
Mr. Wilson’s employment agreement provides that he will be nominated as a member of our board of directors, and
that we will use our best efforts to cause him to be elected, appointed, or re-elected or re-appointed, as a director.

(1)                                 Represents the grant date fair value of awards granted during the indicated year,
as determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Pursuant to SEC rules, the amounts shown
exclude the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. Please
see the discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of these awards in “Note 11—
Stockholders’ Equity” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Generally, the full grant date fair
value is the amount that we would expense in our financial statements over the award’s vesting
schedule. These amounts reflect our accounting expense, and do not correspond to the actual
value that will be recognized by our directors.
(2)                                 The number of restricted stock awards subject to vesting, excluding shares
received in lieu of fees, made to each of our directors for service as a director during 2015 was
19,440.
(3)                                 Represents the numerical sum of the dollar amounts reflected in each other
column for each director.
(4)                                 Mr. Hunt received a prorated amount of director compensation as a result of his
decision not to stand for re-election at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders.
(5)                                 Messrs. Irish and Smiley received a prorated amount of director compensation as
a result of their resignations from our board of directors in January 2015.

Discussion of Director Compensation Table
Employee directors receive no additional compensation for service on our board of directors or any committee of the
board of directors. All directors receive actual expense reimbursements associated with attending board and
committee meetings. For 2015, our non-employee directors each received $40,000 in cash per year (payable on a
quarterly basis in the amount of $10,000). Our director compensation program in 2015 consisted of two principal
elements: (1) annual retainer and committee fees and (2) equity consisting of restricted stock awards. Our lead
independent director received an additional $50,000 per year (payable on a quarterly basis in the amount of $12,500).
Additional annual compensation for each committee chairperson and committee member for all of the committees of
our board of directors is set forth below:
