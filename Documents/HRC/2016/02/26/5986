</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the provisions concerning migrants contained in the outcome documents of 
all major United Nations conferences and summits, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that every State must ensure the protection of human rights of all individuals 
within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, without discrimination of any kind, including 
in particular on the basis of national origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 27 June 2001 and advisory 
opinions OC 16/99 of 1 October 1999 and OC 18/03 of 17 September 2003, issued by the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, on the right to information on consular assistance in the 
framework of the guarantees of the due process of law and on the juridical condition and rights 
of undocumented migrants, respectively, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 31 March 2004 in the 
<i>Avena and Other Mexican Nationals</i> case (<i>Mexico v. United States of America</i>) and recalling the 
obligations of States reaffirmed therein, as well as in the subsequent rulings of the International 
Court of Justice following that judgment, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and children, 
who attempt to cross international borders without the required travel documents, which places 
them in a particularly vulnerable situation, and recognizing the obligation of States to respect the 
human rights of those migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the increasing participation of women in international migration movements, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the manifestations of violence, racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and other forms of intolerance and inhuman and degrading treatment against 
migrants, especially women and children, in different parts of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/208 of 23 December 2003, in New York on 14 and 
15 September 2006, for the purpose of discussing the multidimensional aspects of international 
migration and development, which recognized the relationship between international migration, 
development and human rights, </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/L.14 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the adoption of resolution 62/270 by the General Assembly on the Global Forum on 
Migration and Development in which, inter alia, the Assembly recognizes that exchanges of 
information and expertise, consultation and closer cooperation between the Global Forum on 
Migration and Development and the United Nations could have a positive impact, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the role of migrants in positive interaction, particularly in social and cultural 
fields between the countries of migration, and their contribution to the promotion of international 
ties, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving 
societies and their communities of origin and committing to ensure dignified, humane treatment 
with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation to 
address their legitimate needs, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including those that 
refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic approaches that take into 
account the causes and consequences of the phenomenon, the full respect of human rights and 
the fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved </i>to ensure respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in 
this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Strongly condemns the manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, 
and urges States to apply existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts or manifestations or 
expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit 
xenophobic and racist acts; </p>

<p> (<i>c</i>) Expresses concern at legislation and measures adopted by some States that may

</p>

</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Also requests States to prosecute, in conformity with applicable law, any act of 
violation of the human rights of migrants and their families, inter alia, arbitrary detention, torture

observance of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, particularly with regard to the right

territory the detention occurs to inform the foreign national of that right; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Requests all States, in conformity with national legislation and applicable 
international legal instruments to which they are party, to prosecute violations of labour law

remuneration and conditions of health, safety at work and the right to freedom of association; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Encourages all States to remove unlawful obstacles that may prevent the safe, 
unrestricted and expeditious transfer of earnings, assets and pensions of migrants to their country 
of origin or to any other countries, in conformity with applicable legislation, and to consider, as

</p>
<p> 3. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance of protecting vulnerable groups, and in this regard: 
</p>

harmonious and tolerant environment, and encourages States to consider the possibility of 
adopting that type of programme;

Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the two additional Protocols thereto;
