This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding expected future
events, business prospectus or financial results. The words
"expect",  "anticipate",  "continue",  "estimate",  "objective",  "ongoing",  "may",  "will",  "project",
"should",  "believe",  "plans",  "intends"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to  identify  such

expected future developments, as well as other factors that the Company believes reasonable
under  the  circumstances.  However,  whether  actual  results  and  developments  will  meet  the
Company’s expectations and predictions depends on a number of risks and uncertainties which
could cause the actual results, performance and financial conditions to differ materially from the
Company’s  expectations,  including  those  associated  with  fluctuations  in  crude  oil  and  natural
gas prices, the exploration or development activities, the capital expenditure requirements, the
business  strategy,  whether  the  transactions  entered  into  by  the  Company  can  complete  on
schedule pursuant to its timetable or at all, the highly competitive nature of the oil and natural gas
industries,  the  foreign  operations,  environmental  liabilities  and  compliance  requirements,  and
economic and political conditions in the People’s Republic of China. For a description of these
and other risks and uncertainties, please see the documents the Company has filed from time to
time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2012 Annual
Report on Form 20-F filed on April 24, 2013.
 
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by
these  cautionary  statements.  The  Company  cannot  assure  that  the  results  or  developments
anticipated  will  be  realized  or,  even  if  substantially  realized,  that  they  will  have  the  expected
effect on the Company, its business or operations.
