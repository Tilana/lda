<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth session from 
21 May to 4 June 2012. The review of South Africa was held at the 16th meeting on 31 
May 2012. The delegation of South Africa was headed by Andries Nel, Deputy Minister of 
Justice and Constitutional Development. At its 18th meeting, held on 4 June 2012, the 
Working Group adopted the report on South Africa. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of South Africa: Czech Republic, Maldives and 
Cameroon. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1 and 
paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of South Africa: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/13/ZAF/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/ZAF/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/ZAF/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to South Africa through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Andries Nel, Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, conveyed 
to the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review the warm greetings of the 
Government and people of South Africa. 
</p>
<p>6. He stated that South Africa was among the first group of countries to be reviewed 
under the UPR in 2008 and, therefore, it was with a deep sense of honour that it presented 
its second report to that mechanism, which was based on the purposes and principles 
contained in the Charter of the United Nations, including developing friendly relations 
among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of 
peoples, and achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an 
economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. 
</p>
<p>7. Earlier that year South Africa had celebrated 18 years of democracy that had 
followed its first democratic elections on 27 April 1994, as well as the fifteenth anniversary 
of the entry into force of its Constitution on 4 February 1997. 
</p>
<p>8. The Constitution set out the framework within which to overcome the legacy of 
apartheid, predicated on the country&#8217;s collective desire to heal the divisions of the past and </p>


<p>to establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human 
rights and to progressively improve the quality of life for its people and to build a united 
democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place among the community of nations. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution created statutory institutions, such as the Commission for Gender 
Equality, the Human Rights Commission, and the Commission for the Promotion and 
Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities, to assist in 
ensuring the realization of those and other rights. Legislation had also been passed to 
combat discrimination, and to give citizens access to equality courts in the event of 
suffering such discrimination. 
</p>
<p>10. Even in the midst of bitter struggle, the liberation movement of South Africa 
developed moral values of human compassion and solidarity far beyond the narrow 
confines of its opposition to the apartheid social system. It represented something good, not 
just something better than apartheid. It asserted the humanness of the human spirit&#8211;the 
search for societies at peace within and among themselves. 
</p>
<p>11. Naturally, over time, the internalization, grasp and general understanding of the 
UPR process and its requirements had significantly improved from the State&#8217; initial 
experience and interaction with the Working Group on 15 April 2008, at its first session. 
</p>
<p>12. South Africa was grateful that the South African civil society, in its broad 
formations as stakeholders active in the human rights sector, had also found the process 
useful and had lodged their own independent reports, reflecting their own experiences of 
human rights enjoyment in the country. 
</p>
<p>13. South Africa acknowledged and appreciated the recommendations generated for the 
State during the first session of the Working Group for their consideration for 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>14. All efforts of Government continued to be aimed at redressing the inequalities, 
imbalances and historical injustices, at restoring social justice to the people and at building 
a united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist society. 
</p>
<p>15. While the apartheid regime provided for the well-being of a mere 5 million White 
people, the new democratic Government was immediately faced with the mammoth task of 
providing for the well-being of the total population&#8212;in excess of 40 million people. The 
implication of that task entailed, among others, ensuring the progressive realization to food 
security, access to health services, quality education, social security, adequate housing, 
water and sanitation, rural development, land reform and land restitution, and electrification 
of rural and peri-urban areas&#8212;with very limited resources. 
</p>
<p>16. In its efforts to give effect to socioeconomic rights, the Government, working with 
the people, had over the years expanded the delivery of social services. 
</p>
<p>17. Since 1994, the national housing programme had delivered 2.8 million new housing 
units. That had provided shelter for an additional 13.5 million people, approximately 25 per 
cent of the population, making the programme one of the world&#8217;s largest subsidized 
housing programmes. By December 2011, 87 per cent of the rural households had been 
provided with clean water, and 75 per cent with access to sanitation.  
</p>
<p>18. Furthermore, the Government provided social grants to more than 15 million people, 
approximately 30 per cent of the population, mainly vulnerable groups such as children, 
persons above the age of 60 and people with disabilities. Importantly, those benefits were 
currently extended to non-nationals with permanent residence status and refugees. 
</p>
<p>19. Access to basic education had been broadened through increased access to schooling 
for children from poor households by removing the payment of school fees, benefiting 8 </p>


<p>million children, and through the conversion of tertiary institution loans into bursaries for 
qualifying students. 
</p>
<p>20. One of the major achievements in education was the doubling of the foundation 
phase enrolment from 300,000 in 2003 to 705,000 in 2011. By 2009, 98.5 per cent of 
children aged 7 to 15 and 98.8 per cent of children aged 7 to 14 were enrolled in school. 
The country remained poised to meet its target of 100 per cent enrolment by 2014. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to health, among many improvements, in addition to the existing 385 
public hospitals, a total of 29 hospitals in rural and urban areas were under construction, 
while 17 others were in the planning and design stage. Those facilities would also provide 
services for people with HIV and AIDS. Over 3,000 primary health-care clinics were 
currently able to provide counselling, testing and treatment for people with HIV and AIDS. 
That had resulted in an increase in the number of patients accessing antiretroviral therapy, 
from 500,000 in 2008 to 1.9 million in 2012. Access to HIV testing and treatment for 
mothers and children had improved, resulting in a more than 50 per cent reduction in HIV 
transmission from mothers to children, from 8 per cent in 2008 to 3.5 per cent in 2010. 
</p>
<p>22. South Africa had prioritized the issues of gender equality and the advancement of 
the rights of women, and the promotion and protection of the rights of the child and people 
with disabilities. The Government had established, in 2009, a fully fledged Department for 
Women, Children and People with Disabilities with the core mandate of advocacy for 
mainstreaming and monitoring Government policies and programmes with respect to those 
targeted groups. 
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation was prohibited by 
the Constitution. Given the recent spate of violence that had targeted lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex persons, the Government had established a national task team 
comprising representatives from the Government and civil society to advise on measures to 
ensure maximum protection and adequate remedies and to combat impunity. The courts had 
set an important precedent and sent a strong signal that crimes of that nature would not be 
tolerated. Recently, four perpetrators of the so-called &#8213;corrective rape&#8214; of lesbians had been 
sentenced to 18 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government remained undeterred in its pursuit of a nation united in its 
diversity, creating platforms for social dialogue to strengthen and deepen acceptance, 
tolerance and racial harmony. To that end, specialized institutions, provided for by the 
Constitution, had been established to promote and protect cultural, linguistic and religious 
rights and practices of the people. 
</p>
<p>25. Those values also constituted the vision South Africa had of the creation of a better 
Africa in a better world based on the principles of social and universal justice. 
</p>
<p>26. At a global level South Africa had, among others, hosted the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, 
the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance, the 2010 International Federation of Association Football World Cup and the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(COP 17) as a demonstration of its commitment to multilateralism, its acceptance of its 
global responsibilities, and its promotion of a fair, just and equitable world order. 
</p>
<p>27. In pursuit of that vision, the Government had hosted and played a significant role at 
a regional level at the 2002 African Union Summit where the Constitutive Act of the 
African Union was launched in pursuance of a common vision of a united and strong Africa 
in order to strengthen cohesion and solidarity among its peoples. 
</p>
<p>28. In addition, South Africa hosted the recently concluded Global African Diaspora 
Summit on 25 May 2012, which resolved to establish an African Union diaspora volunteer </p>


<p>programme, aimed at linking the diaspora with the development efforts of the continent and 
giving practical meaning to the concept of one African family. 
</p>
<p>29. The Government would continue to pursue its key priorities as set out in the 
Medium Term Strategic Framework (2009&#8211;2014). Those included the establishment of the 
National Health Insurance system with the objective to ensure universal health coverage. 
</p>
<p>30. The Government was implementing a gender equity strategy to achieve its target of 
a minimum of 50 per cent for women&#8217;s representation. For example, representation of 
women in the legislature stood at 44 per cent as compared to 25 per cent after the first 
democratic elections in 1994. A new gender equity bill aimed at enforcing gender parity 
measures across all sectors of society was in the pipeline. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to safety and security, the delegation was happy to report that the crime 
statistics released during September 2011 confirmed that the tide was turning in the fight 
against crime. A reduction in the reported crime statistics had been seen across all 
categories of crime. Importantly, the 2011 National Victims of Crime Survey findings 
supported trends that showed a decrease in crime levels. 
</p>
<p>32. All the above were examples of key priorities that the Government of South Africa 
was pursuing towards the realization of the aspirations of its people and the fulfilment of its 
international obligations as regards the respect for and promotion, protection and fulfilment 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Government would continue to work 
tirelessly towards the development of the country, as a developmental State that responded 
to the needs and aspirations of its people. To that end, the Government was striving to 
strengthen the public sector to improve the provision of services within a developmental 
State. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government was committed to working with independent institutions created to 
support the constitutional democracy, such as the Human Rights Commission, the 
Commission for Gender Equality and the Office of the Public Protector. 
</p>
<p>34. The Government also pledged its commitment to do all in its power to sign and 
ratify, before the end of 2012, all outstanding instruments in the area of international human 
rights and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>35. The delegation stated, in conclusion, that while extraordinary progress had been 
made over the previous 18 years, there was much left to be done and that the Government 
was very mindful of the words of its former President, Nelson Mandela: &#8213;I have taken a 
moment here to rest, to steal a view on the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on 
the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come 
responsibilities and I dare not linger for my long walk is not yet ended&#8214;.

</p>
<p>114. South Africa then provided responses to questions presented in advance and during 
the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>115. Regarding legislation on the crime of torture, the Cabinet had recently approved a 
draft bill criminalizing torture in South Africa, consistent with the provisions of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. The bill was being processed through Parliament. 
</p>
<p>116. On the Protection of State Information Bill, it was clarified that the bill was not a 
media bill. The primary purpose was not to regulate or interfere in any way with the media 
or access to information, but rather to amend current statutes not consistent with the </p>


<p>Constitution. The Government had been very open and had engaged with the media and 
with civil society. The draft bill was currently before Parliament. 
</p>
<p>117. The Government was committed to combating any discrimination or violence 
against persons on the basis of sexual orientation and had pronounced itself accordingly. 
The Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development has established a task team to 
develop a national intervention strategy on those crimes through, among others, research 
and policy development. The Government had adopted measures that focused, inter alia, on 
the prevention, combating and punishment of sexual violence against women and children. 
Those included support for the victims through the establishment of victim-friendly 
facilities. Additionally, the Government was considering re-establishing sexual-offences 
courts. 
</p>
<p>118. With regard to questions raised on fighting crime in rural areas, it was reiterated that 
crime had decreased in the fiscal year 2010/11. Contact crimes, which included serious 
offences such as murder, rape and assault, had decreased by 6.9 per cent. Furthermore, in 
2010 the Rural Safety Strategy had been launched; it involved the various actors concerned 
in addressing contact crimes, such as farm killings and others. Regarding allegations that 
some police officials had accepted bribes from rape suspects, South Africa responded that 
the Government took such allegations very seriously and, when they were reported, 
criminal and administrative proceedings were immediately instituted. The community was 
also continuously encouraged to report such action. 
</p>
<p>119. South Africa indicated that the Government was developing a comprehensive 
immigration policy by reviewing its existing legislation, systems and processes. Research 
had been undertaken to identify best international practices and adapt them to the South 
African situation, and a draft policy document had been developed. In June 2012 the 
department would undertake a programme of consultation and advocacy with key 
stakeholders, which would culminate in an amendment of the Immigration and Refugee 
Acts by the end of March 2013. The policy would be in line with the South African 
Constitution, which was founded on the principles of self-determination, non-
discrimination and human rights. The policy would also take into consideration all the 
recommendations made by various United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies 
and international humanitarian law agencies. The Government remained committed to the 
ratification of all outstanding international human rights and humanitarian law instruments. 
In terms of concerns raised about the application of the principle of non-refoulement, the 
current Refugees Act incorporated that principle and it was complied with by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>120. On issues relating to health, South Africa informed the Human Rights Council that a 
number of interventions had been introduced to decrease maternal and child mortality, 
which it acknowledged was unacceptably high. Both maternal and child mortality were 
related to the generalized HIV epidemic that the country had faced since the early 1990s. It 
was indicated, however, that some gains had been made in reducing these rates. South 
Africa referred to a recent World Health Organization-Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS and World Bank report that indicated that maternal mortality had been reduced 
by about 6 per cent in the previous five years. With respect to reducing HIV/AIDS, a five-
year national strategy was being implemented and an accelerated plan to prevent mother-to-
child transmission was also under way. The plan had already resulted in a significant 
decrease in the transmission of HIV from mothers to children between 2008 and 2010. 
Information on treatment thresholds for HIV-positive women and children and initiatives to 
reduce maternal and child mortality was also provided. 
</p>
<p>121. With regard to questions on corporal punishment, South Africa clarified that the 
courts had outlawed corporal punishment as an infringement of the right to be free from 
inhuman treatment or punishment. Additionally, legislation was subsequently adopted in </p>


<p>that regard, including the South African Schools Act of 1996, which prohibited corporal 
punishment in a school setting, and the 1997 Abolishment of Corporal Punishment Act, 
which was a law of general application. South Africa explained that the issue of complaints 
on compliance with treaty obligations had been taken to a higher level. A committee of 
relevant government departments had been set up to address the follow-up to the UPR and 
other reports. The committee would be working with the South African Human Rights 
Commission. Additionally a work plan was being developed to address not only reporting 
to human rights bodies and mechanisms but also the ratification of human rights 
instruments. The initiative had the support of various key authorities. 
</p>
<p>122. On poverty eradication, the delegation indicated that social assistance constituted the 
Government&#8217;s largest poverty alleviation measures, which provided social assistance in the 
form of income support to more than 15 million persons at a cost of 3.5 per cent of the 
gross domestic product. It was acknowledged that the income support would not suffice to 
change the fortunes of the people unless it was complimented by other initiatives. The anti-
poverty strategy incorporated education, one of the strong pillars of the country&#8217;s anti-
poverty initiative. South Africa expressed its belief that through education it would be able 
to improve the future possibilities of its people to participate actively in the labour market, 
making it possible for them to earn their own income to provide for their own livelihood 
and interrupting the cycle of poverty from one generation to the next. Those measures were 
supported by initiatives to provide health-care services for vulnerable groups. Poverty 
eradication was treated very seriously by the Government and efforts to expand the social 
safety net to cover as many persons as possible were continuous. It was reiterated that 
access to social assistance programmes had been extended to permanent residents as well as 
to persons who had been granted refugee status. As a result no one in the country currently 
suffered from lack of access to food. 
</p>
<p>123. South Africa indicated that it had noted a number of requests for information that it 
had been unable to respond to because of lack of time, and would provide the information 
at a later date. It thanked the delegations for their participation, their questions and the 
constructive recommendations that had been made. 
</p>
