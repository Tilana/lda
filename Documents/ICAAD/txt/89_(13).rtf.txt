The Court observes that you have pleaded guilty before a full hearing of the case hence you are entitled for a reduction of 6 months of your term of imprisonment which now stands to 12 months. 

14.     
 You are not a first offender and hence you are not entitled to the credit that is given to an offender with previous good character.

The Court is mindful of the fact that a sentence below two (02) years could be suspended in terms of Section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009,
