SUMMING UP

Madam and Gentlemen of Assessors,

1.      
It is now my duty to sum up this case to you. I will direct on matters of Law which you must accept and act upon. On matters of facts however, which witnesses to accept as reliable, which version of the evidence to accept, these are matters for you to decide for yourselves. So if I express my opinion to you about facts of the case or if I appear to do so it is a matter for you whether you accept what I say, or form your own opinions. In other words you are the judges of facts. All matters of facts are for you to decide. It is for you to decide the credibility of the witnesses and what parts of their evidence you accept as true and what parts you reject.

2.      
You have to decide what facts are proved and what inferences drawn from those facts. You then apply law as I explain it to you and form your individual opinion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. 

3.      
 Prosecution and defence made submissions to you about the facts of this case. That is their duty. But it is a matter for you to decide which version of the facts to accept or reject.

4.      
You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions but merely your opinions of yourself and your opinion need not be unanimous but it would be desirable if you agree on them. Your opinions are not binding on me but I can tell you that they carry great weight with me when I deliver my judgement.

5.      
On the question of proof, I must direct you as a matter of law that the onus of burden of proof lies on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts. There is no obligation on the accused person to prove his innocence. Under our criminal justice system accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. This is the golden rule.

6.      
The standard of proof in a criminal trial is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means you must be satisfied so that you are sure of the accused's guilt before you can express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about his guilt then you must express an opinion that he is not guilty.

7.      
Proof can be established only through evidence. Evidence can be from direct evidence that is the evidence that who saw the incident or felt the offence being committed. The other kind of evidence is circumstantial evidence that you put one or more circumstances together and draw certain irresistible inferences. Evidence presented in the form of a document is called Documentary evidence.

8.      
In assessing evidence of witnesses you need to consider certain tests. Examples:

"        
Consistency: That is whether a witness saying the story on the same lines without variations and contradictions.

"        
Probability: That is whether the witness was talking about in his/her evidence is probable in the circumstances of the case.

"        
Spontaneity: That is whether a witness has behaved in a natural or rational way in the circumstances that he/she talking about. 

9. The caution interview statement of the accused person is in evidence. What an accused says in his caution interview is evidence against him. I will direct you shortly on how you should consider that evidence.

10. The facts which agreed between the prosecution and the defence are called agreed facts. You may accept those facts as if they had been led from witnesses from witness box. The following facts are agreed between the Prosecution and the Accused.

1.      
Isimeli Ronavutukalou, 23 years of age at time of alleged offending, farmer of Naitasiri Settlement, Naitasiri is the Defendant in this case.

2.      
NM, Waitress of Naisogo, Village, Naitasiri is the complainant in this case.

3.      
The alleged offending occurred on the month of August 2011 at Naisogo, Village, Naitasiri.

4.      
As per paragraph 3, the complainant got off the bus at Naisogo Village and walked quite a distance to her home.

5.      
As per paragraph 4, the complainant slowed down and walked to the side of the road since she wanted to relieve herself.

6.      
The admissibility of following documents is not in dispute.

a)      
The medical report of NM dated 31/08/2011.

b)      
The typed and hand written Caution Interview Statement of Isimeli Ronavutukalou dated 01/09/2011.

c)      
The typed and hand written Charge Statement of Isimeli Ronavutukalou dated 01/09/2011.

11. Your decisions must be solely and exclusively upon the evidence, which you have heard in this court and upon nothing else. You must disregard anything you have heard about this case outside of this court room. 

12.     
Your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence apply the law to those facts. Approach the evidence with detachment and objectivity. Do not get carried away by emotions.

13.     
 Now let's look at the charges.

Statement of Offence

RAPE: Contrary to Section 207(1)(2)(a) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

 ISIMELI RONAVUTUKALOU on the 31st Day of August 2011 at Naisogo Village, Naitasiri in the Central Division had carnal knowledge of NM without her consent.

14.     
In order to prove the offence of Rape the prosecution has to prove following elements beyond reasonable doubt.

1. The accused had carnal knowledge of the complainant,

2. without her consent,

3. He knew or believed that that she was not consenting or didn't care if she was not consenting.

15.     
Carnal knowledge is the penetration of vagina or anus by the penis. It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that there was ejaculation, or even that there was full penetration.

16.     
In this case victim was 20 years of age at the time of the offence and, therefore, she had the capacity under the law to consent. Therefore, the offence of rape is made out only if there was no consent from the alleged victim.

Now let's look at the evidence led by the prosecution in this case.

17.     

1.      
The first witness was the victim, NM. According to her she is 22 years old and resides at Gaji Road, Samabula. In the year 2011 she was working in a restaurant in Suva market. On 31/08/2011 she finished her work at 4.30pm and went to R. B. Patel Supermarket to buy some food items for her child. After purchase she had boarded a Nausori bound bus to go to Naisogo Village as her daughter was looked after there. When she got off the bus it was dark. As her house is little far from the road she started to walk. When she came closer to Isimeli's house she had seen accused, Emoni and two other boys were standing there. She knew the accused and Emoni as they are related to her. She had requested from Emoni whether he could come with her up to her house. He agreed and all walked up to a bridge. At the bridge accused told Emoni that he was going to drop the victim. At that time victim wanted to relieve herself. She had gone to a grassy land and relived herself. At that time a taxi went passing her. When she was about to wear her undergarment the accused came there and grabbed her hand and pushed. As a result she fell on the grass. At that time accused had asked whether she was going to give him. He then pulled down her undergarment and inserted his penis into her vagina for about two minutes. As she was terrified and scared she did not shout for help. According to her she never consented for sex. When she saw the two boys accused stood up and ran away from the scene. She then stood up and went towards the bridge. While seated on the bridge Emoni had come there and she told the incident to him. Emoni brought her shoes and hand bag from the scene of crime.

Analysis of the Evidence

19.     
As assessors and judges of facts, in this case this victim (NM) gave evidence first. According to her she had been raped by the accused on 31/08/2011 while she was returning home. Accused pushed her down and committed the offence. She says that she never consented for sex. Though there were three other persons including her relation she neither shouted nor tried to free herself. In her statement to police she had said that the accused told her to wait and went up to Fijian boys. You have to consider her evidence with great caution. 

20.     
As assessors and judges of facts, you heard the evidence of Emoni. He admitted that he told police that victim had told him that accused wanted to have sex with her and he ran away from the scene when another boy came and requested for sex. Further he said that victim never told that the accused forced her to have sex with him. Finally he said that victim's main complaint was that a boy wanted to have sex with her. In the re-examination witness said victim complained that while she was having sex with the accused another boy was standing behind them. You have to consider this evidence very carefully.

21.     
Dr. Kitiana not noted the size of the injury in her Medical Report. But she noted the same in her personal notes. Prosecution did not take any endeavour to mark those notes. According her a mild injury found in the cervix of the victim. 

22.     
The Caution Interview Statement of the accused was not challenged. Accused in his caution interview statement admitted that he had sex with the victim with consent.

23.     
Madam and gentlemen of assessors, in this case accused elected to give evidence from witness box. That is his right. In his evidence he denied the charge. According to him the victim consented for sex. She was very happy at that time. His evidence was corroborated by defence witness Niko. 

24.     
I have summarized all the evidence before you. But, still I might have missed some. That is not because they are unimportant. You heard every items of evidence and you should remind yourself of all that evidence and form your opinion on facts. What I did was only to draw your attention to the salient items of evidence and help you in reminding yourself of the evidence. 

25.     
In this case the accused is charged for rape contrary to sections 207(1)(2)(a) 0f the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009. I have already explained to you about the charges and its ingredients. 

26.     
 Madam and gentleman of assessors, in this case state has to prove lack of consent before you can find the accused guilty of rape. If you find there was consent and that he is thereof not guilty of rape. 

27.     
You have heard all the prosecution witnesses. You have observed them giving evidence in the court. You have observed their demeanour in the court. Considering my direction on the law, your life experiences and common sense, you should be able to decide which witness's evidence, or part of his evidence you consider reliable, and therefore to accept, and which witness's evidence, you consider unreliable and therefore to reject. Use the tests mentioned above to assess the evidence of witnesses.

28.     
You must also carefully consider the accused's position as stated above. Please remember, even if you reject the version of the accused that does not mean that the prosecution had established the case against the accused. You must be satisfied that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused.

29.     
 Madam and gentleman of assessors, remember, it is for the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is not for the accused to prove his innocence. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and that burden stays with them throughout the trial.

30.     
Once again, I remind, that your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence, apply the law to those facts and come to a correct finding. Do not get carried away by emotions.

31.     
This is all I have to say to you. You may now retire to deliberate. The clerks will advise me when you have reached your individual decisions, and we will reconvene the court. 

32.     
Any re-direction?
