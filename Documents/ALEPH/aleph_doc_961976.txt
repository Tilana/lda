(1) Funds flow from operations is not a recognized measure under GAAP. Management believes that in
addition to net earnings, funds flow from operations is a useful supplemental measure as it demonstrates
the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future growth through capital investment.
Investors are cautioned, however, that this measure should not be construed as an indication of the
Company’s  performance.  The  Company’s  method  of  calculating  this  measure  may  differ  from  other
issuers and accordingly, it may not be comparable to that used by other issuers. For these purposes, the
Company defines funds flow from operations as funds provided by operations before changes in non-cash
operating working capital items.
(2) BOE’s are calculated using a conversion ratio of 6 MCF to 1 barrel of oil. The conversion is based on an
energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a
value equivalency at the wellhead and as such may be misleading if used in isolation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
The following report dated August 4, 2006 is a review of the operations, current financial position and
outlook for the Company and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements for
the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2006,  including  the  notes  related  thereto,  and  the  audited  financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, together with the notes related thereto.
General Discussion
The Company is pleased to report its financial and operations results for the first half of 2006.
At June 30, 2006 the Company had working capital of $8,942,000 ($13,902,000 if adjusted for
the fair market value of its investments) and along with the Company’s funds flow is adequately
financed to complete exploration projects that are budgeted at approximately $9,100,000 for
2006. At June 30, 2006, capital expenditures of $4,891,000 have been made for 2006, mainly
on the Meliadine property in Nunavut Territory and Caballo Blanco, Mexico.
Meliadine West
The initial $6 million exploration program planned for this year on Meliadine West as been
increased  to  $6.5  million  so  that  the  drill  meterage  can  be  increased  to  17,500  meters  from
15,000 meters. The 17,500 meter drill program commenced in March 2006 and is expected to
conclude in September. The program is designed mainly to:
• Infill drill the Tiriganiaq deposit to upgrade resources from inferred to indicated status
and to expand existing zones.
• To conduct initial drilling of two large surface geochemical targets (Aklak and Aqpik)
on the far eastern end of the property.
• To conduct prospecting, mapping, and geophysical programs on reconnaissance targets.
• To  continue  the  program  of  engineering  work  to  determine  and  compile  necessary
material information to complete a scoping study.
Up to 4 drill rigs have been active on the property with at least two rigs continuously drilling
on  the  Tiriganiaq  deposit.  The  drilling  operations  have  been  more  challenging  this  year
compared to previous years, due mainly to the critical shortage of experienced drillers. To date,
a total of 12,350 meters in 45 holes has been completed, which is approximately 70% of the
proposed program. Assay results have been received for 60% of the Tiriganiaq holes and 67% of
the reconnaissance drill holes and the Company is very pleased with the assay results on an
overall basis. These results have been released in press releases dated June 26, 2006 and August
2, 2006. Highlights from the drilling to date include:
• 26.1 gmt gold over 2.3 meters in hole M06-574
• 22.7 gmt gold over 2.6 meters in hole M06-576

• 10.1 gmt gold over 3.8 meters in hole M06-583
• 20.5 gmt gold over 16.7 meters in hole M06-583
including: 26.8 gmt gold over 7.4 meters
and:
26.7 gmt gold over 4.5 meter
• 12.9 gmt gold over 3.9 meters in hole M06-585
• 13.0 gmt gold over 11.6 meters in hole M06-585
including:  16.7 gmt over 8.4 meters
• 31.5 gmt gold over 5.65 meters in hold M06-588
• 15.7 gmt gold over 7.03 meters in hole M05-591
including:  19.1 gmt gold over 4.93 meters
• 40.2 gmt gold over 4.9 meters in hole M06-594
including: 106.0 gmt gold over 1.8 meters
Initial drilling of targets in the Aqpik and Aklak zones has been completed. Results  from the
Aqpik zone were released on August 2, 2006. Of the initial 8 holes completed in the Aqpik area,
two returned significant intersections of 8.6 gmt gold over 3.2 meters in hole CWM06-02 and
9.6 gmt gold over 3.2 meters in hole CWM06-06. Drill results from the four holes completed in
the Aklak zone have not yet been received from the lab.
Surface  prospecting  and  geophysical  programs  are  continuing  at  various  locations  on  the
property  for  gold,  but  also  for  diamonds  on  the  eastern  end  of  the  claim  block.  Diamond
indicator till sampling is taking place on the eastern end of the CWM claim block, directly up-
ice of the recent bedrock discovery of diamond bearing kimberlite by Shear Minerals.
Comaplex has a 78 percent interest in the program with an option to increase to 80 percent.
Mr.  Doug  Dumka,  P.Geo.  is  the  Chief  Geologist  for  Comaplex  and  is  the  Senior  Project
Geologist and designated Q.P. for the Meliadine West Project.
Caballo Blanco
Drilling commenced on the Caballo Blanco property in eastern Mexico in March of 2006 and
continued until mid June. Two drill holes (CB06-01 and CB06-02) tested the south-west and
south-east ridges of the Cerro La Cruz zone, while a third drill hole (CB06-03) was collared
approximately 100 meters north of the initial two holes on the summit ridge of the Cerro La
Cruz  target  and  angled  towards  the  highly  anomalous  gold  mineralization  in  last  year’s  hole
CB05-03 (2.6 gmt gold over 32 meters).

A total of 743.8 meters in three drill holes have been completed in 2006. Drilling continues to
be slow and tedious due to the extremely hard and broken ground. Drill breakdowns during the
drilling of DDH06-03 did not allow completion of the hole. Attempts were made to rectify the
issue prior to the commencement of the rainy season, but this was not possible.
Detailed  sampling  and  mapping  of  the  entire  Cerro  La  Cruz  zone  has  now  been  completed.
Surface geochemical samples of outcrop on the summit returned up to 6.07 gmt gold. Surface
and collar information from this work is summarized in the figures in the July 18, 2006 press
release.  This  prospect  is  presently  being  analyzed  to  determine  the  potential  size  of  the
anomaly(s) and to assess what types of programs may be required in the future.
In  June  2006,  Comaplex  completed  the  earn-in  requirements  of  the  option  with  Almaden
Minerals Ltd. and Comaplex now holds an undivided 60% interest in the property, subject to
payment of its share of a final option payment to an underlying vendor.
Mark Balog, P.Geol. is the Vice President - Exploration for Comaplex and is the designated 
Q.P. for the Caballo Blanco Project.
Other Mineral Property Activities
Surface exploration work on the Company’s grassroots gold and industrial mineral (soapstone -
dimension stone) properties in Newfoundland will take place in the last half of the summer and
into the fall.
Ongoing research, land acquisition, and third party property option agreements will continue as
the Company attempts to add quality projects to its portfolio.

Comaplex Mineral Corp Interim Report Q2 2006
CMF Interim_q2  8/9/06  1:09 PM  Page 5
Financial and Operational Discussion
The first half of 2006 revenues from mineral operations increased by $310,000 to $608,000
from the 2005 six month results as Comaplex disposed of share investments during the second
quarter resulting in a gain on sale of $440,000 compared to a gain of $136,000 in the second
quarter of 2005. In addition, Comaplex received a mineral production royalty of $33,000 from
its Quebec mineral property in 2006.
Net revenue for the oil and gas division increased to $1,917,000 in the first half of 2006 from
$1,686,000 in the first half of 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased production
volumes and distribution income from investments offset partially by a reduction of $210,000 in
gain on sale of investments.  Net revenue for the second quarter of 2006 decreased from the first
quarter of 2006 by approximately $19,000 due to decreased commodity prices offset partially by
increased distribution income from investments.
Natural  gas  liquids  and  natural  gas  production  during  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2006,
averaged 325 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Total production consisted of 50 barrels
per  day  of  liquids  and  1,652  MCF  per  day  of  natural  gas.  Average  production  during  the
corresponding 2006 six month period was 48 barrels per day of liquids and 1,001 MCF per day
of natural gas. The increase is predominantly due to a change in the reporting of ethane sales at
the  Garrington  Elkton  plant.  Effective  January  1,  2006,  the  operator  of  the  plant  has  been
providing us with ethane sales volumes. In the past only ethane revenues were reported and
pricing and ethane volumes were not provided. As such the revenues were recorded as part of
natural gas sales with only nominal ethane volumes being recorded. This change resulted in
approximately 500 MCF per day of additional ethane volumes (year over year) being reported
(included  in  natural  gas  volumes).  In  addition,  increased  production  from  the  Company’s
Granta Makepeace property resulted in a further 70 MCF per day of production in the first six
months of 2006 compared to the prior years comparable period.
Second quarter 2006 saw an increase of 34 BOE’s per day over first quarter 2006 production
primarily  due  to  increased  Granta  Makepeace  production  resulting  from  increased  field
compression equipment installed during 2006.
Natural gas prices decreased to an average of $5.25 per MCF ($4.36 per MCF in the second
quarter)  in  the  first  half  of  2006  compared  to  $6.69  per  MCF  in  the  first  half  of  2005.  As
discussed above, the reporting of correct ethane volumes has resulted in more volumes but no
adjustment to revenues (as these were previously reported). The impact is approximately a 20
percent reduction in price per MCF in 2006 from previous periods. Liquid prices increased in
the first six months of 2006 to $62.81 per barrel ($64.75 per barrel in the second quarter) from
$50.97 in the corresponding 2005 period and from $60.96 received in the first quarter of 2006.

CMF Interim_q2  8/9/06  1:09 PM  Page 6
Natural  gas  and  natural  gas  liquids  production  costs  for  the  first  six  months  of  2006  were
$243,000 ($3.93 per BOE) compared to $294,000 ($7.57 per BOE) for the first six months of
2005. The decrease in 2006 over the first six months of 2005 was due mainly to increased third
party plant processing fee recoveries in 2006. Production costs for the second quarter 2006 over
first  quarter  2006  saw  a  decline  of  $57,000  due  to  the  payment  of  mineral  taxes  in  the  first
quarter of 2006. The BOE per day figures are correspondingly affected by the ethane volume
change. The impact is approximately a 17 percent reduction in costs per BOE in 2006 over
previous periods.
The Company reported a gain on sale of investments of $210,000 in the first quarter of 2005
and did not sell any oil and gas investments in 2006.
General and administrative costs for mineral operations increased to $534,000 in the first six
months  of  2006  compared  to  $376,000  in  the  corresponding  2005  period.  The  increase  was
primarily due to increased employee compensation expenses, an increase of $2,500 per month
in the management fee (see below) and miscellaneous expenses related to field operations that
were not capitalized. General and administrative expenses were marginally higher in the second
quarter 2006 than the first quarter of 2006 due to additional compensation expense.
The  Company  paid  a  management  fee  to  Comstate  Resources  Ltd.  (Comstate)  of  $150,000
(2005 - $120,000). Services provided by Comstate include executive services (CEO and CFO
duties),  accounting  services,  oil  and  gas  administration  and  office  administration.  Comstate
owns 689,682 (December 31, 2005 - 689,682) shares in the Company.
Stock based compensation declined to $61,000 in the first six months of 2006 from $86,000 for
the  first  six  months  of  2005.  The  decline  was  due  primarily  to  recording  higher  stock  based
compensation in the first years following the issuance of stock options as required by Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles.
Depletion, depreciation and accretion expense (“DD&A”) increased to $391,000 for the first six
months of 2006 compared to $291,000 for the first six months of 2005. The increase was due
primarily to a 2006 provision of $55,000 relating to a Quebec mineral property. Second quarter
2006  DD&A  costs  over  first  quarter  2006  DD&A  costs  saw  an  increase  of  $35,000  due  to
increased depletion of the Company’s oil and gas properties resulting from higher production rates.
The  Company  reviews  the  carrying  value  of  its  mineral  properties  on  an  ongoing  basis  and
reduces the cost of properties if it is determined that the property values are lower than the
property cost. No amounts were written off in 2006 or the first half of 2005.
Comaplex has no current income tax expense.  Comaplex has sufficient tax pools to ensure that
no current income taxes are payable.

The ability to claim the above successored amounts is restricted to income from 56 percent of
the Meliadine property.  In addition to the above federal and provincial income tax pools, the
Company has approximately $1,025,000 of attributable crown royalty deduction available to
apply against Alberta taxable income.
Net  earnings  for  the  first  six  months  of  2006  were  $820,000  compared  to  $595,000  in  the
corresponding  2005  period.    The  increase  over  the  2005  first  half  is  predominantly  due  to
increased gain on sale of investments and increased natural gas production volumes, partially
offset  by  increased  general  and  administrative  costs.    Second  quarter  2006  net  earnings
increased $426,000 over the first quarter 2006 amount due primarily to the $440,000 gain on
sale of investments.
Funds  flow  from  operations  increased  in  the  first  six  months  of  2006  to  $1,232,000  from
$902,000 for the 2005 comparable period.  The increase was due primarily to increased oil and
gas revenue.  Quarter over quarter saw a marginal increase of $18,000.
