<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/21, the Human Rights Council decided to appoint a Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights. The Special Rapporteur was appointed at the 28th session of the Council and 
</p>
<p>took office in May 2015.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the first Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights, Idriss Jazairy, pursuant to the aforementioned resolution. In it, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur lists the activities he undertook from 1 May to 30 July 2015 and provides his 
</p>
<p>preliminary considerations concerning the foundations and context of the mandate. He also 
</p>
<p>presents some preliminary observations, the implementation strategy for the mandate and 
</p>
<p>some projected activities.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>3. The activities of the Special Rapporteur are carried out in accordance with Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 27/21.  
</p>
<p>4. Since his appointment in March 2015, the Special Rapporteur has requested 
</p>
<p>invitations to visit Cuba, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and the United States of America. He 
</p>
<p>has been invited to visit the Sudan. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan for the invitation and has confirmed the visit for November 2015.  
</p>
<p>5. From 1 May to 30 July 2015, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to all Member 
</p>
<p>States and relevant stakeholders, including civil society, requesting information to capture 
</p>
<p>the present situation on unilateral coercive measures. He has also reached out to all special 
</p>
<p>procedures and treaty bodies with a similar communication. The Special Rapporteur in 
</p>
<p>addition requested that the human rights mechanisms provide information on the respective 
</p>
<p>work of the mechanism on issues concerning unilateral coercive measures. 
</p>
<p>6. From 8 to 12 June 2015, the Special rapporteur participated in the 22nd meeting of 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders, held in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>7. Since his appointment, the Special Rapporteur has also met with representatives of 
</p>
<p>Iran (Islamic Republic of), the Russian Federation, the Sudan, the United States and the 
</p>
<p>European Union. He has also held informal consultations with academia working on 
</p>
<p>Security Council sanctions and on unilateral coercive measures. 
</p>
<p>8. On 6 July 2015, the Special Rapporteur issued a press release welcoming the re-
</p>
<p>establishment of formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and 
</p>
<p>calling for the embargo to be lifted. 
</p>
<p>9. On 14 July 2015, the Special Rapporteur issued a press release welcoming the 
</p>
<p>nuclear agreement reached between Iran (Islamic Republic of) and the five plus one group 
</p>
<p>of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
</p>
<p>and Northern Ireland and the United States, and calling for the immediate lifting of 
</p>
<p>sanctions. </p>


<p><b> III. Reasons for a special procedure on the adverse human rights 
impact of unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p>10. In its Article 55(c), the Charter of the United Nations calls upon the United Nations 
</p>
<p>to promote &#8220;universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms&#8221;. Likewise, the Vienna Declaration asserted the following that &#8220;the universal 
</p>
<p>nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question&#8221;. Furthermore, In its resolution 
</p>
<p>60/251, the General Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should &#8220;be 
</p>
<p>responsible for promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal 
</p>
<p>manner&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. Emphasis here is on &#8220;universal&#8221;: the thrust of the provisions of human rights treaties 
</p>
<p>and covenants relate mainly to national jurisdictions of States, although some general 
</p>
<p>comments of treaty bodies, such as general comments No. 8, No. 12 or No. 14 of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights do refer to extraterritorial &#8220;sanctions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>From the point of view of the victims of violations of human rights on the ground, 
</p>
<p>addressing only the adverse human rights impact of domestic measures would leave a 
</p>
<p>protection gap that falls short of the desired universality of human rights. It also stands to 
</p>
<p>reason that the International Bill of Human Rights, which condemns violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights by authorities in the territories under their jurisdiction, would also condemn such 
</p>
<p>violations if perpetrated by the same authorities outside their own borders. The protection 
</p>
<p>gap became painfully obvious during the 1990s, which has been referred to as the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;sanctions decade&#8221;.1 At that time, the population of States targeted by external &#8220;sanctions&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>such as Iraq, and in particular women and newborn children, suffered most acutely from 
</p>
<p>comprehensive &#8220;sanctions&#8221;, which lead to the unwarranted death of many innocent people. 
</p>
<p>The special procedure, as a Charter-based human rights mechanism, is not constrained by 
</p>
<p>national jurisdictions and can thus address this protection gap. The comparative advantage 
</p>
<p>of a Charter-based body over a treaty body to address this extraterritorial dimension of 
</p>
<p>measures having an impact on human rights, was aptly underlined by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council Advisory Committee in a report dated 10 February 2015.2  
</p>
<p>12. Addressing possible violations of human rights from both national and foreign 
</p>
<p>sources is indeed acting to promote universal respect for the promotion of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, as the Human Rights Council was mandated to do by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly in its resolution 60/251. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Clarifying definitions concerning unilateral coercive 
measures 
</b></p>
<p>13. From Human Rights Council resolution 27/21, one can infer that unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures are measures including, but not limited to, economic and political ones, imposed 
</p>
<p>by States or groups of States to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the 
</p>
<p>subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights with a view to securing some specific 
</p>
<p>change in its policy. 
</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>the 1990s</i> (Boulder, Colorado, Lynne Rienner, 2000). 
</p>
<p> 2 Research-based progress report of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee containing 
</p>
<p>recommendations on mechanisms to assess the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights and to promote accountability (A/HRC/28/74). See in particular para. 60. </p>


<p>14. The Special Rapporteur will consider as unilateral coercive measures, measures 
</p>
<p>other than those taken by the Security Council under article 41 of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations. Only the latter are truly multilateral from the point of view of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>under whose aegis the present report is being elaborated. There is a presumption that, once 
</p>
<p>the Security Council has decided on sanctions, and without prejudice to the exercise of the 
</p>
<p>right to self-defence referred to in article 51 of the Charter, Member States have to comply 
</p>
<p>with its decisions without adding to or retrenching from their content, pursuant to articles 
</p>
<p>25, 48(2) and 103 of the Charter. However, this is not always the case. 
</p>
<p>15. Coercive measures imposed by international financial institutions and regional 
</p>
<p>bodies on their own members or on candidates to membership are not usually considered as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;unilateral&#8221; as they are part of a package of rights and obligations whose prior acceptance 
</p>
<p>by target countries are conditions for membership. Take, for instance, a duty-free zone 
</p>
<p>established between an economic grouping and a partner State. The decision by the former 
</p>
<p>to withhold free-entry status to products originating in land not part of the territory of the 
</p>
<p>partner State according to international law is not a unilateral coercive measure because it is 
</p>
<p>part of an international agreement that carries with it a territorial definition known to co-
</p>
<p>signatories.3 However, the use of international financial institutions by one or several 
</p>
<p>member States through their weighted voting rights as a conduit for their national policies 
</p>
<p>on unilateral coercive measures should be part of the remit of the present mandate.4 Finally, 
</p>
<p>coercive measures from regional groupings of countries or from one of their Member States 
</p>
<p>targeting third countries are considered as unilateral in the sense that they are imposed 
</p>
<p>pursuant to rules at no time endorsed by the targeted country.  
</p>
<p>16. Unilateral coercive measures can be comprehensive or targeted. The latter are also 
</p>
<p>referred to as &#8220;smart&#8221; measures.5 They owe this epithet to the claim that they minimize 
</p>
<p>collateral damage in terms in particular of avoiding to jeopardize the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights by the poorest and most vulnerable groups in the society of the targeted country. The 
</p>
<p>former are measures aimed at the whole economy or financial system of a country. They 
</p>
<p>tend to be indiscriminate and therefore to have adverse human rights impacts on the poorest 
</p>
<p>and most vulnerable segments of the society of the targeted country. Their effectiveness is 
</p>
<p>gauged in the light of their capacity to impose broad-based policy changes or to create 
</p>
<p>sufficient economic distress in the targeted country to incite the people to rise against their 
</p>
<p>political leadership. &#8220;Smart&#8221; coercive measures, for their part, may be aimed at certain 
</p>
<p>sectors of the economic activity of a country or be broader but specific to a circumscribed 
</p>
<p>expanse of territory. Their impact may be to destabilize a particular branch of production or 
</p>
<p>a particular geographic area. The right to work and to a decent standard of living of people 
</p>
<p>deriving their income from the sector or the region may be compromised. However, the 
</p>
<p>adverse impact on human rights in both cases is likely, in theory, to be more limited than in 
</p>
<p>the case of comprehensive coercive measures targeting a whole country.6 In practice, it may

<p>and vote against: (a) any extension by the respective institution of any loan, credit or guarantee to the 
</p>

</p>
<p>Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any international financial institution.

<p>be difficult to distinguish between some &#8220;smart&#8221; unilateral coercive measures and 
</p>
<p>comprehensive ones, as will be exemplified hereunder.  
</p>
<p>17. Whether comprehensive or &#8220;smart&#8221;, unilateral coercive measures are hard to 
</p>
<p>reconcile with the Declaration on the Right to Development and in particular with its article 
</p>
<p>3, which stipulates that &#8220;States have the duty to cooperate with each other in ensuring 
</p>
<p>development and eliminating obstacles to development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. In summary, any unilateral coercive measure imposed on a country necessarily runs 
</p>
<p>counter to some provisions of the International Bill of Human Rights or peremptory norms 
</p>
<p>and other provisions of customary law. Such measures entail, to different degrees, adverse 
</p>
<p>consequences on the enjoyment of the human rights of innocent people. There is a very 
</p>
<p>wide range of human rights that might be involved, including political, economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights. The focus of impact assessment should remain on the rights to life, 
</p>
<p>health and medical care, an adequate standard of living, food, education, work, housing and 
</p>
<p>development. The justification provided for unilateral coercive measures is the claim that 
</p>
<p>they aim at the improvement of the human rights situation overall in the targeted country. 
</p>
<p>Thus, it is said that the cost in human rights terms of the coercive measure is justified by the 
</p>
<p>greater human rights benefits expected to accrue from such measures. It remains to be seen 
</p>
<p>whether human rights lend themselves to this kind of calculus.  
</p>
<p>19. A variety of expressions are being used to refer to unilateral coercive measures. 
</p>
<p>Some refer to them as &#8220;sanctions&#8221;, others as &#8220;restrictive measures&#8221; and others still use them 
</p>
<p>interchangeably or jointly as, say, &#8220;restrictive measures (sanctions)&#8221;. The term &#8220;restrictive 
</p>
<p>measure&#8221; does not carry the same ethical overtones of punishment as &#8220;sanctions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>However, it eschews the mention of &#8220;unilateral&#8221;, which itself raises the issue of legitimacy 
</p>
<p>of such measures since what is unilateral can, in given circumstances, lack legitimacy. The 
</p>
<p>term &#8220;unilateral coercive measures&#8221;, though more cumbersome, has the advantage of not 
</p>
<p>prejudging any of the aforementioned, rather controversial, issues. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur will use the expression &#8220;source countries&#8221; when referring to 
</p>
<p>countries initiating and applying unilateral coercive measures and the expression &#8220;target 
</p>
<p>countries&#8221; to mean countries that have been targeted by unilateral coercive measures, 
</p>
<p>whether the latter themselves are comprehensive or targeted at a particular sector, area or at 
</p>
<p>specific persons. 
</p>
<p>21. It may be said that the &#8220;sanctioning&#8221; authority, in order to be legitimate, should have 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction over the &#8220;sanctioned&#8221; State. It might have to be mandated by the international 
</p>
<p>community to uphold international standards and coerce &#8220;deviant&#8221; States into conforming 
</p>
<p>to an international agreement or to internationally accepted norms of conduct. It might 
</p>
<p>even, in certain circumstances, be entitled to do so of its own accord. Usually the Security 
</p>
<p>Council has the central authority in this regard. Yet Article 41 of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations refers to coercive measures taken by the Council simply as &#8220;measures&#8221; rather than 
</p>
<p>&#8220;sanctions&#8221;. To suggest that States can impose &#8220;sanctions&#8221; on other States while the 
</p>
<p>Security Council itself only imposes &#8220;measures&#8221; that truly deserve to be called &#8220;multilateral 
</p>
<p>sanctions&#8221;, and which will be referred to as such by the present mandate, implies that 
</p>
<p>decisions of States that impose unilateral coercive measures have at least the same legal 
</p>
<p>cogency as those of the Security Council. It also implies that there is a hierarchy among 
</p>
<p>States, between the &#8220;sanctioning&#8221; and the &#8220;sanctioned&#8221;. This runs counter to the spirit of 
</p>
<p>the Charter and in particular to Article 2(1), which refers to the sovereign equality of all the 
</p>
<p>States Members of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>22. Unilateral coercive measures are said to be &#8220;extraterritorial&#8221; because they are 
</p>
<p>initiated by a country or group of countries and imposed outside their national territory or 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. The laws imposing them may have extraterritorial effect not only on targeted 
</p>
<p>countries but also on third countries in a manner that will coerce the latter to also apply the </p>


<p>unilateral coercive measures on the targeted country, non-compliance leading to heavy 
</p>
<p>unilateral penalties.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Historical retrospect 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Early uses of unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p>23. There has been a spectacular increase in the resort to unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>since the 1990s. However this form of pressure, which has a particularly negative impact on 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of human rights when imposed by stronger States or groups of States against 
</p>
<p>weaker ones, is not new. There are records that indicate that already in Ancient Greece in 
</p>
<p>492 BC, the city-State of Aegina seized Athenian ships and held their passengers hostage as 
</p>
<p>a response to Athens holding Aeginians captive.7  
</p>
<p>24. In the Middle Ages, during the Crusades, religious leaders and church councils in 
</p>
<p>Europe practiced unilateral coercive measures by prohibiting the export of ships, weapons 
</p>
<p>and ammunitions to the Saracens, as Arabs or Muslims were referred to in those days.8 This 
</p>
<p>became official Holy See policy from the Council of Lateran in 1179 until it was 
</p>
<p>denounced, four centuries later, by Martin Luther.9 It is interesting to note that, already in 
</p>
<p>those days, the claim to oblige traders from third parties to apply one&#8217;s own embargo on a 
</p>
<p>target country was invoked. Thus a historian from that period, Peter the Chanter, reports the 
</p>
<p>case of the citizens of Marseilles opposing foreign traders moored in their port and intent on 
</p>
<p>shipping timber and weapons to Alexandria. They called on three bishops to intervene. The 
</p>
<p>latter obliged by excommunicating the traders who, unperturbed, sailed out of the port. The 
</p>
<p>historian reports that they had hardly covered a mile at sea when the ship sank with its crew 
</p>
<p>and cargo.10  
</p>
<p>25. A more recent case in point is the blockade of Germany after the cessation of World 
</p>
<p>War I in order to coerce that country to stand down from its opposition to certain leonine 
</p>
<p>clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. The unilateral coercive measure applied against 
</p>
<p>Germany visited untold sufferings on the German population, whose basic rights were 
</p>
<p>ignored.11 In fact, the founding fathers of the League of Nations considered coercive 
</p>
<p>measures as the backbone of its policies for the maintenance of peace. That was already a 
</p>
<p>progress on the past, when such measures and in particular blockades were a prelude to war 
</p>
<p>or part of the stratagems of war itself. 
</p>
<p>26. One could also mention the unilateral coercive measures applied at the initiative of 
</p>
<p>Western countries against the Soviet Union in 1949 &#8212; the Coordinating Committee for 
</p>
<p>Multilateral Export Controls &#8212; and China in 1951 &#8212; the China Committee &#8212; and the

<p>population was relatively limited because the measures were circumvented by the source 
</p>
<p>countries themselves. 
</p>
<p>27. Except for the cases of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa under apartheid, most 
</p>
<p>recent unilateral coercive measures before1975 were implemented in the context of the 
</p>
<p>East-West ideological rivalry. Then came the Final Act of the Conference on Security and 
</p>
<p>Cooperation in Europe, which, in its principle VI, expressed the resolve of the signatories to 
</p>
<p>put an end to autonomous policies of coercive measures. According to that principle, the 
</p>
<p>parties to the Treaty &#8220;will likewise in all circumstances refrain from any other act of &#8230; 
</p>
<p>economic or other coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by 
</p>
<p>another participating State of the rights inherent to sovereignty&#8221;. Experience thereafter did 
</p>
<p>not live up to expectations as unilateral coercive measures were redeployed in the direction 
</p>
<p>of developing countries and then escalated again inter alia between the West and the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation as a result of tension on Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>28. Most current unilateral coercive measures have been imposed at great cost, in terms 
</p>
<p>of the human rights of the poorest and most vulnerable groups, by developed countries on 
</p>
<p>developing countries. There are a few examples of the reverse situation, such as the Arab 
</p>
<p>oil embargo of 1973 against Western States in response to the position the latter took during 
</p>
<p>the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. There are also cases of developing countries imposing unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures on neighbouring States for short periods of time. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Current trends 
</b></p>
<p>29. Observed trends do not point to advanced countries giving up the resort to unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures, much to the contrary. This is not to say, however, that the situation has 
</p>
<p>remained static. The Security Council has given up resorting to comprehensive sanctions 
</p>
<p>since 1994, when it last imposed them on Haiti. Following this example, source countries 
</p>
<p>have generally been moving away from comprehensive sanctions to resort rather to &#8220;smart&#8221; 
</p>
<p>sanctions. These are focused on a particular territory within a target country, on a specific 
</p>
<p>activity, for example, non-proliferation or on a particular category of traded goods, such as 
</p>
<p>the arms trade or the commodity trade. There is also increasing resort to &#8220;smart&#8221; sanctions 
</p>
<p>that target natural or corporate persons on the basis of their supposed involvement in policy 
</p>
<p>decisions of their State that are challenged by the country or group of countries initiating 
</p>
<p>the unilateral coercive measures. A corpus of legal rules has been devised to redress the 
</p>
<p>excesses of such measures and to submit their use to certain conditions while introducing 
</p>
<p>some measure of due process and independent assessment to gauge the impact of such 
</p>
<p>measures on human rights. This is a positive evolution. It tends to limit the collateral 
</p>
<p>damage of such measures on unintended groups and therefore deserves to be welcomed.  
</p>
<p>30. The evolution has not been homogeneous in source countries. There is therefore a 
</p>
<p>need to review the progress achieved in different source countries and to consider the 
</p>
<p>possibility of promoting the &#8220;best practices&#8221; of some such countries or groups thereof to the 
</p>
<p>benefit of others as a step toward the elaboration of &#8220;next practices&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>31. In reality, however, it is not always easy to translate good intentions in the capitals 
</p>
<p>of advanced countries into measures that safeguard human rights in the day-to-day life of 
</p>
<p>remote communities in the developing world. Thus, the introduction of financial coercive 
</p>
<p>measures such as a ban on the use of international interbank financial telecommunications 
</p>
<p>or a measure undermining the principle of immunity of a central bank&#8217;s assets can, because 
</p>
<p>of their indiscriminate character, be tantamount to the reintroduction of comprehensive 
</p>
<p>sanctions. Likewise, the superimposition of targeted unilateral coercive measures on </p>


<p>Security Council sanctions may distort the purpose of the latter, putting their initial balance 
</p>
<p>out of kilter. The result may be to transform what was intended to be a &#8220;smart&#8221; coercive 
</p>
<p>sanction into a comprehensive coercive measure. In the same way, when a number of 
</p>
<p>diverse &#8220;smart&#8221; unilateral coercive measures converge on the same country, their 
</p>
<p>summation may become a comprehensive coercive measure. Nor does this 
</p>
<p>comprehensiveness, which carries a particularly high cost in terms of adverse human rights 
</p>
<p>impact, necessarily increase the efficiency of the measures. Two cases in point are the 
</p>
<p>coercive measures imposed on Cuba and Iran (Islamic Republic of). It is fortunate that, 
</p>
<p>under the recent initiative of the President of the United States, targeted measures that, 
</p>
<p>when added up become comprehensive coercive measures, are now being called into 
</p>
<p>question. The point is illustrated by the United States Secretary of State, who referred to the 
</p>
<p>transition in relations between the United States and Cuba as taking place because the 
</p>
<p>President &#8220;made a personal, fundamental decision to change a policy that didn&#8217;t work and 
</p>
<p>that had been in place not working for far too long&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p>32. More generally, gaps still occur between the safeguards surrounding policy on 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures and the real-life adverse human rights impacts of such 
</p>
<p>measures. These gaps need to be investigated, identified and overcome. 
</p>
<p>33. Progress achieved by source countries in fine-tuning policies on unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures has resulted, inter alia, in the European Union giving up resort to autonomous 
</p>
<p>comprehensive sanctions. However, when targeting a vital sector such as oil and petroleum 
</p>
<p>product exports, such &#8220;targeted&#8221; measures come to affect, at least indirectly, the whole 
</p>
<p>economy or financial system of a country. There is now also greater recognition that, 
</p>
<p>contrary to past practice, the purpose of unilateral coercive measures should not be to 
</p>
<p>advance the economic interests of source countries. Their proclaimed objective is of late 
</p>
<p>becoming &#8220;the upholding of international law, human rights law and humanitarian law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Negative human rights impacts: how to eliminate or mitigate 
them and to provide redress for their victims and guidance 
from international law, human rights law  
and humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Elimination of unilateral coercive measures or restrictions to their use 
</b></p>
<p>34. The most obvious answer to the first question is to renounce unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures as a tool of foreign policy in recognition of the overarching principle of self-
</p>
<p>determination proclaimed in articles 1 of both the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It 
</p>
<p>is also a recognized principle of customary international law that even economic measures 
</p>
<p>not otherwise prohibited become unlawful if they coerce a State to take action in an area in 
</p>
<p>which it has the right to decide freely. The Vienna Declaration itself, in its part I, paragraph 
</p>
<p>31, called upon all States &#8220;to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international law and the Charter of the United Nations that create obstacles to trade 
</p>
<p>relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights instruments in 
</p>
<p>particular the right of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well-
</p>
<p>being including food and medical care, housing and the necessary social services&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Likewise, the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/244542.htm. </p>


<p>and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations13 as 
</p>
<p>well as article 32 of General Assembly resolution 3281 (XXIX) stipulate that no State may 
</p>
<p>use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
</p>
<p>another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
</p>
<p>right. This gives legitimacy to the position expressed by developing countries: they reject 
</p>
<p>the imposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of 
</p>
<p>coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions, against developing countries 
</p>
<p>and call for their elimination.14 
</p>
<p>35. The Vienna Declaration also calls on States to refrain from any unilateral measure 
</p>
<p>not in accordance with international law or the Charter of the United Nations. Seen from 
</p>
<p>the vantage point of source countries, the portent of the injunction revolves around the 
</p>
<p>determination of which coercive measures effectively run counter to these provisions and 
</p>
<p>which do not. The European Union Guidelines on Implementation and Evaluation of 
</p>
<p>Restrictive Measures stress that &#8220;the introduction and implementation of restrictive 
</p>
<p>measures must always be in accordance with international law. They must respect human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;.15 The guidelines mention that the decisions of the 
</p>
<p>Council if the European Union in the framework of the Common Foreign and Security 
</p>
<p>Policy in this respect are even subject to judicial review by the European Court of Justice.16 
</p>
<p>In the <i>Kadi</i> case,17 a decision by the European Council to include a person on a terrorist list 
</p>
<p>was overturned by the European Court of Justice, despite the fact that this was by way of an 
</p>
<p>implementation of a Security Council listing that was unappealable. The adjudication was 
</p>
<p>based on a recognition that, by the standards of peremptory norms and jus cogens, the 
</p>
<p>listing of the claimant violated his human rights and failed to comply with due process. 
</p>
<p>Judging from this audacious precedent, one can draw comfort as to the independent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to protect targets of unilateral coercive measures from their adverse impact on 
</p>
<p>human rights in the European Union context. Taking a series of recent cases where the 
</p>
<p>General Court of the European Union has annulled &#8220;restrictive measures&#8221; on human rights 
</p>
<p>grounds, it has been alleged, however, that immediately after annulment, the European 
</p>
<p>Union will often relist the targeted company within days for different reasons.18 By 
</p>
<p>contrast, in the United States, there exist limited possibilities for an individual or entity 
</p>
<p>subject to an asset freeze decided by the government office in charge of economic 
</p>
<p>sanctions, namely, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, to challenge such decision.19 Thus 
</p>
<p>far, there have been no reported judicial decisions in the United States reversing a 
</p>
<p>designation established by the Office.  </p>
<p><b> B. International legal framework, including human rights law  
</b></p>
<p><b>and international humanitarian law

<p>the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and 
</p>
<p>to provide accountability for the source countries and redress for victims. 
</p>
<p>37. There are, in legal terms and in the context of international law, differences between 
</p>
<p>the concepts of retorsion, retaliation and reprisals, even if the terminology is unsettled and 
</p>
<p>sometimes fluctuant.20 In summary, retorsion refers to applying pressure on a target 
</p>
<p>country, the latter being or not in breach of its international obligations, without the source 
</p>
<p>country itself suspending any international obligation owed to the target country.21 
</p>
<p>Retaliation refers to the <i>lex talionis</i>, which demands that a wrongdoer be inflicted with the 
</p>
<p>same injury as that which he has caused to another. It may thus be used to describe a 
</p>
<p>suspension by a source country, by way of a unilateral coercive measure, of its international 
</p>
<p>commitments selectively against the target country to an extent that is proportionate with 
</p>
<p>the wrongful act of the latter, thus staying within the alleged bounds of legitimacy. Finally, 
</p>
<p>the concept of reprisal, traditionally used to cover otherwise unlawful action, including 
</p>
<p>forcible action, taken by way of self-help in response to a breach, is now mostly used to 
</p>
<p>refer to action taken in time of international armed conflict. In that context, reprisals have 
</p>
<p>been defined as &#8220;coercive measures which would normally be contrary to international law 
</p>
<p>but which are taken in retaliation by one party to a conflict in order to stop the adversary 
</p>
<p>from violating international law&#8221;.22 unilateral coercive measures can be implemented as an 
</p>
<p>alternative, or as a prelude, to the use of force. They may be invoked for political motives 
</p>
<p>or for reasons pertaining to human rights. It is recognized that they are not legitimate if they 
</p>
<p>pursue an economic objective of the source country or group of countries. International law 
</p>
<p>will only consider such measures as legitimate if: (a) they are a response to a breach of the 
</p>
<p>international obligations of the target country; and (b) the breach of such obligations causes 
</p>
<p>injury on a State or group of States giving them the right to retorsion/retaliation. The notion 
</p>
<p>of extraterritorial source of injury giving rise to the right to retorsion/retaliation is clear for 
</p>
<p>political or commercial disputes, but less so for claims of violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>overseas. Be that as it may, the measures taken by the aggrieved State(s) might have been 
</p>
<p>qualified as wrongful had it not been for the fact that they are a proportionate response to a 
</p>
<p>breach of the international obligations by the target country. This legitimacy would also 
</p>
<p>depend on the source countries having given due notice to the target country to have to 
</p>
<p>comply with its international obligations. However, the legitimacy of retorsion/ retaliation 
</p>
<p>may be put in doubt if the negative human rights impact of the unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>undermines basic human rights or if the measures are pursued indefinitely without any 
</p>
<p>progress in achieving their proclaimed objective. Thus, human rights law mitigates the 
</p>
<p>rigors of international law.  
</p>
<p>38. It may be ultimately that the preferred option to legitimize unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures is to apply to them the legal regime of countermeasures in the sense of the 
</p>
<p>International Law Commission Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for 
</p>
<p>International Wrongful Acts,23 article 22 of which reads states that the wrongfulness of an 
</p>
<p>act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State, as 
</p>
<p>may be the case for unilateral coercive measures, &#8220;is precluded if and to the extent that the 
</p>
<p>act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State&#8221;. However there are 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20 See E.S. Colbert, Retaliation in International Law (New York, King&#700;s Crown Press, 1948), pp. 2 and 
</p>
<p>3, fn. 1. 
</p>
<p> 21 See &#8220;Commentaries on the Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful 
</p>
<p>Acts&#8221; (2001) <i>ILC Yearbook</i>, Vol. II, Part Two, p. 128. 
</p>
<p> 22 See S. Oeter, &#8220;Methods and Means of Combat&#8221;, <i>Handbook of International Humanitarian Law</i> 
</p>
<p>(Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 232, No. 476. See also S. Darcy, &#8220;Retaliation and 
</p>

<p>limitations to the exercise of countermeasures as set out in article 50 of the same text. 
</p>
<p>Countermeasures would thus be wrongful if they affected obligations for the protection of 
</p>
<p>fundamental human rights; obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; or 
</p>
<p>other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. 
</p>
<p>39. When applied by international organizational procedure outside that of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council or by regional organizations, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of 
</p>
<p>International Organizations24 become relevant. 
</p>
<p>40. While human rights law is often considered to be &#8220;soft law&#8221; as compared with 
</p>
<p>international law, general comment No. 31 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights asserts that every State party to the Covenant is &#8220;obligated to every other 
</p>
<p>State party to comply with its undertakings under the treaty&#8221; by considering that the 
</p>
<p>violation of Covenant rights by any State party requires others to call on violators to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;comply with their Covenant obligations&#8221;. In this case, human rights law is harsher on 
</p>
<p>violators of obligations of human rights treaties than international law in relation to other 
</p>
<p>treaty obligations, as it does not require the State(s) taking unilateral coercive measures to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate injury from breach by the target country of its obligations under the 
</p>
<p>International Bill of Human Rights.  By these standards, any State party may intervene &#8212;
</p>
<p> some would say interfere &#8212; to call a defaulting State to comply with its obligations, even 
</p>
<p>if the breach of a human rights provision by the latter causes no injury to the former. This 
</p>
<p>raises the question as to whether this general comment opens the way for legitimizing the 
</p>
<p>resort to unilateral coercive measures against States in breach of their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations. One might doubt it, since the general comment indicates that this call to 
</p>
<p>comply, &#8220;far from being regarded as an unfriendly act, [is] regarded as a reflection of 
</p>
<p>legitimate community interest&#8221;. Unilateral coercive measures are not friendly acts towards 
</p>
<p>target countries. They are punitive and are usually resorted to after a breakdown of 
</p>
<p>diplomatic negotiations. Were this to be a source of legitimacy for unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures, it would mean that any State could at any time take justice into its own hands and 
</p>
<p>react through such measures against perceived breaches of human rights by any other State. 
</p>
<p>It is precisely to avoid this resort of States to self-administered justice, which could easily 
</p>
<p>threaten world peace, that the Charter of the United Nations was adopted and that 
</p>
<p>centralized responsibilities in the field of the use of sanctions were devolved on the 
</p>
<p>Security Council. Article 53 (1) of the Charter stipulates that &#8220;no enforcement action shall 
</p>
<p>be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without authorization of the 
</p>
<p>Security Council&#8221;. The French version of Article 53 refers to &#8220;action coercitive&#8221;, which 
</p>
<p>might cover unilateral coercive measures, though it can be argued that this article refers to 
</p>
<p>resort to military force only. The issue of whether Article 53 precludes recourse to 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures without Security Council authorization is contentious. It is a 
</p>
<p>moot point deserving further investigation by jurists.25

<p>41. International humanitarian law makes it possible in wartime to lift export bans and 
</p>
<p>to provide safe channels to satisfy the basic human rights of the civilian population.26 The 
</p>
<p>Geneva Convention also bans collective reprisals.27 
</p>
<p>42. Source countries claim that medical equipment, medicines and other items necessary 
</p>
<p>to meet basic human rights are exempt from restrictive measures applied in peacetime. Yet 
</p>
<p>for a series of reasons, 85,000 cancer patients in a country targeted by unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures cannot find locally the required treatment through no fault of the country 
</p>
<p>concerned. Rights holders in target countries where the negative impact of such measures is 
</p>
<p>particularly acute could be considered as in a war zone and benefit from the protection of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, which has the advantage of being neutral while the context of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures is very heavily charged politically. Independent procurement agencies of 
</p>
<p>third countries could be involved in providing humanitarian supplies in peacetime for target 
</p>
<p>countries whose delivery, even though allowed by source countries, may be hampered 
</p>
<p>indirectly because of a payments freeze or ban on the use of international 
</p>
<p>telecommunications payment mechanisms. Likewise, unilateral coercive measures of the 
</p>
<p>kind that prevents access to life-saving drugs are comparable to collective reprisals and 
</p>
<p>would therefore be banned under humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Issues of remedies and redress 
</b></p>
<p>43. Finally, on the issue of redress for innocent victims of unilateral coercive measures, 
</p>
<p>the European Court of Justice has acted on several occasions to annul decisions regarding 
</p>
<p>such measures taken by the European Union. In very rare cases, it has acted to indemnify 
</p>
<p>symbolically individual victims. Since close to half of the States Members of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations have at one time or another been targeted by unilateral coercive measures in the 
</p>
<p>recent past, the most realistic form of redress would be an apology to innocent victims for 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; to their human rights entitlements which has occurred because of 
</p>
<p>those measures, together with a commitment to try harder, if not to end the measures, at 
</p>
<p>least to continue seeking ways to reduce the unintended adverse human rights impact they 
</p>
<p>have on the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>44. In view of the shortcomings of adjudicatory procedures at the national and regional 
</p>
<p>levels and of the real global challenges posed by unilateral coercive measures at the global 
</p>
<p>level, the issue of an independent mechanism of the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>machinery may at some stage have to be considered to promote accountability and 
</p>
<p>reparations.

<p>best, as has been the case for the participation of &#8220;source countries&#8221; invited by the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to the two workshops 
</p>
<p>on unilateral coercive measures held in 201328 and 201429 and for the written responses to 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General from the same States in preparation of the analytical report on this 
</p>
<p>theme, which he submits regularly to the General Assembly.30 The collection of 
</p>
<p>comprehensive data in this regard is an issue deserving further attention by the mandate-
</p>
<p>holder. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Study and evaluation of the practice of unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and its adverse impact on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>47. On the basis of the fragmentary information gathered, the Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>study the present trends, which all point to an increased resort to unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures despite the concern expressed by the United Nations about this trend. It bears 
</p>
<p>mentioning that concern was already expressed by the Commission on Human Rights in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 1995/45 of 3 March 1995 and regularly reiterated thereafter. The Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council itself adopted two decisions and seven resolutions31 expressing inter alia &#8220;deep 
</p>
<p>concern&#8221; at the fact that coercive measures continue to be promulgated. Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>trend was has been unaffected by the numerous resolutions and outcome documents 
</p>
<p>adopted by the General Assembly,32 the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
</p>
<p>Development33 and other major international conferences34 strongly urging States to refrain 
</p>
<p>from promulgating and applying unilateral coercive measures. The question arises as to 
</p>
<p>whether the multiplicity of United Nations resolutions adopted on such measures does not 
</p>
<p>signal an emerging customary law and evolving peremptory norms calling into question 
</p>
<p>present trends as they express themselves on the ground. 
</p>
<p>48. Notwithstanding the 16 targets of sanctions currently applied by the Security 
</p>
<p>Council,35 there are 37 targets for the European Union36 and 3237 for the United States, of 
</p>
<p>which several overlap with Security Council sanctions, the overwhelming majority of the 
</p>
<p>European Union and United States targets being the same countries. Of these targets, 7 
</p>
<p>concern terrorist entities and traffickers in drugs and blood diamonds, transnational 
</p>
<p>criminal organizations and cybercriminals, which would have been more effective if they 
</p>
<p>had all been concerted at the United Nations level. Many other countries apply unilateral

<p>coercive measures and it would be very helpful if they could provide to the mandate the 
</p>
<p>requisite information for future reports.  
</p>
<p>49. To these sanctions and unilateral coercive measures should be added the coercive 
</p>
<p>measures applied by regional organizations on their own members, as referred to in 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 above. The League of Arab States, the African Union, the Organization of 
</p>
<p>American States and other regional organizations have thus applied coercive measures on 
</p>
<p>several of their member States. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
</p>
<p>also has few such measures applied against the arms trade in relation with Nagorno-
</p>
<p>Karabakh38 and a list of Russian individuals targeted.39  
</p>
<p>50. Apart from criminal entities, the targets of sanctions are States, mostly developing 
</p>
<p>countries whose population has often been adversely affected thereby in the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>their human rights, and selected individuals within those States. These will constitute the 
</p>
<p>focus of the work of the Special Rapporteur in recognition of the fact that the few more 
</p>
<p>developed countries that are the target of unilateral coercive measures have broader options, 
</p>
<p>including through import substitution or through retaliation, to mitigate the adverse impact 
</p>
<p>of such measures on the enjoyment of human rights by their population.40 
</p>
<p>51. The aforementioned totals do not include unilateral coercive measures resorted to by 
</p>
<p>other individual countries whether or not members of the European Union, including those 
</p>
<p>harsh measures undermining the most basic rights of the Palestinian people. Taking those 
</p>
<p>additional individual measures into account, and even excluding criminal entities rightly 
</p>
<p>targeted, it is likely that there are currently over 75 targets of such measures, but the 
</p>
<p>number of countries targeted are of course less than half this number because western 
</p>
<p>source countries tend to have the same target countries in sight. However, in the absence of 
</p>
<p>centralized data, these figures are at best an estimate. Behind these quantitative data, there 
</p>
<p>are millions of people who are prevented from enjoying their basic human rights. One 
</p>
<p>needs to exclude from this count the drug dealers, terrorists or &#8220;kleptocrats&#8221; who have also 
</p>
<p>been targeted. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur will undertake a broad-based fact-finding approach towards 
</p>
<p>all stakeholders to establish pragmatically the extent of the adverse impact of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures, while trying to ascertain the nature of the human rights at jeopardy, 
</p>
<p>whether civil and political or the right to development or cultural or social rights. He will 
</p>
<p>then promote a United Nations-wide rule-based response that can prevent, minimize and 
</p>
<p>redress the adverse impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights.

<p>important task for the mandate. There is in this regard a difference in views among Member 
</p>
<p>States as to whether source countries should simply put &#8220;an immediate end to unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures&#8221;, which is the view of target countries and developing countries at large, 
</p>
<p>or whether such measures should remain a key component of foreign policy that at best 
</p>
<p>requires a small adjustment to mitigate their adverse human rights impacts, which is the 
</p>
<p>view of most source countries. This difference in views finds expression in the polarized 
</p>
<p>voting pattern that has prevailed so far in the adoption of resolutions pertaining to unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures. For developing States, adopting guidelines should not signify a 
</p>
<p>recognition of the legitimacy of such measures as a tool of foreign policy, a position they 
</p>
<p>do not countenance. For the source countries, mostly advanced States, of which one group 
</p>
<p>has indeed adopted exhaustive guidelines, the issue might signify no more than sharing 
</p>
<p>such guidelines with others.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur will seek to promote, through appropriate recommendations, 
</p>
<p>a consensual approach in this regard, giving priority to pragmatic options that can 
</p>
<p>effectively prevent, minimize and redress the adverse impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures on vulnerable groups on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Review and evaluation of mechanisms for assessment and redress 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur will also review existing independent mechanisms set up to 
</p>
<p>assess the adverse impacts of unilateral coercive measures and adjudicatory procedures to 
</p>
<p>permit redress or reparations of aggrieved parties, and will seek to identify best practices 
</p>
<p>and next practices, having in view the necessity to promote the accountability of source 
</p>
<p>countries and the credibility of impact assessment in target countries. 
</p>
<p>56. In order to mirror in the approach to unilateral coercive measures, progress achieved 
</p>
<p>in respect of United Nations sanctions policy, the Special Rapporteur will review ongoing 
</p>
<p>work in this regard by the High-level Review of United Nations Sanctions and the Inter-

<p><b> E. Contribution to strengthen the capacity of the Office of the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance and advisory services to affected countries 
</b></p>
<p>57. Pursuant to his mandate, the Special Rapporteur will contribute to backstopping the 
</p>
<p>capacity of OHCHR to provide affected countries with technical assistance and advisory 
</p>
<p>services. Consultations have been initiated with OHCHR to determine the modalities of the 
</p>
<p>special procedure&#8217;s involvement in this important area 
</p>
<p>58. The mandate-holder will investigate the possibility and acceptability of including 
</p>
<p>reporting on unilateral coercive measures and on their human rights impact as part of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review process and to organize a cross-cutting mainstreaming session of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council on this theme  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Only multilateral sanctions approved by the Security Council comply with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, which is the bond between all 
</b></p>
<p><b>States Members of the United Nations. The political reality, however, has departed 
</b></p>
<p><b>from the ideals of the founding fathers based on a vision of the unity of purpose of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>victors of the Second World War. Thus, it soon became obvious that the veto powers 
</b></p>
<p><b>devolved to the five permanent members of the Security Council would, on occasion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent it from adopting sanctions when these were necessary if only to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>innocent populations from abuse of their human rights, or the procedure in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council for adopting sanctions was too lengthy while the need to resort to coercive 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures brooked no delay. It was to be expected that unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>would be adopted to remedy such deficiencies.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>However, the question remains as to whether such measures would still be 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate if the Security Council had already taken action and adopted appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctions in good time. This is open to debate, but there are strong legal arguments 
</b></p>
<p><b>that support a negative answer. It has been argued that:  
</b></p>
<p><b>From the moment when the Council occupies itself with the adoption of 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandatory sanctions, Member States transform into agents for the execution of 
</b></p>
<p><b>these sanctions, their duty being to implement them in good faith without 
</b></p>
<p><b>undermining their effective application. For States not individually injured, 
</b></p>
<p><b>this implies an obligation to suspend measures already adopted at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>individual level if they are different or incompatible with the measures decided 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Council, or in any case, to modify them in order to harmonize them with 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations sanctions. A fortiori, the States in question should not adopt 
</b></p>
<p><b>collective countermeasures after the pronouncement of mandatory sanctions 
</b></p>
<p><b>but only measures that are necessary and sufficient for the execution of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandatory sanctions. In short, unless the Council invites States to go further 
</b></p>
<p><b>than its own measures </b>&#8212;<b> a rare event in practice </b>&#8212;<b> the triggering of Chapter 
</b></p>
<p><b>VII ends the power of States not individually injured to react as they please at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the individual level.</b>45<b>

</p>
<p>Press, 2010), p. 1142. </p>


<p>61. <b>The debate as to whether autonomous policies of retorsion/retaliation or of 
</b></p>
<p><b>countermeasures by States or groups of States warrant unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>in such circumstances and whether or not they comply with international law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>customary law and peremptory norms of behaviour, is essentially a political debate 
</b></p>
<p><b>between source and target countries. The pragmatic way out of the resulting 
</b></p>
<p><b>conundrum has been to focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of such measures and 
</b></p>
<p><b>on their human rights impact.  The argument goes that if measures achieve their 
</b></p>
<p><b>objectives rapidly and if these objectives are viewed as desirable by the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, they may be considered as legitimate. However, this legitimacy is 
</b></p>
<p><b>undermined if the measures have caused, by design or by default, egregious violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>of basic human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The search for international legitimacy has therefore led to a flurry of 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives to focus on universally accepted targets, to be monitored closely and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adjusted as warranted by evolving circumstances. The aims of the measures targeting 
</b></p>
<p>countries are to be limited to changing the target country&#8217;s behaviour if, and only if, it 
</p>
<p><b>is in breach of an international treaty, covenant or agreement or to signal the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international </b>community&#8217;s disapproval of the targeted country&#8217;s<b> behaviour. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures should be time-bound and in view of the modesty of the outcome of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures in achieving their goals so far,46 should be combined with 
</b></p>
<p><b>a series of other complementary efforts including incentives and negotiations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase chances of success. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>But if the human rights impact of unilateral coercive measures on the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable groups is egregious and if there is no perceptible progress towards the 
</b></p>
<p><b>achievement of the proclaimed target, the legitimacy of these measures will be called 
</b></p>
<p><b>into question even if a good legal case can be made in support of the action. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Resort to unilateral coercive measures in this case is not conditional on 
</b></p>
<p><b>demonstration of direct injury by the source-State or group of States. Keeping in 
</b></p>
<p><b>mind as a guiding thread the fate of rights holders in target countries who should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected both by their authorities and by the source countries, it is suggested that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>focus of investigations be pragmatic, i.e. to get a full picture of the unilateral coercive 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures under implementation, to devise parameters to assess their human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact while distinguishing correlation from causation, to identify best institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice in source countries and devise United Nations guidelines applicable to such 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to correct and redress their negative impact. This conceptual approach will 
</b></p>
<p><b>have to be confronted with case studies to ensure, at all times, a reality check for 
</b></p>
<p><b>ongoing research in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>   <b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 46 The rate of success of unilateral coercive measures in the pre-globalization era was 34 per cent and 
</p>
<p>has gone down since then as South-South cooperation mainly with new world economic powerhouses 
</p>
<p>has reduced the constraints of embargoes coming from advanced industrialized countries. See Heather 
</p>
<p>Chingono, Medial Hove and Steven James Danda &#8220;Sanctions Effectiveness in a Globalized World&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i>International Journal of Humanities and Social Studies</i>, Vol.3, No. 21, December 2013. The success 
</p>
<p>rate of unilateral coercive measures is, however, improved when their impact is compounded not only 
</p>
<p>by incentives but also by supportive international economic trends. Thus unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>of 2012 imposing an embargo on Iranian oil exports added to the drop in oil prices in 2015 enhanced 
</p>
<p>pressure to seal the nuclear deal between the five plus one group and Iran (Islamic Republic of). 
</p>
<p>These developments with respect to Iran (Islamic Republic of) and those relating to the policy to end 
</p>
<p>the comprehensive unilateral coercive measures against Cuba may be the harbingers of a new future 
</p>
<p>trend to seek solutions to international conflicts of interest through negotiation and diplomacy rather 
</p>
<p>than through economic or military violence.  </p>
