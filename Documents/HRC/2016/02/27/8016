<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 15/8. In the report, the Special 
Rapporteur elaborates upon the concept of security of tenure as a component of the right to 
adequate housing. The backdrop is one of a global tenure insecurity crisis, manifesting 
itself in many forms and contexts&#8212;forced evictions, displacement resulting from 
development, natural disasters and conflicts and land grabbing&#8212;and evident in the millions 
of urban dwellers living under insecure tenure arrangements. The Special Rapporteur 
discusses existing guidance under international human rights law, raising questions 
regarding the precise State obligations with respect to ensuring security of tenure. She 
examines the wide range of existing tenure arrangements, and the prevalent focus in policy 
and practice on one form of tenure: individual freehold. The Special Rapporteur also 
discusses selected operational and policy challenges pertaining to securing tenure. She 
concludes by underscoring the need for more specific and comprehensive human rights and 
operational guidance on security of tenure.

<p><b> I. Introduction: setting the context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. A global tenure insecurity crisis 
</b></p>
<p>1. We are in the grip of a global tenure insecurity crisis. Access to secure housing and 
land is a prerequisite for human dignity and an adequate standard of living, yet many 
millions of people live under the daily threat of eviction, or in an ambiguous situation 
where their tenure status can be challenged by authorities or private actors at any time. 
</p>
<p>2. The crisis manifests itself in many forms and contexts. Forced evictions are its most 
visible and egregious sign. Displacement resulting from development, natural disasters and 
conflicts, land grabbing, and the growing number of urban dwellers living under insecure 
tenure arrangements worldwide are further manifestations of the crisis. 
</p>
<p>3. In the absence of comprehensive global statistics on forced evictions, estimates by 
organizations of reported cases, as well as communications received by the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur, confirm that forced evictions take place everywhere and affect millions 
of people annually. For instance, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions has estimated 
that between 1998 and 2008 forced evictions affected over 18 million people.1 The adverse 
impacts of forced eviction are massive, increasing poverty and destroying communities, 
leaving millions in extremely vulnerable situations. 
</p><p>4. Many others are displaced due to development projects. According to one estimate, 
in the 2000s, such development projects affected 15 million people annually.2 Preparations 
for mega-events are further sources of insecurity and forced evictions.3 
</p>
<p>5. Conflicts and natural disasters, including those exacerbated by climate change, also 
trigger displacement and can undermine security of tenure. Over 26 million people were 
internally displaced at the end of 2011 due to armed conflicts, violence or human rights 
violations, while nearly 15 million were displaced due to natural hazards.4  
</p>
<p>6. The political economy of land deeply influences processes of development, 
urbanization and housing. Land speculation, as well as large-scale acquisition of land in 
rural areas&#8212;often non-transparent and managed poorly&#8212;undermine tenure rights and local 
livelihoods.5 Coupled with drought and other climate-related changes, such activities are 
major drivers of migration to cities, where adequate land and housing is often not available 
to newcomers, especially the poor. As a result, people settle in housing and settlements with

<p>insecure tenure arrangements. Unplanned and exclusionary urbanization has obvious 
impacts on tenure security.6 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, due to their increasing commodification, rural and urban lands have 
become highly contested assets, which has had dramatic consequences, particularly but not 
exclusively in emerging economies. The dynamics that accompany the liberalization of 
land markets are increasing the pressure of the market on urban low-income settlements, 
and this in a global context where resources for housing do not reach the lowest income 
groups. Communities are under threat of dispossession, their right to adequate housing, 
including tenure security, left unprotected.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Who is affected by tenure insecurity</b>&#8212;<b>measuring and assessing the 
extent of the problem 
</b></p>
<p>8. Tenure insecurity is a global phenomenon. Yet, assessing the nature and scale of the 
problem is fraught with difficulties of definition as well as measurement, and precise data is 
not available.7 This is because tenure security is partly a matter of perception and 
experience, highly dependent on political, economic and cultural context, as well as a legal 
issue.  
</p>
<p>9. Self-made and unplanned settlements, with precarious housing conditions, epitomize 
tenure insecurity in a very visible form. In many cities they now represent the largest single 
channel of land and housing supply for the majority of the population. Attempts to measure 
the scale of these settlements and their level of tenure insecurity have been problematic for 
the reasons just highlighted, and also because of the great diversity in settlements and 
tenure characteristics across countries and regions.  
</p>
<p>10. The United Nations Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) provides data on &#8213;slums&#8214;, 
the word it has adopted to define such settlements. One UN-Habitat study estimated that 
924 million people were living in slums in 2001;8 an estimate for 2010 placed the number at 
about 828 million.9 However, by 2010 tenure security was not taken into account in the 
UN-Habitat measurements of slums, hence the latter figure offers only a very small insight 
into the current extent of tenure insecurity in urban areas.10 Similarly, the revised indicator 
for the Millennium Development Goal target of improving the lives of 100 million slum 
dwellers (7 (d)) does not include security of tenure.11 While this particular target was 
reached, the question remains as to whether this result reflects the real situation of slums 
and informal settlements worldwide. Developing effective ways to measure tenure 
(in)security is an urgent imperative, including for the Millennium Development Goals and 
the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. 
</p>
<p>  
 6  Expert projections show that by 2050, 67 per cent of the world&#8216;s population will be urban.

</p>
<p> 7  A few initiatives to measure tenure security are however under way. See, for example, R. Sietchiping 
et al., &#8213;Monitoring tenure security within the continuum of land rights: methods and practices&#8214;, paper 
prepared for the Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty, Washington D.C., 23-26 April

 11 The revised indicator for the target is the proportion of the urban population living in slums (the 
</p>
<p>original indicator was the proportion of households with access to secure tenure). <i>Claiming the

E.08.XIV.6) , p. 40. </p>


<p>11. Informal settlements are by no means the only example of tenure insecurity. In fact, 
a wide range of individuals and groups may be insecure:12 refugees and internally displaced 
persons, affected by or under threat of conflicts, disasters and climate change; people on 
land set aside or affected by development projects; residents of informal settlements; 
occupants of valuable land; tenants with or without legal leases/titles, in informal 
settlements or formal contexts, in rural and urban areas; internal or international migrants; 
minorities; nomadic communities; groups affected by stigma or caste-based discrimination; 
the poor, landless, jobless and/or homeless; sharecroppers; bonded labourers; other 
marginalized groups, such as persons with disabilities or persons living with HIV; children; 
indigenous peoples; groups with customary land rights; and even individual property 
owners.  
</p>
<p>12. Among all these, women, who often have to depend on a man to gain access to 
housing and secure tenure, are particularly vulnerable. Single and older women, in 
particular, too often do not have the legal empowerment, education or financial resources to 
defend their tenure. 
</p>
<p>13. While no one appears fully protected from tenure insecurity, it is evident that the 
most marginalized and poorest bear the brunt of the insecurity burden. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Why security of tenure matters  
</b></p>
<p>14. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/8, requested the Special Rapporteur 
on adequate housing to identify best practices as well as challenges and obstacles to the full 
realization of the right to adequate housing, and identify protection gaps in that regard. As 
the above overview shows, a central challenge to the realization of the right to adequate 
housing is the lack of security of tenure.  
</p>
<p>15. Insecure tenure arguably annuls all other aspects of adequate housing&#8212;what is the 
point of having a well-insulated, affordable, culturally appropriate home, to cite only some 
aspects of adequate housing, if one is under daily threat of eviction? At the same time, any 
housing initiative, whether in the context of urban renewal, land management or 
development-related projects, or in dealing with reconstruction needs after conflicts or 
disasters, will inevitably have tenure security implications. In addition, the denial of access 
to secure land and housing has been a major cause of conflict throughout history. It is also a 
source of impoverishment and a hindrance to socioeconomic development.  
</p>
<p>16. Conversely, when access to secure housing or land is provided, the potential for 
social and economic progress is immense&#8212;a fact recognized globally.13 Tenure security 
means a lot to families and individuals. It gives people certainty about what they can do 
with their land or home; and it offers them protection from encroachments by others. It 
often protects, increases and enables access to public services and benefits. It increases 
economic opportunities. It is a basis for women&#8216;s economic empowerment and protection 
</p>
<p>from violence. The relevance of the issue, not only to human rights but also to 
development, is evident.

Global Campaign for Secure Tenure, launched in 1999 by UN-Habitat. </p>


<p><b> D. The study on security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur has decided to dedicate much of her attention until the end of 
her mandate to the issue of security of tenure. The present report reflects the areas of research 
she commissioned in 2012 (some of which can be found in two research papers available 
from www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/StudyOnSecurityOfTenure.aspx). In section 
I, the Special Rapporteur described the broad context bearing upon tenure security and the 
crucial importance of the issue. In section II she maps the tenure systems and arrangements 
existing worldwide, as well as key policies and practices pertaining to tenure security. In 
section III, the Special Rapporteur assesses existing guidance under international human 
rights law as well as in national and regional legal frameworks and related case law and 
other global governance frameworks. In section IV, she highlights some of the key 
challenges that pertain to securing tenure, flagging areas for further research rather than 
offering definite answers to what are extremely complex issues.  
</p>
<p>18. The present report is also based on three consultations convened by the Special 
Rapporteur in 2012. In September, in Naples, the Special Rapporteur convened a 
consultation with 26 participants from housing, urban planning and human rights 
organizations. In October 2012, in Geneva, she convened an expert group meeting with 
another 26 participants, including experts in the areas of land management, urban planning 
and human rights law and litigation, and representatives of humanitarian action and 
community-based organizations. Also that month, the Special Rapporteur convened a 
public consultation in Geneva. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the participants 
in the above consultations,14 and other contributors, for the high quality of their inputs. The 
final text of the report remains the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s sole responsibility. 
</p>
<p>19. Resources permitting, the Special Rapporteur intends to continue to explore some of 
the issues that emerged in her first year of research. She aims to submit a final report on 
security of tenure to the Human Rights Council in 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Mapping and framing tenure 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definitions 
</b></p>
<p>20. Any discussion of land and housing tenure needs to recognize the importance of 
cultural, historical and political contexts, and the specific legal systems in place. The 
particular combination of these specificities results in subtle differences in the way key 
terms and relationships are defined.  
</p>
<p>21. &#8213;Tenure&#8214; comes from the French verb <i>tenir</i>, meaning &#8213;to hold&#8214;. A definition that is 
commonly cited considers land tenure &#8213;the relationship, whether legally or customarily 
</p>
<p>defined, among people, as individuals or groups, with respect to land&#8214;.15 This definition 
does not however reflect the realities of informal tenure systems, common in urban areas. 
The reasons may be that policy development on land tenure has its roots in rural contexts.  
</p>
<p>22. For the purpose of the present report, and to account for types of tenure in urban 
contexts, tenure is understood as the set of relationships with respect to housing and land, 
established through statutory law or customary, informal or hybrid arrangements. 
</p>
<p>  
 14  The lists of participants for the consultations and the expert group meeting are available from 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/StudyOnSecurityOfTenure.aspx. 
 15  See, for example, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), &#8213;Land tenure and 
</p>
<p>rural development&#8214;, Land Tenure Series 3 (2002), para. 3.1. </p>


<p>23. Security of tenure is understood in the present report as tenure of land and/or 
housing which ensures a secure home and enables one to live in security, peace and dignity. 
While the report does not address land tenure other than as prerequisite for housing, it must 
be noted that issues pertaining to land&#8212;whether for housing or agriculture&#8212;are intimately 
linked. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Existing tenure systems and categories 
</b></p>
<p>24. Land tenure systems and forms determine who can use and dispose of what land, 
housing or natural resources for how long and under what conditions. Attempts have been 
made to classify forms and systems of tenure in order to clarify existing arrangements.  
</p>
<p>25. First, it has been suggested that all categories of tenure exist within a number of 
primary tenure systems, namely: (a) statutory systems, established by law or statutes&#8212;they 
consist of two main types, private and public tenure systems, and can guarantee individual 
or collective rights; (b) customary systems, referring to the communal possession of rights 
to use and allocate land by a group sharing the same cultural identity or established by 
customs; (c) religious systems, whereby all or some land is owned and managed by 
religious authorities; and (d) informal tenure systems, most common in urban areas&#8212;these 
are often hybrid systems that have emerged in response to the difficulties of existing 
systems to cater for rapidly expanding cities and their urban land markets.16 
</p>
<p>26. Within each of these primary tenure systems, a number of tenure categories or forms 
exist. Several tenure categories may also co-exist on the same plot, a situation frequent in 
urban settlements. Some of the main categories include: individual freehold (ownership in 
perpetuity); delayed freehold (conditional ownership); registered leasehold (ownership for a 
specified period, from a few months to 999 years); public rental (rental occupation of 
publicly owned land or housing); private rental (rental of privately owned property); 
collective or communal ownership, including cooperative (ownership is vested in the 
cooperative or group of which residents are co-owners); community land trust (a non-profit 
organization develops and stewards affordable housing on behalf of a community); and 
customary ownership or use.17 
</p>
<p>27. These broad distinctions are used to clarify the nature of tenure, yet in most cases 
they simplify and do not fully reflect the complexity of situations on the ground. In many 
cases legal plurality exists, such as when statutory tenure categories are superimposed upon 
customary regimes. It might thus be useful to understand the issue as one of a spectrum of 
tenure arrangements and forms, with marked variations depending on context. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Understanding </b>&#8220;<b>informal settlements</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. The above distinctions have particularly obvious limitations when attempting to 
capture and reflect the diversity of arrangements in informal tenure systems, or in what is 
commonly termed &#8213;informal settlements&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>29. Informal settlements are self-made, spontaneous, self-managed and unplanned 
settlement and housing arrangements, initiated by urban poor themselves. They are 
generally characterized by precarious infrastructure and housing conditions. The term 
</p>
<p>  
 16 See Geoffrey Payne and Alain Durand-Lasserve, &#8213;Holding on: security of tenure&#8212;types, policies, 
</p>
<p>practices and challenges&#8214;, available from 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/StudyOnSecurityOfTenure.aspx. 
 17 Ibid. </p>


<p>informal settlement has become common, but many other terms are used, such as &#8213;slums&#8214;, 
</p>
<p>&#8213;bidonvilles&#8214; and &#8213;favelas&#8214;, among others.  
</p>
<p>30. The category of informal settlements includes diverse categories with varying 
degrees of formal recognition&#8212;in other words, with &#8213;ambiguous&#8214; or &#8213;hybrid&#8214; tenure status. 
They include regularized or unregularized use or occupancy of land and/or housing, on 
public, private or customary land, unauthorized subdivisions on legally owned land or 
housing, and various forms of rental arrangements, whether formalized in some manner or 
not.  
</p>
<p>31. There is debate about the most appropriate term to use in describing these diverse 
arrangements. For the purpose of the present report, the term informal settlements is used, 
recognizing its widespread use, while being sensitive to its shortcomings. Indeed, the term 
informal settlements is not only a major simplification, it also reflects a false dichotomy 
between the dominant paradigm of formality and the complexity of urban settlement 
processes (see section II, subsection E below). Furthermore, informal settlements, like other 
commonly used terms, has generally negative connotations. In addition, the inherent 
ambiguity in the status of these settlements has a number of political, operational and 
human rights implications. It generally results in the settlements not being recognized as 
belonging to the city. It often leads government authorities and private actors to consider 
the settlements or their inhabitants fully &#8213;illegal&#8214;, thereby justifying forced evictions or 
denial of rights.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The primacy of individual freehold  
</b></p>
<p>32. Despite the prevalence of a great variety of tenure systems and arrangements 
worldwide, in the past few decades, most models of urban planning, land management, 
development and legal regimes have centred around one particular form: individual 
freehold. This common fixation on freehold has been supported by the predominant 
economic doctrine of reliance on private property and market forces.  
</p>
<p>33. As a result, the financial sector and the private housing market, coupled with support 
for households to take on credit debt, became primary mechanisms for allocating housing 
solutions. Foreign assistance from international organizations greatly influenced the 
development of market-based housing finance and boosted housing market activity in 
developing countries. Despite some diversity in housing policy experience, most countries 
opted for promoting housing markets and individual homeownership, privatizing social 
housing programmes and deregulating housing finance markets. This was evident in most 
formerly planned economies, which in the 1990s privatized public housing on a large scale, 
leading to radical changes in tenure structure. In many of those countries, owner-occupied 
housing now constitutes more than 90 per cent of the housing stock (A/67/286, para. 6). 
</p>
<p>34. In developing countries, Governments were encouraged to undertake individual land 
titling programmes as a key means of not only increasing tenure security, but also of 
facilitating access to formal credit and reducing poverty. The underlying assumption was 
that secure tenure&#8212;understood as having proper titles&#8212;increased housing investment.18 
Also influential was the claim of a direct correlation between property ownership and 
</p>
<p>  
 18 See World Bank, <i>Housing: Enabling Markets to Work</i> (1993). </p>


<p>affluence in the West and the lack of it in developing countries.19 Consequently, home 
ownership rates worldwide have been generally climbing since the 1950s.20 
</p>
<p>35. This process has overshadowed other well-established forms of tenure. Government 
support of other forms was reduced, for instance for collective ownership or rental 
housing.21 Furthermore, the prevalence of individual freehold over any other tenure 
arrangements has increased the tenure insecurity of all other forms of tenure.22  
</p>
<p>36. More recently, international institutions have become increasingly aware of the 
limitations of strategies based predominantly on the formalization of urban land markets 
and have recognized that there is a variety of tenure instruments that can be employed.23 
However this trend has not permeated all spheres of practice and policy. A number of 
agencies and governments still adhere to a preponderant focus on private property 
ownership, with debatable results.24 
</p>
<p><b> E. The </b>&#8220;<b>continuum of land rights</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. The above sections highlight the existing tensions in development and housing 
policy between recognizing the complexity and diversity of tenure arrangements 
worldwide, and promoting one single form&#8212;formalized, registered freehold&#8212;as the ideal 
model for secure tenure and socioeconomic development. 
</p>
<p>38. Such tensions are apparent in a model suggested originally by UN-Habitat and the 
Global Land Tool Network, and used by other agencies since,25 called the &#8213;continuum of 
land rights&#8214;. While the continuum was intended to express the range and diversity of tenure 
</p>
<p>situations, it is illustrated by a linear diagram, with an arrow going from left (informal land 
rights) to right (formal land rights).26  
</p>
<p>39. This linear diagram has several limitations. First, by placing individual freehold at 
the very end of the continuum (the most formal and secure form of tenure), it could be 
interpreted as reflecting the dominant economic and housing model discussed just above. It 
appears to suggest that registered individual freehold is an ideal type or ultimate goal, 
despite the fact that many other categories in other tenure systems offer equally high levels 
of security and legality. In fact, tenure categories reflect diverse social and economic 
contexts, and thus there can be no such ideal category&#8212;registered individual freehold&#8212;as 
the sole guarantee for secure tenure and route to economic development. Rather, it should

<p>40. In addition, by addressing the issue in terms of informal and formal rights, the 
continuum diagram is reflective of a binary thinking that has permeated international 
development policy. It has been common to discuss land tenure and property rights in terms 
of some form of duality, such as that between statutory and customary tenure arrangements.27 
Another form of duality involved a distinction between legal and illegal, or formal and 
&#8213;informal&#8214; tenure categories, in which the former consisted of officially approved and 
registered property and the latter (all other tenure arrangements) were &#8213;extralegal&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>41. As discussed above, tenure categories are often partly formal, recognized or legal, 
creating shades and combinations of legality, formality and extralegality. The degree of 
tenure security provided by each of the tenure categories does not always correspond to 
formalistic or legalistic readings of existing arrangements; rather, it can vary depending on 
the socioeconomic and political context.  
</p>
<p>42. The importance of recognizing the diversity and multidimensional nature of existing 
practices is increasingly being acknowledged. In a recent publication, UN-Habitat and the 
Global Land Tool Network indicated that the continuum diagram illustrates a wide range of 
tenure rights &#8213;in a highly simplified way: in reality, tenure rights do not lie on a single line, 
and they may overlap with one another. Tenure can take a variety of forms, and &#8215;registered 
freehold&#8216; (at the formal end of the continuum) should not be seen as the preferred or 
ultimate form of land rights, but as one of a number of appropriate and legitimate forms.&#8214;28  
</p>
<p>43. It is thus evident that forms of tenure should more accurately be placed in a 
multidimensional relationship to one another. And if there is a continuum, it should be seen 
as going from insecurity to security of tenure, not from informality to formality. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Security of tenure in international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of relevant frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>44. Security of tenure is recognized as a key component of the right to adequate housing 
under international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur conducted comprehensive 
research into the various sources of international human rights law, and especially the 
authoritive guidance and commentary of United Nations human rights mechanisms, in 
order to identify States&#8216; obligations relating to security of tenure. 
</p>
<p>45. Regional and national case law, global governance frameworks relating to land 
tenure and human settlements, and selected national constitutional and legislative 
frameworks were examined in order to supplement an understanding of international human 
rights law and to assist in identifying potential gaps and challenges. 
</p>
<p>46. The most explicit and comprehensive discussion on security of tenure can be found in 
commentary and observations adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. Other United Nations human rights mechanisms, like their regional and national 
counterparts, have focused overwhelmingly on preventing and providing redress for forced 
evictions, while giving only limited attention to other elements of security of tenure.  
</p>
<p>  
 27 See, for example, World Resources Institute, in collaboration with the United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Programme et al., <i>World Resources Report: The Wealth of the Poor</i>&#8212;<i>Managing Ecosystems to Fight 
Poverty </i>(2005), pp. 60-61.  
</p>

and Secure Tenure</i> (2012), p. 12. </p>


<p><b> B. Obligation to confer legal security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>47. In its general comment No. 4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights identified &#8213;legal security of tenure&#8214; as one of 
seven elements of the right to adequate housing (para. 8 (a)). The Committee stressed that 
&#8213;notwithstanding the type of tenure, all persons should possess a degree of security of 
tenure which guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other 
threats. States parties should consequently take immediate measures aimed at conferring 
legal security of tenure upon those persons and households currently lacking such 
protection, in genuine consultation with affected persons and groups&#8214; (ibid.). 
</p>
<p>48. From this observation and the authoritative guidance of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and other United Nations human rights mechanisms, it appears 
that security of tenure must be &#8213;legal&#8214; or protected by law. Systematic reference can be 
found as to the provision of &#8213;adequate housing with legal security of tenure&#8214;, and to the 
importance of adopting adequate laws and regulations in this respect.29 
</p>
<p>49. The obligation to confer legal tenure security is due to everyone, irrespective of the 
type of tenure held. The question then arises as to what precisely the State obligations are 
under that general injunction. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
notes that States should take immediate measures aimed at conferring security of tenure 
(see para. 49 above). This language, on its face, articulates an immediate obligation to 
ensure a minimum degree of tenure security to all (to prevent forced evictions). 
</p>
<p>50. States are also called upon to confer security of tenure to all those who lack it. This 
seems to imply that one focus of State action should be on the most disadvantaged and 
insecure. An examination of the authoritive guidance of United Nations mechanisms 
confirms that States must secure tenure particularly for the most disadvantaged and 
marginalized, such as low-income groups, informal settlers, and minorities.30  
</p>
<p>51. National and regional case law offers similar guidance. For instance, the Supreme 
Court of India has called upon the State to provide some security of tenure to marginalized 
groups, such as pavement dwellers, and the South African Constitutional Court and the 
European Court of Human Rights have addressed security of tenure and protection against 
eviction for the urban poor and inhabitants of informal settlements.31  
</p>
<p>52. The above questions, as well as others discussed in subsections C and D of the 
present section, could be discussed with respect to a number of situations, individuals and 
groups. One such group is inhabitants of informal settlements. Guidance so far has focused 
on protection against forced evictions. More broadly, what should States do to ensure that 
all inhabitants of informal settlements enjoy security of tenure, irrespective of their legal 
status under national law? What types of minimum measures, as well as measures of

<p>progressive realization, should States take? Is there an obligation to give legal recognition 
to such settlements, and if so what are the implications for rights of tenure? Should any 
distinction be made under international human rights law as to whether these settlers are on 
public or private land (a distinction that is often accorded central importance in national 
law32)? And should the threshold of protection be higher in situations of long-established 
communities and historic acquiescence of the authorities to their presence?33  
</p>
<p><b> C. Protection against forced eviction 
</b></p>
<p>53. As noted above, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
stressed that all persons should possess a degree of security of tenure which guarantees 
legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats. The Commission on 
Human Rights, in its resolution 1993/77 (para. 3), similarly urged Governments to confer 
legal security of tenure on all persons currently threatened with forced eviction.  
</p>
<p>54. There is no doubt that forced eviction constitutes a gross violation of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights.34 Providing protection against such practices is 
thus a core function of security of tenure. Forced evictions have been addressed by human 
rights mechanisms and courts at all levels in considerable detail. Extensive guidance is 
available as to the prohibition of forced eviction and the strict procedural safeguards that 
must be followed in situations in which evictions are carried out, including meaningful 
consultation with affected communities.35  
</p>
<p>55. Legislation against forced evictions is considered essential to a system of effective 
protection. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, such 
legislation should include measures which (a) provide the greatest possible security of 
tenure to occupiers of houses and land, (b) conform to the Covenant and (c) are designed to 
control strictly the circumstances under which evictions may be carried out.36 A number of 
countries have adopted legislation aimed at preventing forced evictions.37 
</p>
<p>56. Questions remain as to what types of measures should be taken to &#8213;provide the 
greatest possible security of tenure&#8214; to occupiers of houses and land. No explanation is 
given as to what could qualify as greatest possible security of tenure, or how this should be 
determined bearing in mind the diversity of national contexts. For instance, should 
principles of reasonableness38 and proportionality be used to ascertain what level of security 
of tenure is appropriate in a given context? This question of a threshold of security of 
tenure has also attracted little attention from regional and national mechanisms and courts.  
</p>
<p>  
 32 This question should be explored against the complexity of intervening on private land in a context 
</p>
<p>where national law guarantees the protection of private property. 
 33 ECHR found that States have higher obligations of protection in such cases (<i>Yordanova and others </i>v. </p>
<p><i>Bulgaria</i>, para. 121)<i>.</i> See similar reasoning in Human Rights Committee, communication No. 
2073/2011, <i>Naidenova et al.</i> v.<i> Bulgaria</i>, Views adopted on 30 October 2012, paras. 14.6-14.7.

<p>(1997); and the basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement

<p>57. Further questions remain as to the exact circumstances under which evictions may 
be carried out, with a view to restricting their occurrence. According to the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and as reiterated in the basic principles and 
guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement, evictions can take place only 
in the &#8213;most exceptional circumstances&#8214;.39 Jurisprudence from national and regional bodies 
that has developed since this language was adopted could be used to more clearly define 
what the phrase &#8213;most exceptional circumstances&#8214; entails. For example, the &#8213;just and 
</p>
<p>equitable&#8214; jurisprudence from South Africa as well as European Court of Human Rights 
jurisprudence regarding proportionality are highly pertinent in seeking to better understand 
this phrase and in identifying what constitutes a public purpose of the type that is often 
cited as reason to evict.40 
</p>
<p><b> D. Recognizing and protecting a variety of tenure forms 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted that tenure 
&#8213;takes a variety of forms, including rental (public and private) accommodation, cooperative 
housing, lease, owner-occupation, emergency housing and informal settlements, including 
occupation of land or property&#8214;.41 Thus the Committee reflects the diversity of tenure 
arrangements worldwide. 
</p>
<p>59. In the same vein, the Governing Council of UN-Habitat, in its resolution 23/17, 
encouraged Governments and Habitat Agenda partners to promote security of tenure for all 
segments of society by recognizing and respecting a plurality of tenure systems (para. 7 
(b)).42 Similarly, the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of 
Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security43 advise that States 
&#8213;should recognize and respect all legitimate tenure right holders and their rights. They 
</p>
<p>should take reasonable measures to identify, record and respect legitimate tenure right 
holders and their rights, whether formally recorded or not&#8214; (p. 3). The Special Rapporteur 
observes that the determinations of who may constitute &#8213;legitimate&#8214; right holders should be 
made in accordance with international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>60. Given that tenure can take a variety of forms and that States must ensure security of 
tenure to all, irrespective of tenure type, what are States&#8216; obligations with respect to 
ensuring that all forms of tenure that are legitimate under international human rights law are 
protected equally? Guidance is incomplete in this regard. United Nations and regional 
human rights bodies have focused only on a limited range of forms of tenure&#8212;mostly 
private property, indigenous communal ownership or use, women&#8216;s access to land, property 
</p>
<p>or inheritance, informal tenure (mostly in cases involving Roma), and occupancy tenancy 
rights (in countries that were previously part of the Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia). 
</p>
<p>61. Other forms of tenure are barely discussed. For instance, collective tenure&#8212;other 
than that held by indigenous peoples&#8212;warrants further examination. It is also unclear what 
State obligations are with respect to tenancy. Should States adopt a framework of tenant

<p>protection? How should tenants&#8216; rights be balanced with the rights of property owners?44 
What are the limits within which tenants&#8216; rights or the rights of holders of other forms of 
tenure can be ensured? 
</p>
<p><b> E. Non-discrimination and security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>62. International human rights mechanisms have discussed the particular tenure situation 
of some groups and individuals, such as Roma or women, but have offered little guidance 
with respect to other groups.45 For instance, commentary in relation to the situation of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) focuses only on a few issues (primarily housing or 
property restitution) and countries,46 and would thus warrant further elaboration. Other 
groups whose tenure needs require clarification are asylum seekers and migrants.  
</p>
<p>63. While non-discrimination is relevant to all groups and individuals, and all grounds 
of non-discrimination are potentially relevant to tenure security, the Special Rapporteur 
focuses here on issues of non-discrimination on account of property status, location and 
socioeconomic status, which are less often discussed in the human rights framework.  
</p>
<p>64. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed that 
discrimination on the grounds of property status or place of residence is prohibited under 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Property status 
includes those holding real property (for example land ownership or tenure) and those who 
lack it. The Committee further clarified that the exercise of Covenant rights, such as access 
to water or protection from forced eviction, should not be conditional on, or determined by, 
a person&#8216;s current or former place of residence, or land tenure status, such as living in an 
</p>
<p>informal settlement.47 Furthermore, the Committee has noted that States parties must give 
due priority to those social groups living in unfavourable conditions by giving them 
particular consideration.48 
</p>
<p>65. An examination of national legislation and case law reveals that different forms of 
security of tenure provide varying degrees of security, and that the variation is often a 
function of the property interests associated with each type of tenure as well as of 
socioeconomic status. For instance, those in informal settlements have minimal protections 
against eviction, while those with freehold tenure secured by title deeds are able to avail 
themselves of a far higher degree of protection. Furthermore, as United States expropriation 
case law demonstrates, even within an overall regime providing security of tenure, those 
with less economic status tend to enjoy a lesser degree of security of tenure in practice.49   
</p>
<p>  
 44 See, for example, Constitutional Court of South Africa, <i>Maphango and others </i>v.<i> Aengus Lifestyle 
</i></p>
<p><i>Properties</i>, case CCT 57/11, [2012] ZACC 2, decision adopted on 13 March 2012.

<p> 46 See, for example, concluding observations of United Nations treaty bodies on Bosnia and 
Herzegovina (E/C.12/BIH/CO/1) and Croatia (CERD/C/HRV/CO/8 and CCPR/C/HRV/CO/2); as

 49 The Supreme Court of the United States found that expropriating low-cost owner-occupied housing to 
</p>
<p>make way for private redevelopment was in the public interest as that development would create jobs 
 </p>


<p>66. The issue of non-discrimination on account of property or socioeconomic status is 
evidently complex. While the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
explicitly prohibited such discrimination, the precise modalities of addressing these aspects 
of non-discrimination are unclear. How can States ensure that all members of society, 
regardless of economic status or type of tenure arrangement, enjoy security of tenure on the 
basis of non-discrimination and equal protection of the law? This has massive implications 
for inhabitants of informal settlements. 
</p>
<p><b> F. General remarks 
</b></p>
<p>67. The foregoing analysis demonstrates that a number of issues require further 
clarification under international human rights law. Treaty bodies, starting with the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, have a particularly important role to 
play in efforts to provide more precise and comprehensive guidance with respect to security 
of tenure. National courts, aided by the use of strategic litigation, could provide another 
avenue to clarify aspects of security of tenure beyond preventing or seeking redress for 
forced evictions.  
</p>
<p>68. At a more fundamental level, the above issues may require a paradigm shift away 
from correlating security of tenure with a property rights regime and towards the grounding 
of security of tenure solidly in the human rights framework. Related to this is the need to 
protect the right to adequate housing when it comes into conflict with the right to property. 
For instance, in the case of <i>Modder East Squatters and Another </i>v.<i> Modderklip Boerdery 
(Pty) Ltd</i>, involving an informal settlement located on private land, the Supreme Court of 
South Africa reconciled this conflict of law by ordering the State authorities to compensate 
the owner of the land for the costs associated with its occupation by the informal settlement 
until such time as the State authorities could provide alternative land for the residents of 
that settlement, thereby recognizing the rights of the community to adequate housing and to 
protection against illegal eviction.50 <i>Modderklip</i> demonstrates how individual property 
rights can interfere with, rather than enhance, tenure rights of others. It also demonstrates 
how such a conflict of rights can be reconciled. Such conflicts also take place between the 
rights of landlords and those of tenants.51 
</p>
<p>69. Finally, while the full elaboration of the scope of &#8213;security of tenure&#8214; as recognized 
in the framework of international human rights law presents a range of challenges that have 
yet to be adequately met, the Special Rapporteur nonetheless underscores that security of 
tenure should be understood as encompassing, at a minimum: (a) legal protection from 
forced eviction, harassment or other threats; (b) recognition&#8212;legally, by authorities, but 
also by private actors&#8212;of the right to live in a secure place in peace and dignity; this 
recognition includes receiving support from authorities and equal access to and availability 
of all public services; (c) justiciability&#8212;in other words, security of tenure must be 
enforceable; to make this criterion truly effective may require the provision of legal aid to 
facilitate access to effective remedies; and (d) any other aspect required as a step towards

others. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Selected challenges and entry points 
</b></p>
<p>70. In addition to gaps in existing human rights guidance, the Special Rapporteur notes a 
number of challenges at the operational and policy level in a number of sectors bearing 
upon security of tenure. In this section, she reviews a few existing challenges requiring 
further examination. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Land governance and the political economy of land  
</b></p>
<p>71. Fundamentally, tenure insecurity is a political economy issue&#8212;the laws, institutions 
and decision-making processes relating to the access and use of housing and land are highly 
influenced by existing power structures within society. Thus it is increasingly recognized 
that land administration and urban planning cannot be considered purely technical matters. 
They can be manipulated to serve private interests, with major risks of exclusion and 
discrimination.52 This is especially problematic when the rule of law is absent or out of 
reach of the poorest and most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>72. A land governance and political economy perspective raises some important 
questions. Who benefits from the status quo and who is excluded? Who sets the agenda for 
land governance and land management reform? How are the benefits of reform 
distributed?53 These questions cannot be ignored, especially not in a context of rising 
interest in land and conflicted legal pluralism.54  
</p>
<p>73. Increased global demand for land implies an increased need for land policies that 
ensure tenure rights and equal access to land. Efforts to promote secure tenure must go 
hand in hand with improving the overall governance of land and protecting human rights. 
This is precisely the rationale behind the voluntary guidelines on land tenure mentioned 
above.55 Other guidance exists with regard to the governance of agricultural investments.56 
Yet no such safeguards are in place for urban and housing investments.  
</p>
<p>74. And while central and local authorities are primarily responsible to ensure that land 
and housing policies are respectful of the right to adequate housing, development and 
humanitarian agencies also have a significant role to play. Agencies must show due 
diligence to avoid being unwittingly complicit in human rights violations. In addition, 
urban developers, investors and national and international finance institutions may 
contribute to a more inclusive urban growth, but can also have an adverse impact on the 
rights of urban poor and other groups, and be complicit in forced evictions and land

<p>grabbing. Their particular impact on security of tenure should be assessed against the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (A/HRC/17/31, annex). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Land management and administration  
</b></p>
<p>75. Land management and administration can have enormous positive impacts on 
solving land disputes and strengthening tenure security. However, prevalent land 
management and administration projects, by focusing on the granting of individual freehold 
titles to users or owners of non-contested plots, have often proven ill-suited to recognize all 
forms of tenure and in particular to protect the most vulnerable. This is particularly the case 
in urban contexts, where such programmes have on occasion unwittingly discriminated 
against or excluded urban poor.57 Land management programmes might also unwittingly 
exclude IDPs.58 
</p>
<p>76. Titling is not just a matter of formalizing informal arrangements that already exist. 
Very often, contradictory claims of ownership arise following the announcements of titling 
programmes.59 A related difficulty has been that titling of contested plots involves 
politically contentious decisions about the allocation of rights and thus is difficult to 
advance&#8212;this is often the case in informal settlements.60  
</p>
<p>77. At a more basic level, land titling is unlikely to address the global needs for 
increased tenure security within an adequate time frame. In many countries adjudication 
and registration of freehold land parcels at current rates could take well over a century. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of public land  
</b></p>
<p>78. Public land remains one of the most important potential sources of land for housing 
the poor, yet there remain obstacles to using public land for such purposes. For instance, 
poor land governance, corruption in land administration and the tight relationship that exists 
between tenure status and land values encourages nepotism, corruption, clientelism and 
market-driven interests in public land allocation.  
</p>
<p>79. Legal dualism and ambiguity between the concepts of &#8213;public domain&#8214; and &#8213;State 
domain&#8214;, common in francophone Africa for instance, is blurring the boundary between 
alienable and unalienable land, to the benefit of government actors involved in land 
allocation. The lack of public land demarcation also allows for misuse.61  
</p>
<p>80. Legal regimes regulating the use of public land differ greatly in their flexibility or 
ability to make land secure or not. In many countries, the State can grant temporary and 
conditional permits to settle on public land, such as &#8213;temporary licenses&#8214; in Nigeria or 
&#8213;permits to occupy&#8214; in francophone Africa.62 There is great diversity in the rights and level 
of security such permits offer. Such temporary allocations of public land offer needed 
housing with some security to those who occupy that land, in a context of scarcity of

</i></p>
<p><i>Inequality in the Cambodian Land Sector</i> (2009). 
 58 In C&#244;te d&#8216;Ivoire, land titling legislation makes it difficult for displaced persons to apply for 
</p>
<p>recognition of their rights. See Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, <i>Whose Land is This? Land 
Disputes and Forced Displacement in the Western Forest Area of C&#244;te d'Ivoire</i> (2009).

<p>urbanized land and housing. However, in cases of complete lack of alternative secure 
housing elsewhere, they can have detrimental effects, given the real threat of evictions with 
no or inadequate compensation and within an extremely short time frame.63 The issue is 
how to manage land in ways in which these temporary rights-holders are not left vulnerable 
to forced eviction and abuse, and are able to gain increased tenure security in the long term.  
</p>
<p>81. Conversely, such temporary permits could be a first step towards increased tenure 
security.64 For instance in Brazil, authorities can recognize, by way of leasehold rights to 
use and stay for an indefinite period, those individuals or communities who have settled on 
public land for at least five years&#8212;however these do not offer complete protection, as seen 
in the recent evictions of communities benefiting from such permits.65 
</p>
<p><b> D. Urban planning  
</b></p>
<p>82. Urban planning policies, laws and regulations can have a direct impact on 
strengthening tenure security, or, conversely, on increasing insecurity. Planning rules that 
often disregard cultural specificities and are based solely on the housing products offered to 
the upper classes or dominant groups, coupled with rigid and costly regulatory frameworks 
for how land and housing should be developed, often fail to meet the needs of the poor or of 
marginalized groups, putting formalization out of their reach and rendering them or their 
homes de facto illegal.  
</p>
<p>83. Non-compliance with planning laws thus becomes a common justification for the 
evictions of long-established communities, often minorities or informal settlers. This has 
been the case in Israel, whereby non-issuance of construction permits often leads to 
irregular construction and, in some cases, to eviction and demolition orders to the detriment 
of minorities.66 In Turkey, an urban rehabilitation project within the framework of a law 
regulating the protection and renovation of historical and cultural buildings led to the 
demolition of the historic Romani neighbourhood and the eviction of its inhabitants.67 
</p>
<p>84. Another issue is the lack of coherence and harmonization among the multiplicity of 
laws and regulations bearing upon urban security of tenure, leading to legal uncertainty, 
lack of implementation of key provisions, even unwanted impacts such as evictions.68 
Rights of adverse possession provided for by law might also be limited or denied by 
subsequent regulations, or in implementation.69 In addition, even when planning laws 
provide for the regularization of informal settlements, questions of sustainability relating to 
the increase of land prices and full availability of services remain.70

<p>85. Some innovative planning regulations exist to secure tenure for the most 
marginalized.71 A significant example is the Brazilian &#8213;Special Zones of Social Interest&#8214; 
(ZEIS).72 ZEIS is a planning instrument, based on the constitutional recognition of the 
social function of property,73 regulating the use and occupation, for social housing 
purposes, of public or private properties. It is used to recognize existing informal 
settlements as well as to define unoccupied areas of the city as areas for social housing.  
</p>
<p>86. Regulations on &#8213;inclusionary zoning&#8214;, which provide that any new city development 
must include &#8213;mixed types of housing&#8214;, including a minimum percentage for social 
housing, are another positive example. Several cities in Canada and the United States have 
adopted such measures, while they are also envisaged in planning legislations in Colombia, 
France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.74  
</p>
<p>87. Finally, an issue relevant to any planning is the role of planning policies and related 
institutions in supporting initiatives by communities of the urban poor and community-
driven upgrading.75 In many countries, urban poor associations have been very successful in 
gaining access to secure housing and land. However, community initiatives without clear 
government support can be limited to areas that are not contested (for example, of low land 
value) while communities supported can be vulnerable to evictions. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Recognizing and recording the diversity of tenure forms and rights  
</b></p>
<p>88. As mentioned in section II, development actors and Governments are increasingly 
moving towards more flexible and expansive ways of recording and recognizing tenure 
forms and tenure rights.76 Tools and approaches are being developed and implemented to 
that end. They often build upon existing practices or rights,77 and involve communities 
(such as participatory mapping).78 There are also legal instruments to recognize or 
regularize tenure rights, such as &#8213;adverse possession&#8214; in common law systems or the 
similar concept of &#8213;<i>usucapiao</i>&#8214; in Brazil.79  
</p>
<p>89. Questions remain as to the minimum conditions that these approaches should fulfil 
to ensure security of tenure, what type of institutional arrangements are required for 
implementation, and whether such approaches can be replicated in diverse contexts and at 
scale. This is particularly relevant to those forms of tenure that have received less attention

<p>and support in research, policy and practice, such as community land trusts, collective 
tenure models and cooperative ownership.80  
</p>
<p>90. Other forms that had a demonstrated ability to ensure secure tenure in the past, such 
as tenancy, should also be given renewed attention. Tenancy rates have decreased in many 
countries, and so has the security associated with them, as seen in some European countries 
for instance.81 In other countries, tenancy remains well-established,82 and in some the role 
of rental housing is attracting renewed attention,83 or being used in innovative ways to 
prevent homelessness.84  
</p>
<p>91. At a more fundamental level, there remains a tension between the obligation under 
international human rights law to confer security of tenure in law and approaches of de 
facto or administrative recognition.85 A related question is whether a form of tenure can be 
secured if not recorded at all.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Security of tenure in the aftermath of conflicts and disasters 
</b></p>
<p>92. Conflicts and natural disasters tend to exacerbate tenure insecurity for affected 
populations, in particular displaced persons, and heighten the risks of forced evictions.86 
Displacement resulting from conflict or disaster creates risks for forced evictions, 
confiscation, land grabs, abusive or fraudulent sale or occupation of land and housing.  
</p>
<p>93. In the aftermath of conflict or disaster, there is a real risk that existing discrimination 
on the basis of tenure status, gender or other grounds will be reinforced, thus preventing 
individuals from accessing aid, including temporary shelter and permanent housing with 
tenure security. The Special Rapporteur has highlighted the overemphasis placed on 
individual property owners and the associated difficulty to protect and support those with 
other forms of tenure, such as renters or those without formal documents over their land or 
housing. Women&#8216;s equal access to security of tenure is another concern, in a context of 
discriminatory access to land or housing (see A/66/270). 
</p>
<p>94. In addition, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation legislation, and 
measures such as planned relocation,87 natural hazard risk mapping and land zoning for 
residential housing, have been used to bypass eviction protections or may be phrased in a 
manner that could be misused to forcibly evict people.88  
</p>
<p>95. Progress has been made in recent years, with some humanitarian actors explicitly 
addressing issues of tenure for the most disadvantaged. For instance, several agencies have 
worked to record rights to housing and land at an early stage of displacement; to upgrade

<p>and regularize IDP settlements;89 and to support the most vulnerable through legal aid on 
housing, land and property issues, both in statutory and customary law contexts.90  
</p>
<p>96. Humanitarian actors and Governments addressing conflicts and natural disasters 
play an important role with respect to ensuring (or not) security of tenure. Temporary 
arrangements initiated or supported by humanitarian actors often have long-term impacts; 
the challenge is to ensure that these reinforce, rather than undermine, tenure security. 
Coordination between humanitarian and development actors is also essential to guarantee a 
coherent approach. The Special Rapporteur made recommendations in this regard in a 
previous report to the General Assembly (A/66/270). She believes those recommendations, 
together with work done by individual agencies,91 could serve as basis for further 
operational and strategic guidance. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Recognition and protection of security of tenure is one of the most compelling 
</b>challenges of today&#8217;s world and is fundamental to preventi<b>ng the most egregious 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of eviction, displacement and homelessness. Furthermore, security of tenure, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the cornerstone of the right to adequate housing, is essential for human dignity and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustain an adequate standard of living.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur has highlighted the complexity and multifaceted 
nature of security of tenure, both in practice and in law. While human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and courts at national, regional and international levels have primarily 
</b></p>
<p><b>focused on forced evictions, policies and practices pertaining to land tenure have 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken a fully different approach, with an emphasis at the start on securing tenure 
</b></p>
<p><b>through land titling programmes, based on the granting of property rights. The past 
</b></p>
<p><b>decade has seen some developments towards more flexible and encompassing 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches to recognize and protect various forms of tenure.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>This evolution, from a narrow focus on property rights towards a more 
expansive recognition of diverse forms of tenure and rights</b>&#8212;<b>while still uneven and 
</b></p>
<p><b>incomplete</b>&#8212;<b>is significant. There is a risk in relying on property rights as the means 
</b></p>
<p><b>by which to best secure tenure. Rather, security of tenure should be clearly articulated 
</b></p>
<p><b>and grounded in the international human rights framework and expressed in a variety 
</b></p>
<p><b>of tenure forms.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>An obvious need, confirmed by consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, 
is for more specific and comprehensive human rights guidance on security of tenure. 
</b></p>
<p><b>As shown in section III above, existing legal and policy guidance is incomplete and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sparse. Many questions remain as to the precise State obligations with respect to 
</b></p>
<p><b>conferring legal security of tenure, and the scope and content of security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international human rights law. In this regard it must be emphasized, however, 
</b></p>
<p><b>that people already have a right to security of tenure, as part of their human right to
