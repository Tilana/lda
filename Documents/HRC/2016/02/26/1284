<p><b>  26/&#8230;  Human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
   enterprises 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 8/7 of 18 June 2008, 17/4 of 6 July 
2011 and 21/5 of 27 September 2012, and Commission on Human Rights resolution 
2005/69 of 20 April 2005, on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>in particular</i> that the endorsement by consensus of the Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4 
established an authoritative framework to prevent and address adverse human rights risks 
and impacts of business activities, based on the three pillars of the United Nations &#8220;Protect, 
Respect and Remedy&#8221; framework,1 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that policies and proper regulation, including through national 
legislation, of transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and their 
responsible operation can contribute to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of and 
respect for human rights and assist in channelling the benefits of business towards 
contributing to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that weak national legislation and implementation cannot effectively 
mitigate the negative impact of globalization on vulnerable economies or derive maximally 
the benefits of activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and 
that further efforts to bridge governance gaps at the national, regional and international 
levels are necessary, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the efforts made to implement the Guiding Principles by some States, 
business enterprises, international organizations and members of civil society, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the valuable role played by civil society, including non-
governmental organizations, in promoting the implementation of the Guiding Principles and 
accountability for business-related human rights abuses and in raising awareness of the 
human rights impacts and risks of some business enterprises and activities, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the important role that national action plans and other such frameworks on 
business and human rights can play as a tool for promoting the comprehensive and effective 
implementation of the Guiding Principles, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> at legal and practical barriers to remedies for business-related human 
rights abuses, which may leave those aggrieved without opportunity for effective remedy, 
including through judicial and non-judicial avenues, and recognizing that it may be further 
considered whether relevant legal frameworks would provide more effective avenues of 
remedy for affected individuals and communities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the annual Forum on Business and Human Rights has grown in 
size and become a valuable opportunity for constructive global exchange of challenges, 
lessons learned and good practices in implementing the Guiding Principles by all relevant 
stakeholders, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the importance of building the capacity of Governments, business 
enterprises, civil society and other stakeholders to better prevent abuses, provide effective 
remedy and manage challenges in the area of business and human rights, and that the 
United Nations system has an important role to play in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the views and recommendations of the United Nations human rights treaty 
bodies, including the general comments bearing on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, such as general comment No. 16 
of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises in the fulfilment of its mandate,

other stakeholders in a regional context; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> that the effective implementation of the Guiding Principles

national action plans and other relevant initiatives, with annual reports on the 
implementation of such commitments, and invites all relevant stakeholders to submit 
relevant information to the Working Group; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the efforts of the Working Group to develop guidance for the 
development and implementation of effective national action plans, including with regard

</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages</i> the Working Group to identify and promote best practices in the 
national implementation of the Guiding Principles, and to reflect its findings, including in 
global progress on the implementation of the Guiding Principles, in its annual reports to the 
Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue the work on domestic law remedies to address corporate involvement in gross 
human rights abuses, and to organize consultations with experts, States and other relevant 
stakeholders and to present a progress report thereon to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-ninth session, and the final report thereon to the Council at its thirty-second session; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to launch an inclusive and transparent 
consultative process with States in 2015, open to other relevant stakeholders, to explore and 
facilitate the sharing of legal and practical measures to improve access to remedy, judicial 
and non-judicial, for victims of business-related abuses, including the benefits and 
limitations of a legally binding instrument, and to prepare a report thereon and to submit it 
to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-second session; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Welcomes</i> the role of the Working Group in guiding the first two annual 
Forums on Business and Human Rights, encourages all stakeholders to continue to attend 
the Forum, and decides that the two-day Forum should continue to be held on an annual 
basis, with the addition of one meeting day to allow for the preparation and sharing of new 
tools and experience; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to include as an item of the agenda of the 
Forum on Business and Human Rights the issue of access to remedy, judicial and non-
judicial, for victims of business-related human rights abuses, in order to achieve more 
effective access to judicial remedies; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Working Group on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises as set out in Human 
Rights Council resolution 17/4 for a period of three years; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Encourages</i> all States, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental

transmitted, and for States to reply favourably to requests for visits by the Working Group; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Invites</i> international and regional organizations to seek the views of the 
Working Group when formulating or developing relevant policies and instruments, and 
invites the Working Group to continue to collaborate closely with relevant United Nations 
bodies, including the treaty bodies and the special procedures; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all the 
resources and assistance necessary for the Working Group to fulfil its mandate effectively, </p>


<p>including for developing guidance for the implementation of the Guiding Principles and the 
organization of the Forum in a sustainable manner; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made by national human rights institutions to enhance

stakeholders;

<p>16. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the report of the Secretary-General on the challenges,
