<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human

</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti considers the 
</p>
<p>situation to be complex but not insuperable. Following his second mission to the country, in 
</p>
<p>July 2014, he reviews here the efforts made thus far to address the five human rights areas 
</p>
<p>identified in his previous report as warranting urgent action, namely: (a) illiteracy, (b) 
</p>
<p>prolonged pretrial detention, (c) elections, (d) redress for large-scale human rights 
</p>
<p>violations perpetrated in the past and (e) resettlement of the people displaced by the 2010 
</p>
<p>earthquake. 
</p>
<p> For each area, the Independent Expert identifies the problems observed and 
</p>
<p>proposes specific solutions. As a prerequisite for addressing these urgent human rights 
</p>
<p>matters, however, there must be strong political will on the part of the Government and the 
</p>
<p>international community, active involvement by civil society, consensus on the priority 
</p>
<p>problems to be addressed, focused coordination of work and perseverance in efforts to 
</p>
<p>attain the stated goals. 
</p>
<p> In December 2014, a new Prime Minister was appointed as a first step towards 
</p>
<p>clearing the impasse surrounding the holding of elections, which is one of the five areas 
</p>
<p>identified by the Independent Expert for priority action. Success on this front could bring 
</p>
<p>significant momentum to the efforts to improve the human rights situation in Haiti. The 
</p>
<p>early days of 2015 will be decisive in this regard.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to the statement of the President of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, of 28 March 2014, in which the Council invited the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti to undertake a mission to Haiti and to report 
</p>
<p>on that mission to the Council at its twenty-eighth session (A/HRC/PRST/25/1, para. 13). 
</p>
<p>2. In the President&#8217;s statement, the Council agreed to extend the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>mandate for one year (para. 9). Mr. Gustavo Gall&#243;n had been appointed in June 2013 and 
</p>
<p>took up his duties on 1 August 2013. The present report relates to the period from 15 April 
</p>
<p>to 31 December 2014 and contains recommendations for the Government of Haiti and the 
</p>
<p>international community. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert undertook a mission to Haiti from 15 to 22 July 2014, 
</p>
<p>followed by a series of meetings in New York from 22 to 25 July. In Haiti, he stayed in 
</p>
<p>Port-au-Prince and visited Aquin and Les Cayes in the Sud Department; he also participated 
</p>
<p>in a workshop on economic and social rights organized in C&#244;te des Arcadins by the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Human Rights and the Fight against Extreme Poverty. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert wishes to thank all those he met during his visit, especially 
</p>
<p>the Haitian authorities &#8212; who made the mission possible &#8212; and in particular the Minister 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights, who invited him to take part in the aforementioned workshop with 
</p>
<p>members of the Interministerial Committee for Human Rights. The workshop enabled the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert to appreciate first-hand the Committee&#8217;s efforts to bring together the 
</p>
<p>work done by different ministries with a view to developing a comprehensive human rights 
</p>
<p>policy, which is the starting point for coordinated governmental action in this sphere. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert also wishes to thank the President of the Senate, the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman, the Director General of the National Police, the Deputy Director of the 
</p>
<p>Prisons Administration, the Inspector General of the National Police, the Secretary of State 
</p>
<p>for Literacy, the Dean of the Court of First Instance in Aquin, the Government 
</p>
<p>Commissioner at the Court of First Instance in Aquin, the Police Commissioner and the 
</p>
<p>Clerk at the Aquin police station, the Dean of the Court of First Instance in Les Cayes, the 
</p>
<p>former Government Commissioner in Les Cayes, the Dean of the Court of First Instance in 
</p>
<p>Les C&#244;teaux, the Government Commissioner at the Court of First Instance in Les C&#244;teaux, 
</p>
<p>the alternate Government Commissioner at &#206;le-&#224;-Vache and the alternate Government 
</p>
<p>Commissioner at the Court of First Instance in Les Cayes. 
</p>
<p>6. The support received from the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti 
</p>
<p>(MINUSTAH) was instrumental in the success of this mission. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>wishes to express his appreciation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>as well as to her staff and all those working with her, in particular in the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Section, and all members of their teams for the able support they provided in Port-au-Prince 
</p>
<p>and on field visits and for the views they shared on the country situation. The Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert also wishes to thank the representatives of the United Nations funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes in Haiti and their teams for their support and for the information they 
</p>
<p>provided. 
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert wishes to thank as well the representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Organization of American States, through whose good offices he was able to meet with 
</p>
<p>members of the diplomatic corps to exchange views on the human rights situation in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>He also expresses his thanks to the ambassadors of the Group of Friends of Haiti with 
</p>
<p>whom he met in New York, hosted by the Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.15-02042 
</p>
<p>8. Lastly, the Independent Expert extends his sincere thanks to the many 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society organizations, political parties, journalists and members of 
</p>
<p>human rights NGOs in Port-au-Prince and the Sud Department with whom he met in Haiti 
</p>
<p>and in New York. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Five key aspects of the human rights situation in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p>9.  The Independent Expert presented his first report to the Human Rights Council in 
</p>
<p>March 2014, following his first mission to Haiti from 23 September to 1 October 2013. In 
</p>
<p>that report, he pointed to the profound inequalities in Haitian society as the underlying 
</p>
<p>cause of the critical human rights situation in the country and drew attention to five key 
</p>
<p>aspects that required urgent action: (a) the extremely precarious economic situation of the 
</p>
<p>majority of the population; (b) inhumane conditions in prisons; (c) very weak government 
</p>
<p>institutions; (d) continued impunity for serious human rights violations committed in the 
</p>
<p>past and still awaiting resolution; and (e) other factors, including a succession of natural 
</p>
<p>disasters and other events that are complicating the task of guaranteeing human rights both 
</p>
<p>now and for the future. 
</p>
<p>10. Far from being new, these five aspects have been present for many years and are the 
</p>
<p>result of an accumulation of developments within the country as well as internationally. 
</p>
<p>They have been identified in the numerous substantive analyses conducted by the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert&#8217;s predecessors, which he endorses and which show that these five key 
</p>
<p>aspects require urgent action inasmuch as they are at the root of continued serious 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights. Furthermore, from a structural viewpoint they undermine the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by Haitian society as a whole and must be addressed and 
</p>
<p>resolved once and for all. 
</p>
<p>11. While the human rights situation in Haiti is complex, the Independent Expert does 
</p>
<p>not feel it is insurmountable. This assessment, which he expressed already in his first 
</p>
<p>report, is based on the Haitian population&#8217;s vast capacity for work, their perseverance and 
</p>
<p>desire for freedom, and the country&#8217;s rich natural-resource base, despite the many trials and 
</p>
<p>tribulations faced by this brave nation throughout history. 
</p>
<p>12. To tackle the country&#8217;s critical human rights situation, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>proposes a set of emergency measures, or &#8220;shock treatment&#8221;, to jump-start changes in the 
</p>
<p>most acute areas of these five aspects, namely: (a) eradicating illiteracy; (b) resolving, as a 
</p>
<p>matter of urgency, all cases of persons being held in pretrial detention; (c) ensuring 
</p>
<p>transparency and credibility in the holding of the elections; (d) guaranteeing redress for the 
</p>
<p>large-scale and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated in the past; and (e) 
</p>
<p>resettling in suitable, long-term housing all of the people displaced by the 2010 earthquake 
</p>
<p>and subsequent disasters who are still living in camps. 
</p>
<p>13. These measures are necessary for three reasons: first, to end the serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations that would otherwise continue to be committed against thousands of 
</p>
<p>people; secondly, to send a clear message to the Haitian people and the international 
</p>
<p>community of the firm commitment to remedy the country&#8217;s human rights situation; and 
</p>
<p>lastly, to open the way for full implementation of the recommendations made by 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms over the past 30 years. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>stands ready to assist in this undertaking. 
</p>
<p>14. The Independent Expert&#8217;s second mission to Haiti focused on observing 
</p>
<p>developments in these five key aspects, and particularly the five elements identified during 
</p>
<p>his first mission. </p>


<p>GE.15-02042 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>15. In line with the guidance provided by the Human Rights Council with regard to his 
</p>
<p>mandate (A/HRC/PRST/25/1, paras. 10&#8211;12), the Independent Expert has proposed that the 
</p>
<p>Government organize a workshop to identify the causes of inequality that are undermining 
</p>
<p>human rights in Haiti and ways to overcome them. The workshop would be intended for 
</p>
<p>key national and international stakeholders, Government representatives, members of the 
</p>
<p>Interministerial Committee for Human Rights, the Office of the Ombudsman and 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society. The previous Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>human rights would also take part, as would two other experts from intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations active in the area of inequality. The Independent Expert hopes that, subject to 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s agreement, the workshop can be held in early 2015 and that it will lead to 
</p>
<p>a strengthening of programmes already under way as well as new initiatives to tackle the 
</p>
<p>inequality that underlies the human rights crisis in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>16. Prior to the Independent Expert&#8217;s second mission, a number of international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments were incorporated into Haitian legislation, including the two Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Government has also launched 
</p>
<p>the ratification process for a number of other instruments, such as the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
</p>
<p>Families; the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons; and the Second 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has signed the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of 
</p>
<p>Intolerance and the Inter-American Convention against All Forms of Discrimination and 
</p>
<p>Intolerance.  
</p>
<p>17. Haiti has submitted its midterm report under the universal periodic review and, after 
</p>
<p>nationwide consultation with civil society and final review by the Interministerial 
</p>
<p>Committee for Human Rights, has finalized its periodic report for submission to the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>18. Haiti has also adopted legislation on paternity, maternity and filiation; an anti-
</p>
<p>corruption law; a law against human trafficking; and an adoption reform law.  
</p>
<p>19. The Minister for Human Rights has prepared a draft plan of action to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights in Haiti, and the draft is being discussed at national consultation 
</p>
<p>workshops. This is a unique opportunity to include in the plan of action the urgent priority 
</p>
<p>measures recommended for the five areas identified in the Independent Expert&#8217;s report.  
</p>
<p>20. On 8 October 2014, the Human Rights Committee met with a high-level delegation 
</p>
<p>of the Government of Haiti to review the country&#8217;s report on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by Haiti in 1991. 
</p>
<p>This was the initial report from Haiti; it was to have been submitted in 1996.  
</p>
<p>21. The Committee welcomed a number of positive developments, in such areas as 
</p>
<p>decisions taken (e.g., the appointment of a Minister for Human Rights), national legislation 
</p>
<p>adopted (e.g., on the inclusion of disabled persons) and accession to or ratification of 
</p>
<p>various international human rights instruments (CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, paras. 3 and 4). At the 
</p>
<p>same time, the Committee noted four areas of special concern and requested the 
</p>
<p>Government to provide additional information within a year. Those areas were: (a) the slow 
</p>
<p>pace of the investigation into the Jean-Claude Duvalier case and the lack of reparation for 
</p>
<p>the victims of serious human rights violations imputed to him; (b) the continued 
</p>
<p>occurrence, which showed an increase in 2014, of firearm-related deaths caused by the 
</p>
<p>forces of law and order; (c) allegations of threats, harassment and intimidation against 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, journalists and members of the opposition; and (d) the denial of the </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.15-02042 
</p>
<p>right of Haitian citizens to vote and be elected in regular elections since 2011 (paras. 7, 10, 
</p>
<p>19 and 20). 
</p>
<p>22. The Committee also expressed concern about the following matters: incorporation of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into national law and its 
</p>
<p>applicability in Haitian courts; the small budget assigned to the Office of the Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>and the shortage of information on the implementation of its recommendations; gender 
</p>
<p>equality; discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people; the 
</p>
<p>withdrawal from the parliament&#8217;s agenda of the bill to ratify the Second Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>to the Covenant, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty; the Criminal Code&#8217;s definition 
</p>
<p>of torture, which does not include psychological torture; violence against women, in 
</p>
<p>particular rape; human trafficking, especially of child domestic workers; the situation of 
</p>
<p>persons deprived of their liberty, especially those in prolonged pretrial detention; the 
</p>
<p>dilatoriness and passive stance of the judicial system; interference by the executive and 
</p>
<p>legislative branches in judicial decisions and the weak operating capacity of the High 
</p>
<p>Council of the Judiciary; and the ongoing forced evictions of persons living in refugee 
</p>
<p>camps (CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, paras. 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11&#8211;18). 
</p>
<p>23. The Committee&#8217;s observations and recommendations are highly pertinent. Many of 
</p>
<p>them are considered, by the Independent Expert and others, to warrant urgent priority 
</p>
<p>action, in particular those concerning prolonged pretrial detention, the holding of elections, 
</p>
<p>and the right to know the truth and to reparation and justice for victims of serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations in the past. The urgency attached to these matters should be taken into 
</p>
<p>special account by the Haitian authorities. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government has expressed reservations about some of the Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>observations and recommendations, namely with regard to the Office of the Ombudsman, 
</p>
<p>violence against women (rape), independence of the judiciary, protection of persons 
</p>
<p>displaced by the earthquake, alleged violations of the freedom of opinion, expression, 
</p>
<p>assembly and association, and participation in political affairs.1 While respecting the right 
</p>
<p>of Haiti to express its opinion on these matters, the Independent Expert invites the 
</p>
<p>Government to use the recommendations of the Committee and other relevant bodies to 
</p>
<p>strengthen safeguards and respect for human rights in its territory and to identify any 
</p>
<p>obstacles it encounters in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Economic, social and cultural rights and social inequality  
</b></p>
<p>25. As noted in the previous report, the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights in Haiti is severely limited by the country&#8217;s acute social inequalities. 
</p>
<p><b> (i) Priority action to eradicate illiteracy 
</b></p>
<p>26. To tackle this situation of inequality, the Independent Expert had recommended that 
</p>
<p>priority be given to ensuring the right to a quality education for all, without exception. The 
</p>
<p>country should therefore focus all available resources on promptly eradicating illiteracy, 
</p>
<p>which plagues more than half of the adult population. The literacy rate among Haitians 
</p>
<p>aged 15 and older stands at 48.7 per cent according to the United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Programme (UNDP).2 
</p>

</p>
<p>table refers to the year 2013 although this is not indicated in the heading. </p>


<p>GE.15-02042 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>27. Reducing inequality takes time and will require structural programmes that go 
</p>
<p>beyond just providing social assistance. In the meantime, steps must be taken urgently to 
</p>
<p>close the literacy gap, as knowing how to read and write is crucial to a life with dignity and 
</p>
<p>to the exercise of most rights, such as the right to education, which in turn gives access to 
</p>
<p>such other rights as the right to work, to food, to housing and to health. 
</p>
<p>28. According to UNDP figures,3 5,294,000 Haitians &#8212; out of a total population of 
</p>
<p>10,320,000 &#8212; are illiterate. The Office of the Secretary of State for Literacy has indicated 
</p>
<p>to the Independent Expert a figure on the order of 3.5 million illiterate Haitians. A two-year 
</p>
<p>campaign supported by Latin American and Caribbean cooperation assistance is currently 
</p>
<p>under way to teach 450,000 people how to read and write.  
</p>
<p>29. Without wishing to diminish that campaign&#8217;s importance, at the rate indicated it 
</p>
<p>would take at least 15 years (or 23 years, according to the UNDP figures) to eradicate 
</p>
<p>illiteracy, and that does not take into account future population growth. Urgent action to 
</p>
<p>address this problem should include a major boost in the human and financial resources 
</p>
<p>allocated to achieving this goal in order to cut significantly the time needed to teach all 
</p>
<p>Haitians how to read and write. 
</p>
<p>30. The authorities responsible for improving literacy in Haiti have shared with the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert their concern that the literacy campaign focuses exclusively on Creole 
</p>
<p>and does not include French, the country&#8217;s other official language. As French is the 
</p>
<p>language used in all administrative, legal and other official matters, an additional effort is 
</p>
<p>needed to make sure that people who learn to read and write in Creole can also understand 
</p>
<p>written French, thus helping to guarantee the realization of Haitian citizens&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert encourages the Government of Haiti to step up its effort to 
</p>
<p>eradicate illiteracy as soon as possible in order to lay a solid foundation for the realization 
</p>
<p>of human rights in the country. He further invites the entire international community to 
</p>
<p>support this effort and to coordinate international cooperation with the Government in this 
</p>
<p>area as a matter of the highest importance.  
</p>
<p><b> (ii) Other aspects of economic, social and cultural rights that merit particular attention  
</b></p>
<p>32. In the Independent Expert&#8217;s previous report, it was stated that the majority of 
</p>
<p>Haitians lived in conditions of extreme poverty. A full 76 per cent of the population earned 
</p>
<p>less than US$2 per day, and 60 per cent earned less than US$1 per day. Unemployment 
</p>
<p>stood at 60 per cent. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) for Haiti was calculated at 23.2, 
</p>
<p>placing it in the category of &#8220;alarming&#8221;. More than 44 per cent of the population suffered 
</p>
<p>from malnutrition. Nearly 75 per cent of households were located in slums,4 which meant 
</p>
<p>that the right to housing is not a reality for the majority of Haitians (and that situation has 
</p>
<p>worsened since the earthquake in 2010). The right to health was similarly not guaranteed, 
</p>
<p>with 60 per cent of the population lacking access to basic health care, according to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF); that situation, too, had worsened since the 
</p>
<p>cholera epidemic. Lastly, the right to education was not enjoyed by all: UNICEF figures 
</p>
<p>showed that almost half of the country&#8217;s boys and girls did not attend school and only 2 per 
</p>
<p>cent of children of school age completed secondary education.5 
</p>
<p>33. The Government has deployed considerable efforts to tackle these situations of 
</p>
<p>extreme vulnerability, including through a national programme to combat hunger and 
</p>

<p>malnutrition and a national social assistance programme aimed at improving living 
</p>
<p>conditions.6 
</p>
<p>34. These programmes are part of the Strategic Development Plan for Haiti, which is 
</p>
<p>built around five priorities: (a) education and human and social development (access to 
</p>
<p>education, health, social services and culture, and better quality of habitat); (b) the 
</p>
<p>environment and land use; (c) the economy and employment; (d) energy; and (e) the rule of 
</p>
<p>law and democracy. The Government is aiming to halve the number of people suffering 
</p>
<p>from hunger by the end of 2016 and to eradicate hunger and malnutrition fully by 2025.  
</p>
<p>35. According to a report on the status of attainment of the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals in Haiti, co-authored by the National Observatory on Poverty and Social Exclusion 
</p>
<p>and UNDP, Haiti has made significant progress against most of the indicators and has 
</p>
<p>achieved all (or almost all) of its targets. In particular, underweight in children under 5 has 
</p>
<p>been halved, extreme poverty has been reduced to 24 per cent, infant mortality has fallen by 
</p>
<p>44 per cent since 1990, maternal mortality has dropped to 157 per 100,000, the HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>epidemic has been stabilized and 64.8 per cent of households now have access to an 
</p>
<p>improved drinking-water source. Haiti is still among the countries receiving the most 
</p>
<p>attention from the international community, with a leap in official development assistance 
</p>
<p>following the 2010 earthquake.7 
</p>
<p>36. The same report observes that many challenges remain, and the progress made in 
</p>
<p>some sectors is still too limited to have a major impact on development and poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction.8 Among those challenges, the report mentions inequality, low income levels (45 
</p>
<p>per cent of workers live on less than US$1.25 per day), unequal gender representation in the 
</p>
<p>parliament (women account for only 4 per cent) and the lack of measures to combat 
</p>
<p>deforestation and the loss of biodiversity. 
</p>
<p>37. With respect to inequality in particular, the human development index (HDI) for 
</p>
<p>Haiti rose from 0.456 in 2012 to 0.471 in 2013, leaving it in 168th place among the 187 
</p>
<p>countries and territories surveyed.9 When this index is adjusted for the inequalities affecting 
</p>
<p>the poorest of the poor, who are deprived of health, education and dignity, it drops to 0.285 
</p>
<p>(which is a slight improvement over 2012, when it stood at 0.273).10 According to UNDP, 
</p>
<p>the HDI can be viewed as an index of &#8220;potential&#8221; human development and the inequality-
</p>
<p>adjusted human development index (IHDI) as an index of &#8220;actual&#8221; human development. 
</p>
<p>The loss in potential human development caused by inequality is the difference between the 
</p>
<p>HDI and the IHDI, and can be expressed as a percentage.11

<p>38. A further disparity appears in the gender inequality index, which reflects gender-
</p>
<p>based inequalities in three areas: reproductive health, empowerment and economic activity. 
</p>
<p>In 2013, Haiti had a gender inequality index rating of 0.599, which was a modest 
</p>
<p>improvement over the 0.592 recorded in 2012. Even so, it still leaves the country in 132nd 
</p>
<p>place in 2013, as compared with 127th in 2012.12 
</p>
<p>39. The Independent Expert wishes to reiterate the hope he expressed in his first report 
</p>
<p>that the social assistance programmes and the 2014&#8211;2016 Poverty Reduction Action Plan 
</p>
<p>will be able to meet the basic needs of the majority of the population. It is also his hope that 
</p>
<p>they will help to identify the factors perpetuating the deep social inequalities besetting 
</p>
<p>Haitian society so that they can be neutralized as soon as possible through policies that 
</p>
<p>ensure decent living conditions for all. 
</p>
<p><b>  B. Deprivation of liberty and detention conditions 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Priority action to address prolonged pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>40. A second area that requires urgent action is the practice of prolonged pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention. More than 70 per cent of prisoners in Haiti are deprived of their liberty for years 
</p>
<p>without appearing before a judge.13 For some of these individuals, the time spent in pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention is longer than the sentence that might be handed down if they were convicted. 
</p>
<p>This practice is clearly contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>which stipulates in its article 9, paragraph 3, that anyone arrested or detained on a criminal 
</p>
<p>charge is to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to 
</p>
<p>exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release. It 
</p>
<p>is therefore crucial that steps be taken to ensure that persons held in prolonged pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention are either tried or released within a reasonable period of time. This perverse 
</p>
<p>judicial practice must be halted. 
</p>
<p>41. Urgent action must be taken at the national level so that cases can be brought to trial 
</p>
<p>or other solutions found for most of the 7,500 people who are being held in pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention in the country&#8217;s seriously overcrowded detention facilities, which currently house 
</p>
<p>over 10,500 prisoners.14 
</p>
<p>42. As indicated in the Independent Expert&#8217;s previous report, the authorities are aware 
</p>
<p>that this situation is not new and it is due in part to the shortage of investigating judges 
</p>
<p>available to hear the cases of detainees. Aside from their insufficient numbers, these judges 
</p>
<p>do not devote enough time to dealing with cases. According to the same sources, some

</p>
<p> 13 According to conversations with the Chief Commissioner of the Prisons Administration, this figure 
</p>
<p>can reach or even exceed 80 per cent. At 31 October 2014, 72 per cent of the people in custody were 
</p>
<p>awaiting trial (79 per cent of them were minors and 81 per cent were women), according to the 
</p>
<p>MINUSTAH correctional unit. The International Centre for Prison Studies estimates that some 70.6 
</p>
<p>per cent of prisoners were in pretrial detention in August 2013 (www.prisonstudies.org/country/Haiti, 
</p>
<p>consulted on 26 January 2015).  
</p>
<p> 14 As at 31 October 2014, according to the MINUSTAH correctional unit, out of 10,508 prisoners, 7,578 
</p>
<p>were in pretrial detention.  </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.15-02042 
</p>
<p>judges spend a disproportionate amount of time giving classes or looking after personal 
</p>
<p>affairs.  
</p>
<p>43. Various steps could be taken to keep this problem from getting worse. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert has been informed that, on the instruction of the prosecutor&#8217;s office, a 
</p>
<p>committee has been set up to monitor the situation of detentions in Les Cayes (Sud 
</p>
<p>Department). The committee sits once a week to review the cases of persons being held in 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention and orders releases as applicable. 
</p>
<p>44. Other measures relating to the administration of justice should be implemented at 
</p>
<p>the national level. Currently, investigating judges cannot be reappointed immediately upon 
</p>
<p>expiry of their mandate because they have to wait months to be issued a certificate of good 
</p>
<p>conduct so that the Ministry of Justice can reappoint them. This practice paralyses the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice as over 100 investigating judges are presently unable to investigate 
</p>
<p>or preside in cases of persons being held in prolonged pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>45. This procedure could be organized differently such that certification would be ready 
</p>
<p>before expiry of their mandate. That way, judges could be reappointed without any 
</p>
<p>interruption in their work. 
</p>
<p>46. The Independent Expert wishes to repeat the recommendation made to the 
</p>
<p>authorities in his previous report that a small group of judges, assisted by law students in 
</p>
<p>their final year of studies, should be appointed for a set period of time to examine the cases 
</p>
<p>of prolonged pretrial detention and take a decision on them. Some high-ranking officials are 
</p>
<p>aware of the situation and are working on possible solutions. The Minister for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights informed the Independent Expert that she had asked the Minister of Justice to reopen 
</p>
<p>before the end of October 2013 the office responsible for monitoring prolonged pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention. That request should be made again. 
</p>
<p>47. As indicated above, the urgent need to address the matter of pretrial detention had 
</p>
<p>also been identified by the Human Rights Committee. In its concluding observations on the 
</p>
<p>initial report of Haiti, the Committee recommended that the State party should ensure that 
</p>
<p>all persons who are arrested and detained enjoy the effective right to habeas corpus. It 
</p>
<p>should also encourage courts to promote alternatives to deprivation of liberty for indicted 
</p>
<p>persons, taking into account the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-
</p>
<p>custodial Measures. It should take urgent steps to address the situation of persons who have 
</p>
<p>been in pretrial detention for many years in a way which will directly help reduce prison 
</p>
<p>overcrowding. The State party should also take appropriate action to ensure the separation 
</p>
<p>of remand and convicted prisoners and of adults and minors (CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, para. 15). 
</p>
<p><b> (ii) Other aspects concerning detention conditions  
</b></p>
<p>48. The country&#8217;s places of detention have a combined capacity to hold only 4,000 
</p>
<p>prisoners.15 They are extremely overcrowded16 and do not offer decent living conditions.17 
</p>
<p>This constitutes inhumane, cruel and degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 Based on information provided by the Prisons Administration. According to the International Centre 
</p>
<p>for Prison Studies, the capacity stood at 5,958 as at 1 August 2014. Available from 
</p>
<p>www.prisonstudies.org/country/Haiti (consulted on 26 January 2015). 
</p>
<p> 16 According to the MINUSTAH correctional unit, there were 10,508 prisoners as at 31 October 2014. 
</p>
<p>According to the Prisons Administration, 10,161 were registered as at 29 June 2014.  
</p>
<p> 17 The Prisons Administration in Haiti has set itself a target of providing each detainee with 2.5 square 
</p>
<p>metres, which would mean that the official capacity of the country&#8217;s prisons is 2,383 persons. 
According to the United Nations, the target should be 4.5 square metres, which would give an official 
</p>
<p>capacity of 1,324 persons. </p>


<p>GE.15-02042 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>49. The occupancy rate is 794 per cent of maximum capacity in the five most 
</p>
<p>overcrowded prisons; that works out to 0.57 square metres per person (the standard is 4.5 
</p>
<p>square metres per prisoner). Fort-Libert&#233; and Port-au-Prince have even higher rates, with 
</p>
<p>almost three persons per square metre.18 
</p>
<p>50. The prison in Les Cayes, in the Sud Department, has capacity for 100 persons. It 
</p>
<p>currently holds 610 prisoners (474 &#8220;on remand&#8221; and 136 convicted, of whom 132 were 
</p>
<p>men, 3 were women and 1 was a minor), according to information provided to the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert by the former government commissioner on 19 July 2014.19 
</p>
<p>51. In the municipality of Aquin, also in the Sud Department, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>visited the police station, which is used as a place of detention. The prisoners were divided 
</p>
<p>among five cells: in one, there were three women; in another, there were two minors (who 
</p>
<p>should not have been in custody); and in the remaining three, there were more adults than 
</p>
<p>the space was designed to hold. 
</p>
<p>52. The judicial authorities in Aquin asked the Independent Expert to report that a 
</p>
<p>detention facility is needed in that municipality and also in Les C&#244;teaux, because convicted 
</p>
<p>prisoners from these two places are confined in the prison in Les Cayes.  
</p>
<p>53. Sanitation conditions in places of detention are inadequate. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>observed a lack of privacy and appropriate sanitation at the Aquin police station, including 
</p>
<p>the absence of sewage drains. Similar situations had been found in the Port-au-Prince and 
</p>
<p>Jacmel prisons during the previous mission.  
</p>
<p>54. As stated in the previous report, the national prison in Port-au-Prince, which is 
</p>
<p>located in the town centre, will be demolished to make way for urban redevelopment. It is 
</p>
<p>not yet known where the prisoners will be transferred, and this has generated concern.  
</p>
<p>55. Detention centres do not offer conditions that allow prisoners to work or study. The 
</p>
<p>Prisons Administration is responsible for providing medical services and food but often 
</p>
<p>does not have the funds or service agreements in place to ensure the supply of these 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p>56. The Independent Expert is compelled to repeat the call made to the Haitian 
</p>
<p>authorities in his previous report concerning the need to improve significantly the 
</p>
<p>conditions in detention centres and, in particular, to improve health services, ensure 
</p>
<p>availability of food and health care, provide settings that allow prisoners to work or study 
</p>
<p>and add a more humane dimension to living quarters and recreational areas. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Weak rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>57. Because of the weak rule of law, the people of Haiti face uncertainty in many 
</p>
<p>spheres of their basic rights, including property registration, access to justice and 
</p>
<p>government services, and the holding of elections.  
</p>
<p><b> (i) Priority action to ensure the right to participation in public life 
</b></p>
<p>58. The right of citizens to vote and to be elected to office has been flouted all too often 
</p>
<p>in Haiti. As unclear electoral rules have repercussions that go to the very core of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s institutional structure, a solution is needed urgently. In his previous report, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert noted that parliamentary and municipal elections should have been held 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 According to data provided by the MINUSTAH Human Rights Section on 31 October 2014.  
</p>
<p> 19 As at 31 October 2014, there were 683 prisoners (548 &#8220;on remand&#8221; and 135 convicted), according to 
the MINUSTAH Human Rights Section. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.15-02042 
</p>
<p>in 2012 but, as of December 2013, no date had yet been set. Similar observations had been 
</p>
<p>made by previous Independent Experts. In 2006, for instance, Louis Joinet stated that, at the 
</p>
<p>time of completion of his report, he was unaware, owing to repeated deferrals, of the date 
</p>
<p>and under what political circumstances the elections would be held (E/CN.4/2006/115, 
</p>
<p>para. 79).  
</p>
<p>59. During his July 2014 mission, the Independent Expert saw progress in the fact that 
</p>
<p>the Government had set a date of 26 October 2014 for the first round of parliamentary and 
</p>
<p>local elections and 28 December for the second round. These elections had been postponed 
</p>
<p>several times since 2011. A number of concerns, however, led him to wonder if the 
</p>
<p>elections could in fact take place on those dates. For instance, the parliament would need to 
</p>
<p>enact electoral legislation before the end of the legislature on the second Monday of 
</p>
<p>September 2014; the make-up of the provisional Electoral Board was being contested by six 
</p>
<p>opposition parties; and the logistical preparations for the elections would take 120 days as 
</p>
<p>from the promulgation of the electoral act.  
</p>
<p>60. Those doubts were confirmed when 26 October came and went and no elections 
</p>
<p>were held. The Government announced that the Senate had not taken a decision on the draft 
</p>
<p>electoral legislation approved by the Chamber of Deputies and that the elections would be 
</p>
<p>held in 2015 pursuant to regulations that would be issued in a presidential decree.  
</p>
<p>61. Many observers had forecast that the Senate would not be able to adopt an electoral 
</p>
<p>law given the body&#8217;s calendar and, in particular, because only two thirds of the Senate seats 
</p>
<p>were occupied; the terms of the remaining third had expired and not been renewed in the 
</p>
<p>absence of legislative elections. With the terms of another third of the senators and a 
</p>
<p>number of members of the Chamber of Deputies coming to an end in January 2015, that 
</p>
<p>means there will no longer be a parliament at that point and the Government would take the 
</p>
<p>place of the legislature by way of presidential decrees until such time as elections are held. 
</p>
<p>Such a scenario presents a grave danger for democratic rule. 
</p>
<p>62. Political confrontation has always been a highly sensitive issue in Haiti and it 
</p>
<p>continues to be so. It is thus all the more urgent that the competing political forces reach 
</p>
<p>agreement on a set of ground rules so that elections can be called.  
</p>
<p>63. The urgency of addressing this situation, as expressed by the Independent Expert, is 
</p>
<p>echoed by the Human Rights Committee, which has recommended to the State party that it 
</p>
<p>take, as a matter of highest priority, the necessary measures to organize the legislative and 
</p>
<p>municipal elections that were to have been held in 2011 so as to guarantee effective access 
</p>
<p>to citizens&#8217; rights under article 25 of the Covenant (CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, para. 20). 
</p>
<p>64. The consultative commission appointed by the President to find a solution to the 
</p>
<p>election impasse recommended on 8 December 2014 that a new government be formed 
</p>
<p>with participation of the opposition parties. &#201;vans Paul was subsequently named Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister on 25 December 2014. The commission also recommended that the President of 
</p>
<p>the High Council of the Judiciary and the members of the provisional Electoral Council all 
</p>
<p>step down; that was expected to happen in early January 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> (ii) Other elements of the rule of law that need to be guaranteed 
</b></p>
<p>65. In his previous report, the Independent Expert identified a number of other areas 
</p>
<p>where the weak rule of law was evident and where a concerted effort was required to 
</p>
<p>strengthen it. These areas include the need for a reliable property registration system; the 
</p>
<p>need for judges to be allowed adequate time to handle matters in their remit; deteriorating 
</p>
<p>respect for the right to life, which casts doubts on the executive branch&#8217;s ability to protect 
</p>
<p>this right and draws attention to the judiciary&#8217;s passive stance vis-&#224;-vis these violent crimes 
</p>
<p>(including those imputed to State actors, sexual violence and attacks against human rights </p>

</b></p>
<p>defenders); and the continued exploitation of children sent to live with and work for host 
</p>
<p>families. 
</p>
<p>66. During the July 2014 mission, the Independent Expert noticed a lack of public 
</p>
<p>confidence in the administration of justice. It was especially striking among people whose 
</p>
<p>land had been expropriated to expand the airport at Les Cayes; some 200 families cited 
</p>
<p>various problems linked mainly to indemnification for their land. The specific complaints 
</p>
<p>included: (a) the indemnification process was slow, not transparent and discriminatory; (b) 
</p>
<p>for the small number of families having received compensation, the value was limited to the 
</p>
<p>land expropriated and did not cover other property, and the amounts were significantly 
</p>
<p>below the market value; (c) no compensation had yet been paid for expropriated dwellings; 
</p>
<p>and (d) families receiving compensation for their land were notified by the authorities to 
</p>
<p>move immediately without yet having received any indemnity for their homes. The right to 
</p>
<p>own property is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 17) and the 
</p>
<p>1987 Constitution of Haiti (chapter II, section H); in cases of public interest or eminent 
</p>
<p>domain, laws and procedures are in place that govern when and how a person&#8217;s right to own 
</p>
<p>property may be denied. The right to housing is also a basic right and it must be respected if 
</p>
<p>the home of some of these families is expropriated without indemnity. The right to housing 
</p>
<p>is set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (arts. 22 and 25), the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 11) and the 1987 Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Haiti (art. 22). Subsequent to the Independent Expert&#8217;s mission, a high-level delegation 
</p>
<p>consisting of the Secretary of State for Public Works, two advisers to the Prime Minister, 
</p>
<p>the Sud Departmental Finance Director and the Director of the Antoine Simon airport in 
</p>
<p>Les Cayes met with those landowners and pledged to follow up so that the indemnification 
</p>
<p>process could move forward to everyone&#8217;s benefit and construction work could begin 
</p>
<p>without further delay.  
</p>
<p>67. The Independent Expert continued to receive reports of acts of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>threats against the two co-directors of the non-governmental organization KOFAVIV, 
</p>
<p>which works to prevent sexual violence. The children of Malya Villard-Appolon and of 
</p>
<p>Eramithe Delva were the target of an attempted kidnapping in 2013. In February 2014, a 
</p>
<p>woman was arrested on suspicion of having taken part in that attempt; and in May 2014, a 
</p>
<p>man was arrested on charges of having threatened Mrs. Villard-Appolon with a firearm in 
</p>
<p>October 2013. A member of KOFAVIV who had identified the female suspect to the police 
</p>
<p>reportedly received death threats and was forced to move away from her neighbourhood. 
</p>
<p>Since March 2014, Mrs. Villard-Appolon and Mrs. Delva have been receiving threatening 
</p>
<p>telephone calls and, on 28 April 2014, several shots were fired at the organization&#8217;s offices. 
</p>
<p>The two co-directors of KOFAVIV have had to leave the country out of fear for their lives. 
</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s lawyer, Julio Hyacinthe, and its gender and communications officer, 
</p>
<p>Georjhy Desire, have also reportedly received telephone threats, according to complaints 
</p>
<p>lodged with the Judiciary Police on 22 May and 11 June 2014. 
</p>
<p>68. Building a strong rule of law is a challenge but it is also an urgent need in Haiti. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert wishes to reiterate the suggestion made at the time of his first mission 
</p>
<p>that a workshop should be organized, led by an expert in the rule of law, to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>work of civil society and the Government, in particular the Interministerial Committee for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, under the guidance of the Minister for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Past human rights violations and impunity  
</b></p>
<p>69. A fourth critical area is the matter of impunity, which is of special concern in Haiti 
</p>
<p>and relates to all types of crime. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.15-02042 
</p>
<p><b> (i) Priority action to provide redress for human rights violations committed in the past 
</b></p>
<p>70. Impunity is especially blatant in connection with the large-scale, systematic and 
</p>
<p>serious violations of human rights committed in the past. Urgent action must be taken to 
</p>
<p>give effect to the victims&#8217; right to know the truth, right to justice and right to reparation.  
</p>
<p>71. On 20 February 2014, a three-judge appellate court sitting in Port-au-Prince 
</p>
<p>overturned a lower-court ruling that had not allowed complaints brought by individuals 
</p>
<p>whose human rights had been violated by the former dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier. In 
</p>
<p>January 2012, an investigating judge had ordered Mr. Duvalier to appear before a 
</p>
<p>magistrate&#8217;s court on charges only of misappropriation of public funds; all the other charges 
</p>
<p>were rejected, including those for crimes against humanity, murder and torture. The 
</p>
<p>appellate court reproached the investigating judge for not having interviewed all the 
</p>
<p>complainants and it affirmed that crimes against humanity form an integral part of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s legal system and are imprescriptible. The appellate court accordingly ordered a 
</p>
<p>new investigation that was to identify all the parties involved, including all those complicit 
</p>
<p>in the crimes imputed to Mr. Duvalier. 
</p>
<p>72. Although this was a landmark decision in that it ordered a follow-up investigation to 
</p>
<p>remedy a denial of justice that had occurred at a lower-court level, the actual impact has 
</p>
<p>been very limited. The new investigation was launched in mid-May 2014, but Jean-Claude 
</p>
<p>Duvalier died six months later, on 4 October, without any formal charges being filed 
</p>
<p>against him. The investigating judge had not been able to interview more than one 
</p>
<p>complainant a week inasmuch as he had not been relieved of any of his other caseload and 
</p>
<p>he had not been assigned an investigative team and clerk in order to be able to devote 
</p>
<p>himself entirely to the Duvalier case. 
</p>
<p>73. As these crimes against humanity were perpetrated over a period of 15 years, the 
</p>
<p>justice system should have been aware of them since the end of the regime some 28 years 
</p>
<p>ago. With over two dozen complainants and various other parties and witnesses to be 
</p>
<p>interviewed, the Duvalier case deserved the investigating judge&#8217;s undivided attention, and 
</p>
<p>he should have been afforded a guarantee of independence, heightened security and 
</p>
<p>additional human, physical and financial resources in order to properly conduct such a 
</p>
<p>high-profile case.  
</p>
<p>74. The Independent Expert had proposed, in his first report, that a national commission 
</p>
<p>be set up to oversee reparation for the victims of the serious human rights violations 
</p>
<p>committed under the regime of the Duvaliers (father and son) and the military governments 
</p>
<p>and the violations perpetrated by the groups supporting or opposing President Jean-
</p>
<p>Bertrand Aristide. The commission should have been established in 1995, pursuant to the 
</p>
<p>recommendation of the National Truth and Justice Commission that had been appointed for 
</p>
<p>the victims of the 1991 coup.  
</p>
<p>75. The death of Jean-Claude Duvalier makes setting up this commission all the more 
</p>
<p>necessary so that reparation can be decided and granted for the victims of those large-scale, 
</p>
<p>systematic human rights violations, bearing in mind that it is no longer possible for the 
</p>
<p>courts to declare criminal responsibility for the Duvaliers for the violations that occurred 
</p>
<p>between 1957 and 1986. The commission&#8217;s remit could include as well violations that were 
</p>
<p>perpetrated after Duvalier&#8217;s fall and thus provide input for educational activities aimed at 
</p>
<p>re-establishing the right to memory. The creation of this commission would in no way 
</p>
<p>impede the launching of a judicial investigation into events involving any living person 
</p>
<p>responsible for serious crimes committed during the presidency of Jean-Claude Duvalier 
</p>
<p>(or, as applicable, of his predecessor and father, Fran&#231;ois Duvalier). 
</p>
<p>76. During its review of the initial report submitted by Haiti in 2014, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee was of the same view as the Independent Expert as to the urgency of taking 
</p>
<p>action on human rights violations committed in the past. In support of the effort to combat </p>


<p>GE.15-02042 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>the impunity undermining the rule of law in Haiti, the Committee recommended that the 
</p>
<p>State party continue the investigation into the Duvalier case with a view to bringing to 
</p>
<p>justice all those responsible for serious violations committed during that regime and 
</p>
<p>granting victims fair and just redress. The Committee also recommended that the State 
</p>
<p>party implement the recommendations of the National Truth and Justice Commission 
</p>
<p>pertaining to the serious violations committed between 1991 and 1994, and it reminded the 
</p>
<p>State party of its obligation to launch criminal proceedings in all cases of serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations (CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, para. 7). 
</p>
<p><b> (ii) The need for a stronger and more credible judicial system to combat impunity 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Committee further drew attention to the need to strengthen the overall capacity 
</p>
<p>and credibility of the judicial system in order to combat impunity. This means guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>the independence and effective operation of the High Council of the Judiciary 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, paras. 16 and 17). The Independent Expert wishes to reiterate the 
</p>
<p>appeal made to the Haitian authorities in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Other factors having an impact on human rights, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>catastrophes and other humanitarian crises 
</b></p>
<p>78. The fifth area identified in the Independent Expert&#8217;s first report relates to serious 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights stemming from other factors, such as forced displacement in the 
</p>
<p>wake of natural catastrophe, statelessness and the cholera epidemic. 
</p>
<p><b> (i) Priority action for displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>79. In December 2013, some 140,000 persons were still living in refugee camps. By 
</p>
<p>July 2014, at the time of the Independent Expert&#8217;s second mission, that number had 
</p>
<p>dropped to 104,000 and, by October 2014, it had dropped further to 85,400, according to 
</p>
<p>data provided by the Government to the Committee.20 Progress in this direction should not 
</p>
<p>be allowed to falter. The pace should in fact be stepped up in order to promptly find decent, 
</p>
<p>long-term housing solutions for the many families who, five years after the earthquake, 
</p>
<p>continue to live in harsh conditions in these camps.  
</p>
<p>80. The people in these camps live in constant threat of being forcibly evicted by the 
</p>
<p>property owners, which represents a further menace to their already flouted rights. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert echoes the Committee&#8217;s call to the State party to ensure that no one is 
</p>
<p>evicted from a camp unless some other solution has been found for the person and his or 
</p>
<p>her family and ensure that all those displaced by the earthquake receive a long-term 
</p>
<p>solution for their housing situation (CCPR/C/HTI/CO/1, para. 18).  
</p>
<p><b> (ii) Other factors 
</b></p>
<p>81. During his visit to Haiti in July 2014, the Secretary-General visited the central plain 
</p>
<p>region, which is where the first cases of cholera had been recorded. With the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister, he launched a campaign to improve access to water and sanitation in rural areas as 
</p>
<p>part of the effort to halt the cholera epidemic. The Independent Expert hopes that that visit 
</p>
<p>will spur implementation of the recommendation made in his previous report, specifically, 
</p>
<p>that a reparations commission be set up for the victims of the epidemic in order to catalogue 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20 Based, in turn, on the International Organization of Migration/Camp Coordination and Camp 
</p>

</p>
<p>the damage suffered and corresponding compensation, identify those responsible and halt 
</p>
<p>the epidemic, among other actions.  
</p>
<p>82. With regard to the issue of statelessness, the Independent Expert is following closely 
</p>
<p>the progress of talks between the Haitian and Dominican authorities. He had hoped to meet 
</p>
<p>with the Minister for Haitians Living Abroad, but that was not possible during the mission 
</p>
<p>in July 2014. 
</p>
<p>83. In October 2014, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights made public its 
</p>
<p>judgement of 28 August 2014 in which it found Judgement TC/0168/13 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic to be in violation of the American 
</p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights. According to Judgement TC/0168/13, which had been 
</p>
<p>issued one year earlier, all persons born in the Dominican Republic after 1929 of parents 
</p>
<p>who were foreign nationals were deemed illegal aliens and did not have the right to 
</p>
<p>Dominican nationality. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights rejected the Dominican 
</p>
<p>court&#8217;s decision, thus confirming the position taken by several other international bodies, 
</p>
<p>including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, who had declared that this decision was not in 
</p>
<p>conformity with international obligations (A/HRC/25/71, para. 79). 
</p>
<p>84. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights concluded that Judgement TC/0168/13, 
</p>
<p>given its general scope, did not comply with the obligation assumed under article 2 of the 
</p>
<p>American Convention on Human Rights to adopt national legislation with regard to the 
</p>
<p>rights &#8212; recognized in the Convention &#8212; to juridical personality (art. 3), to a name (art. 
</p>
<p>18) and to nationality (art. 20) and, in connection with those rights, the right to identity and 
</p>
<p>the right to equal protection under the law (art. 24); it also failed to respect the obligations 
</p>
<p>set forth in article 1, paragraph 1, of the Convention.21 The Dominican Republic was thus 
</p>
<p>obligated to take action within a reasonable time frame to ensure that the aforementioned 
</p>
<p>acts cease to have any legal force or effect.22 
</p>
<p>85. The Inter-American Court accordingly ordered the Dominican Government to take 
</p>
<p>all necessary steps, within a reasonable time frame, so that Judgement TC/0168/13 and the 
</p>
<p>provisions of articles 6, 8 and 11 of Act No. 169-14 would cease to have legal force and 
</p>
<p>effect, pursuant to paragraph 468 of the judgement.23 
</p>
<p>86. This finding of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights should have provided the 
</p>
<p>necessary basis for action by the Haitian Government vis-&#224;-vis the Dominican authorities to 
</p>
<p>ensure the protection of the rights of persons of Haitian origin living in the Dominican 
</p>
<p>Republic. Regrettably, the Constitutional Tribunal of the Dominican Republic issued an 
</p>
<p>opinion stating its disagreement with the decision of the Inter-American Court and 
</p>
<p>declaring, on 4 November 2014, the unconstitutionality of the instrument acknowledging 
</p>
<p>the competence of the Inter-American Court that had been signed by the President of the 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic on 19 February 1999.24 This could mean an eventual repudiation by 
</p>
<p>that country of the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>human rights protection system built around the American Convention on Human Rights.

<p>The Independent Expert appeals to the international community to deploy all necessary 
</p>
<p>efforts to ensure that the Dominican Republic continues to honour its obligations under the 
</p>
<p>American Convention on Human Rights.25  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Independent Expert reaffirms the conclusions contained in his first report, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in particular his perception and belief that the human rights situation in Haiti is 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremely grave but can be surmounted if five basic conditions are met: strong 
</b></p>
<p><b>political will on the part of the Government and the international community, active 
</b></p>
<p><b>involvement by civil society, consensus on the priority problems to be addressed, 
</b></p>
<p><b>focused coordination of work and perseverance in efforts to attain the stated goals. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Independent Expert reiterates the numerous recommendations made 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning Haiti over the past three decades by human rights experts and bodies of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations and the inter-American system. He has selected from among their 
</b></p>
<p><b>analyses and recommendations five key areas that should be given priority and be the 
</b></p>
<p><b>focus of future efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The five areas are closely interlinked among themselves and with the deep 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities present in Haitian society. They relate to the fragile situation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural rights of the vast majority of the population; inhumane 
</b></p>
<p><b>conditions in prisons, especially for persons being held in prolonged pretrial 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention; the absence of legal guarantees in many spheres of life owing to the very 
</b></p>
<p><b>weak rule of law; the blatant impunity of those who committed human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations in the past; and the harsh conditions endured by the many victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>natural catastrophes and other humanitarian crises, such as the earthquake of 
</b></p>
<p><b>January 2010, the cholera epidemic that broke out in October 2010 and the prospect 
</b></p>
<p><b>of statelessness. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The critical situation of human rights in Haiti can obviously not be solved 
</b></p>
<p><b>overnight, but the five areas mentioned above must be addressed promptly inasmuch 
</b></p>
<p><b>as they are a source of ongoing and serious violations. This can be achieved through 
</b></p>
<p><b>the follow actions: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The State should set a reasonably short time frame for eradicating 
</b></p>
<p><b>illiteracy, which afflicts roughly one half of the adult population. Although reducing 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequality takes time, in particular when structural programmes that go beyond mere 
</b></p>
<p><b>social assistance are involved, literacy is a crucial necessity for living with dignity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>for exercising most rights, in particular the right to education, which in turn gives 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to such other rights as the right to work, to food, to housing and to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Reducing prison overcrowding, ensuring proper sanitation in prisons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing food to inmates and, especially, processing the cases of and defining the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal status of persons being held in prolonged pretrial detention should all be seen to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promptly, on the basis of studies already conducted by the Prisons Administration; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthening the rule of law by consolidating institutions is a complex 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaking and requires time, but it is of the utmost urgency to clearly establish and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee the right of Haitians to vote and to be elected. In this regard, it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraging to see that in December 2014 the President welcomed the 
</b></p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>victims of other large-scale, systematic and serious human rights violations committed

<p><b>in the past, whether under the regime of the Duvaliers and the military governments

<p><b>or in connection with acts of violence perpetrated by groups supporting or opposing
