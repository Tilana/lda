Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
Gold Exploration – Western Australia incorporating: 
 
Deep South Project   
 
Trouser Legs Project  
 
Yundamindera Project
Hawthorn Resources 80%, MetalsX 20%;

Whiteheads Project  
 
Hawthorn Resources’ Western Australian gold exploration programs are primarily focussed in four 
major project areas where Hawthorn Resources holds in its own right or has earned equity from joint 
venture partners in over 50 granted exploration, mining, prospecting licences and applications. The 
Company  believes  that  the  major  project  areas,  in  close  proximity  to  milling  and  transport 
infrastructure, hold both exploration upside and near term potential for development.
Hawthorn Resources 100%
Figure 1. Eastern Goldfields, Western Australia – Project Locations
Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
The major project areas are situated in a distinct and highly prospective geological and mineralogical 
domain,  extending  from  Lake  Carey  to  the  historic  Pinjin  Mining  Centre  –  a  strike  length  of 
approximately  125  kilometres.  Hawthorn’s  tenement  package  is  surrounded  by  major  gold  mines, 
deposits  and  advanced  resources  including  Sunrise  Dam,  Wallaby,  Red  October,  Mt  Morgans 
Carosue  Dam,  Safari  Bore,  Deep  South,  Porphyry  and  Butchers  Well  Mines.  The  gold 
endowment of these mines and resources currently exceeds 22 Million ounces.
Yundamindera Project  
(Hawthorn 100% and Hawthorn Resources 80%, Metals X 20%). 
 
In  the  Yundamindera  Project  area,  located  approximately  175  kilometres  to  the  north  east  of 
Kalgoorlie,  Western  Australia  exploration  has  focused  on  the  discovery  of  gold  associated  with 
mineralised syenitic porphyry dykes, BIF’s and shears. Significant gold mineralisation continues to 
be discovered within the project area both in outcrop and more importantly, beneath extensive and 
pervasive, transported cover sequences.  
 
Exploration in the Yundamindera Project area has been focused towards the discovery of shear 
and porphyry associated gold mineralisation – the host of major gold resources in the North East 
Goldfields of Western Australia at the Wallaby (>7 Moz Au),  Jupiter – Heffernans (1.4 Moz Au) 
and Butcher Well (0.3 Moz) mining centres.
Figure 2. Box Well and Coffey Bore Prospects – Geology of North East Goldfields of Western Australia
At  the  Box  Well  West  Prospect  a  strongly  gold  mineralised,  silicified  shear  zone  has  been 
discovered within a broader, gold mineralised, stockwork quartz veined package of felsic volcanics 
and volcaniclastic sediments. 
  
Despite  an  extensive  history  of  modern  exploration  in  the  prospect  area  this  newly  identified 
mineralised  unit  had  not  previously  been  identified  or  drilled,  prior  to  Hawthorn’s  exploration 
discovery.
Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
Drilling to date has intercepted a 5-12 metre wide north-northwest striking and east dipping (60-65°), 
gold bearing quartz-pyrite±haematite shear zone along the 1200 metre of strike tested to date. The 
shear zone has been identified in each section drilled to date, including sections where only lower 
grade gold results have been returned, indicating the robust nature of this structural feature.  
 
The  intersection  of  this  primary  mineralised  shear  zone  with  steep  east  dipping,  strongly  silicified 
felsic  tuffs  and  lavas  appears  conducive  to  the  formation  of  broad  zones  of  gold  bearing  breccia 
zones with widths and grades including
(incl. 10 metres @ 3.06 g/t Au from 24m),
o 
 26 metres @ 2.07 g/t Au from 19 metres in YMC075, 
o  15 metres @ 2.58 g/t Au from 112 metres in YMC076, 
o  27 metres @ 1.37 g/t Au from 24 metres in YMC085 
o  38 metres @ 1.62 g/t Au from 12 metres in YMC092 
o  36 metres @ 1.96 g/t Au from 42 metres in YMC093 
o  19 metres @ 2.13 g/t Au from 101 metres in YMC095,
(incl. 21 metres @ 3.01 g/t Au from 57m),
(incl. 8 metres @ 3.37 g/t Au from 19m),
Figure 3. Box Well West Prospect – Longitudinal Section with Planned & Proposed Drill hole Locations
Diamond  Core  Drilling  is  scheduled  to  commence  on  the  9th  August  2016  to  obtain  core  for 
metallurgical and geological control that should enable an initial resource estimate to be reported to 
shareholders.  
 
During the previous quarter an Auger drilling program was carried out over 7 High Priority targets 
identified by the recently completed a Sub-Audio Magnetics (SAM) geophysical survey in the same 
lithological and structural package as the Box Well West gold mineralised zone continued.  
 
The  results  from  this  program,  which  included  holes  drilled  directly  into  the  surface  projection  of 
known gold mineralisation, are very encouraging. Results of a similar and greater magnitude to holes 
drilled  into  known  mineralisation  have  been  returned  from  the  BW_01  to  BW_02  anomaly 
commence  approximately  160  metres  south  of  existing  drilling  and  extend  for  over  1000  metres 
along strike to the south. Similarly several extremely strong anomalous results were returned from 
the BW_04 to BW_07 cluster of anomalies to the north of existing drilling. Figure 3 and 4. 
 
An aggressive RC drilling program is planned within the prospect area to test these newly identified 
anomalous  zones,  strike  and  depth  extension  of  known  mineralisation,  and  to  infill  near  surface 
mineralisation at the existing prospect (these proposed holes are not included on Figure 3 for clarity). 
This  RC  drilling  program  will  be  carried  out  concurrently  with  the  Diamond  Core  drilling  program 
above.
Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
Figure 4. Box Well West Prospect – SAM targets and Auger Drill sampling – June 2016 Quarter
Hawthorn believes that the data from the 2 imminent drilling programs should enable a gold resource 
estimate  to  be  announced  within  the  Box  Well  West  prospect  area.  Further  zones  of  gold 
mineralisation are actively being explored for within Yundamindera project area, in particular in the 
6.0 kilometres of strike with no effective historic drilling between the Box Well West prospect and 
the announced Coffey Bore prospect.
Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
These exploration programs will be a primary focus for Hawthorn during the remainder of 2016. 
 
 
Trouser Legs – Anglo Saxon Project 
(Hawthorn Resources70%, Gel Resources 30%). 
 
The Trouser Legs Project area is located 140 km north east of Kalgoorlie and is centred on the 
historic Anglo Saxon Mine. The Trouser Legs - Anglo Saxon project area is situated 35 kilometres 
to the east of the Carosue Dam Mill of Saracen Mineral Holdings Limited. 
 
Hawthorn has announced a Mineral Resource Estimate at the Anglo Saxon Deposit of
Indicated  Mineral  Resource  –  599,000t    at  3.3  g/t  gold  for  63,700  oz  of  gold  (Oxide  and 
Transition Zones), and  
 
Inferred Mineral Resource – 1,687,000t at 4.1 g/t gold for 221,800 oz of gold (Oxide, Transition 
and Primary)
•
•
Hawthorn Resources  confirms that  all  material  assumptions  and technical  parameters  underpinning the  Mineral  Resource Estimate in  the  announcement, 
Anglo Saxon – Indicated Mineral Resource Upgrade; ASX Announcement: 30/10/2013, continue to apply and have not materially changed, and that the 
form and context in which the Competent Persons findings are presented have not been materially altered.    
 
During  the  quarter  the  Anglo  Saxon  Gold  Mining  Project  –  Project  Management  Plan  was 
approved  by  the West  Australian  Department  of  Mines  and  Petroleum  and  Hawthorn  was  further 
granted  an  Approval  to  Commence  Mining  Operations  on  the  basis  of  the  approved  Project 
Management Plan. 
 
A re-optimization of the Anglo Saxon Gold Mining Project has commenced in order to reflect the 
current  sustained  stronger  gold  price  and  existing  plant  and  equipment  rates  obtained  during  the 
previous quarter, with a Mining Schedule to be developed from this re-optimization.
Figure 5. Anglo Saxon Deposit – Proposed Mine Layout
Discussions have been held with Technical Mine Services groups and other companies expected to 
be required to develop the Mining Project. Further announcements regarding the development of the 
Mining Project are expected in the near future.
Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
Deep South Project 
(Hawthorn Resources 80%, Metals X 20%). 
 
The Deep South Project is approximately 180 kilometres north east of Kalgoorlie with the project 
area situated along strike of known economic gold mineralisation hosted in the Deep South-Mexico 
gold orebodies owned by Saracen Mineral Holdings Limited (“Saracen”). Saracen has completed a 
Feasibility Study on the underground Probable Reserve at the deposit of 125,000 ounces of gold in a 
Mining Inventory of 174,000 ounces of gold. Saracen have reported that underground development 
of this deposit is well advanced with initial ore production commencing during the quarter production. 
 
Hawthorn  has  identified  a  gold  mineralised  horizon  analogous  to  the  adjacent  Deep  South  gold 
orebodies within its tenement package.
Figure 6. Deep South Longitudinal Section
As previously reported Hawthorn has completed a SAM (Sub-Audio Magnetic) survey over the key 
tenements  in  the  project  area.  This  geophysical  technique,  utilising  off  time  EM  data  identifies 
conductive  horizons  within  rock  packages  that  may  indicate  significant  sulphide,  potentially  with 
associated gold mineralisation developed.  
 
In  the  immediately  adjoining  Saracen  Deep  South  Mine  it  is  believed  that  the  high  gold  grade, 
footwall  Scarlett  Lode  (a  carbonate  +/-  variable  pyrite-pyrrhotite-quartz-magnetite  vein)  would 
generate a substantial EM anomaly.    
 
RC drill testing of the substantial EM anomaly (DS_01), with significant depth extent immediately to 
the  east  and  in  the  footwall  of  the  Central  Zone  of  gold  mineralisation  previously  reported  is  to 
commence  during August  in combination  with  a  Diamond core drilling program of the known gold 
mineralisation in the Central Zone to obtain core for metallurgical testwork, geological control and 
resources estimation. See Figure 7 and 8 below

Joint Ventures – Western Australia 
 
 
Mount Bevan Iron Ore Project  
(Hawthorn 40%, Legacy 60%)   
 
The Mount Bevan Project, comprising Exploration Licence 29/510, is located approximately 100 km 
west of Leonora in the central Yilgarn region of Western Australia.  
 
The Project area is held in Joint Venture with Legacy Iron Ore (“Legacy”), with technical programs 
approved by a Technical Committee comprising representatives of each company and managed by 
Legacy. 
 
Three  substantial  BIF  horizons  have  been  identified  within  the  tenement  to  date  that  extend  in  a 
north-northwest orientation throughout the entire length of the tenement; a strike distance of more
Hawthorn Resources Limited – June 2016 Activities Report
than 25 kilometres. The westernmost of these horizons hosts the substantial Mt Bevan Indicated 
Magnetite Resource of 322Mt @ 34.7% Fe within a larger Inferred Magnetite Resource of 1,117 
Mt @ 34.9% Fe.   
 
In addition the northern extension of the Jupiter Mines Limited (“Jupiter”) Mt Mason Resource DSO 
Haematite Resource (9.4Mt @ 57.6% Fe) extends into the Joint Venture tenement.  
 
During  the  quarter  the  Joint  Venture  partners  commenced  exploration  to  determine  whether 
repetitions of the encouraging nickel and copper results reported  to within 700 metres north of joint 
venture  tenements  by  St  George  Mining  Limited  (ASX:  SGQ)  occur  within  the  Joint  Venture 
tenement.  
 
A  detailed  ground  magnetic  survey  was  completed  with  interpretation  by  specialist  geophysical 
company Southern Geoscience nearing completion. Nonetheless several strong magnetic anomalies 
have been detected to date of a similar amplitude and attitude to those on the adjoining St George 
Mining tenement.
Figure 9. Mt Bevan JV – North End of JV Tenement – Detailed Ground Magnetics merged with Regional TMI Data.
St George Mining Limited “Cathedrals Belt Prospects” and Hawthorn / Legacy Target Areas
Follow-up geophysical surveys are planned when the interpretation is complete to further enhance 
and refine targets for drill testing.
