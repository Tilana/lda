law; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Notes</i> that, according to paragraph 5 of the Basic Principles on the

guarantees necessary for their legal defence;

<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that the principles of equality before the courts

international law as guarantees of a fair trial, including the right to appeal a conviction and 
a sentence; 
</p>
