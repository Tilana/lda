3.
Risk factors
The  Listed  Options  offered  under  this  Prospectus  are  considered  highly  speculative.  
An investment in the Company is not risk free and the Directors strongly recommend 
potential  investors  to  consider  the  risk  factors  described  below,  together  with 
information contained elsewhere in this Prospectus and to consult their professional 
advisers before deciding whether to apply for Options pursuant to this Prospectus.
There are specific risks which relate directly to the Companyâ€™s business.  In addition, 
there  are  other  general  risks,  many  of  which  are  largely  beyond  the  control  of  the 
Company and the Directors.  The risks identified in this section, or other risk factors, 
may  have  a  material  impact  on  the  financial  performance  of  the  Company  and  the 
market price of the Companyâ€™s securities.
The following is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the risk factors to which the 
Company is exposed.
3.1
Specific risks associated with the Company
(a)
Going concern risk
The Directors have determined that future equity raisings or debt financing 
arrangements  will  be  required  to  assist  the  funding  of  the  Companyâ€™s 
activities to meet the Companyâ€™s objectives. There is no certainty that these 
will  be  successfully  completed  to  provide  adequate  working  capital  for  the 
Company.
In  the  event  that  the  Placement  is  not  completed  successfully  there  is 
significant  uncertainty  as  to  whether  the  Company  can  continue  as  a  going 
concern,  and  which  is  likely  to  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the 
Companyâ€™s activities.
(b)
Funding risk
At the date of this Prospectus, the Company has no income producing assets 
and  will  generate  losses  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Until  it  is  able  to 
develop a project and generate appropriate cash flow, it is dependent upon 
being  able  to  obtain  future  equity  or  debt  funding  to  support  long  term 
exploration,  after  the  expenditure  of  the  net  proceeds  raised  under  the 
Placement.  Neither  the  Company  nor  any  of  the  Directors  nor  any  other 
party  can  provide  any  guarantee  or  assurance  that  if  further  funding  is 
required, such funding can be raised on terms favourable to the Company (or 
at all).
Any  additional  equity  funding  will  dilute  existing  Shareholders.  Also,  no 
guarantee or assurance can be given as to when a project can be developed 
to  the  stage  where  it  will  generate  cash  flow.  As  such,  a  project  would  be 
dependent  on  many  factors,  for  example  exploration  success,  subsequent 
development, commissioning and operational performance.
(c)
Additional requirements for capital
The  Companyâ€™s  capital  requirements  depend  on  numerous  factors.    The 
Company  will  require  further  financing  in  addition  to  amounts  raised  under
11
the  Placement.    Any  additional  equity  financing  will  dilute  shareholdings, 
and  debt  financing,  if  available,  may  involve  restrictions  on  financing  and 
operating activities.  If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing 
as  needed,  it  may  be  required  to  reduce  the  scope  of  its  operations  and 
scale back its exploration programmes as the case may be.  There is however 
no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding 
or be able to secure funding on terms favourable to the Company.
(d)
Title â€“ Sunny Corner mineral rights only
The  Company  does  not  have  a  registered  interest  in  the  Sunny  Corner 
tenement.    It  only  has  an  equitable  interest  pursuant  to  farm  in  and  joint 
venture agreements to earn an initial interest of 70% of the mineral rights of 
the tenement.
The  only  right  available  to  the  Company  to  protect  its  interest  in  this 
tenement  is  lodgement  of  a  caveat  over  the  tenement  pursuant  to  the 
Mining Act 1992 (NSW).  A caveat prevents the registration of any transfer or 
mortgage over the tenement without first giving notice to the Company.  As 
at the date of this Prospectus, the Company has not yet lodged caveats with 
the  Department  of  Trade  and  Investment,  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy 
Division, New South Wales over the tenement.
3.2
Specific industry risks
(a)
Environmental
The operations and proposed activities of the Company are subject to State 
and Federal laws and regulations concerning the environment.  As with most 
exploration  projects  and  mining  operations,  the  Companyâ€™s  activities  are 
expected  to  have  an  impact  on  the  environment,  particularly  if  advanced 
exploration or mine development proceeds.  It is the Companyâ€™s intention to 
conduct  its  activities  to  the  highest  standard  of  environmental  obligation, 
including compliance with all environmental laws. Approvals are required for 
land  clearing  and  for  ground  disturbing  activities.    Delays  in  obtaining  such 
approvals  can  result  in  the  delay  to  anticipated  exploration  programmes  or 
mining activities.
(b)
Exploration
The mineral tenements of the Company are at various stages of exploration, 
and  potential  investors  should  understand  that  mineral  exploration  and 
development  are  high-risk  undertakings.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that 
exploration  of  these  tenements,  or  any  other  tenements  that  may  be 
acquired  in  the  future,  will  result  in  the  discovery  of  an  economic  ore 
deposit.    Even  if  an  apparently  viable  deposit  is  identified,  there  is  no 
guarantee that it can be economically exploited.
The future exploration activities of the Company may be affected by a range 
of  factors  including  geological  conditions,  limitations  on  activities  due  to 
seasonal  weather  patterns,  unanticipated  operational  and  technical 
difficulties,  industrial  and  environmental  accidents,  native  title  process, 
changing government regulations and many other factors beyond the control 
of the Company.
12
(c)
Exploration costs
The exploration costs of the Company are based on certain assumptions with 
respect  to  the  method  and  timing  of  exploration.    By  their  nature,  these 
estimates  and  assumptions  are  subject  to  significant  uncertainties  and, 
accordingly, the actual costs may materially differ from these estimates and 
assumptions.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the cost estimates 
and  the  underlying  assumptions  will  be  realised  in  practice,  which  may 
materially and adversely affect the Companyâ€™s viability.
(d)
Operations
No assurances can be given that the Company will achieve commercial 
viability through the successful exploration and/or mining of its tenement 
interests.
(e)
Tenure and access
Mining and exploration tenements are subject to periodic renewal.  There is 
no  guarantee  that  current  or  future  tenements  or  future  applications  for 
production tenements will be approved.
The  Company's  tenements  are  subject  to  the  applicable  mining  acts  and 
regulations  in  New  South  Wales.    The  renewal  of  the  term  of  a  granted 
tenement is also subject to the discretion of the relevant Minister.  Renewal 
conditions  may  include  increased  expenditure  and  work  commitments  or 
compulsory  relinquishment  of  areas  of  the  tenements  comprising  the 
Companyâ€™s  projects.    The  imposition  of  new  conditions  or  the  inability  to 
meet  those  conditions  may  adversely  affect  the  operations,  financial 
position and/or performance of the Company.
(f)
Government policy changes
Adverse changes in government policies or legislation may affect ownership 
of  mineral  interests,  taxation,  royalties,  land  access,  labour  relations,  and 
mining  and  exploration  activities  of  the  Company.    It  is  possible  that  the 
current system of exploration and mine permitted in New South Wales  may 
change,  resulting  in  impairment  of  rights  and  possibly  expropriation  of  the 
Companyâ€™s properties without adequate compensation.
(g)
Joint venture parties, agents and contractors
The Directors are unable to predict the risk of financial failure or default by 
a  participant  in  the  earn-in  agreements  and  joint  ventures  to  which  the 
Company is at present a party (i.e. the West Wyalong and Sunny Corner joint 
ventures) or may become a party or the insolvency or managerial failure by 
any of the contractors used (or to be used in the future) by the Company in 
any  of  its  activities  or  the  insolvency  or  other  managerial  failure  by  any  of 
the  other  service  providers  used  (or  to  be  used  in  the  future)  by  the 
Company for any activity.
3.3
General risks
(a)
Economic
General economic conditions, movements in interest and inflation rates and 
currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the Companyâ€™s
13
exploration, development and production activities, as well as on its ability 
to fund those activities.
(b)
Market conditions
Share market conditions may affect the value of the Companyâ€™s quoted 
securities regardless of the Companyâ€™s operating performance.  Share 
market conditions are affected by many factors such as:
(i)
(ii)
general economic outlook;
introduction of tax reform or other new legislation;
(iii)
commodity prices;
(iv)
interest rates and inflation rates;
(v)
changes in investor sentiment toward particular market sectors;
(vi)
the demand for, and supply of, capital; and
(vii)
terrorism or other hostilities.
The market price of securities can fall as well as rise and may be subject to 
varied and unpredictable influences on the market for equities in general 
and resource exploration stocks in particular.  Neither the Company nor the 
Directors warrant the future performance of the Company or any return on 
an investment in the Company.
(c)
Dividends
Any future determination as to the payment of dividends by the Company 
will be at the discretion of the Directors and will depend on the financial 
condition of the Company, future capital requirements and general business 
and other factors considered relevant by the Directors.  No assurance in 
relation to the payment of dividends or franking credits attaching to 
dividends can be given by the Company.
(d)
Reliance on key personnel
The responsibility of overseeing the day-to-day operations and the strategic 
management of the Company depends substantially on its senior 
management and its key personnel.  There can be no assurance given that 
there will be no detrimental impact on the Company if one or more of these 
employees cease their employment.
3.4
Speculative nature of investment
The above list of risk factors ought not to be taken as exhaustive of the risks faced by 
the Company or by investors in the Company.
The  above  factors,  and  others  not  specifically  referred  to  above,  may  in  the  future 
materially  affect  the  financial  performance  of  the  Company  and  the  value  of  the 
Securities  offered  under  this  Prospectus.    The  Applicants  should  consider  that  an 
investment  in  the  Company  is  speculative  and  should  consult  their  professional 
adviser before deciding whether to apply for Securities pursuant to this Prospectus.

Rights and liabilities attaching to Shares
There  is  only  one  class  of  Share  in  the  Company,  fully  paid  ordinary  shares.    The 
following  is  a  summary  of  the  more  significant  rights  and  liabilities  attaching  to 
Shares.    This  summary  is  not  exhaustive  and  does  not  constitute  a  definitive 
statement of the rights and liabilities of Shareholders.
Full  details  of  the  rights  attaching  to  the  Shares  of  the  Company  are  in  the 
Constitution  of  the  Company,  a  copy  of  which  is  available  for  inspection  at  the 
Companyâ€™s registered office during normal business hours.
(a)
General Meetings
Shareholders  are  entitled  to  be  present  in  person  or  by  proxy,  attorney  or 
representative  to  attend  and  vote  at  general  meetings  of  the  Company. 
Shareholders  may  requisition  meetings  in  accordance  with  Section  249D  of 
the Corporations Act and the Constitution of the Company.
(b)
Voting Rights
Subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any class 
or classes of shares of the Company, at general meetings of Shareholders or 
classes of Shareholders:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
each Shareholder entitled to vote, may vote in person or by proxy, 
attorney or representative;
on a show of hands, every person present who is a Shareholder or a 
proxy,  attorney  or  representative  of  a  Shareholder  has  one  vote; 
and
on  a  poll,  every  person  present  who  is  a  Shareholder  or  a  proxy, 
attorney or representative of a Shareholder shall, in respect of each 
Share held by him, or in respect of which he is appointed a proxy, 
attorney  or  representative,  have  one  vote  for  the  Share,  but  in 
respect  of  partly  paid  Shares,  shall  have  such  number  of  votes  as 
bears the same proportion to the total of such Shares registered in 
the Shareholderâ€™s name as the amount paid (not credited) bears to 
the total amounts paid and payable (excluding amounts credited).
(c)
Dividend Rights
Subject to the rights of any preference Shareholders and to the rights of the 
holders of any shares created or raised under any special arrangement as to 
dividend, the Directors may from time to time declare a dividend to be paid 
to the Shareholders entitled to the dividend which shall be payable on all 
Shares according to the proportion that the amount paid (not credited) is of 
the total amounts paid and payable (excluding amounts credited) in respect 
of such Shares but only out of the profits of the Company.
The Directors may from time to time pay to the Shareholders any interim 
dividends as they may determine.  No dividend shall carry interest as against 
the Company.
15
Subject to the ASX Listing Rules and the Corporations Act, the Company may 
implement a dividend reinvestment plan on any terms, under which 
participants may elect in respect of all or part of their Shares to apply the 
whole or any part of a dividend from the Company in subscribing for 
securities of the Company or a related body corporate of the Company. The 
Directors may, at their discretion, implement, amend, suspend or terminate 
a dividend reinvestment plan subject to the ASX Listing Rules.
(d)
Winding-Up
If  the  Company  is  wound  up,  the  liquidator  may,  with  the  authority  of  a 
special  resolution  of  the  Company,  divide  among  the  Shareholders  in  kind 
the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  property  of  the  Company,  and  may  for  that 
purpose  set  such  value  as  he  considers  fair  upon  any  property  to  be  so 
divided, and may determine how the division is to be carried out as between 
the  Shareholders  or  different  classes  of  Shareholders.  The  liquidator  may, 
with the authority of a special resolution of the Company, vest the whole or 
any part of any such property in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of 
the contributories as the liquidator thinks fit, but so that no Shareholder is 
compelled to accept any Shares or other securities in respect of which there 
is any liability.
(e)
Transfer of Shares
Generally,  Shares  are  freely  transferable,  subject  to  formal  requirements, 
the registration of the transfer not resulting in a contravention of or failure 
to observe the provisions of a law of Australia and the transfer not being in 
breach of the Corporations Act or the Listing Rules.
(f)
Variation of Rights
Pursuant  to  Section  246B  of  the  Corporations  Act,  the  Company  may,  the 
rights  attached  to  the  shares  in  any  class  may  be  varied  or  cancelled  only 
with  the  written  consent  of  the  holders  of  at  least  three-quarters  of  the 
issued  shares  of  the  affected  class,  or  by  special  resolution  passed  at  a 
separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares of the affected class.
(g)
Alteration of constitution
In  accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act,  the  Constitution  can  only  be 
amended  by  a  special  resolution  passed  by  at  least  three  quarters  of 
Shareholders  present  and  voting  at  the  general  meeting.    In  addition,  at 
least  28  days  written  notice  specifying  the  intention  to  propose  the 
resolution as a special resolution must be given.
