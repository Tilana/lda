<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the Universal Declaration of

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme

</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
objectives and principles thereof, and welcoming the decisions of the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference, held in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2007, and in particular the adoption of 
the Bali Action Plan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21, the 
Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Declaration on 
Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development, and recognizing that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
development and that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to meet equitably the 
development and environmental needs of present and future generations, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that they must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and 
with the same emphasis,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolution 7/23 of 28 March 2008 on human rights and climate change, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights (A/HRC/10/61), 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that climate change-related effects have a range of implications, both direct and 
indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights including, inter alia, the right to life, the 
right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to adequate 
housing, the right to self-determination and human rights obligations related to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, and recalling that in no case may a people be deprived of its own 
means of subsistence,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that while these implications affect individuals and communities around the 
world, the effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by those segments of the population 
who are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors such as geography, poverty, gender, 
age, indigenous or minority status and disability, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution, and 
that effective international cooperation to enable the full, effective and sustained implementation </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/L.30 
  page 3 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in accordance with the 
provisions and principles of the Convention is important in order to support national efforts for 
the realization of human rights implicated by climate change-related effects,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that human rights obligations and commitments have the potential to inform and 
strengthen international and national policy-making in the area of climate change, promoting 
policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to hold a panel discussion on the relationship between climate change and 
human rights at its eleventh session in order to contribute to the realization of the goals set out in 
the Bali Action Plan and to invite all relevant stakeholders to participate therein; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a summary of the panel discussion and decides to make the summary available to the 
Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for its 
consideration; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living to prepare and present a thematic report 
on the potential impact of climate change on the right to adequate housing, and encourages other 
relevant special procedure mandate-holders to give consideration to the issue of climate change 
within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Welcomes</i> the steps by the Office of the High Commissioner and the secretariat of 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to facilitate exchange of 
information in the area of human rights and climate change; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to participate at a senior level, 
during the High-level Meeting on Climate Change, to be held ahead of the general debate of the 
General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, and at the fifteenth session and Conference of 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
