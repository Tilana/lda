<p><b>Resolution 9/9.  Protection of the human rights of civilians in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, the 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977, other international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law instruments, and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly states that the Human Rights Council shall be responsible for promoting universal 
</p>
<p>respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without 
</p>
<p>distinction of any kind and in fair and equal manner, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> resolution 2005/63 of 20 April 2005 of the Commission on Human Rights, and 
</p>
<p>taking note of decision 2006/21 of 24 August 2006 adopted by the Sub-Commission on the 
</p>
<p>Promotion and Protection of Human Rights at its final session, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
</p>
<p>complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i> Gravely concerned </i>at violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>during armed conflicts, wherever they occur, and their impact on the civilian population, 
</p>
<p>especially women, children and vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p>  </p>

 <p><i> Reiterating</i> that effective measures to guarantee and monitor the implementation of human 
</p>
<p>rights should be taken in respect of civilian populations in situations of armed conflict, including 
</p>
<p>people under foreign occupation, and that effective protection against violations of their human 
</p>
<p>rights should be provided, in accordance with international human rights law and applicable 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, particularly Geneva Convention IV relative to the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and other applicable international 
</p>
<p>instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that States parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have undertaken to 
</p>
<p>respect and ensure respect for these Conventions in all circumstances,  </p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that all human rights require protection equally and that the protection 
</p>
<p>provided by human rights law continues in armed conflict situations, taking into account when 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law applies as a <i>lex specialis</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in accordance with article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, certain rights are recognized as non-derogable in all circumstances and that any 
</p>
<p>measures derogating from the provisions of the Covenant must be in accordance with its article 4 
</p>
<p>in all cases, and underlining the exceptional and temporary nature of any such derogations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes</i> that conduct that violates international humanitarian law, including 
</p>
<p>grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, or of the Protocol Additional 
</p>
<p>thereto of 8 June 1977 relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts 
</p>
<p>(Protocol I), may also constitute a gross violation of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses</i> its deep concern at the violations of human rights during armed conflicts 
</p>
<p>and of  international humanitarian law, which undermines the protection of human rights of 
</p>
<p>civilians in armed conflicts;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to respect the human rights of civilians in armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of combating impunity in order to prevent violations of 
</p>
<p>international human rights law and international humanitarian law perpetrated against civilians in 
</p>
<p>armed conflicts, and urges States, in accordance with their international obligations, to bring 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of such crimes to justice; </p>

 <p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the international community to support regional efforts aimed at the 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians in armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Resolves </i>to address, in accordance with its mandate established by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly in its resolution 60/251, systematic and gross violations of the human rights 
</p>
<p>of civilians in armed conflicts, and calls upon States involved in such conflicts to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>work of any mechanism that the Council may decide to establish, as and where appropriate, in 
</p>
<p>response to such violations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> relevant special procedures and the Human Rights Council Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee, and invites human rights treaty bodies, within their respective mandates, to continue 
</p>
<p>to address the relevant aspects of the protection of human rights of civilians in armed conflicts in 
</p>
<p>their work;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites </i>the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, within 
</p>
<p>existing resources, an expert consultation, open to the participation of Governments, regional 
</p>
<p>organizations, relevant United Nations bodies and civil society organizations, and in consultation 
</p>
<p>with the International Committee of the Red Cross, on the issue of protecting the human rights of 
</p>
<p>civilians in armed conflict, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>to report on the outcome of this consultation, in the form of a summary of discussions on the 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned issue, to the Council at its eleventh session; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i> Decides </i>to continue consideration of this question at its 11th session under the same 
</p>
<p>agenda item on the basis of the outcome of the consultation referred to in paragraph 8 above, 
</p>
<p>with a view to consider requesting the Advisory Committee, while taking into account the work 
</p>
<p>of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on this subject, to 
</p>
<p>elaborate a study with potential recommendations on the protection of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>civilians in armed conflicts.
