Rhino Resource Partners LP Announces
Second Quarter 2016 Financial and Operating Results
LEXINGTON, KY (August 10, 2016) – Rhino Resource Partners LP (OTCQB: RHNO) (“Rhino”
or the “Partnership”) announced today its financial and operating results for the quarter ended
June 30, 2016. For the quarter, the Partnership reported a net loss of $121.9 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of $4.5 million, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.1
million in the second quarter of 2015. Approximately $118.7 million of asset impairment charges
impacted the net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Diluted net loss per common unit was
$13.42 for the quarter compared to diluted net loss per common unit of $2.73 for the second
quarter of 2015. Total revenues for the quarter were $42.8 million, with coal sales generating
$39.1 million of the total, compared to total revenues of $56.8 million and coal revenues of $48.5
million in the second quarter of 2015. (Refer to “Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA” included
later in this release for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures).
The Partnership continued the suspension of the cash distribution for its common units for the
current quarter. No distributions will be paid for common or subordinated units for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016.
Joe Funk, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rhino’s general partner, stated, “Our focus on
cash generation resulted in positive cash flow from operations and Adjusted EBITDA during the
quarter despite the historically difficult coal market. Our strong cash generation and continued
support of our sponsor, Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (OTCQB:ROYE) (“Royal”), allowed us to
reduce our debt by almost $6 million during the second quarter. We are pleased we were able to
work with our creditors to extend our credit agreement to July 2017 with the possibility to extend
the maturity to December 2017.
Our relationship with ION Carbon & Minerals, LLC (“Ion Carbon”), an wholly owned subsidiary of
AMCI Holdings, Inc. (collectively referred to as “AMCI”), has provided Rhino the opportunity to
commence test shipments to major European steel companies in the back half of 2016. Rhino
believes these initial test shipments could lead to potential contracted business in 2017. We look
forward to the opportunity this relationship with AMCI will bring to Rhino and our unitholders and
the capability for AMCI to place Rhino coals into markets where we have not historically
participated. Our relationship with AMCI is an example of the insight and market strategies that
Royal has provided to help us grow our cash flow in the future.
1
Safety remains a top priority at all of our operations as we continue to manage through these
difficult coal market conditions. Although natural gas prices have risen during the past few weeks
from historic lows, persistently low natural gas prices continue to adversely affect the steam coal
markets.
We have resumed mining operations at our previously idled underground mine at our Rob Fork
complex in Central Appalachia, as we were able to secure an export met coal order for 60,000
tons that will be shipped ratable over the balance of 2016. In addition, we contracted a second
met coal export order for 70,000 tons that will be shipped ratable from August 2016 through
January of 2017 from our Tug Fork operations. These orders will greatly reduce the holding costs
incurred on the idled operations in Central Appalachia over the balance of 2016.
Continued productivity improvements at Pennyrile have lowered costs and improved the coal
recovery rates at this operation compared to the prior year. Pennyrile has become a positive cash
flow producer for Rhino during the first six months of 2016 as we have increased production and
sales to meet our contracted positions for 2016. We are fully contracted for 2016 at Pennyrile with
1.2 million tons forecast to be produced and sold this year. We are confident Pennyrile will be a
positive cash flow provider for the Partnership for the remainder of 2016 at these production and
sales levels. Pennyrile gives us additional diversification and we expect it to be a significant
generator of stable cash flow as it ramps up to its full potential run rate of two million tons per
year.
In Northern Appalachia, our customers took delivery of additional shipments from our Hopedale
operation compared to the previous quarter as these customers fulfil their contracted tons that
were carried over from the prior year. The increased shipments helped improve our Northern
Appalachia results during the quarter. We continue to lower the cost structure at our Hopedale
operation, but we believe the ongoing production of low-priced natural gas in this region will
continue to reduce the demand for Northern Appalachia steam coals in the near term. We
continue to seek sales contracts for the remainder of Hopedale’s 2016 open sales position. Our
Sands Hill operation in Northern Appalachia continued to produce positive results in the quarter.
At Rhino Western, our Castle Valley operation performed well during the quarter providing
positive cash flow, which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year.”
Coal Operations Update
Pennyrile
●Pennyrile’s sales are fully contracted through 2016 and 2017 at current production levels.
    
 ●Productivity improvements at Pennyrile have lowered costs, improved coal recovery rates and
turned this operation into a positive cash flow producer during the first six months of 2016.
    
 ●Rhino’s Pennyrile operations produced approximately 342,000 tons during the second quarter
while coal sales were approximately 334,000 tons.
2
Northern Appalachia
●
For the second quarter, year-over-year coal revenues per ton increased slightly by $0.44 to
$57.21 due to a higher mix of higher priced tons shipped from our Hopedale operation during
the second quarter of 2016.
Sales volume was 161,000 tons, versus 253,000 tons in the prior year and 122,000 tons in the
prior quarter. Sales were lower year-to-year due to decreased sales volumes from our
Hopedale operation due to weak steam coal market conditions in Northern Appalachia caused
by low-priced natural gas.
●
Rhino Western
●
Coal revenues per ton in the quarter increased to $38.70 versus $37.59 in the prior year and
$38.08 in the prior quarter. Coal revenues per ton increased due to higher contracted prices for
coal from Rhino’s Castle Valley mine. Sales volume was 215,000 tons versus 268,000 tons in
the prior year and 252,000 tons in the prior quarter.
●
Cost of operations per ton was $29.54 versus $34.16 in the prior year and $32.48 in the prior
quarter. Castle Valley had lower maintenance and other expenses in the current quarter, which
led to the quarter-to-quarter decrease in cost of operations per ton.
Central Appalachia
●
Coal revenues per ton in the quarter was $63.03 versus $58.65 in the prior year and $56.00 in
the prior quarter. Metallurgical coal revenue per ton in the quarter was $83.72 versus $81.83 in
the prior year and $81.61 in the prior quarter. Steam coal revenue in the quarter was $51.99 per
ton versus $52.57 in the prior year and $51.02 in the prior quarter. Sales volume was 88,000
tons in the quarter versus 233,000 in the prior year and 100,000 tons in the prior quarter.
●Cost of operations per ton in the quarter was $33.95 versus $54.95 in the prior year and $29.99
in the prior quarter.
Asset Impairment
The Partnership’s Elk Horn coal leasing company is located in eastern Kentucky and provides
the Partnership with coal royalty revenues from coal properties owned by Elk Horn and leased to
third party operators. The ongoing weakness in the central Appalachia steam coal markets has
adversely affected the price and demand for steam coal produced by operators that mine coal on
the Elk Horn properties. Thus, Elk Horn’s royalty revenues have also declined as the operators
produce less coal and prices for steam coal are depressed. During the second quarter of 2016,
the Partnership received an inquiry from a third party interested in purchasing Elk Horn. Based
upon the price offered by the third party and the continued deterioration of the central Appalachia
steam coal markets that has adversely affected Elk Horn’s financial results, the Partnership
decided to evaluate the Elk Horn assets for potential impairment as of June 30, 2016. The
Partnership recorded total asset impairment charges of approximately $118.7 million related to
the Elk Horn long-lived asset group during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Capital Expenditures
●Maintenance capital expenditures for the second quarter were approximately $0.2 million.
●Expansion capital expenditures for the second quarter were approximately $1.7 million.

Evaluating Financial Results
Rhino management uses a variety of financial measurements to analyze the Partnership’s
performance, including (1) Adjusted EBITDA, (2) coal revenues per ton and (3) cost of operations
per ton.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before deducting interest expense,
income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization, while also excluding certain non-
cash and/or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a
measure of the operating performance of the Partnership’s segments. Adjusted EBITDA should
not be considered an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from
operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in
accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA identically, the
Partnership’s calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
(Refer to “Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA” included later in this release for reconciliations of
Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures).
Coal Revenues Per Ton. Coal revenues per ton sold represents coal revenues divided by tons
of coal sold. Coal revenues per ton is a key indicator of Rhino’s effectiveness in obtaining
favorable prices for the Partnership’s product.
Cost of Operations Per Ton. Cost of operations per ton sold represents the cost of operations
(exclusive of depreciation, depletion and amortization) divided by tons of coal sold. Rhino
management uses this measurement as a key indicator of the efficiency of operations.

Overview of Financial Results
Results for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included:
●
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $4.5 million and net loss from continuing
operations of $121.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $4.1
million and a net loss from continuing operations of $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Approximately $118.7 million of asset impairment charges impacted the net loss for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016.
●
Basic and diluted net loss per common unit from continuing operations of $13.42 compared to
basic and diluted net loss per common unit from continuing operations of $2.73 for the second
quarter of 2015.
●
Coal sales were 0.8 million tons, which was a decrease of 18.5% compared to the second
quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower sales from Central Appalachia due to weak demand for
met and steam coal from this region.
●Total revenues and coal revenues of $42.8 million and $39.1 million, respectively, compared to
$56.8 million and $48.5 million, respectively, for the same period of 2015.
    
 ●Coal revenues per ton of $49.01 compared to $49.51 for the second quarter of 2015, a
decrease of 1.0%.
    
 ●Cost of operations from continuing operations of $33.9 million compared to $47.3 million for the
same period of 2015.
    
 ●Cost of operations per ton from continuing operations of $42.43 compared to $48.33 for the
second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 12.2%.
Total coal revenues decreased approximately 19.3% primarily due to fewer steam coal tons sold
in Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales from the Pennyrile mine in the Illinois
Basin. Coal revenues per ton decreased primarily because of lower prices for steam coal sold in
Central Appalachia in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, as well
as the larger mix of lower priced tons from the Pennyrile mine. Total cost of operations decreased
primarily due to lower costs in Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia as production was
reduced in these regions in response to weak market demand, partially offset by increased costs
from higher production at the Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin. The decrease in the cost of
operations on a per ton basis was primarily due to a decrease from Central Appalachia as coal
was produced from lower cost operations during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the same period in 2015.
Results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included:
●
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $11.1 million and net loss from continuing
operations of $123.2 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $9.6
million and a net loss from continuing operations of $12.7 million in the first six months of 2015.
Approximately $118.7 million of asset impairment charges impacted the net loss for the six
months ended June 30, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and net loss from continuing operations for the
first six months of 2016 were benefited by approximately $3.9 million from a prior service cost
benefit resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at the Partnership’s
Hopedale operation. Including net income from discontinued operations of approximately $0.7
million, total net loss and Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $12.0
million and $10.3 million, respectively. Rhino did not have any income or loss from
discontinued operations in the first six months of 2016.
●
Basic and diluted net loss per common unit from continuing operations of $26.57 compared to
basic and diluted net loss per common unit from continuing operations of $4.18 for the first six
months of 2015.
●
Coal sales were 1.6 million tons, which was a decrease of 14.2% compared to the first six
months of 2015, primarily due to lower sales from Central Appalachia due to weak demand for
met and steam coal from this region, partially offset by increased sales from the Pennyrile
operation.
5
●Total revenues and coal revenues of $83.2 million and $75.8 million, respectively, compared to
$112.9 million and $94.0 million, respectively, for the same period of 2015.
    
 ●Coal revenues per ton of $47.72 compared to $50.77 for the first six months of 2015, a
decrease of 6.0%.
●Cost of operations from continuing operations of $63.3 million compared to $93.5 million for the
same period of 2015.
●Cost of operations per ton from continuing operations of $39.86 compared to $50.47 for the first
six months of 2015, a decrease of 21.0%.
Total coal revenues decreased approximately 19.4% primarily due to fewer steam coal tons sold
in Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales from the Pennyrile mine in the Illinois
Basin. Coal revenues per ton decreased primarily because of lower prices for steam coal sold in
Central Appalachia in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, as well
as the larger mix of lower priced tons from the Pennyrile mine. Total cost of operations decreased
primarily due to lower costs in Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia as production was
reduced in these regions in response to weak market demand, partially offset by increased costs
from higher production at the Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin. The decrease in the cost of
operations on a per ton basis was primarily due to a decrease from the Pennyrile mine in the
Illinois Basin as production was increased and optimized during the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015, as well as a $3.9 million benefit in Northern
Appalachia during the six months ended June 30, 2016 from a prior service cost benefit resulting
from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at the Hopedale operation.

Forward Looking Statements
Except for historical information, statements made in this press release are “forward-looking
statements.” All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press
release that address activities, events or developments that Rhino expects, believes or
anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including the
statements and information included under the heading “Coal Operations Update.” These
forward-looking statements are based on Rhino’s current expectations and beliefs concerning
future developments and their potential effect on Rhino’s business, operating results, financial
condition and similar matters. While management believes that these forward-looking statements
are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting
Rhino will turn out as Rhino anticipates. Whether actual results and developments in the future
will conform to expectations is subject to significant risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many
of which are beyond Rhino’s control or ability to predict. Therefore, actual results and
developments could materially differ from Rhino’s historical experience, present expectations
and what is expressed, implied or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, the following: Rhino’s inability to obtain additional financing
necessary to fund its capital expenditures, meet working capital needs and maintain and grow its
operations or its inability to obtain alternative financing upon the expiration of its credit facility;
Rhino’s future levels of indebtedness, liquidity and compliance with debt covenants; volatility and
recent declines in the price of Rhino’s common units; sustained depressed levels of or decline in
coal prices, which depend upon several factors such as the supply of domestic and foreign coal,
the demand for domestic and foreign coal, governmental regulations, price and availability of
alternative fuels for electricity generation and prevailing economic conditions; declines in
demand for electricity and coal; current and future environmental laws and regulations, which
could materially increase operating costs or limit Rhino’s ability to produce and sell coal;
extensive government regulation of mine operations, especially with respect to mine safety and
health, which imposes significant actual and potential costs; difficulties in obtaining and/or
renewing permits necessary for operations; the availability and prices of competing electricity
generation fuels; a variety of operating risks, such as unfavorable geologic conditions, adverse
weather conditions and natural disasters, mining and processing equipment unavailability,
failures and unexpected maintenance problems and accidents, including fire and explosions
from methane; poor mining conditions resulting from the effects of prior mining; the availability
and costs of key supplies and commodities such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives; fluctuations
in transportation costs or disruptions in transportation services, which could increase competition
or impair Rhino’s ability to supply coal; a shortage of skilled labor, increased labor costs or work
stoppages; Rhino’s ability to secure or acquire new or replacement high-quality coal reserves
that are economically recoverable; material inaccuracies in Rhino’s estimates of coal reserves
and non-reserve coal deposits; existing and future laws and regulations regulating the emission
of sulfur dioxide and other compounds, which could affect coal consumers and reduce demand
for coal; federal and state laws restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases; Rhino’s ability to
acquire or failure to maintain, obtain or renew surety bonds used to secure obligations to reclaim
mined property; Rhino’s dependence on a few customers and its ability to find and retain
customers under favorable supply contracts; changes in consumption patterns by utilities away
from the use of coal, such as changes resulting from low natural gas prices; changes in
governmental regulation of the electric utility industry; Rhino’s ability to successfully diversify its
operations into other non-coal natural resources; disruption in supplies of coal produced by
contractors operating Rhino’s mines; defects in title in properties that Rhino owns or losses of
any of its leasehold interests; Rhino’s ability to retain and attract senior management and other
key personnel; material inaccuracy of assumptions underlying reclamation and mine closure
obligations; and weakness in global economic conditions.
9
Other factors that could cause Rhino’s actual results to differ from its projected results are
described in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual
Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date hereof. Rhino undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, unless required by law.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership recorded a provision
for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.1 million related to Elk Horn lessee customers in
Central Appalachia. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Partnership
recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, related to Elk Horn lessee customers in Central Appalachia. The Partnership
believes that the isolation and presentation of these specific items to arrive at Adjusted
EBITDA is useful because it enhances investors’ understanding of how the Partnership’s
management assesses the performance of the business. The Partnership believes the
adjustment of these items provides investors with additional information that they can utilize in
evaluating the Partnership’s performance. Additionally, the Partnership believes the isolation
of these items provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of
the Partnership’s operating results.
 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership recorded an asset

recorded an asset impairment loss of approximately $2.2 million for its Cana Woodford mineral
rights since the Partnership classified this asset as held for sale as of June 30, 2015. The
