<p><i>Summary 
</i> From 24 to 28 May 2010, the independent expert on the issue of human rights 
obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation conducted a mission to 
Slovenia to assess the way in which the State is implementing its human rights obligations 
related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. In the present report, she notes that, 
although overall the country enjoys very high levels of access to water and sanitation, 
certain members of the population do not enjoy equal levels of access or otherwise face 
challenges. She expresses particular concern about the enjoyment of the right to water and 
sanitation for the Roma population in Slovenia. The independent expert will present a full 
report on the mission to the Human Rights Council when she next reports.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 24 to 28 May 2010, the independent expert on the issue of human rights 
obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de 
Albuquerque, conducted a mission to Slovenia with the aim of assessing the way in which 
the State implemented its human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert thanks the Government of Slovenia for the invitation to visit 
the country and the excellent cooperation demonstrated in the preparation of and during the 
mission. She expresses her appreciation for the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
facilitating meetings with the actors that she requested to meet. She was honoured to be 
received by the President of the Republic, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for 
the Environment, the Ombudsman and other senior officials. She also met with 
representatives of the Office of National Minorities, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of 
the Environment and Spatial Planning, the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs 
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meetings were also held with non-governmental 
organizations, academics and individuals who had faced challenges in their access to 
drinking water and sanitation. The independent expert visited a water treatment plant in 
Koper, and a drinking water plant and wastewater treatment plant in Ljubljana. She also 
travelled to Dolenjska, where she visited Roma settlements in Ribnica, Trebnje, Novo 
Mesto and &#352;kocjan. In Trebnje and Novo Mesto, she met with the mayors and other 
municipal officials. The independent expert expresses her gratitude to everyone who agreed 
to meet with her and who assisted her in achieving a better understanding of the situation of 
human rights, drinking water and sanitation in Slovenia. She was especially moved by the 
personal stories shared, and thanks the individuals concerned for agreeing to meet with her.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The human rights to water and sanitation at the national and 
international levels 
</b></p>
<p>3. The human rights to water and sanitation, protected under the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, require that they are available, 
accessible, affordable and of good quality to all. These rights must be guaranteed in a non-
discriminatory manner. Ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and to sanitation is 
closely related to the enjoyment of other human rights, including the rights to education, 
work, health, housing and food. 
</p>
<p>4. Although the rights to water and sanitation are not specifically mentioned in the 
Constitution of Slovenia, the interlocutors with whom the independent expert met indicated 
that the right to water enjoyed constitutional protection. Significantly, the Constitution 
specifies that international treaties shall be applied domestically. Furthermore, the 
independent expert was informed that a Constitutional Court decision interpreted the right 
to water through the right to private property protected under article 33 of the Constitution, 
which is understood broadly to cover also the basic needs for an adequate life. 1  The 
Constitution also refers to other entitlements closely related to water, such as the right to a 
healthy living environment,2 the right to health care3 and the obligation of the State to

</p>
<p>provide opportunities for citizens to obtain proper housing.4  Slovenia has consistently 
demonstrated its commitment to the rights to water and sanitation at the international level. 
This commitment was reiterated in meetings at the highest levels during the mission.  
</p>
<p>5. The responsibility for water and sanitation extends across several ministries, 
including the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning, the Ministry of Health and 
the Government Office for Local Self-Government and Regional Policy. Numerous 
regulations govern the legal framework pertaining to water and sanitation, including the 
Water Act,5 the rules on criteria for determining a drinking water protection area,6 the 
Environmental Protection Act, the Spatial Planning Act 7  and the Housing Act. 8 
Municipalities have the primary obligation to ensure the drinking water supply and the 
discharge and treatment of wastewater9 for all people within their jurisdiction. Furthermore, 
as a member of the European Union, Slovenia is also obliged to conform with standards 
regarding water and sanitation set at the European Union level, in particular with regard to 
water quality and wastewater treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>6. Nearly 100 per cent of the population have access to safe drinking water, and 92 per 
cent are connected to the public water supply system. There is a thorough system of water-
quality testing implemented at the national and municipal levels, and the tap water in 
Slovenia meets European Union standards. Furthermore, the Government&#8217;s constant 
monitoring of groundwater resources available for current and future generations is an 
impressive achievement that allows the country to know exactly how much water it is using 
and to predict and avoid future situations of water scarcity. Slovenia also has a strict regime 
of water protection zones to prevent contamination of water sources by agriculture, industry 
and other activities, which restricts or prohibits certain activities in protected areas. Overall, 
the independent expert concludes that Slovenia has a good framework and system in place 
for ensuring the provision of safe drinking water to the general population.  
</p>
<p>7. With regard to sanitation, more than 50 per cent of the population are connected to a 
wastewater treatment facility, and this proportion is steadily increasing thanks to significant 
efforts made by the Government in this area. Those who do not have sewerage generally 
have cesspools, which also hygienically separate human excreta from human and animal 
contact, thus meeting some important dimensions of the human rights requirements 
concerning sanitation. 
</p>
<p>8. Generally speaking, pollution of groundwater is not a widespread problem. 
However, in certain areas, worrying levels of pollution were reported by both Government 
and non-governmental sources. Pesticides, nitrates and industrial contaminants are some of 
the pollutants found in the north-eastern region of the country, as well as in Celje. The 
independent expert received information about pollution in Celje reportedly having an 
impact on the health of the population. The Government has taken measures in these 
regions to ensure that the water used for drinking and other personal uses does not pose a

</p>
<p>threat to human health. The independent expert encourages the Government to continue to 
guarantee access to safe drinking water in these regions, and to work with the communities 
concerned to find sustainable solutions to the pollution problems. She also encourages the 
Ministry of the Environment to continue its efforts, in cooperation with the Ministry of 
Agriculture, to change agricultural practices and eliminate the use of harmful substances 
that threaten the broader environment.  
</p>
<p>9. Concern was also expressed about the sustainability of cesspools and other older 
sanitation systems, namely because of seepage into the soil owing to deteriorating 
materials. The activities described by the Government indicate that it is making significant 
efforts to meet the requirements of the European Union Wastewater Directive, but these 
efforts will need to be maintained, and even strengthened, if they are to meet human rights 
standards. Inadequate wastewater treatment poses a serious threat to the environment, 
including to water resources. The independent expert encourages the Government to 
continue to pay priority attention to this issue.  
</p>
<p>10. While water resources in Slovenia are abundant, with the luxury of significant 
groundwater resources and a high precipitation rate, some areas of the country experience 
water stress during certain seasons. For example, in the coastal region, where tourism 
causes water consumption to almost double in the summer period, the only water source in 
the region is insufficient to meet demand. The water provider has arranged to buy water 
from other sources, including from abroad, to address this situation. A more sustainable 
solution is needed, however, since that source may not be available for purchase 
indefinitely. The Government will need to help local municipalities to find alternatives to 
address changing water availability.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Access to water and sanitation for specific groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. People living in poverty 
</b></p>
<p>11. According to official statistics, about 240,000 people in Slovenia were at risk of 
poverty in 2008. The number of people registered to receive social benefits has been 
increasing steadily, with almost 14,000 new beneficiaries since 2002. The unemployed and 
one-member households experienced the highest levels of poverty.10  However, poverty 
levels may be much higher, since the manner by which poverty thresholds are established 
depends on seeking information from a sample of the population. Reportedly, those without 
an official address (because they live in an illegal building, in a shelter or are homeless), are 
not captured in these samples. Furthermore, the methodology, which is a standard European 
Union method, may set the poverty threshold at an artificially high level, depending on the 
distribution of wealth in society, since it establishes the threshold in relation to a median 
rather than to an average income.  
</p>
<p>12. People living in poverty in Slovenia face potential problems when paying for basic 
services, including water and sanitation. With social assistance amounts defined at the 
national level (currently set at &#8364; 227 per month; the recently adopted Financial Social 
Assistance Act is set to raise the amount to &#8364; 288 per month) and different water and 
sanitation prices being defined by the municipalities, these affordability issues may be 
worse in some regions than in others. For instance, experts have suggested that the cost of 
</p>
<p>  
 10 See www.stat.si/eng/novica_prikazi.aspx?id=2032. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation services should not exceed 3 per cent of a household&#8217;s income.11 In 
Ljubljana, the reported price of water is &#8364; 1.21 (2009) per cubic metre (in 2010, &#8364; 1.786 per 
cubic metre). A family of four on social assistance would require 12 cubic metres per 
month for basic needs (equal to about 100 litres per day per person), meaning that they 
would pay at least &#8364; 14.5 per month, or more than 6 per cent, of their income for these 
services. Other regions have higher prices than Ljubljana for water and sanitation services, 
and may thus present even starker examples of the affordability problems that can arise. 
The Government must make sure that access to safe drinking water and sanitation does not 
jeopardize a person&#8217;s ability to enjoy other basic rights, such as the rights to health, housing 
and food. In this context, the independent expert encourages the Government to establish an 
independent regulator for water and wastewater that would control pricing, quality and 
service performance in an independent manner. She notes with appreciation that plans for 
such a regulator are already under discussion.  
</p>
<p><b> B. &#8220;Erased&#8221; people 
</b></p>
<p>13. Immediately following independence, a law was passed in Slovenia determining that 
non-Slovene citizens from other republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
would lose their permanent resident status unless they acquired Slovenian citizenship. 
Three requirements had to be met to that effect, including that the person applied for 
citizenship within six months of the Citizenship Act entering into force. According to 
official data, 171,132 citizens of the former Yugoslav republics living in Slovenia applied 
for and were granted citizenship of the new State under section 40 of the Citizenship Act. It 
is estimated that an additional 11,000 persons left Slovenia.12 
</p>
<p>14. Those who either failed to apply for Slovenian citizenship within the prescribed time 
limit or whose requests were not granted became subject to the Aliens Act and had their 
names deleted from the Register of Permanent Residents and transferred to the Register of 
Aliens without a Residence Permit. According to information obtained during the mission, 
persons whose names were removed from the Register received no official notification.13 
They only later became aware that they had become aliens when, for example, they 
attempted to renew their personal documents (personal identification card, passport or 
driving licence). Without identification documents or residency permits, these &#8220;erased&#8221; 
persons became illegal residents in Slovenia, and their access to housing, work, basic 
services, health services and social security were limited, a serious violation of their 
economic, social and cultural rights. This situation also affected their ability to connect 
legally to the water and sewage networks.  
</p>
<p>15. Following a decision of the Constitutional Court in 2003,14 the Minister for the 
Interior made important efforts to issue retroactive residence permits to the above-
mentioned persons, with effect from 1992. In June 2010, the Act on Changes and 
Amendments to the Act governing the Status of the Citizens from other Successor States to 
the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia living in Slovenia was enacted,15 and 
the Act on arranging the Status of the Citizens from other Successor States to the former 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia living in Slovenia was enacted in July 2010. The

</p>
<p>Constitutional Court has indicated that the provisions of the latter Act would be in line with 
its decision from 2003; 16  implementation of this Act is thus vital to resolving the 
outstanding issue of &#8220;erased&#8221; people. The independent expert welcomes these recent 
developments and encourages the Government to regularize the situation of the remaining 
members of this population group without delay, and to recognize the human rights 
violations that they have suffered as well.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Roma 
</b></p>
<p>16. Official statistics report that 3,000 Roma people live in Slovenia, although other 
estimates put the number as high as 10,000. There are approximately 105 Roma settlements 
in Slovenia, with the majority of Roma people living in Prekmurje and Dolenjska. 
According to the findings of an analysis on the theme &#8220;Territorial issues of Roma 
settlements in Slovenia&#8221; and prepared in 2007 by an expert group tasked to deal with the 
spatial problems of Roma settlements, about 10 per cent of settlements should be relocated 
because they are situated in a hazardous area. About 21 settlements have no access to water, 
and many of them also have no access to sanitation. Notably, in March 2010, the 
Government adopted a new integrated national programme of measures for Roma for the 
period 2010-2015, of which one of the main strategic goals is improving the living 
conditions of the Roma community.  
</p>
<p>17. The impact of the lack of access to water and sanitation on these communities is 
devastating. The individuals with whom the independent expert met explained that they 
were systematically ill with diarrhoea and other diseases. In one community with no access 
to water, the people drank from a polluted stream or had to walk for two hours to obtain 
safe water. They collected water in jerricans, which they hauled back to their homes. 
Moreover, with no other option, they were forced to defecate in the open. Such a situation 
is astonishing in a country where so much has been achieved for the vast majority of the 
population.  
</p>
<p>18. The implications of the lack of access to water and sanitation for hygiene are 
particularly serious. Many people explained how their children went to school but 
eventually dropped out because they were ashamed of not being able to wash and were 
therefore teased by other schoolchildren about their odour. Similarly, adults faced 
difficulties in finding work when they had no way of maintaining minimum standards of 
hygiene. Women face particular issues when they are menstruating, and those interviewed 
expressed a feeling of shame for the conditions in which they had to practice their 
menstrual hygiene.  
</p>
<p>19. Although the situation of the Roma minority in Slovenia is a difficult and complex 
issue, the independent expert notes with appreciation that some municipalities have found 
positive ways to address it. For example, almost all settlements in the north-eastern part of 
the country have access to these most basic services and report higher levels of integration 
of the Roma community into the local population. In a settlement in Trebnje visited by the 
independent expert, important efforts had been made to ensure that the community was 
connected to water and sanitation. Furthermore, the community was working with the 
municipality to legalize the land and buildings where they lived, which will represent a 
longer-term solution to their situation. Less than 30 minutes away, however, other 
municipalities had failed to find similar solutions. Such discrepancies are unacceptable, and

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.2

<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>the independent expert calls on the Government to take urgent action to ensure that all 
people in Slovenia have access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This could be 
achieved by earmarking some of the funds that municipalities receive to extend access to 
these communities, and by the exchange of good practices between municipalities and with 
other European countries with Roma communities. Furthermore, swift and decisive action 
must be taken against all forms of discrimination, including discrimination based on 
ethnicity.    
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>20. In the present note, the independent expert has highlighted the main issues 
examined during her mission to Slovenia. Overall, she found that Slovenia ensured the 
enjoyment of the rights to water and sanitation for the vast majority of the 
population. However, special attention is needed for the most vulnerable groups, and 
immediate steps are required to ensure access for certain Roma communities. 
Slovenia has the expertise, experience and resources to ensure that these communities 
enjoy the same human rights as the rest of the population. 
</b></p>
<p><b>21. The independent expert will present a full report to the Council when she next 
reports, and looks forward to continuing her dialogue with the Government of 
Slovenia.
