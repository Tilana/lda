<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 25 and 26 June 2012, the Human Rights Council panel discussion on women&#8217;s 
human rights took place pursuant to resolution 6/30, in which the Council decided to 
incorporate sufficient and adequate time, at minimum an annual full-day meeting, to 
discuss the human rights of women, including measures that can be adopted by States and 
other stakeholders, to address human rights violations experienced by women. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 17/11 the Human Rights Council decided to include in the annual full-
day discussion on women&#8217;s human rights, at its twentieth session, the theme of remedies, 
with a focus on transformative and culturally sensitive reparations for women who have 
been subjected to violence. The Council, in its resolution 20/12, welcomed the 2012 annual 
discussion on women&#8217;s rights, and in paragraph 11, requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a summary report of 
the proceedings, including conclusions and recommendations made by participants, to be 
submitted to the Council at its twenty-first session. 
</p>
<p>3. Pursuant to resolution 17/11, OHCHR organized two panels: one on remedies and 
reparations for women who have been subjected to violence (Panel I) and one on protecting 
women human rights defenders (Panel II). Panel I discussions focused on promising 
practices and challenges in addressing issues and measures taken to provide effective, 
prompt, just, transformative and culturally sensitive reparations for women who have been 
subjected to violence in different contexts. Panel II focused on women human rights 
defenders; participants discussed existing efforts and practices with regard to prevention 
and the protection of women human rights defenders, including the adoption of national 
plans and development of gender-specific mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>4. The following summary of discussions sets out the main issues raised during the 
discussions, including conclusions and recommendations which could be useful to the 
continuing consideration of the theme of reparations for women who experience violence. 
The present summary is aimed at capturing the main points raised by the panellists. As 
separate but related issues were addressed throughout the course of the annual full-day 
discussions, the summary presents a separate record of the discussions for the two panels 
and groups them under specific themes.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Panel I: Remedies and reparations for women who have been 
subjected to violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening statements 
</b></p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, opened the discussion by 
recalling Human Rights Committee general comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the 
general legal obligation on States parties to the Covenant, in which the Committee stated 
that without reparations, the obligation of States to provide effective remedies was not 
discharged (para. 16). She stressed that in addition to compensation, reparations 
encompassed restitution, rehabilitation, measures of satisfaction and guarantees of non-
repetition. The High Commissioner highlighted and welcomed progress in the area of the 
conceptualization of gender-sensitive reparations, including the 2007 Nairobi Declaration </p>


<p>on Women&#8217;s and Girls&#8217; Rights to a Remedy and Reparation1 and the report by the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, on reparations 
(A/HRC/14/22), as well as other current developments in reparation policies and measures. 
The High Commissioner also recalled some of the general principles and programmatic 
guidelines that had been developed to ensure reparation measures were guided by non-
discrimination and gender-specific considerations. Those included, inter alia, ensuring that 
women and girls are adequately informed of their rights to reparations; that violations 
targeting women and girls are properly included in reparation programmes; and that the 
definition of &#8220;victims&#8221; takes into account differences between women and their children 
and other dependants.  
</p>
<p>6. In the area of programmatic responses, the High Commissioner stressed that 
reparation processes should allow for women and girls to come forward when they are 
ready and the registration processes should take into account obstacles women may face if 
displacement is necessary or other costs are implicated. Furthermore, reparation processes 
must not expose women to further harm, stigmatization and ostracism and should take into 
account their safety and best interest at all times, including by ensuring confidentiality and 
avoiding public disclosure of violations suffered. The High Commissioner highlighted that 
reparation policies and measures should ensure that eligibility standards for reparations for 
victims of certain crimes, such as sexual violence, ensure inclusiveness and avoid re-
victimization. For example, the documentation required for restitution should take into 
account the greater difficulties faced by women in proving property titles. Gender 
considerations must be paramount in assessing the harm suffered. In the case of sexual 
violence and other gender-based crimes, the multidimensional and long-term consequences 
of the harm affecting women and girls, their families and their communities must be taken 
into account and addressed through multidisciplinary approaches. Furthermore, in deciding 
the form of reparations, a number of elements must be kept in mind, including, for example, 
existing obstacles and challenges women may face in owing land or receiving and 
managing money. 
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner further stressed that one overarching lesson that had been 
learned was the need to ensure genuine and informed participation of women in the design 
and delivery of reparations. Only women and girls themselves could determine what forms 
of reparation were best suited to their situation, what was culturally appropriate and did not 
expose them to further harm and victimization, what could lead to reconciliation, and what 
had the potential to address the underlying causes that exposed them to violence in the first 
place. Ensuring meaningful participation required an investment of time and resources to 
reach out to women and provide information in accessible and understandable formats.  
</p>
<p>8. The High Commissioner underlined the importance of the conclusions made by the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women in her report on reparations for women who 
have been subjected to violence, especially how guarantees of non-repetition offered the 
greatest potential for transforming gender relations, and the need for States to ensure that 
economic compensation and reintegration measures enhance the autonomy of women. 
</p>
<p>9. The High Commissioner emphasized that, while the conceptual framework had been 
advanced, there remained a gap between the conception and delivery of reparation 
programmes, and called for greater international accountability in order to bridge that gap. 
She urged the Human Rights Council to further engage with and advocate for increased 
commitment to ensure prompt, adequate and effective reparations for women who have 
been subjected to violence, at the international, regional and national levels.

<p>10. Andr&#225;s D&#233;k&#225;ny, Vice-President of the Human Rights Council, Permanent 
Representative of Hungary, reiterated the findings of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on 
reparations, in particular that reparations should strive to have a transformative potential, 
and welcomed the discussion as an opportunity to identify areas that required further study.  
</p>
<p>11. The moderator, Rashida Manjoo, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
emphasized that the law of remedies included two aspects: the substantive and the 
procedural, and highlighted the areas that the panellists were invited to focus on. She also 
thanked the panellists for making themselves available to share their expertise in different 
country contexts and areas of work. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Good practices in gender-responsive remedies 
</b></p>
<p>12. Patricia Guerrero, Director of the Liga de Mujeres Desplazadas, hailed the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights decision in the case of <i>Gonz&#225;lez</i> <i>et al. </i>(&#8220;<i>Cotton Field</i>&#8221;) <i>v</i>. 
<i>Mexico</i> as a historic reparation ruling that placed an obligation on States in the region to 
ensure that women victims of violence have full access to justice, including reparations. 
She briefly outlined three elements to the ruling: it reaffirmed that a lack of justice for 
women victims of violence amounted to gender discrimination; it formed part of the 
conceptual development of gender violence; and, through the provision of legal and 
political tools in the ruling, allowed for engagement with the judiciary and the executive to 
review public policy. Additionally, she noted that the ground-breaking ruling was also the 
result of civil society mobilization. Civil society was also involved in the monitoring of the 
implementation of the ruling and translation into the public policies of States. 
</p>
<p>13. Carla Ferstman, Director of REDRESS, referred to States&#8217; generic compensation 
schemes for victims of crimes, noting that they were not specifically designed to address 
violence against women, but rather catered to a wide array of crimes. Those compensation 
schemes were based on harm done and, in some circumstances, the method of assessing 
harm could have a negative impact on gender-based violence and sexual violence. She 
noted however that victims could access generic compensation schemes without the 
requirement of prosecution or conviction which, given the low rate of convictions in cases 
of gender-based violence, represented a potentially significant positive avenue through 
which women who experience violence could claim compensation. Ms. Ferstman 
underlined the importance of those schemes and called for States to critically reflect on and 
review how they could ensure that those schemes take into account the gendered nature of 
the harm suffered. 
</p>
<p>14. Chris Dolan, Director of the Refugee Law Project, briefed participants on progress 
in the understanding of reparations as combining physical and economic repair for victims 
with psychological and political healing in acknowledgment of past crimes. He however 
noted that the transformative potential of reparations had yet to be realized, and urged 
States to regard reparations within the transitional justice framework as of equal importance 
to prosecutions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Remedies in post-conflict settings 
</b></p>
<p>15. Ms. Ferstman compared the promising efforts being made by the International 
Criminal Court&#8217;s Trust Fund for Victims as regards complementing the narrow criminal 
prosecutorial process of the court with the reparation regime of the ad hoc International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. She noted that unlike the reparative function of the ad hoc 
court, the Trust Fund for Victims, in addition to implementing Court-ordered reparations 
awards against a convicted person when directed by the Court to do so, provided assistance </p>


<p>with physical rehabilitation, material support, and/or psychological rehabilitation to victims 
and their families in situations where the Court was active. 
</p>
<p>16. In his follow-up intervention, Mr. Dolan expressed doubts as to the effectiveness of 
the Trust Fund for Victims in ensuring the transformative nature of reparations, especially 
as it did not adequately address the collective nature of mass violence. Mr. Dolan called for 
a shift in the prioritization of resources by the international community and by States, 
irrespective of whether a country was resource poor or resource rich. He cited the example 
of Sierra Leone, where the ratio of spending on prosecution as opposed to reparation was 
100 to 1 &#8211; with $300 million spent for the Special Court and $3 million devoted to the 
reparation programme. That amounted to $35,000 per prosecution and $80 per victim. 
</p>
<p>17. Ms. Guerrero underlined that the lack of development could not be used as an 
excuse by States for lack of reparations, as they had a legal obligation in that sense and 
access to justice was essential for development and sustainable peace. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Remedies in traditional and informal justice processes 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, affirmed that 
mechanisms for reparations should strive to have a transformative potential so as to subvert 
rather than reinforce pre-existing patterns of structural subordination and systemic 
hierarchies. She noted that many informal justice models, ranging from those that operated 
independently of the justice system to fully institutionalized programmes, were built on 
foundations that had historically excluded women and had made it almost impossible for 
women to articulate their issues or to participate in decisions that had an impact on their 
rights. Ms. Shaheed expressed concern that those alternative forums may be replicating 
State subordination by providing legitimacy to non-formal influential groups, often without 
provision for appealing decisions. Care should, therefore, be taken to monitor customary 
dispute-resolution mechanisms to ensure that women are integrated and play an active role 
in the design, implementation and monitoring of those mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Shaheed stressed that issues of cultural sensitivity and cultural heritage could 
also impact on the implementation of non-formal justice mechanisms. For example, in 
many countries where there were multiple alternative systems of dispute resolutions, the 
decisions relating to which mechanisms and violations were sanctioned by the State further 
facilitated and entrenched existing discriminatory practices. She urged States to take those 
factors into account when considering and identifying culturally appropriate mechanisms. 
Ms. Shaheed called for further focus on transformative reparations that would not only 
address violence against women but also assess the outcomes and the impact on women of 
the implementation of reparation decisions.  
</p>
<p>20. With regard to non-formal justice mechanisms and administrative reparation orders, 
Ms. Ferstman noted that although significant progress had been made in developing a 
normative legal framework for ensuring that remedies were effective, prompt and specific, 
there continued to be a dichotomy between advancements in norms at the judicial level and 
decisions emanating from non-formal processes, most notably their frequent failure to 
protect women&#8217;s rights. It was critical, therefore, that States factor in that dichotomy when 
adopting or endorsing non-formal justice mechanisms.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Comments from States and non-governmental organizations on good 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>21. In the ensuing discussion, 35 State representatives, two United Nations entities and 
five representatives from non-governmental organizations made statements. Speakers </p>


<p>acknowledged that States bore ultimate responsibility and were obliged to act with due 
diligence vis-&#224;-vis violence against women, including by ensuring effective, prompt, just, 
transformative and culturally sensitive remedies and reparations for women who have been 
subjected to violence. They agreed that effective remedies entailed those complex 
considerations and that effective access to justice was a prerequisite to increasing women&#8217;s 
awareness of the available mechanisms. Speakers emphasized that remedies and reparations 
were a part of a comprehensive and holistic approach to eliminating violence against 
women that drew together prevention, protection and punishment alongside the rights of 
victims to assistance, compensation, rehabilitation and non-repetition.  
</p>
<p>22. In relation to developing reparation policies and programmes, a number of speakers 
called for the substantive participation of women who have been subjected to violence and 
civil society actors, such as women&#8217;s groups and community leaders, alongside men and 
boys, to ensure a holistic concept of remedies and reparations. Among reparation examples 
provided by States, it was argued that remedies and reparations included: social workers in 
police stations; shelters and crisis centres for abused women; financial support for legal-aid 
centres; mobile courts in isolated communities; programmes to raise public awareness; and 
the involvement of women in the decision-making processes of shaping policies and 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>23. Speakers requested that more effort be put into ensuring that remedies and 
reparations that are available to women victims of violence are specific to individual 
circumstances and culture in order to prevent discrimination, stigmatization and re-
victimization of victims of violence, particularly women victims of sexual violence. 
Speakers also urged for careful reflection on ingrained patriarchal norms, stereotyping and 
gender assumptions that contributed to the re-victimization of women who experience 
violence. There was discussion on challenges in developing consistent polices in view of 
differing countries&#8217; religious and cultural specificities and difficulties in ensuring linkages 
</p>
<p>between judicial and administrative reparation orders. In addition, questions were raised as 
regards the ways in which international mechanisms could contribute to ensuring that 
national reparation programmes and schemes engage with civil society; form part of good 
practices; and are adequately resourced. Furthermore, questions pertaining to effective 
communication and cooperation at the international, regional and national levels to counter 
underlying causes of discrimination were answered by the panellists. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>In their concluding remarks, panellists called for a shift in thinking on 
reparations for women who experience violence as a gender equality issue and called 
</b></p>
<p><b>on States to uphold their human rights obligations in that regard. Panellists called for 
</b></p>
<p><b>reparation programmes not to be limited to financial compensation, but to focus on 
</b></p>
<p><b>restoring the respect for and dignity of women who experience violence while ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>the transformative potential of mechanisms in catalysing new thinking that would 
</b></p>
<p><b>have a substantial impact on women</b>&#8217;<b>s lives and address the root cause of the violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>that women experience. 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Panel II: Protecting women human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening statements 
</b></p>
<p>25. The panel was opened by Mona Rishmawi, Chief of the Rule of Law, Equality and 
Non-Discrimination Branch, on behalf of the Deputy High Commissioner for Human </p>


<p>Rights, Kyung-wha Kang. In her opening remarks, Ms. Rishmawi stressed that the role and 
contribution of women human rights defenders was fully recognized by the international 
community, and that the specific risks and threats faced by women human rights defenders 
were well documented. She highlighted that women human rights defenders were subjected 
to the same risks as their male counterparts but that they were subjected to additional risks 
and threats due to their sex and the transgression of gender norms. However, protection 
mechanisms for human rights defenders did not respond to the specific needs of women 
human rights defenders in appropriate ways. Other obstacles highlighted in the statement 
included persistent gender stereotypes on the role of women human rights defenders in the 
public and private spheres and the existence of linkages between perpetrators and those in 
power. Ms. Rishmawi referred to various OHCHR activities aimed at ensuring support to 
and, where needed, also protection for, women human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>26. Ambassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, President of the Human Rights Council and 
moderator of the panel, reiterated the importance of the role of women human rights 
defenders to the work of the Council. The President recalled the report on women human 
rights defenders submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders to the Human Rights Council in 2011, in which the Special Rapporteur 
emphasized that where protection mechanisms existed for human rights defenders, they 
often lacked a gender-specific approach (A/HRC/16/44 and Corr.1, para. 92). The President 
noted that the panel offered an opportunity to enhance the understanding of the risks that 
women human rights defenders faced in carrying out their work, and the way in which 
protection mechanisms should be designed to respond to those gender-specific risks. She 
underlined that the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms (known as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders) provided 
an effective framework for the rights of human rights defenders, which must be guaranteed 
equally for women, and that understanding the gender dimensions of ensuring those rights 
was critical to guaranteeing effective protection to women human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender aspect of violence against human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Margaret 
Sekaggya, defined the threats and risks faced by women human rights defenders. She 
pointed out that both women and men human rights defenders faced the same risks but that, 
in addition, women were exposed to gender-specific risks, ranging from verbal abuse based 
on their gender to sexual violence, and that those forms of threats were particularly 
common in conflict situations. Ms. Sekaggya drew attention to the stigmatization of women 
human rights defenders, who were often perceived in their communities as challenging 
accepted social, cultural and religious norms as well as patriarchal systems that perpetuated 
harmful gender stereotypes. Globalization policies had also contributed to the targeting of 
women who advocated for the rights of minorities, indigenous peoples, lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual and transgender persons, and reproductive rights. She emphasized the link between 
militarization and an increase in sexual violence against women human rights defenders, 
especially in times of conflict. Ms. Sekaggya noted that the threats faced by women human 
rights defenders had multiple sources and stemmed primarily from social, cultural and 
religious norms, the effects of globalization and the militarization of society, especially in 
times of war.  
</p>
<p>28. In her intervention, Sunila Abeysekera, a member of the Executive Committee of the 
International Coalition of Women Human Rights Defenders, highlighted the ways in which 
women human rights defenders were targeted, as well as the root causes of those threats. 
Ms. Abysekera noted that the violations experienced by women human rights defenders 
related to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. She added that those </p>


<p>violations took place both in the private and public spheres and in all situations and were 
perpetrated by both State and non-State actors, including family members, private 
companies, transnational corporations and mercenaries. She reported that certain groups of 
women human rights defenders were increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Those women 
included those who defended the right of peoples to land, water and a clean environment; 
women who defended reproductive rights and rights relating to sexuality; women who 
advocated for equality and non-discrimination for non-normative individuals and 
communities; women who organized and mobilized communities; and women living in 
societies in transition. Ms. Abeysekera stressed that the context in which violations took 
place was as important as the nature of the violations. Those contexts included the existing 
societal framework of patriarchy and hetero-normativity, which justified violence against 
women and allowed violence to be perpetrated against women with impunity, alongside 
religious fundamentalism, extreme nationalist politics, the deterioration of democratic 
norms, the current global economic crisis, and the militarization of society and conflicts in 
every part of the world. Those contexts limited the capacity of women to promote and 
defend human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. International, regional and national mechanisms for the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Rapporteur on the rights of human rights defenders of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, Jos&#233; de Jes&#250;s Orozco, spoke of the recognition that the 
Commission had given to the issue of protection of women human rights defenders. He 
cited as evidence the establishment of a special office headed by a rapporteur; a resolution 
in which the General Assembly of the Organization of American States recognized the 
work of women human rights defenders in the region;2 and the creation of a network of 
human rights defenders by the Commission. The Commission had in place mechanisms for 
the protection of women human rights defenders, such as precautionary measures, public 
hearings, opinions issued on cases referring to the acts of States, and thematic hearings 
alongside thematic reports listing violations. Mr. Orozco expressed regret that the situation 
for women human rights defenders in some countries in the region had worsened due to 
gender stereotyping, discrimination and obstacles in the administration of justice, 
particularly in rural areas. He urged States and civil society to ensure that women human 
rights defenders are aware of existing protection mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>30. Nazar Abdelgadir, Executive Director of the Geneva Institute for Human Rights, 
commented on the role, challenges and outcomes of women in North Africa and the Middle 
East within the context of the current political transitions in the region. Mr. Abdelgadir 
stated that despite the very effective and active role played by women in overcoming legal, 
political, social and cultural challenges in creating change, women had yet to be fully 
recognized or included in decision-making. He insisted that women human rights defenders 
in the region should be fully consulted when States are designing protection mechanisms. 
Furthermore, he called for training of women human rights defenders in the region so as to 
allow them to be able to better claim and defend their rights.  
</p>
<p>  
 2 General Assembly of the Organization of American States, resolution 2067 (XXXV-O/05) of June 7 
</p>
<p>2005, para. 2. </p>


<p><b> D. Comments from States and non-governmental organizations on good 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>31. During the subsequent dialogue, statements from the floor were made by State 
representatives as well as by representatives from non-governmental organizations and 
United Nations entities. Speakers acknowledged the work carried out by the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, including her 2011 report to 
the Human Rights Council, which focused on the situation of women human rights 
defenders (A/HRC/16/44 and Corr.1). The majority of speakers acknowledged, with 
sympathy and concern, the gender-specific nature of human rights violations against 
women human rights defenders and applauded the courage shown by those women. The 
need for gender-specific protection mechanisms was widely agreed as needed in the context 
of existing inequality and discrimination against women. It was further emphasized that the 
responsibility for developing those mechanisms and the protection of women human rights 
defenders lay with States. In meeting that obligation, it was agreed that it was critical for 
States to cooperate and exchange good practices at the international, regional and national 
levels, as well as to actively engage with women human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>32. Several State representatives proposed in their interventions that, as agents of social 
transition and due to the specific violations targeted towards them, women human rights 
defenders should be engaged both in the development of those protection mechanisms and 
in the decision-making process of such programmes. Furthermore, States stressed the 
detrimental effect that impunity had on society, and noted the importance of punishing 
perpetrators of attacks against women human rights defenders, whether carried out by 
States or non-State actors in the private or in the public sphere. 
</p>
<p>33. Speakers made several recommendations as to how States and the United Nations 
system could build on and strengthen current efforts. Among the initiatives mentioned 
were: increased representation of women in decision-making positions; funding and grants 
for women rights defenders; enactment of laws enforcing a legal prohibition of attacks on 
women who are merely claiming or defending their rights or the rights of others; and 
ensuring the independence of judges and lawyers in the administration of justice. Regarding 
challenges and obstacles faced by women human rights defenders, speakers mentioned, 
among others, cultural, societal and religious barriers; a lack of adequate sex-disaggregated 
data to guide protection mechanisms; the reactive nature of many current systems; a lack of 
protection for family members; and the particular impact on women journalists acting as 
women human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>34. <b>The panel offered recommendations for helping women human rights 
defenders. Ms. Sekaggya pointed out that the intersectional and multiple forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination faced by women human rights defenders needed to be addressed so as 
</b></p>
<p><b>to foster the empowerment of those women. She called for gender-specific protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms for women, noting that the threats that they faced often exceeded those 
</b></p>
<p><b>experienced by their male counterparts. Ms. Sekaggya stressed that States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognize good practices and examples from programmes implemented at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic level to avoid duplication, and should work in closer cooperation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with human rights defenders themselves in the design of policies.</b>   
</p>
<p>35. <b>Ms. Abeysekera suggested that the fight against impunity was critical in 
combating violence against women and protecting women human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Regarding existing protection mechanisms, she noted that those mechanisms required 
</b></p>
<p><b>more constructive engagement with women human rights defenders and a shift away </b></p>


<p><b>from the perception of women human rights defenders as victims of violations, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>rendered their role as conscious agents and initiators of positive action invisible. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>also noted that effective mechanisms must address the specificity of each case as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as the broader social and political structures.  
</b></p>
<p>36. <b>Mr. Abdelgadir emphasized that countries in transition should implement 
protective measures so that women human rights defenders could continue working 
</b></p>
<p><b>without the risk of violence. 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>In their concluding remarks, the panellists referred to existing efforts and 
practices with regard to prevention and the protection of women human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders, including the adoption of national plans and the development of gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>specific mechanisms. The panellists urged the United Nations system to continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>pay particular attention to the implementation of the principle of civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in all its activities and to support national and regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes. They requested the Human Rights Council and States to publicly recognize 
</b></p>
<p><b>and support the work of women human rights defenders, including through 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising, the documentation of violations and good practices, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenging of stereotypes of women. This would forge a path towards equality in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas, including that of protection for women human rights defenders. Political will 
</b></p>
<p><b>was highlighted as a fundamental requirement for improving the protection of women 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders. The participants agreed that combatting impunity was 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical in combating violence against women and offered recommendations for 
</b></p>
<p><b>assisting women human rights defenders.
