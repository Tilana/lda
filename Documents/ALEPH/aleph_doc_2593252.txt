The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) dated August 4, 2016 is intended to supplement and complement the
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the quarter and the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. This
MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarter and six-month period
ended June 30, 2016, and our audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes for December 31, 2015 and the related
MD&A included in the 2015 Annual Report. All amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted and are in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), except for certain performance indicators that are not defined
under IFRS. For further information, please refer to section “Non-IFRS performance measures” on page 21 of this MD&A. With the
exception of troy ounces, the data on production is presented in metric units. More information on Richmont Mines Inc. (“Richmont Mines”,

forward-looking statements” on page 24.
OVERVIEW
Richmont Mines has produced over 1.6 million ounces of gold from its operations in Quebec, Ontario and Newfoundland since beginning
production. The Corporation currently produces gold from the Island Gold Mine in Ontario and the Beaufor Mine in Quebec. The
Corporation is also advancing development of the significant high-grade resource extension at depth of the Island Gold Mine in Ontario.
With 35 years of experience in gold production, exploration and development, and prudent financial management, the Corporation is well
positioned to cost effectively build its Canadian reserve base and to successfully enter its next phase of growth.
Richmont’s shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE MKT) under the symbol “RIC”.
The Corporation is headquartered in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, and has a corporate office in Toronto, Ontario.
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
Company-wide production was 23,320 ounces for the quarter, an 11% decrease over Q2 2015, primarily due to the depletion of the
Monique stockpile earlier this year. The Island Gold Mine produced 18,617 ounces of gold in the second quarter, a 24% increase
over Q2 2015, driven by record underground and mill productivity of 911 tonnes per day and 878 tonnes per day, respectively, as
well as a positive reconciliation (mined vs. reserves) of 19%.
Gold  sold  during  the  quarter  was  24,888  ounces,  a  decrease  of  10%  over  Q2  2015,  at  an  average  realized  price  of  $1,628
(US$1,263) per ounce.
Revenues for the quarter were $40.6 million (US$31.5 million), consistent with Q2 2015.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 3
Company-wide cash costs1 for the quarter were $903 per ounce (US$701 per ounce), a decrease of 7% over Q2 2015 and below
current guidance estimates. Cash costs for the Island Gold Mine were $766 per ounce (US$595 per ounce), a 20% decrease over
Q2 2015 and significantly below current guidance estimates.
Company-wide All-in-Sustaining Costs1 (“AISC”) for the quarter were $1,330 per ounce (US$1,032 per ounce), in-line with Q2 2015
and within current guidance estimates. AISC for the Island Gold Mine were $1,038 per ounce (US$806 per ounce), a 21% decrease
over Q2 2015 and significantly below current guidance estimates.
Earnings were $2.7 million, 8% lower than Q2 2015, or $0.04 per share (US$2.1 million, or US$0.03 per share).
Operating cash flow (after changes in non-cash working capital) of $14.9 million (US$11.5 million), or $0.25 per share (US$0.19 per
share), both in-line with Q2 2015.
Richmont ended the quarter with an increased cash balance of $95.5 million (US$73.4 million), which includes net proceeds of
$29.1 million (US$22.7 million) related to a bought-deal prospectus financing completed on June 7, 2016 and $3.0 million of net
free cash flow1.
Based on the success of the Phase 1 exploration program at the Island Gold Mine, the Corporation launched an aggressive 18 to 24
month Phase 2 drilling program of up to 142,000 metres, with an estimated 39,000 metres to be completed in the second half of
2016.
Based on the strong operational and cost performance in the first six months of the year, Richmont expects to meet, or exceed, the
high  end  of  production  guidance  and  the  low  end  of  cash  cost  and  AISC  guidance.  The  Corporation  will  determine  whether  a
revision to its 2016 guidance estimates is warranted following the completion of a scheduled 3- week electrical upgrade at the
Island  Gold  mill  and  the  commencement  of  stope  mining  in  the  Q  Zone  of  the  Beaufor  Mine,  both  expected  in  August.  It  is
anticipated that any update to guidance estimates would be released by mid- September.

Although Richmont Mines’ financial statements are reported in Canadian dollars, the Corporation also discloses financial and operating
statistics in US dollars. The Corporation’s operating results and cash flows are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian
dollar/US dollar exchange rate as the precious metals revenues are earned in US dollars and the majority of the operating costs are in
Canadian dollars. A weak Canadian currency helps most of Canadian mining operations to report lower US dollar costs. Richmont is
currently leveraging the weakened Canadian dollar to strategically accelerate the development of the deep resources at its Island Gold
Mine.
On a quarterly basis, the Canadian to U.S. exchange rate is adjusted to reflect the actual quarterly rate and year-to-date rate as at the end
of each quarter.
OUTLOOK
Based on the strong operational and cost performance in the first six months of the year, Richmont expects to meet, or exceed, the high
end of production guidance and the low end of cash cost and AISC guidance (see table “Production outlook and cost guidance for 2016”
on page 7).

A)     FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
REVIEW OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
The Island Gold Mine produced 18,617 ounces of gold in the second quarter, a 24% increase over the prior year period. The company-
wide production was 23,320 ounces for the quarter, an 11% decrease over the prior year period, mainly as a result of the depletion of the
Monique stockpile earlier this year. The processing of the Monique Mine stockpile contributed to 4,235 ounces of gold produced in the
second quarter of 2015.
Gold production (ounces)
Revenues for the quarter were $40.6 million (US$31.5 million), in-line with the same quarter of the prior year, as the higher realized sale
price per ounce for the quarter was offset by the impact of lower ounces sold as compared to the second quarter of 2015. A total of 24,888
ounces of gold were sold during the quarter at an average realized price of $1,628 (US$1,263) per ounce, versus 27,566 ounces of gold
sold at an average realized sale price of $1,468 (US$1,194) per ounce in the same quarter of 2015.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 7
Gold sales (ounces and average realized sale price per ounce)
Cost of sales, including depletion and depreciation, totaled $29.7 million (US$23.1 million) in the second quarter of 2016 versus $33.9
million (US$27.6 million) in the same quarter of 2015. Lower cost of sales as compared to the prior year period were impacted by the
depletion of the Monique Mine stockpile earlier this year, and lower production and reduced expensed development activities at the
Beaufor Mine during the quarter, partially offset by higher cost of sales at the Island Gold Mine. Operating costs at the Island Gold Mine
during the quarter were higher due to higher tonnage mined and milled, as compared to the same quarter of 2015. Depreciation at the
Island Gold Mine was also higher than the prior year period, as 28% more ounces of gold were sold during the quarter.
On a consolidated basis, cash costs per ounce decreased by 7% to $903 (US$701), from $974 (US$792) in the same quarter of the prior
year. The decrease was primarily due to the higher proportion of low-cost ounces from the Island Gold Mine during the second quarter of
2016. Lower costs per ounce at the Island Gold Mine, mainly attributable to 12% higher grades and higher productivity as compared to the
same quarter of 2015, were partially offset by lower production at the Beaufor Mine and the depletion of the Monique Mine stockpile in the
first quarter.
AISC per ounce increased by 2% to $1,330 (US$1,032) in the quarter, as compared to $1,304 (US$1,060) in the second quarter of 2015.
Sustaining costs were $10.6 million (US$8.2 million) for the quarter, 16% higher than the $9.1 million (US$7.4 million) incurred in the
same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher underground development costs at the Beaufor Mine and higher Corporate General
and Administration (“G&A”) costs.
Corporate G&A costs totaled $3.2 million (US$2.5 million) in the second quarter of 2016, a $1.1 million increase over the same quarter of
2015. G&A for the quarter increased mainly due to higher equity-based compensation resulting from the increased share price over same
quarter of 2015.
Non-sustaining project capital and expensed exploration of $11.7 million (US$9.1 million) were incurred during the quarter, which
included $7.9 million of accelerated underground development and $3.6 million of non-sustaining exploration drilling at the Island Gold
Mine.

For the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation recorded mining and income taxes of $0.5 million, which includes $0.4 million of income
tax payable, offset by a reduction of $0.7 million from the previous year, $0.1 million of Quebec Mining tax and a $0.7 million increase in
future mining taxes. The Corporation recorded mining and income taxes of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2015, including $0.4
million of income tax payable, $0.2 million of mining taxes and a $0.1 million increase in future mining taxes.
The Corporation generated net earnings of $2.7 million, or $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2016, an 8% decrease from net
earnings of $2.9 million, or $0.05 per share, generated in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease is attributable to higher exploration
costs at the Island Gold Mine and higher G&A costs, offset by a 63% increase in gross profit margin.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $14.9 million ($0.25 per share), in line with the prior year quarter. Net free cash
flow for the quarter was $3.0 million, or $0.05 per share, as compared to $7.4 million, or $0.13 per share, in the same quarter of the prior
year. The decrease reflects higher investments made at the Island Gold Mine during the quarter as compared to the prior year period.
B)     FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
Gold production for the six-month period was 55,689 ounces, a 7% increase over the comparable prior period. The higher production
levels include a 75% increase in gold production at the Island Gold Mine (45,206 ounces versus 25,761 ounces), offset by lower
production from the Beaufor Mine (9,318 ounces versus 15,045 ounces) and the Monique Mine (1,165 ounces versus 11,367 ounces).
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 9
Gold production (ounces)
Revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $93.3 million (US$70.1 million), 20% higher than revenues of $77.8 million
(US$62.9 million) in the comparable six-month period of 2015. The increase in revenues was mainly driven by 9% higher ounces of gold
sold and a 10% higher average realized gold price per ounce during the period. A total of 57,127 ounces of gold were sold during the six-
month period at an average realized sale price of $1,629 (US$1,225) per ounce, versus 52,357 ounces of gold sold at an average
realized sale price of $1,482 (US$1,200) per ounce in the comparable six-month period of 2015.
Gold sales (ounces and average realized sale price per ounce)
Cost of sales, including depletion and depreciation, for the six-month period totaled $65.0 million (US$48.9 million), a 3% increase over
the $63.3 million (US$51.3 million) incurred in the comparable period of 2015. Operating costs at the Island Gold Mine were higher during
the six-month period due to a 35% increase in tonnes mined and milled. Royalties and depreciation costs were higher at the Island Gold
Mine due to the 88% more ounces of gold sold as compared to the same period of the prior year. Operating costs at the Beaufor Mine
were lower due to 14% lower mine production and reduced development expensed during the period. There were no mining operations
at the Monique Mine during the period and the remaining stockpile pad was depleted in January 2016.
Consolidated cash costs per ounce for the six-month period decreased to $848 (US$637) from $976 (US$790) in the comparable six-
month period of 2015, mainly driven by the increase in ounces sold and a higher proportion of low-cost ounces from the Island Gold Mine.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 10
AISC for the period decreased to $1,200 (US$902), from $1,281 (US$1,037) in the comparable period of the prior year.
Sustaining costs were $20.1 million (US$15.1 million) for the six-month period, 26% higher than the $16.0 million (US$12.9 million)
incurred in the comparable six-month period of 2015, due to higher underground development costs at the Island Gold Mine and at the
Beaufor Mine as well as higher G&A costs.
Corporate G&A costs for the six-month period were $6.3 million (US$4.7 million), $2.2 million higher than G&A costs for the comparable
six-month period of 2015. In prior years, the Corporation granted annual equity-based compensation to Directors, senior officers and other
employees at the end of each fiscal year. During 2015, the Board of Directors amended the timing of equity-based awards to the first
quarter of the following year, after complete year-end operational and financial results were available. As a result, equity-based awards
granted for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were deferred until February 2016, which included granting Deferred Share Units
(“DSUs”) rather than options to the Board of Directors. The timing of these grants along with a higher share price during the period as
compared to the same period in 2015, resulted in a higher equity-based compensation amounts for the six-month period.
Non-sustaining project capital and exploration expense of $22.7 million (US$17.1 million) were incurred during the six-month period,
which included $10.3 million on advancing the accelerated underground development of the Island Gold Mine, $7.4 million in non-
sustaining exploration drilling at the Island Gold Mine and $5.0 million for other mining equipment, fixed assets and exploration.

RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 11
The Corporation generated net earnings of $11.2 million, or $0.19 per share in the first half of 2016, a 48% increase over net earnings of
$7.5 million, or $0.14 per share, in the comparable six-month period of 2015. The increase is attributable to the higher revenues for the
six-month period, partially offset by higher exploration and G&A costs.
Operating cash flow for the six-month period totaled $32.2 million or $0.54 per share, a 35% increase over the $23.8 million or $0.43 per
share generated in the six-month period of 2015. Net free cash flow for the six-month period was $4.1 million, or $0.07 per share, as
compared to $7.3 million, or $0.13 per share, in the six-month period of 2015. The decrease reflects higher investments at the Island Gold
Mine during the period.

Total tonnes mined at the Island Gold Mine were up 26% at 172,322 (1,894 tonnes per day (“tpd”)) as compared to 136,852 tonnes (1,504
tpd) in Q2 2015. Total ore mined during the quarter was a record 82,921 tonnes (911 tpd), of which 40,181 tonnes was development ore
and 42,740 tonnes was stope ore, indicating a development ore mined to total ore mined ratio of 48% versus a planned ratio of 40%. Total
waste mined was 89,401 tonnes (982 tpd), including the accelerated ramp development and advancing the exploration and delineation
drift on the 740 metre level. The mine plan for the quarter was focused in lower-grade areas of the mine where ore development activities
primarily occurred in the lower grade extensions of the second mining horizon. The forward-looking 2016 mine plan continues to forecast
development and stope mining at grades of between 7.0 and 7.5 g/t gold, using the December 2015 resource model capped at 95 g/t
gold.

The Island Gold Mine produced 18,617 ounces of gold during the second quarter of 2016, a 24% increase over the same quarter of 2015.
For the six-month period, the Island Gold Mine produced 45,206 ounces of gold, a 75% increase over the same period of 2015, achieving
67% of the higher end of its annual production guidance range of between 62,000 to 67,000 ounces, which incorporates a three-week
shutdown during the third quarter of the year.
Higher gold production during the quarter and the six-month period primarily due to higher mill throughput and higher grades realized.
During the second quarter, the mill achieved a record throughput of 79,924 tonnes (878 tpd), 12% higher than the 71,584 tonnes (787 tpd)
processed in the same quarter of 2015. For the six-month period, mill throughput was 155,830 tonnes (856 tpd), 35% higher than the
115,369 tonnes (637 tpd) in the comparable period of 2015.
For the second quarter, reconciliation of mine production to the reserve model indicates an 8% gain on tonnage and a 10% gain in
grades, for an overall gain of 19% on ounces. For the six-month period, the reconciliation to reserves indicates a 3% gain in tonnage, and
a 27% gain in grades, resulting in 31% higher ounces as compared to the reserve model. Approximately 89% of the total ore mined during
the period was mined in the first and second mining horizons of the deeper resources.
The average milled grade for the second quarter was 7.51 g/t gold, as compared to 6.73 g/t in the same quarter of the prior year. The
average milled grade for the six-month period was 9.36 g/t gold versus 7.16 g/t for the comparable period of 2015. The higher grades for
the six-month period was largely due to the positive reconciliation in grades over the reserve model.

Total ore mined at the Beaufor Mine during the second quarter was 26,026 tonnes, a decrease of 21% from the 32,741 tonnes mined
during the same quarter of 2015. For the six-month period, total ore mined decreased by 16% over the 65,802 tonnes mined in the
comparable period of 2015. The decrease in tonnes mined was mainly attributable to mechanical issues related to mining equipment and
lower than expected availability of economical ore from Zones M, MF and 12.
During the quarter, the Camflo Mill processed 28,281 tonnes of ore from the Beaufor Mine, 23% lower than the 36,914 tonnes processed
in the same quarter of 2015. Average grade for the quarter was 5.27 g/t gold, 13% lower than the average grade of the same quarter of
2015. Lower tonnage and grades resulted in quarterly gold production of 4,703 ounces, a 34% decrease over the 7,082 ounces produced
in Q2 2015.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 14
For the six-month period, the mill processed 57,599 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 5.11 g/t gold, as compared to 66,665 tonnes
processed at an average grade of 7.12 g/t in the comparable six-month period of 2015. Gold production for the six-month period was
9,318 ounces, 38% lower than production of 15,045 ounces in the comparable period of 2015, primarily as a result of lower than expected
tonnes and grade milled.
Gold ounces sold for the second quarter from the Beaufor Mine totaled 4,741 ounces at an average realized price of $1,635 (US$1,269)
per ounce, as compared to gold sales of 6,888 ounces at an average realized price of $1,455 (US$1,183) in the comparable quarter of
2015. Gold ounces sold for the six-month period totaled 9,778 ounces at an average realized price of $1,642 (US$1,234) per ounce, as
compared to gold ounces sold of 15,719 ounces at an average realized sale price of $1,474 (US$1,193) per ounce in the comparable
period of 2015.
Lower tonnes mined in the second quarter and six-month period resulted in lower operating costs as compared to the same quarter and
six-month period of the prior year. However, on a per ounce basis, cash costs were higher due to the lower number of ounces, as
compared to the second quarter and six-month period of 2015.
Cash costs per ounce in the second quarter of 2016 were $1,486 (US$1,154), a 40% increase over Q2 2015.
AISC per ounce of $1,899 (US$1,475) for the second quarter, 51% higher than Q2 2015, due to higher sustaining costs and lower gold
ounces sold during the quarter.
Sustaining costs for the second quarter 2016 were $2.0 million, which included $1.0 million for capitalized underground mine
development, $0.4 million for expensed exploration costs and $0.6 million of other sustaining costs.
For the six-month period, cash costs per ounce were $1,441 (US$1,083), 48% higher than the $973 (US$788) reported in the comparable
period of 2015.
AISC per ounce for the six-month period increased to $1,812 (US$1,362), from $1,113 (US$901) during the comparable period of 2015,
largely due to lower gold ounces sold and higher sustaining costs during the six-month period of 2016. Development of the higher-grade
Q Zone advanced during the quarter with stope mining planned for the third quarter. The higher grades planned from the Q Zone are
expected to increase production in the second half of the year, along with a corresponding decrease in cash costs and AISC.

There was no production from the Monique Mine during the second quarter of 2016, as the remaining stockpile pad was processed in the
first quarter of 2016 as compared to 4,235 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of 2015.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Camflo Mill processed 16,063 tonnes of the Monique stockpile pad at an average
grade of 2.31 g/t gold and produced 1,165 ounces of gold. During the comparable six-month period of 2015, the mill processed 125,764
tonnes of ore, which included material from its mid-grade stockpile at an average grade of 2.90 g/t gold and produced 11,367 ounces of
gold.
There were no gold sales in the quarter as all ounces produced in the first quarter were sold in that quarter. For the six-month period
1,171 ounces of gold were sold at an average realized sale price of $1,581 (US$1,189) per ounce, as compared to gold sales of 12,012
ounces at an average price of $1,491 (US$1,207) in the comparable period of 2015.
Cash costs for the six-month period were $1,185 (US$891) per ounce, which included non-cash charges of $715 per ounce related to
mining costs incurred and paid for in 2014, but which are accounted for when the resulting ounces are sold. Cash costs per ounce for the
comparable period of 2015 were $684 (US$554).
AISC for the six-month period were $1,189 (US$894) per ounce, as compared to $702 (US$569) for the comparable period in 2015.
Camflo Mill
Total ore processed at the Camflo Mill during the second quarter of 2016 was 66,415 tonnes, which is 33% lower than the 98,740 tonnes
of ore processed in the same quarter of 2015. During the quarter, the Camflo Mill processed 28,281 tonnes from the Beaufor Mine as
compared to 36,914 tonnes in the same quarter of the prior year. With the depletion of the stockpile pad at the Monique Mine in the first
quarter of 2016, there was no ore from Monique available for processing during the second quarter. Part of the excess capacity at the
Camflo Mill was used to custom mill 38,134 tonnes of ore from local mining companies in the Abitibi region of Quebec.
For the six-month period 138,851 tonnes of ore were processed, 28% lower than the 192,429 tonnes processed in the comparable period
of 2015. Ore from local mining companies accounted for 65,189 tonnes of the total ore processed during the first half of 2016.

The Corporation spent $3.6 million (US$2.8 million) on exploration and completed approximately 16,800 metres of drilling at the Island
Gold Mine during the second quarter of 2016, significantly higher than $0.6 million (US$0.5 million) incurred in the prior year quarter. For
the six-month period, approximately 38,500 metres of drilling were completed for total exploration costs of $7.4 million (US$5.6 million). At
the end of the second quarter, the Phase 1 exploration drilling program was completed.
The Phase 1 drilling program was launched in September 2015 and focused on three key priorities:
1)      test the lateral continuity of the known deposit to potentially extend mine life above the 1,000 metre level;
2)      follow up on gold intersections down plunge that support the potential for an extension of the deposit between the 1,000 and
1,500 metre levels; and
3)      test high-priority regional gold targets elsewhere across the prospective Island Gold property.
Phase 1 exploration program highlights:
1)      Lateral Exploration
As of June 30, 2016, approximately 50,100 metres of lateral exploration drilling had been completed. This includes 16,440 metres of
drilling from surface, 23,850 metres from the 450 and 620 metre underground levels, 2,612 metres from the underground 190 metre level
and 7,170 metres from the underground 340 metre level.
Favorable results from Phase 1 of lateral exploration program indicate a potential resource block located approximately 300 metres east
of the main deposit as well as a second contiguous mineralized zone identified 800 metres east of the main deposit.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 17
2)      Deep Directional Drilling
As of June 30, 2016, approximately 21,700 metres of deep directional drilling program had been completed, and high grade gold values
over wide zones continued to be intersected, confirming the interpreted high grade zone at depth.
Phase 1 deep directional drilling program also identified a potential new high-grade resource block located in the eastern down plunge
extension between the 900 and 1,250 metre levels, which shows similar geological characteristics as the main C Zone structure.
3)      Regional Surface Exploration
As of June 30, 2016, approximately 4,000 metres of the planned 7,500 metre Phase 1 regional exploration program had been completed.
This included drilling the former Kremzar Mine area, which tested the extension of the previously mined mineralization zone at depth.
Phase 2 exploration program
The results from the Phase 1 drilling program have met, or exceeded the Corporation’s objectives, which has supported the launch of an
aggressive Phase 2 exploration program of up to 142,000 metres that will be completed over the next 18 to 24 months. The Phase 2
exploration program will build on the success of the Phase 1 program and continue to advance three key priorities:
1)      continue to test the lateral continuity of the known deposit to the east of the main deposit to potentially add new resource
blocks with overall objective of expending mine life above the 1,000 metre level;
2)      identify the next million-plus ounce, high grade inferred resource in the vertical extension of the deposit between the 1,000
and 1,500 metre levels;
3)      continue to test high priority regional gold targets across the prospective Island Gold property.
Approximately 39,000 metres ($7.0 million) of the Phase 2 drilling program is expected to be completed in the second half of the year.
For more details, please refer the press release entitled “Strategic Phase 2 exploration program launched at Island Gold high-grade
resource potential identified laterally and at depth” dated July 7, 2016.
BEAUFOR MINE
The Corporation spent $0.4 million (US$0.3 million) on sustaining exploration drilling at the Beaufor Mine during the second quarter of
2016, lower than the $0.7 million (US$0.6 million) spent in the same quarter of 2015. A total of 6,340 metres of drilling were completed
during the quarter and approximately 14,533 metres in the six-month period.
Exploration at Beaufor is being conducted in three main areas, namely the Central Upper Mine, the Northwest Upper Mine and the Lower
Mine.

RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 19
CASH POSITION
At June 30, 2016, the Corporation’s cash position was $95.5 million, higher than the $61.0 million balance at the end of 2015. This
increase reflects the $29.1 million of net proceeds from the bought deal prospectus financing that was closed on June 7, 2016, $32.2
million of operational cash flows and $28.1 million investment in property, plant and equipment during the six-month period. As at June
30, 2016, Richmont had $81.5 million of working capital, a $34.2 million increase from the $47.3 million at December 31, 2015, primarily
reflecting a $34.5 million increase in cash.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
On June 7, 2016, the Corporation issued a total of 2.990 million common shares as part of the bought-deal prospectus financing at a price
of $10.40 per share. This included the entire over-allotment option of 0.390 million shares, and generated aggregate gross proceeds of
$31.1 million. A share issue cost of $2.0 million was incurred relating to the transaction.
During the six-month period ended on June 30, 2016, the Corporation issued 487,963 common shares following the exercise of stock
options (129,220 during the six-month period ended on June 30, 2015) and received cash proceeds of $1.7 million ($0.2 million in the
comparable period of 2015). During the same period, the Corporation issued 812,500 common shares following the exercise of warrants
(none in the comparable period of 2015) and received cash proceeds of $2.0 million and issued 59,731 common shares (none in 2015)
following the vesting of restricted share units.
On February 11, 2015, the Corporation issued a total of 9.625 million common shares on a bought-deal basis through a syndicate of
underwriters, at a price of $4.00 per share. This included the entire over-allotment option of 1.125 million shares, and generated
aggregate gross proceeds of $38.5 million. A share issue cost of $2.4 million was incurred relating to the issuance of common shares.
As of June 30, 2016, the Corporation had 62.7 million shares outstanding.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
There were no changes to the Corporation’s commitments and contingencies from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 with the
exception of the commitments and contingency mentioned below. For further information, regarding commitments and contingencies in
effect as of December 31, 2015, please refer to the 2015 Management’s Discussion and Analysis, filed February 22, 2016 and available
on the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com).
During the six-month period ended on June 30, 2016, the Corporation entered into two financial lease agreements for mobile equipment
with an option to purchase at the end of the lease. For these contracts, minimum lease payments amount to $0.3 million for the remainder
of 2016, $0.7 million for 2017 and 2018, $0.8 million for 2019 and $0.08 million for 2020.
On July 20, 2016, an agreement was signed between the Corporation and a supplier to settle a dispute related to costs stemming from
work that the Corporation had not previously authorized. The agreement, in the amount of $0.2 million, effectively ended an arbitration
process. A provision for this amount has been accounted for in the financial statements in this respect.
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET TRANSACTIONS
The Corporation does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 20
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and the formulation of assumptions that have a significant impact on
revenues and expenses as well as on the amounts of assets and liabilities. Elements such as mineral reserves, basis of depletion of
mining sites in production, asset retirement obligations, impairment test of property, plant and equipment, income taxes and deferred
mining taxes, share-based remuneration expense, dismantling costs and severance costs, recoverability of credits relating to resources
and credits on duties refundable for losses, provisions and contingent liabilities, start of advanced exploration phase and start of
commercial production are estimates that management considers the most significant, which could differ materially and affect operating
results. A detailed discussion of these estimates is provided in the annual management’s discussion and analysis, filed on February 22,
2016 and available on the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In order to minimize the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of gold and exchange rates, Richmont Mines may from time to time,
use derivative financial instruments or gold hedging contracts. As at June 30, 2016 and 2015, Richmont Mines had no gold hedging
contracts and no currency exchange contracts. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, no gain or loss related to
derivative financial instruments or to gold hedging contracts were recorded in the financial statements.
The Corporation has classified its cash and receivables (except taxes receivable) as loans and receivables, and its payables, accruals
and provisions (except salaries and related benefits payable), finance lease obligations, contract payment holdbacks and closure
allowance as financial liabilities. All financial instruments are measured at fair value with the exception of the loans and receivables and
financial liabilities, which are measured at amortized cost.
Cash, receivables and payables, accruals and provisions are recorded at book value and represent their approximate fair value, as these
items will be realized or settled in the short term. The fair value of finance lease obligations, contract payment holdbacks and closure
allowance was determined by calculating the discounted cash flows using market interest rates for financial instruments with similar
characteristics. The fair value of the finance lease obligations, the contract payment holdbacks and the closure allowance approximate
the book value.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the
Corporation’s last annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accounting policies have been applied
consistently throughout the Corporation for the purposes of preparation of these interim consolidated financial statements. There are no
new accounting policies in effect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
NON-IFRS PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Cash costs per ounce, operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital, net free cash flow, net free cash flow per share,
and all-in sustaining costs are non-International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) performance measures, and may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Corporation believes that, in addition to conventional measures
prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Corporation and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Corporation's performance.
Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The net free cash flow and net free cash flow per share are comprised of the Corporation’s operating cash flow after changes in non-cash
working capital, less investments in property, plant and equipment.

“Cash costs” is a common performance measure in the gold mining industry, but does not have any standardized definition. The
Corporation reports cash cost per ounce based on ounces sold. Cash costs include mine site operating costs, administration and
royalties but are exclusive of depreciation, accretion expense, capital expenditures, and exploration and project evaluation costs. (Refer
to Table “Reconciliation of cost of sales to cash costs and to all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold for the quarter and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015”).
All-In Sustaining Costs or “AISC” is an extension of the existing “cash costs” metrics and incorporates costs related to sustaining
production. The Corporation believes that, although relevant, the cash costs measure does not capture the sustaining expenditures
incurred, and therefore, may not present a complete picture of the Corporation’s operating performance or its ability to generate free cash
flows from its operations. AISC includes cost of sales, excluding depreciation, and includes sustaining capital expenditures, delineation
drilling costs and evaluation costs, corporate general and administrative costs, and environmental rehabilitation accretion and
depreciation.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cost of sales to cash costs and to all-in sustaining costs, on a consolidated basis:

GENERAL INFORMATION
The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice-President, Finance, are responsible for disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Multilateral Instrument 52-109 of the Canadian Securities Administrators) and have designed them, or had them designed
under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to the Corporation is communicated to them by
others within the Corporation, especially during the period when reports that must be filed under the terms of Canadian securities law are
being prepared.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 23
The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice-President, Finance are also responsible for internal controls over financial
reporting and have designed them, or had them designed under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance that the financial
information is reliable and that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards. The internal controls over financial reporting during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 were adequately applied.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
In the normal course of operations, the mining industry involves exposure to numerous risks that can affect the performance of
corporations such as Richmont Mines. A detailed discussion of these risks is given in the annual Management’s Discussion and
Analysis, dated February 19, 2016, filed February 22, 2016, and available on the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com).
REGULATION 43-101
The geological data in this document have been reviewed by Mr. Daniel Adam, Geo., Ph.D, Vice-President, Exploration, an employee of
Richmont Mines Inc., and a qualified person as defined by Regulation 43-101. Please refer to the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) for
full reports and additional corporate documentation.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or the
Corporation’s future performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward -looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”,
“estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “targeting”, “intend”, “could”, “might”, “continue”, or the negative of these terms or other comparable
terminology. These statements are only predictions. In addition, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis may contain forward-looking
statements attributed to third party industry sources. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, as there
can be no assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations upon which they are based will occur. By its nature, forward-looking
information involves numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the
possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not occur and may cause actual results or
events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such a difference
are discussed in the section entitled “Risk factors” in the Corporation’s annual management’s discussion and analysis report dated
February 19, 2016, filed February 22, 2016, and available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com). Other risks may be detailed in Richmont Mines’
Annual Information Form, Annual Report and periodic reports. Except as may be required by law, the Corporation undertakes no
obligation and disclaims any responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise.
RICHMONT MINES INC.
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 24
CAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS CONCERNING RESOURCE ESTIMATES AND CIVIL LIABILITIES AND JUDGMENTS
Resource estimates
The resource estimates in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis were prepared in accordance with Regulation 43-101 adopted by
the Canadian Securities Administrators. The requirements of Regulation 43-101 differ significantly from the requirements of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we use the terms “Measured,”
“Indicated” and “Inferred” Resources; although these terms are recognized and required to be used in Canada, the SEC does not
recognize them. The SEC permits U.S. mining corporations, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that
constitute “reserves.” Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has
been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally extracted at the time the determination is made. United States
investors should not assume that all or any portion of a Measured or Indicated Resource will ever be converted into “reserves.”
Furthermore, “Inferred Resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and whether they can be mined economically
or legally, and United States investors should not assume that “Inferred Resources” exist or can be legally or economically mined, or that
they will ever be upgraded to a more certain category.
Potential unenforceability of civil liabilities and judgments
The Corporation is incorporated under the laws of the Province of Quebec, Canada. All of the Corporation's directors and officers as well
as the experts named in the Form 20-F are residents of Canada. Also, all of the Corporation's assets and most of the assets of these
persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for shareholders to initiate a lawsuit within the United
States against these non-U.S. residents, or to enforce U.S. judgments against the Corporation or these persons. The Corporation's
Canadian counsel has advised the Corporation that a monetary judgment of a U.S. court predicated solely upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal securities laws would likely be enforceable in Canada if the U.S. court in which the judgment was obtained had
a basis for jurisdiction in the matter that was recognized by a Canadian court for such purposes. This result may not always be the case. It
is less certain that an action could be brought in Canada in the first instance on the basis of liability predicated solely upon such laws.
As a “foreign private issuer”, the Corporation is exempt from the Section 14 proxy rules and Section 16 of the U.S. Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and this may result in shareholders having less complete and timely data.
The submission of proxy and annual meeting of shareholder information (prepared to Canadian standards) on Form 6-K may result in
shareholders having less complete and timely data. The exemption from Section 16 rules regarding sales of common shares by insiders
may result in shareholders having less data in this regard.
Compliance with Canadian Securities Regulations
This quarterly report is intended to comply with the requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange and applicable Canadian securities
legislation, which differ in certain respects from the rules and regulations promulgated under the United States Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as promulgated by the SEC.
U.S. investors are urged to consider the disclosure in our annual report on Form 20-F, File No. 001-14598, as filed with the SEC under
the Exchange Act, which may be obtained from us (without cost) or from the SEC’s website: http://sec.gov/edgar.shtml.

5.Share-based compensation
a)Share option plans
In effect since May 2012, the Corporation’s long-term incentive plan (the “New Plan”) permits the granting of options, restricted share units
(“RSUs”), share appreciation rights (“SARs”) and retention awards (“Retention Awards”) to directors, officers, other employees,
consultants and service providers providing ongoing services to the Corporation.
The current policy of the Corporation is to set the exercise price of each option granted at the market price at closing of the Corporation’s
stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange, on the day prior the day of grant. Vesting is set at one third one year after the grant date, one third
on the second anniversary of the grant date, and one third on the third anniversary of the grant date, with expiry of the option five years
after the date of grant. In previous years, options vested as above or in tranches of 20% beginning one year after the grant date, thereafter
vesting cumulatively on every anniversary date over a period of four years, and expiring six years after the date of grant; or options that
vested 20% on the grant date and vested cumulatively thereafter on every anniversary date over a period of four years, and expiring five
years after the date of grant; or options that vested on August 8, 2016 and expiring five years after the date of grant; or options that vested
100% on the grant date and expiring five years after the date of grant.
A summary of the status of options outstanding under the Corporation’s New Plan at June 30, 2016 and changes during the three-month
and six-month periods then ended, is presented below:

During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation granted 360,000 share options to a director, an officer and employees
(205,000 to directors and employees for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015). The weighted average fair value of these share
options at the grant date, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $3.36 ($2.01 for the six-month period ended June
30, 2015).
The Corporation had a Stock Option Purchase Plan (the “Initial Plan”) under which options to acquire common shares were granted to its
directors, officers, employees and non-employees. The exercise price of each option was determined by the market price of the
Corporation’s stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange, on the day prior to the grant, and the maximum term of the options granted was ten
years. 20% of the options were vested on the grant date and vested cumulatively thereafter on every anniversary date over a period of
four years. The Corporation ended the Initial Plan in 2012. Outstanding options that were issued under this previous plan, will continue to
have the same terms and conditions as when they were initially issued.
A summary of the status of options outstanding under the Corporation’s Initial Plan at June 30, 2016 and changes during the three-month
and six-month periods then ended, is presented below:

b)Restricted share units
The Corporation’s New Plan permits the granting of RSUs. Upon vesting, each RSU is exchanged for one common share of the
Corporation. The fair value of each RSU is equal to the fair value of one common share of the Corporation at the date of grant. The fair
value is amortized over the vesting period of three years. Two types of RSUs are issued: (1) RSUs that vest in thirds one year after the
grant date, then vest cumulatively thereafter on every anniversary date over a total period of three years, (2) RSUs that fully vest at the
earliest of three years after the grant date or upon the Director leaving the Board.
A summary of the status of RSUs outstanding under the Corporation’s New Plan at June 30, 2016 and changes during the three-month
and six-month periods then ended, is presented below:

During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation granted 265,180 RSUs to officers and employees at an average fair
value of $6.32 (none in the comparable period of 2015).
c)Deferred share units
In May 2015, the Corporation established a deferred share unit (DSU) plan for directors. The value of an outstanding DSU, on any
particular date, is equal to the market value of a common share of the Corporation at such date. DSUs are granted to directors and must
be retained until the director leaves the Corporation’s Board of Directors (Board), at which time, the Board elects one or any combination
of the following payment methods: (a) issuing common shares from treasury, (b) purchase shares on the market or (c) paying cash. If the
Board does not elect for the payment method, the obligation is automatically settled in cash.

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Q2 2016 | Page 37
DSU’s are initially measured on the grant date at fair value and recognized as an obligation. The obligation is re -measured to fair value
at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated income
statement. The Corporation values the obligation based on the market price at closing of the Corporation’s stock on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.
In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation granted 110,000 DSUs to directors (none in the comparable period of
2015) and recorded a compensation expense of $1,319 (none in 2015). As at June 30, 2016, 110,000 DSUs were outstanding (none as
at December 31, 2015) for which the compensation liability was $1,319 (none as at December 31, 2015). Subsequent to the quarter’s
end, the Corporation released 47,000 shares as payment for 47,000 DSU.
d)Retention awards
In March 2012, the Corporation signed agreements with several employees considered as key personnel. These agreements incorporate
a retention payment (“Retention Awards”) provided certain conditions are met by the employee, most notably that the employee continues
his or her employment with the Corporation until March 2017. These retention payments would be payable in 2017 in either of the
Corporation’s common shares or cash, at the discretion of the employee, with the number of common shares to be determined by the
current value of the common shares at the time of payment. As at June 30, 2016, the total amount that could be paid as Retention Awards
under these agreements is $1,750 and the liability accrued for to this effect amounts to $1,407 as at June 30, 2016 ($1,234 as at
December 31, 2015), which corresponds to the best estimate of the amount to be paid relating to the Retention Awards, based on
estimated forfeitures and a 1.3% discount rate.
e)Options outside the Corporation’s plan
In addition, 800,000 inducement options were granted on October 16, 2014 to the incoming CEO. In compliance with TSX rules, these are
considered outside of the Corporation’s plan. These options vest in thirds on December 1st, 2015, and thereafter on December 1st 2016
and 2017, and expire five years after the date of grant. These options have an exercise price of $2.46. As at June 30, 2016, all options are
outstanding and 266,666 are exercisable.

During the six-month period ended on June 30, 2016, the Corporation acquired mobile equipment at a cost of $3,015 via two financial
lease agreements. At the end of these contracts, the Corporation benefits from an option of a lower purchase price. Minimum lease

11.Asset retirement obligations
The Corporation’s production and exploration activities are subject to various federal and provincial laws and regulations governing the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The
Corporation conducts its operations so as to protect public health and the environment. The Corporation has recorded the asset
retirement obligations of its mining sites on the basis of management’s best estimates of future costs, based on information available on
the reporting date. Best estimates of future costs are the amount the Corporation would reasonably pay to settle its obligation on the
closing date. Future costs are discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the liability. Such estimates are subject to change based on modifications to laws and regulations or as new information
becomes available.
