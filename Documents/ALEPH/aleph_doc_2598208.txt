Corporate 
 
During  the  year  the  Company  completed  two  placements  and  a  shareholder  purchase  plan  that  raised 
$5,074,000 to continue exploration on the Aucu gold deposit in  the Kyrgyz Republic and the Merolia nickel 
and gold projects in Western Australia. 
 
Exploration Summary 
 
White  Cliff  controls  extensive  tenement  packages  in  Western  Australia’s  Yilgarn  Craton  and  the  Pilbara 
region as well as a major gold-copper project in Central Asia. 
 
Central Asia 
 
During  the  year  2,494  metres  of  reverse  circulation  drilling  was  conducted  at  the  Aucu  high  grade  gold 
deposit in the Kyrgyz Republic (Map 2).  Drilling was focused on extending the existing JORC compliant gold 
resource of 1.15 Million tonnes at 4.2 g/t containing 156,000 ounces of gold. The drilling program identified 
extensive  new  high  grade  mineralisation  including:  8  metres  at  55  g/t  gold,  6  metres  at  38.4  g/t  gold,  4 
metres  at  60  g/t  gold  and  multiple  other  intersections  at  similar  grades.  The  additional  gold  mineralisation 
extends the upper gold zone an additional 600 metres to the east.  
 
Drilling during the remainder of 2016 will focus on increasing the mineral resource at the Aucu gold deposit 
by drilling out the new zone. 
 
Western Australia 
 
In Western  Australia the Company  is  exploring  several  projects  with  the primary  focus  on  the  Merolia  gold 
and nickel project (Map 1).

Drilling  identified  high  grade  gold  mineralisation  at  the  Ironstone  Gold  prospect  and  the  Company  has 
conducted  an  extensive  geochemical  soil  sampling  program  along  the  ironstone  gold  and  comet  well  gold 
trends to identify additional gold targets. 
 
Significant  nickel  mineralisation  was  encountered  at  the  Coglia  nickel  prospect  with  drill  intersections  of  4 
metres  at  3%  nickel  within  12  metres  at  2.2%  nickel.  Further  petrology  and  multi  element  assays  are 
underway prior to further drilling.

The Aucu Gold Project, Central Asia (89%) 
 
During the year 2,494 metres reverse circulation drilling was completed at the Aucu high grade gold deposit 
in the Kyrgyz Republic (Map 2).  Drilling identified extensive high grade mineralisation including: 8 metres at 
55  g/t  gold,  4  metres  at  60  g/t  gold,  6  metres  at  38.4  g/t  gold  and  multiple  other  intersections  at  similar 
grades. Mineralisation starts at surface is open along strike at either end and at depth below the drilling. The 
new zones of gold mineralisation are in addition to the existing JORC compliant inferred gold resource of 1.2 
Million tonnes at 4.2 g/t containing 156,000 ounces of gold. 
 
Three New Mineralised Zones Discovered 
 
Field work commenced in May 2015 immediately discovering three new mineralised zones interpreted to be 
extensions of the existing Aucu gold resource. The new mineralised zones are parallel to the existing zones 
and consist of: 
 
The Upper Gold Zone East, 900 metres East of the Upper Gold Zone (UGZ) which consists of a 500 metre 
long zone  with drilling results including:  8 metres at 55 g/t  gold, 4 metres at 60  g/t gold, 2 metres at 43  g/t 
gold and multiple other intersections at similar grades. Mineralisation starts at surface is open along strike at 
either end and at depth below the drilling. 
 
The  Eastern  Gold  Zone  (EGZ),  which  occurs  1.5  kilometres  east  of  the  Lower  Gold  Zone  (LGZ)  within 
granodiorite  with  drilling  results  including:  3  metres  at  6.97  g/t  gold,  3  metres  at  4.33  g/t  gold  and  an 
additional 3 metres at 3.56 g/t gold. 
 
The Camp Gold Zone (CGZ) that occurs 400 metres south of the LGZ within sediments with drilling results of 
9 metres at 6.83g/t gold The CGZ was initially identified from trenching results of 3 metres at 23.8 g/t gold.

Licence Extended to 2020 
 
During  December  the  Kyrgyz  State  Agency  for  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources  (SAGMAR)  issued  a  five 
year extension to the Company’s exploration license (AP 590) with an expiry date of 31 December 2020. 
 
The Company has also received statutory approvals for the 2016 exploration program from the relevant state 
authorities  (Geology,  Mining,  Environment,  Forestry  and  the  regional  government).  The  2016  drill  program 
commenced in June and will continue through until the end of October. 
 
Metallurgical Test Work  
 
Preliminary metallurgical test work revealed an average total  overall gold recovery  of  98.9% from intensive 
cyanide  leaching  of  both  the  gravity  concentrate  and  gravity  tailings.  The  total  gravity  recoverable  gold 
averaged an exceptional 88.6% from intensive cyanide leaching of the gravity concentrate. 
 
The  test  work  was  conducted  on  182  one  metre  RC  samples  which  were  composited  into  69  samples 
representing  each  ore  intersection  from  every  hole  (Figure  1).  The  samples  represent  ALL the  mineralised 
intervals sampled from the 2014 and 2015 drill programs. 
 
Further investigation of the test work revealed an average overall gold recovery of 99% for the samples that 
represent  the  current  JORC  Compliant  resource  (1.2  Million  tonnes  at  4.2  g/t  gold).  The  above  results 
indicate that all of the JORC Compliant Inferred resource is likely to have very high average recoveries and 
further, will be amenable to standard processing methods. 
 
Summary
1.  JORC Compliant Inferred Gold Resource of 1.2 Mt at 4.2 g/t containing 156,000 ounces of gold 
2.  Mineralisation outcrops at surface 
3.  Three new mineralised zones discovered with exceptionally high average grades ~40+ g/t gold 
4.  Metallurgical average total gold recovery of 99% 
5.  Average gravity recoverable gold of 88.6%

Merolia Gold and Nickel Gold Project (100%)
During the year the company finalised drilling programs for the McKenna and Coglia nickel sulphide targets 
and the Ironstone Gold target (Figure 2). See ASX releases dated 21/01/2016 and 12/02/2016. 
 
High grade gold mineralisation was discovered at the Ironstone Gold prospect and the Company is planning 
further  exploration.  For  detailed  information  see  ASX  release  dated  29/02/2016.  The  Company  has 
conducted  an  extensive  geochemical  soil  sampling  program  along  the  ironstone  gold  and  comet  well  gold 
trends.  Approximately  2,000  samples  have  been  collected  and  are  currently  at  the  laboratory  undergoing 
analysis. Results will be released as they become available. 
 
Significant  nickel  mineralisation  was  encountered  at  the  Coglia  nickel  prospect  with  drill  intersections  of  4 
metres  at  3%  nickel  within  12  metres  at  2.2%  nickel.  While  the  mineralisation  occurs  within  the  regolith 
profile  the  high  grade  and  significant  copper  is  more  suggestive  of  the  sulphide  deposit.  Further  petrology 
and multi element assays are underway. 
 
Three  barren  iron  sulphide  conductors  were  encountered  at  the  McKenna  prospect  downgrading  its 
prospectivity. No further work is planned.
Other Projects
No significant exploration was undertaken on the Company’s remaining exploration projects during the year.

(ii) Executives 
There were no other executives of the Company as at 30 June 2016. 
 
Details of directors’ and executives’ remuneration are set out under the following main headings: 
A 
B

D 
 
A 
The  objective  of  the  Company’s  executive  reward  framework  is  to  ensure  reward  for  performance  is  competitive 
and appropriate for the results delivered. The framework aims to align executive reward with the creation of value 
for shareholders.  The key criteria for good remuneration governance practices adopted by the Board are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  framework  provides  a  mix  of  fixed  salary,  consultancy  agreement  based  remuneration  and  share  based 
incentives. 
   
The  broad  remuneration  policy  for  determining  the  nature  and  amount  of  emoluments  of  Board  members  and 
senior  executives  of  the  Company  is  governed  by  the  full  board.  Although  there  is  no  separate  remuneration 
committee  the  Board’s  aim  is  to  ensure  the  remuneration  packages  properly  reflect  directors’  and  executives’ 
duties and responsibilities.  The  Board  assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of emoluments of 
such officers on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective 
of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention and motivation of a high quality Board and executive 
team.  
 
The current remuneration policy adopted is that no element of any director or executive package is directly related 
to the Company’s financial performance. Indeed there are no elements of any  director or executive remuneration 
that  are  dependent  upon  the  satisfaction  of  any  specific  condition  however  the  overall  remuneration  policy 
framework is structured to advance and create shareholder wealth.  
 
Non-executive directors 
Fees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of, 
the directors.  Non-executive directors’ fees and payments are reviewed annually by the Board and are intended to 
be in line with the market.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies 
 
(a)
(b)
(c)
Basis of preparation 
The financial report is a general purpose financial report, which has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, Accounting Standards and Interpretations and complies 
with  other  requirements  of  the  law.  The  accounting  policies  detailed  below  have  been  consistently 
applied  to  all  of  the  years  presented  unless  otherwise  stated.  The  financial  report  has  also  been 
prepared on a historical cost basis.  The Company is a listed public company registered and domiciled in 
Australia. The financial report is presented in Australian dollars. 
 
Going Concern 
The Company and its controlled entities as at 30 June (the “Group”) do not generate sufficient cash flows 
from their operating activities to finance these activities. Thus the continuing viability of the  Group and its 
ability to continue as a going concern and meet its debts and commitments as they fall due are dependent 
upon the Group being successful in completing a capital raising and/or asset sale/joint venture agreement 
in the next 12 months. The directors have mitigated this risk by reducing the Group’s corporate overheads 
and postponing expenditure on the Group’s projects where possible.  
During the financial year the Company has raised a net $5,368,133 in new equity capital, and at the date 
of this report the Company has working capital of approximately $1,660,000. 
Notwithstanding this, the Directors believe that the Company will need to raise additional working capital 
to progress the Company’s exploration activities. 
As a result of these matters, there is  a material uncertainty  that may cast  significant doubt on  whether 
the Group will continue as a going concern and, therefore, whether it will realise its assets and settle its 
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial 
report.    However,  the  directors  believe  that  the  Group  will  be  successful  in  the  above  matters  and, 
accordingly, have prepared the financial report on a going concern basis.
Adoption of new and revised standards 
Changes in accounting policies on initial application of Accounting Standards 
In the year ended 30 June 2016, the Directors have reviewed all of the new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations  issued  by  the  AASB  that  are  relevant  to  the  Group’s  operations  and  effective  for  the 
current annual reporting period. It has been determined by the Directors that there is no impact, material 
or  otherwise,  of  the  new  and  revised  Standards  and  Interpretations  on  the  Group  and,  therefore,  no 
change is necessary to Group accounting policies. 
The Directors have  also reviewed all  new  Standards and Interpretations that  have been issued but are 
not  yet  effective  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016.  As  a  result  of  this  review  the  Directors  have 
determined  that  there  is  no  impact,  material  or  otherwise,  of  the  new  and  revised  Standards  and 
Interpretations on the Group and, therefore, no change necessary to Group accounting policies. 
 
Statement of compliance 
The financial report was authorised by the Board of directors for issue on 5 September 2016
The  financial  report  complies  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards,  which  include  Australian 
equivalents  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (AIFRS).  Compliance  with  AIFRS  ensures 
that  the  financial  report,  comprising  the  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto,  complies  with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

ABN 22 126 299 125
Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
(d)
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of  White Cliff Minerals Limited 
(“Company” or “parent entity”) and its controlled entities as at 30 June 2016 (the “Group”). 
The  financial  statements  of  the  controlled  entities  are  prepared  for  the  same  reporting  period  as  the 
parent entity, using consistent accounting policies. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, income 
and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full. 
Controlled entities are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group  and 
cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.  Control exists 
where  the  Company  has  the  power  to  govern  the  financial  and  operating  policies  of  an  entity  so as  to 
obtain benefits from its activities. 
 
Significant accounting judgements estimates and assumptions
(e)
(f)
(g)
The  application  of  accounting  policies  requires  the  use  of  judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions 
about  carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  The 
estimates  and  associated  assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  other  factors  that  are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if it affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 
Exploration and evaluation costs carried forward  
The Group’s main activity is exploration and evaluation for minerals. The nature of exploration activities 
are  such  that  it  requires  interpretation  of  complex  and  difficult  geological  models  in  order  to  make  an 
assessment  of  the  size,  shape,  depth  and  quality  of  resources  and  their  anticipated  recoveries.  The 
economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate mining viability may change from period to 
period.  In  addition,  exploration  activities  by  their  nature  are  inherently  uncertain.  Changes  in  all  these 
factors can impact exploration asset carrying values. 
Share-based payment transactions: 
The  Group  measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  with  employees  by  reference  to  the  fair 
value  of  the  equity  instruments  at  the  date  at  which  they  are  granted.  The  fair  value  is  determined  by 
either market value or using a Black and Scholes model using the assumptions contained in Note 13. 
 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met 
before revenue is recognised: 
(i) Interest income 
Interest  revenue  is  recognised  on  a time proportionate basis  that  takes  into  account the  effective  yield 
on the financial asset. 
(ii) Government assistance - drilling grants 
Government grants are recognised at fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will 
be  received  and  all  grant  conditions  will  be  met.  Grants  relating  to  expense  items  are  recognised  as 
income over the periods necessary to match the grant to the costs they are compensating. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises  cash at  bank  and  in  hand.  Cash  equivalents  are  short  term,  highly  liquid  investments 
that  are  readily  convertible  to known  amounts  of  cash  and  which  are  subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of 
changes  in  value.    Temporary  bank  overdrafts  are  included  in  cash  at  bank  and  in  hand.  Permanent 
bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
For  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash and cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued) 
 
(h)
Income tax 
The income tax expense or benefit for the year is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income 
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets 
and liabilities attributable to temporary difference and to unused tax losses.   
The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively 
enacted  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  countries  where  the  company’s  subsidiaries  and 
associates  operate  and generate  taxable  income.   Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.  It 
establishes  provisions  where  appropriate  on  the  basis  of  amounts  expected  to  be  paid  to  the  tax 
authorities. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the  taxation  authorities.  The  tax  rates  and  tax  laws  used  to  compute  the  amount  are  those  that  are 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance date. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:


when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset 
or  liability  in  a  transaction  that  is  not  a  business  combination  and  that,  at  the  time  of  the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or  
when  the  taxable  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  controlled  entities, 
associates or interests in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
can  be  controlled  and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  not  reverse  in  the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  all  deductible  temporary  differences,  carry-forward  of 
unused  tax  assets  and  unused  tax  losses,  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:


when the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or 
when  the  deductible  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  controlled  entities, 
associates or interests in joint ventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is only recognised to 
the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future 
and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit  will be available to allow all or part of the 
deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance date and are recognised to the 
extent  that  it  has  become  probable  that  future  taxable  profit  will  allow  the  deferred  tax  asset  to  be 
recovered. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
financial year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current  tax  assets  against  current  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  relate  to  the 
same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Tax consolidation legislation 
The  Company  and  its  100%  owned  Australian  resident  subsidiaries  have  implemented  the  tax 
consolidation  legislation.  Current  and deferred  tax  amounts  are  accounted for  in  each individual  entity 
as if each entity continued to act as a taxpayer on its own. 
The  Company  recognises  both  its  current  and  deferred  tax  amounts  and  those  current  tax  liabilities, 
current tax assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax credits and unused tax losses which 
it has assumed from its controlled entities within the tax consolidated group.

Other taxes 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:


when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as 
part of the expense item as applicable; and 
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.
The  net  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  taxation  authority  is  included  as  part  of 
receivables or payables in the statement of financial position. 
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash 
flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation 
authority, are classified as operating cash flows. 
Commitments and contingencies  are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority. 
 
Impairment of assets 
The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If  any  such  indication  exists,  or  when  annual  impairment  testing  for  an  asset  is  required,  the  Group 
makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its 
fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  its  value  in  use  and  is  determined  for  an  individual  asset,  unless  the 
asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets and the asset's value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases the 
asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. When the carrying 
amount  of  an  asset  or  cash-generating  unit  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount,  the  asset  or  cash-
generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific  to  the  asset.  Impairment  losses  relating  to  continuing  operations  are  recognised  in  those 
expense categories consistent  with the function of the impaired asset unless the asset is carried at re-
valued amount (in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease). 
An assessment is also made at each balance date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has 
been  a  change  in  the  estimates  used  to  determine  the  asset’s  recoverable  amount  since  the  last 
impairment loss  was recognised.  If that is the case the carrying amount of the  asset is increased to its 
recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying  amount that  would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior financial 
periods.  Such reversal  is recognised  in profit or  loss  unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in 
which  case  the  reversal  is  treated  as  a  revaluation  increase.  After  such  a  reversal  the  depreciation 
charge  is  adjusted  in  future  periods  to  allocate  the  asset’s  revised  carrying  amount,  less  any  residual 
value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised costs and represent liabilities for goods and 
services provided to the Group prior to the end of the  financial year that are unpaid and arise when the 
Group  becomes  obliged  to  make  future  payments  in  respect  of  the  purchase  of  these  goods  and 
services. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 
12 months.

Provisions 
Where  applicable,  provisions  are  recognised  when  the  Group  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Provisions are not made for future operating losses. 
When  the  Group expects  some or  all  of  a provision to  be  reimbursed,  for  example under  an insurance 
contract,  the  reimbursement  is  recognised  as  a  separate  asset  but  only  when  the  reimbursement  is 
virtually  certain.  The  expense relating  to any  provision  is  presented  in the  statement  of  comprehensive 
income net  of  any  reimbursement. Provisions  are  measured at the net  present  value  of  management’s 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects the risks specific to the liability. 
When  discounting  is  used,  the  increase in the provision  due to the passage of  time is recognised  as  a 
borrowing cost. 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
Equity settled transactions:
The  Group  provides  benefits  to  employees  and  consultants  of  the  Group  in  the  form  of  share-based 
payments,  whereby  employees  render  services  in  exchange  for  shares  or  rights  over  shares  (equity-
settled transactions). 
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees and consultants is measured by reference 
to the fair value of the equity  instruments at the date  at which they  are  granted  and/or vested. The fair 
value is determined by using either market value or the Black and Scholes model, further details of which 
are given in Note 13.  
The  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  is  recognised,  together  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  equity, 
over  the period in  which any  performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on 
which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting period). 
The  cumulative  expense  recognised  for  equity-settled  transactions  at  each  reporting  date  until  vesting 
date  reflects  the  extent  to  which  the  vesting  period  has  expired,  and  the  Group’s  best  estimate  of  the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.  
The  statement  of  comprehensive  income  charge  or  credit  for  a  year  represents  the  movement  in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that year. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is only 
conditional upon a market condition. 
If  the  terms  of  an  equity-settled  award  are  modified,  as  a minimum  an  expense  is  recognised  as  if  the 
terms had not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification that  increases 
the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, 
as measured at the date of modification. 
If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any 
expense  not  yet  recognised  for  the  award  is  recognised  immediately.  However,  if  a  new  award  is 
substituted  for  the  cancelled  award  and  designated  as  a  replacement  award  on  the  date  that  it  is 
granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as 
described  in  the  previous  paragraph.  The  dilutive  effect,  if  any,  of  outstanding  options  is  reflected  as 
additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share (see Note 4). 
 
Issued capital 
Ordinary  shares  are  classified  as  equity.  Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  issue  of  new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net  of tax, from the proceeds. Incremental costs 
directly  attributable to the  issue  of  new  shares  or  options  for  the  acquisition of  a new  business  are  not 
included in the costs of acquisition as part of purchase consideration.

Earnings per share 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  as  net  profit  or  loss  attributable  to  members  of  the  parent, 
adjusted to exclude any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends, 
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares.  
Diluted  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  as  net  profit  or  loss  attributable  to  members  of  the  parent, 
adjusted for:
 


costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends; 
the after tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares that 
have been recognised as expenses; and 
other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from 
the  dilution  of  potential  ordinary  shares,  divided  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary 
shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
Exploration  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Acquisition  costs  are  accumulated  in  respect  of  each 
separate  area  of  interest.  Acquisition  costs  are  carried  forward  where  right  of  tenure  of  the  area  of 
interest is current and they are expected to be recouped through the sale or successful development and 
exploitation of  the  area of  interest  or,  where  exploration  and evaluation  activities  in the  area of  interest 
have  not  yet  reached  a  stage  that  permits  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  of  economically 
recoverable  reserves.  When  an  area  of  interest  is  abandoned  or  the  Directors  decide  that  it  is  not 
commercial, any accumulated acquisition costs in respect of that area are written off in the financial  year 
and accumulated acquisition costs written off to the extent that they  will not  be recovered in the future. 
Amortisation  is  not  charged  on  acquisition  costs  carried  forward  in  respect  of  areas  of  interest  in  the 
development phase until production commences. 
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest 
that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable  amount of  the  exploration and  evaluation  asset (for  the  cash generating  unit(s)  to  which it 
has  been  allocated  being  no  larger  than  the  relevant  area  of  interest)  is  estimated  to  determine  the 
extent  of  the  impairment  loss  (if  any).  Where  an  impairment  loss  subsequently  reverses,  the  carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent 
that  the  increased  carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. 
Where a decision has been made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest, 
the  relevant  exploration  and  evaluation  asset  is  tested  for  impairment  and  the  balance  is  then 
reclassified to development. 
 
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief

Fair value of options/rights granted 
* The fair value of the equity-settled share options was estimated using the Black and Scholes model taking into 
account  the  terms  and  conditions  upon  which  the  options  were  granted.  The  holders  of  these  options  did  not 
realise any value/profit from these options which have now lapsed.  
**  The fair value of the equity-settled share options was estimated using the initial bid price for these options on 
the first day these options were quoted for trading upon ASX. This method provides the most accurate estimate 
of the value of these options. 
***  The  fair  value  of  the  performance  rights  was  estimated  using  the  Black  and  Scholes  model  taking  into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted. 
**** It was considered that no fair value is required to be expensed upon the grant of these performance rights. 
The fair value of these 16,000,000 performance rights, if vested, approximates $96,000.

The  expected  life  of  the  option/rights  is  based  on  historical  data  and  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  exercise 
patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative 
of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.  The fair value of unlisted option/rights 
was discounted to account for the existence of continuity  of employment vesting conditions, non-transferability 
and  the  un-listed  aspect  of  the  employee  option/rights.  No  other  features  of  option/rights  granted  were 
incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 14: Financial instruments 
 
(a) Capital risk management 
Prudent  capital  risk  management  implies  maintaining  sufficient  cash  and  marketable  securities  to  ensure 
continuity  of  tenure  to  exploration  assets  and  to  be  able  to  conduct  the  Group’s  business  in  an  orderly  and 
professional  manner.  The  Board  monitors  its  future  capital  requirements  on  a  regular  basis  and  will  when 
appropriate consider the need for raising additional equity capital or to farm-out exploration projects as a means 
of preserving capital. The Board currently has a policy of not entering into any debt arrangements.  
 
(b) Categories of financial instruments 
The  Group’s  principal  financial  instruments  comprise  of  cash  and  short-term  deposits.  The  main  purpose  of 
these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial 
assets and liabilities such as receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.  It is, and 
has  been  throughout  the  year,  the  Group’s  policy  that  no  trading  in  financial  instruments  shall  be  undertaken 
during the year.  
 
(c) Financial risk management objectives 
The  Group  is  exposed  to  market  risk  (including  interest  rate  risk  and  equity  price  risk),  credit  risk  and  liquidity 
risk. 
 
The  main  risks  arising  from  the  Group’s  financial  instruments  are  interest  rate  risk  and  credit  risk.  The  Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. 
 
(d) Market risk 
 
Equity price risk sensitivity analysis 
There  has  been  no  change  to  the  Group’s  exposure  to  market  risks  or  the  manner  in  which  it  manages  and 
measures the risk from the previous period. 
 
(i) Interest rate risk management 
All cash balances attract a floating rate of interest. Excess funds that are not required in the short term are placed 
on  deposit  for  a  period  of  no  more  than  3  months.  The  Group’s  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  and the effective 
interest rate by maturity periods is set out below.  
 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
As the Group has no interest bearing borrowings its exposure to interest rate movements is limited to the amount 
of interest income it can potentially earn on surplus cash deposits.  
At 30 June 2016,  if interest rates had changed by  + 50 basis points and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s after tax loss would have been $16,500 (2015: $11,700) lower as a result of higher interest income 
on  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  If  interest  rates  dropped  on  average  –  50  basis  points  then  the  Group  may  not 
have  earned  any  interest  income  which  would  have  increased  the  Group’s  after  tax  loss  by  $1,900  (2015: 
$7,650).

Note 14: Financial instruments (cont) 
 
(e) Credit risk management 
Credit risk relates to the risk that counterparties will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial 
loss  to  the  Group.  The  Group  has  adopted  a  policy  of  only  dealing  with  credit  worthy  counterparties  and 
obtaining  sufficient  collateral  or  other  security  where appropriate, as  a means  of mitigating the  risk  of financial 
loss from any defaults. 
 
(f) Liquidity risk management 
Prudent  liquidity  risk  management  implies  maintaining  sufficient  cash  and  marketable  securities  to  ensure 
continuity  of  tenure  to  exploration  assets  and  to  be  able  to  conduct  the  Group’s  business  in  an  orderly  and 
professional manner. Cash deposits are only held with major financial institutions.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 15: Commitments and contingencies
Exploration expenditure commitments  
In  order  to  maintain  rights  of  tenure  to  its  Australian  located  mineral  tenements,  the  Company  is  required  to 
outlay certain amounts in respect of rent and minimum expenditure requirements set by the Western Australian 
State Government Mines Department. The Group’s commitments to meet this minimum level of expenditure are 
approximately $595,000 (2015: $615,000) annually.   
 
Exemption from incurring this annual level of expenditure may be granted where access to the tenement area is 
restricted  for  reasons  beyond  the  Company’s  control  such  as  where  native  title  issues  restrict  the  Company’s 
ability  to  explore  in  the  project  area.  The  Company  is  not  aware  of  any  such  restrictions  to  exploration  in  the 
coming year and it does not anticipate seeking any exemption to reduce this annual expenditure requirement. 
 
In order to maintain rights of tenure to its Kyrgyz Republic located mineral tenement, the Company is required 
to  complete  an  annual  works  program  as  agreed  with  the  Kyrgyz  government.  If  this  program  is  not 
completed in the calendar year then continued tenure to the project could be in jeopardy.  
 
Other contingencies 
The  Company  is  a  guarantor  to  an  office  lease  under  which  its  remaining  exposure  through  to  the  end  of  the 
lease in June 2018 is approximately $70,000.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the members of White Cliff Minerals Limited
Report on the Financial Report
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  report  of  White  Cliff  Minerals  Limited  (“the  company”),  which 
comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of 
cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory  information,  and  the  directors’  declaration  of  the  consolidated  entity  comprising  the  company 
and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and 
fair  view  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  for  such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation  of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In  Note  1(c),  the  directors  also  state,  in  accordance  with  Accounting  Standard  AASB  101:  Presentation  of 
Financial  Statements,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in  accordance  with  Australian  Auditing  Standards.  Those  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  relevant 
ethical  requirements  relating  to  audit  engagements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial  report.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgement,  including  the  assessment  of 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  consolidated  entity’s  preparation  of  the 
financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s and 
its  controlled  entities’  internal  control.
An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial report.
Our  audit  did  not  involve  an  analysis  of  the  prudence  of  business  decisions  made  by  directors  or 
management.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

Auditor’s opinion
In our opinion:
(a)
the  financial  report  of  White  Cliff  Minerals  Limited  is  in  accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act  2001, 
including:
(i)  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its
performance for the year ended on that date; and
(ii)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001; and
(b)
the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as disclosed in Note 
1(c).
Emphasis of Matter
Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1(a) to the financial report which indicates that the 
continuing  viability  of  the  Group  and  its  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  meet  its  debts  and 
commitments as they fall due are dependent upon the Group being successful in completing a capital raising 
and/or asset sale/joint venture agreement in the next 12 months.
These  conditions  indicate  the  existence  of  a  material  uncertainty  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  about  the 
company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  therefore,  the  company  may  be  unable  to  realise  its 
assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Report on the Remuneration Report
We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors’ report for the year ended 30 June 2016. 
The  directors  of  the  company  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  presentation  of  the  Remuneration 
Report  in  accordance  with  section  300A  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an 
opinion on the Remuneration Report, based  on our  audit conducted  in accordance with Australian  Auditing 
Standards.
Auditor’s opinion
In  our  opinion,  the  Remuneration  Report  of  White  Cliff  Minerals  Limited  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016 
complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.
