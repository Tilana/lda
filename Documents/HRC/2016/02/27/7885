<p><b>  Mission to India: comments of the Government of India on 
the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments of the Government of India on the final report of the visit of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Christof Heyns, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrary executions to India 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>The Government of India&#8217;s additional comments on the final Report of the Special 
</p>
<p><b>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on his visit to India 
</b></p>
<p><b>from 19 </b>&#8211;<b> 30 March 2012, are given below: 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 26, the Special Rapporteur has said that he is unclear about how the 
Supreme Court reached the conclusion that AFSPA did not violate the Constitution.  The 
Government of India views this as a gross disregard for our Supreme Court which is well 
known for its independence and credibility. The judgements of the Supreme Court is in 
public domain and the Special Rapporteur may wish to take a look at them.  
</p>
<p>2. In its discussion on the issue of witch, in paragraph 62, the report states that &#8220;The 
Special Rapporteur heard from the Indian authorities that witch killings did not warrant his 
concern&#8221;. This assertion is uncalled for as no Indian authority has done so. On the contrary, 
</p>
<p>localized problems are acknowledged and tackled at local levels by State authorities.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur has compiled a number of allegations received by him from 
various individuals and NGOs and has not checked the veracity of these from Indian 
authorities or enquired whether available national remedies have been availed of.  In a 
country like India which places a great value on freedom of expression and has a vibrant 
media, numerous such allegations find expression and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report does 
</p>
<p>not give us any new information.  Besides, the Special Rapporteur has not given details of 
allegations in the absence of which the Government is not in a position to verify them and 
would, therefore, request the Special Rapporteur to provide details or refrain from making 
such statements or generalized allegations. Following are some examples: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Such a situation is further complicated by a reported practice of offering gallantry 
awards and promotions to security officers after the encounters (para 14). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reports by official Commissions of Inquiry, Committees and civil society 
organisations, have regarding many major incidents of communal violence indicated 
that the State and its agents, particularly the police forces, willfully did not exercise 
diligence in its duty to protect, and thus tolerated attacks on the life and rights of 
religious minorities, and, in some cases engaged, in active support (para 43). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur was informed of several cases of individuals unlawfully 
taken into custody, severely beaten and taken to hospital where they subsequently 
died. He was informed that no steps had been taken to bring perpetrators of these 
acts to account (para 31). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There are widespread allegations that the violence was fuelled by members of the 
state government (para 46). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur nevertheless heard concerns that the high levels of 
corruption, religious bias and the inconsistent application of investigations impede 
effective progress in such cases, thus fostering a culture of impunity (para 50). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>4. Paragraph 11 of the report states: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur received reports that, while many demonstrations occur 
without casualties, this is not always the case.  For example, at least 100 deaths were 
caused due to excessive use of force against demonstrators in Jammu and Kashmir 
in 2010.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> It is clarified that there were 2241 demonstrations during 2010 in Jammu &amp; Kashmir 
and regrettably not all of them were peaceful. They were specifically targeted against the 
Security Forces on instigation by a section of the society having vested interests in 
disturbing the peace in the region. 832 civilians, 2938 police personnel and 1552 Security 
forces were injured in these demonstrations.  First Information Reports (FIR)s were lodged 
in all cases of deaths, which were unfortunate, and investigations are underway.
