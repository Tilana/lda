<p><b>Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement):  draft resolution 
6/&#8230;  Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> its decision 4/103 of 30 March 2007 and taking note of General Assembly 
resolution 61/170 of 19 December 2006, as well as of the report of the Secretary-General on this 
issue (A/HRC/6/2), 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to international law, 
international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles 
governing peaceful relations among States, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of all 
human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> /&#8230; </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern</i> about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures in the 
field of human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Final Document of the 14th Summit Conference of Heads of State or 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in September 2006 in Havana, in which they 
agreed to oppose and condemn these measures or laws and their continued application, persevere 
with efforts to effectively reverse them and urge other States to do likewise as called for by the 
General Assembly and other United Nations organs, and to request States applying these 
measures or laws to revoke them fully and immediately, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 
to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations 
among States and impedes the full realization of all human rights, and also severely threatens the 
freedom of trade, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and United Nations conferences 
held in the 1990s and their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of international law and the 
Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated, 
implemented and enforced, inter alia through resorting to war and militarism, with all their 
negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social 
development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating 
additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under 
the jurisdiction of other States, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the implementation of 
the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which 
provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p> /&#8230; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 1. <i>Urges</i> all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive measures not in 
accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the 
United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade 
relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 
right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in addition, 
threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member States neither to 
recognize these measures nor apply them, as well as to take effective administrative or legislative 
measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain Powers of 
such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against 
</p>
<p>developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from exercising their right to 
decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates its call</i> upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
the principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the declarations of the 
United Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves to 
their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of 
which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and 
cultural development; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV)  
</p>
<p> /&#8230; </p>

 <p></p>
<p>of 24 October 1970, and according to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States proclaimed by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32, no State may use or 
encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in 
</p>
<p>order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from 
it advantages of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods such as food and medicines should not be used as tools 
for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their own 
means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this regard, calls upon all 
States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial 
application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the 
development of developing countries, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts 
on the Right to Development in its report on its second session (E/CN.4/1998/29); 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with extraterritorial 
application which are not in conformity with international law; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the World 
Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly urged States to 
avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the Information Society;  
</p>
<p> 11<i>. Invites</i> all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Council in the 
field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the scope of their 
respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development; 
</p>
<p> /&#8230; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i>: </p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in discharging her 
functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to pay due attention and 
give urgent consideration to the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all 
Member States and to seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects 
of unilateral coercive measures on their populations, and to submit a report thereon to the 
Council at its ninth session;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Decides</i> to examine this question, on a priority basis, at its ninth session under the 
same agenda item.
