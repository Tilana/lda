<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, a member of the Working Group on the issue 
of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises undertook an 
official visit to Mongolia from 8 to 18 October 2012. The Working Group expert 
appreciated the comprehensive and frank discussions she had with Government, business, 
affected stakeholders and civil society representatives during the visit. In the present report, 
the Working Group presents key findings regarding the potential and actual negative 
impacts of business activities in Mongolia, as well as progress on the implementation of the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The report concludes with 
recommendations that, if implemented, would enable tangible improvements to the 
protection of rights, prevention of negative impacts of business activities in Mongolia, and 
access to remedy for those affected by business activities. 
</p>
<p> During the visit, the expert found that the challenges faced by Mongolia related 
primarily to the lack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities of Government and business 
in addressing human rights impacts; the need to ensure that those impacted by business 
activities participate in key decisions that affect them, requiring in turn that those 
potentially affected have access to relevant information on a timely basis; the need for 
business and the Government to work together on issues of collective business impacts; the

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Further to resolution 17/4, the Working Group is mandated by the Human Rights 
Council to conduct country visits. At the invitation of the Government, Margaret Jungk, 
expert and member of the Working Group, undertook an official visit to Mongolia from 8 
to 18 October 2012.  
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group expert met with Government representatives at the central and 
local (<i>aima</i>g (province) and <i>soum</i> (district)) levels, including the Vice-Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the ministers of Construction, Economic Development, Mining, Justice, Population 
Development and Social Protection, and Nature, Environment and Green Development. She 
also met the President&#8217;s Advisor on Human Rights, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and 
the commissioners of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The expert met 
representatives of the United Nations system, international cooperation agencies, 
diplomatic missions, business enterprises and organizations, trade unions and civil society 
organizations, as well as representatives of nomadic herders and artisanal miners. In 
addition to holding meetings in Ulaanbaatar, the expert travelled to &#214;mn&#246;govi <i>aimag</i>, held 
meetings in Tsogtsetsii and Khanbogd <i>soums</i> and visited two mining sites (Tavan Tolgoi, 
operated by Energy Resources LLC; and Oyu Tolgoi, operated by Turquoise Hill 
Resources). She also participated in the conference, Mining and Human Rights in Mongolia 
(hereafter the Conference), organized by the NHRC and United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) on 10 and 11 October 20121. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group expert wishes to thank the Government for its invitation and for 
its valuable assistance before, during and after her visit to the country. She would also like 
to thank the civil society organizations and individuals with whom she met during her visit, 
as well as business representatives, particularly those who invited the delegation to visit 
their operations. 
</p>
<p>4. The key challenge for any country, especially one that is undergoing rapid economic 
development like Mongolia, is to maximize the positive effects of business (e.g. economic 
development, building infrastructure, employment) while minimizing the negative impacts 
(e.g. damage to the environment, violation of labour rights, reduced access to public 
services). Further to the Working Group&#8217;s mandate,2 during the visit, the expert focussed on 
five areas: identifying the main business-related impacts on human rights; identifying what 
key actors are currently doing to address these; clarifying what challenges are inhibiting 
key actors from meeting their human rights obligations and responsibilities; identifying the 
opportunities to advance implementation and dissemination of the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (hereafter the Guiding Principles); and the good practices and 
lessons learned that can be shared more broadly. 
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Working Group describes the information received by the 
expert during the visit to Mongolia, identifies key challenges as well as good practices, and 
makes recommendations for actions that may assist in remedying the challenges identified.

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General situation 
</b></p>
<p>6. Mongolia has undergone 20 years of political and economic reforms during its 
transition towards a market-based economy. The economy, traditionally based on livestock 
herding, is experiencing rapid transformation, driven by mineral discoveries,3 and real GDP 
per capita has more than doubled since 1990.4  
</p>
<p>7. In 2011, foreign direct investment in Mongolia totalled $5.3 billion. The World 
Bank highlighted that this economic growth has translated into some benefits for the people 
of Mongolia &#8211; poverty decreased from 39.2 per cent in 2010 to 29.8 per cent in 2011. 
According to UNDP&#8217;s Human Development Report (HDR) 2011, Mongolia has a human 
development index value of 0.653, in the medium human development range, placing the 
country at 110 out of 187 countries and territories. Although the percentage of the 
population which is undernourished has fallen steadily since 1991, in 2011 it was still at 
24.2 per cent.5 As noted in December 2012 by the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty 
and human rights,<b> </b>&#8220;this clearly shows that the growth triggered by the mining and 
extractive sector has not benefited the poorest sectors of society who have been left 
behind.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>8. Investment in the mining sector is expected to continue to drive economic 
expansion. Given the large human rights and environmental footprint of the mining sector, 
the Working Group expert gave greater focus to mining, and visited two <i>soums</i> affected by 
mining activities in &#214;mn&#246;govi. She also met with a business enterprise in the 
manufacturing (cashmere) sector and received information concerning the construction 
industry from numerous stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Framework for the protection of human rights in Mongolia 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International legal framework for the protection of human rights in Mongolia 
</b></p>
<p>9. Mongolia has ratified seven of the core human rights treaties,7 signed the 
Convention on Enforced Disappearance, and was reviewed at the ninth session of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) (2010). Mongolia is party to all 
eight fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the four 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.

</p>
<p><b> 2. The national policy and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. Article 10, paragraph 2, of the 1992 Constitution states that &#8220;Mongolia shall fulfil in 
good faith its obligations under international treaties to which it is a Party,&#8221; while paragraph 
3 states that &#8220;the international treaties to which Mongolia is a Party shall become effective 
as domestic legislation upon the entry into force of the laws on their ratification or 
accession.&#8221; The Working Group recommends that Mongolia ensure that international 
treaties do become effective as domestic legislation in practice.  
</p>
<p>11. Chapter 2 of the Constitution addresses human rights and freedoms, and in addition 
to provisions against discrimination, article 16 guarantees specific rights for citizens of 
Mongolia. 
</p>
<p>12. In addition to these rights, various Government and presidential platforms are 
relevant to the protection and promotion of human rights.  
</p>
<p>13. The State Great Hural (Parliament) adopted a National Human Rights Action 
Programme in 20038 to reinforce State mechanisms guaranteeing the realization of human 
rights and freedoms, combating violations thereof and ensuring their effective 
implementation. The action programme specifically recognizes the role of private 
enterprises and organizations in &#8220;the alleviation of poverty, in raising the general standard 
of living, in ensuring the right to work and to favourable conditions of work.&#8221; It also 
acknowledges that &#8220;commensurate with their important role in society, the operations of 
</p>
<p>private enterprises have a profound effect on the enjoyment of these and other human 
rights. They are, thus, important duty-bearers of human rights obligations and the subject of 
legitimate expectations of the State and the people of Mongolia.&#8221; Specifically, the action 
programme sets a number of objectives with regard to the private sector, including the 
promotion of awareness of human rights among workers, business owners, leaders and 
managers; the establishment of systems for registering human rights violations in the 
workplace and relevant complaints and development of investigation procedures; and the 
development and implementation of regulations to nullify licences of enterprises and legal 
persons that have seriously infringed on rights or damaged the environment twice or more. 
</p>
<p>14. At the time of the expert&#8217;s visit, the new Parliament had been in place for about 40 
days and many of the Ministers were new in their functions. The Working Group regrets 
that it was unable to meet with the Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Human Rights or with 
the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, particularly as the latter is responsible for coordinating, 
monitoring and reporting on national and international policies, and other issues relevant to 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government recently adopted its Platform for 2012-2016,9 which includes 
improving access to employment for citizens of Mongolia; improving access to health care 
and education; protecting the environment by integrating economic and development 
policies with a green development policy; and improving transparency and accountability 
with regard to State and Government activities. 
</p>
<p>16. The National Development Strategy (2007-2021)10 reiterates Mongolia&#8217;s 
commitment to respect human rights. It aims to improve direct enjoyment of human rights 
and freedoms by balancing the distribution of State powers; creating a legal environment 
for compensation of damages incurred by illegal actions of other actors; ensuring the right

</b></p>
<p>to a healthy and safe environment; providing for special protection of the rights of disabled 
citizens; and improving the legal environment for protecting the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>17. Mongolia adopted a national level Millennium Development Goal 9 on 
strengthening human rights and fostering democratic governance. Its targets are to fully 
respect and uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; ensure the freedom of the 
media and provide the public with free access to information; mainstream democratic 
principles and practices into life; and develop a zero-tolerance environment to corruption in 
all spheres of society. The 2011 national report on the implementation of this goal states 
that while there has been some progress towards achieving the three targets, several 
challenges remain.11  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to national human rights institutions, the Parliament adopted a law 
establishing the NHRC on 7 December 2000. The NHRC is mandated to promote and 
protect human rights and is &#8220;charged with monitoring the implementation of the provisions 
on human rights and freedoms, provided in the Constitution of Mongolia, laws and 
international treaties of Mongolia.&#8221;12 It is also mandated to review complaints of human 
rights violations and initiate proposals and recommendations and transmit them to State 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>19. Finally, the goals of the President&#8217;s Policy and Action Programme for 2009-2013 
include consolidating a human-centered society upholding human rights and freedom; 
strengthening the judiciary, establishing justice and eliminating corruption and 
bureaucracy; and ensuring a nature-friendly sustainable economic development policy 
supportive of rural development efforts.13 
</p>
<p><b> III. Impacts of business activities on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Framework for business activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Time of significant change and opportunity to improve prevention of business-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impacts 
</b></p>
<p>20. The political and legislative landscape in Mongolia is in a stage of significant 
change, as the new Government has just assumed office and has an ambitious Platform for 
2012-2016, with numerous new policies and laws being debated. The Working Group 
highlights this window of opportunity for setting the stage correctly and improving 
mechanisms to prevent the negative impacts of business activity. The Working Group 
emphasizes that there is need to ensure that laws are coherent, clear and address legislative 
gaps.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>21. Positive developments include the new Procurement Law, which came into force on 
1 October 2012. It provides for civil society to be involved in bidding processes and 
monitoring implementation of procurement contracts. This is crucial for environmental, 
social and human rights impacts to be given greater visibility. A role for civil society in 
reviewing tenders and contract implementation provides valuable confidence and capacity 
building for civil society to participate in decision-making in other areas, for example 
mining.

</p>
<p>22. The expert was informed of the Environmental Protection Law, amended in May 
2012, which requires environmental impact assessments for large-scale business projects, 
as well as strategic assessment of environmental and social impacts across an entire sector, 
when there are cumulative impacts from multiple projects. The Government should follow 
international best practice and incorporate human rights and social aspects into impact 
assessments, which are now included in leading international standards relating to 
environmental impact assessments. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. The expert learned that the upcoming revision of the Minerals Law of 2006 will 
address issues related to infrastructure provision, stakeholder consultation and the social 
responsibility of mining companies. Given the significant impacts of mining activities on 
human rights, the Working Group urges careful consideration of this revision and stresses 
that it should be undertaken with a human rights lens and with strong engagement of 
stakeholders at all levels.   
</p>
<p>24. The expert was informed of a new Conflict of Interest Law that requires 
Government officials to declare their ownership or interest in businesses. Enforcement of 
this is critical to establishing a firewall between business and Government. The Working 
Group strongly encourages the Government to pursue this initiative and consider other 
measures that ensure the separation of business and politics.<b> </b>This would enable both 
democracy and business to flourish, and would enable the Government to play its role in 
protecting the population from the adverse impacts of business.  
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group welcomes the Government&#8217;s plan to reform and strengthen the 
independence of oversight bodies, particularly those on audit, human rights and corruption, 
as these bodies play a key role in preventing and addressing adverse business impacts. 
</p>
<p>26. In addition to these legal developments, the Working Group stresses that the 
Government should consider a smart mix of measures &#8211; mandatory and voluntary &#8211; to 
foster business respect for human rights. The Government should engage with all 
stakeholders, in particular with regard to setting expectations and obligations of business 
enterprises and other actors in addressing business-related impacts on human rights. To 
foster business respect for human rights, the State should encourage business enterprises to 
communicate their policies and procedures for addressing their human rights impacts. The 
Working Group recommends that Mongolia consider developing a national plan for the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles and refer to relevant Working Group reports14 
that highlight positive examples. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Working Group urges the NHRC to take an active role in identifying whether 
specific laws are aligned with Mongolia&#8217;s human rights obligations and are being 
effectively enforced, as well as in providing guidance on human rights to business 
enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Expectations and responsibilities of all actors in addressing business-related impacts 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be clarified 
</b></p>
<p>28. The expert observed a lack of clarity as to the respective roles of business and 
Government, which is linked to the fact that business and politics often go hand in hand in 
Mongolia. In mining communities, the expert was informed of expectations that hospitals 
and schools would be built in the soums by business enterprises, without any mention of the 
government&#8217;s responsibility to do so, nor with clear contractual or legal obligations for 
</p>
<p>business enterprises in this regard.  
</p>
<p>  
 14 A/HRC/20/29; A/67/285. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Working Group recommends that communities, business enterprises and the 
Government refer to the Guiding Principles for clarification on the responsibilities of the 
different actors for preventing and addressing business-related human rights impacts. 
According to the Guiding Principles, the State has a duty to protect against human rights 
abuses in the context of business operations by establishing policies, laws and regulations 
that facilitate an environment in which business enterprises respect human rights. The State 
must also monitor and enforce compliance with such policies and regulations. As such the 
Government also has the responsibility to hold business enterprises to account and ensure 
the provision of an effective remedy for victims when business enterprises negatively 
impact on human rights.  
</p>
<p>30. Business enterprises, for their part, have the responsibility to respect human rights 
across their activities and operations. This means avoiding negative impacts on human 
rights either directly through their own operations or through their business relationships, 
for example with suppliers, business partners or governments. This includes applying 
international labour standards to their workers and those of their contractors, enforcing 
good health and safety practices, and ensuring that communities are not adversely affected 
by their operations. This also means that they have the responsibility to provide for or 
cooperate in remediation of adverse impacts that they have caused or contributed to. 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group emphasizes that obtaining clarification on roles and 
responsibility is key. Without such clarification, business enterprises and Government will 
continue to point the finger at each other &#8220;to do something,&#8221; obscuring who exactly has 
responsibilities for which impacts and activities. Human rights risk falling into the gap 
between the two. Without such clarification, business enterprises may be pushed into taking 
on the role of the Government, and in the course of doing so, may weaken pressure on the 
Government to be accountable and fulfil its democratically elected functions. Furthermore, 
those adversely affected by business will not know where or how to access remedy for 
infringement of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group recommends that the Government comply with its duty to 
protect against human rights abuse within its territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, 
including business enterprises. This requires that the Government state the expectation that 
all business enterprises domiciled in its territory (regardless of whether they are national, 
foreign, State or privately owned) respect human rights throughout their operations. The 
Working Group notes that the 2003 Action Programme provides for the Government to 
ensure that &#8220;human rights standards shall be developed and implemented by all enterprises 
and organizations in Mongolia and reflected in work standards;&#8221; it encourages the 
Government to effectively implement these plans. 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group further recommends that business enterprises operating in 
Mongolia comply with their responsibility to respect human rights, including by adopting a 
human rights policy, carrying out human rights due diligence with regard to their current 
and planned operations and addressing any negative human rights impacts that they cause, 
contribute to or are linked to. In doing so, business enterprises should refer to existing 
guidance and practice in various sectors.15 Business enterprises should pay particular 
attention to vulnerable groups and ensure that such groups are addressed in company due 
diligence. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Working Group encourages business enterprises to share their experiences in 
meeting their responsibility to respect human rights with other enterprises within and across 
sectors in Mongolia. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 See, for example, A/HRC/20/29 and A/67/285. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Key concerns arising from the lack of available and effective remedies and redress 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Working Group recalls that for the purposes of access to remedy in the Guiding 
Principles, the term &#8220;grievance mechanism&#8221; is used to indicate any routinized, State-based 
or non-State-based judicial or non-judicial process through which grievances concerning 
business-related human rights abuses can be raised and remedies can be sought in an 
effective manner. 
</p>
<p>36. Although the 2003 Action Programme provides for &#8220;procedures of public 
institutions and the Courts, whereby individuals and groups may seek redress for 
complaints about human rights violations [to] be widely publicised,&#8221; the expert observed 
that many do not appear to know where to seek redress for violations. For example, while 
nomadic herders indicated that they had contacted various authorities and business 
enterprises to raise their concerns, none of these can be deemed &#8220;grievance mechanisms&#8221; as 
defined in the Guiding Principles. In addition, the expert was informed that in many cases, 
victims and their families do not have recourse to grievance mechanisms or remedy. She 
was also informed that business enterprises were not adequately sanctioned for failing to 
observe legally required safety standards, preferring to pay the relatively small fine for 
violations rather than change their practices. In this regard, the expert found that current 
penalties are inadequate and should be reviewed to ensure that they can act as a deterrent to 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><i>  Access to judicial mechanisms for remedy 
</i></p>
<p>37. As highlighted by the ILO, the gaps and inconsistencies in legal provisions 
regulating employment and dispute resolution arising out of employment relationships are 
of concern. The Law of Courts 1994 does not give clear authority to establish specialized 
courts to deal with employment matters. As such, civil courts deal with contractual claims 
and individual labour rights disputes. In the absence of dedicated labour courts, the 
Working Group recommends that Mongolia ensure that alternate, adequately resourced 
mechanisms are available to resolve both labour rights and labour interest disputes. The 
expert learnt of a comprehensive exercise to modernize the Labour Law of 1999 in the light 
of comparative international experience and international labour standards that Mongolia 
has ratified, and welcomes its inclusion in the 2013-2014 State Tripartite Agreement on 
Labour and Social Consensus. The Working Group urges the Government to continue this 
initial work in a tripartite manner, in order to provide a stronger legal framework to uphold 
the rights of workers in Mongolia.  
</p>
<p>38. The lack of clarity as to where grievances against administrative acts can be brought 
is also of concern; the Constitutional Court does not hear individual complaints, and the 
purview of the Administrative Courts is unclear. While the expert was told of specific cases 
where remedies were awarded,16 she also received evidence of significant gaps. The 
Working Group welcomes the initiative of the Government to develop a general law on 
administrative procedure. It urges the Government to ensure that independent 
administrative courts are empowered to effectively review complaints against 
administrative organs; to review the decisions and actions of public officials that violate 
human rights; and to prevent administrative abuses and misconduct, as per the 2003 Action 
Programme. It also encourages the Government to consider widening the mandate of the 
Constitutional Court to include hearing complaints from individuals with regard to 
violations of their rights, as suggested in the Government Platform for 2012-2016. 
</p>
<p>  
 16 According to the Minister of Justice, the Supreme Court recently awarded 1.3 billion togrogs to the

</b></p>
<p>39. Concern with regard to the independence and capacity of the judiciary was 
highlighted. The Working Group recommends that Mongolia implement the 
recommendations made during the UPR,17 and reinforce the independence and capacity of 
judges, lawyers and prosecutors. The Government should ensure that mandatory training 
for judges and lawyers includes international human rights obligations to which Mongolia 
is a party, as well as standards relating to business and human rights, such as the Guiding 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>40. The expert was told of other specific barriers to accessing remedies, namely that 
actions can only be brought on behalf of specific named individuals with notary certificates, 
and that the law does not allow for cases against illegal administrative acts if those filing 
the case have not been directly affected. The Government should consider broadening the 
locus standi provisions to enable public interest litigation, particularly with regard to the 
impact of mining on human rights. Further, the expert was informed that high court fees 
and stamp duties impede access to courts. The Working Group recommends that the level 
of court fees and stamp duty be reviewed, and waived for indigent plaintiffs and public 
interest cases.  
</p>
<p>41. More broadly, the Working Group notes reports of the lack of free legal assistance in 
civil cases, and even for criminal cases there is insufficient free legal assistance.18 It notes 
the adoption of the National Programme on Legal Aid in 2006 and the Government&#8217;s plans 
to adopt a Law on Legal Aid. The Working Group recommends that the Government 
consider increasing the number of qualified lawyers providing free legal assistance 
throughout Mongolia for both criminal and civil cases.  
</p>
<p>42. Furthermore, the expert was informed of financial costs relating to the 
implementation of court decisions by the Court Decision Enforcing Authority. The 
Working Group recommends that financial obstacles to the implementation of judicial 
decisions be removed. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Working Group understands that one of the President&#8217;s priorities is judicial 
reform, and that the 2003 Action Programme includes provisions on improving access to 
remedy, including through addressing barriers to the implementation of court decisions. 
Similarly, the planned Ministry of Justice review of all laws and draft laws (including at the 
sub-national level) to verify compliance with human rights obligations may address some 
of these issues. The Working Group welcomes these initiatives and suggests that the 
Government be guided by the Guiding Principles in addressing existing gaps and 
challenges in access to remedy, that a special lens of business and human rights be applied, 
and that legislation be amended to ensure compatibility with Mongolia&#8217;s international 
human rights obligations. The Government should carry out awareness-raising campaigns, 
together with the NHRC and civil society, to allow persons within its jurisdiction to avail 
themselves of the legal, and non-legal, remedies available to assist them. 
</p>
<p><i>  Access to non-judicial mechanisms for remedy 
</i></p>
<p>44. The expert was told of various non-judicial mechanisms, including mediation and 
grievance mechanisms. The Labour Code provides for dispute resolution systems for 
collective and individual disputes. In the case of individual disputes, it specifically provides 
for Labour Dispute Settlement Commissions in business enterprises. The Confederation of 
Mongolian Trade Unions19 (CMTU) referred to a tripartite dispute settlement subcommittee

</p>
<p>which operates in 21 aimags to seek to resolve disputes that would otherwise be taken to 
the courts, and which it notes is a faster dispute resolution mechanism.  
</p>
<p>45. The expert was informed that a tripartite committee was set up in early 2012 to 
allow trade unions and employers&#8217; unions to resolve mining-related grievances, but that the 
initiative was suspended following the change of Government. The Working Group 
recommends that the Government assess the effectiveness of all grievance mechanisms, and 
support effective non-judicial mechanisms to complement judicial mechanisms where 
appropriate. Non-judicial mechanisms play a key complementary role to judicial 
mechanisms in ensuring access to effective remedy, and may play a role in preventing 
further human rights violations by providing a venue for community concerns to be heard 
and addressed. The Working Group encourages the Government to provide adequate 
resources to ensure that such mechanisms are effective, and encourages all stakeholders to 
build awareness of their special role. 
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group also notes that the NHRC has an important role to play in 
hearing business-related human rights grievances, though reports indicate that it receives 
limited complaints on this topic. The Government should ensure that the NHRC is provided 
with the necessary support and resources to receive and investigate complaints. 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group notes that a number of business enterprises operating in 
Mongolia are subject to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the International Finance 
Corporation&#8217;s (IFC) Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, 
both of which mention the need for operational-level grievance mechanisms.20 These 
mechanisms, which the expert was informed are in place in a number of mining companies, 
can provide early-stage recourse and resolution. The Working Group regrets that little 
information is available on the accessibility and effectiveness of these mechanisms across 
Mongolia and across sectors. It recommends that operational-level grievance mechanisms 
reflect the criteria in principle 31 of the Guiding Principles to ensure their effectiveness in 
practice, namely that they are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, 
rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning. It also encourages business 
enterprises to ensure that operational-level mechanisms are based on engagement and 
dialogue, consulting the stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended and focusing 
on dialogue as a means to address and resolve grievances. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Consultation and public participation at all levels of decision-making, including timely 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to information, are key to addressing business-related impacts 
</b></p>
<p>48. Public consultation and participation is particularly crucial for decisions that will 
have a substantial impact on people&#8217;s lives, including big &#8220;community footprint&#8221; projects 
such as mining or the construction of a large commercial complex. The failure to provide 
people with information not only undermines the ability of a business enterprise to respect 
rights (as it may not be aware of its potential or actual impacts), but it also fosters mistrust 
between communities and business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>49. Nomadic herders informed the expert that they only found out that a mining 
operation was coming to their area when the trucks and equipment arrived. Local 
government officials also said they were not involved in the decisions of the central

<p>Government on exploration and mining activities.21 They reported that the law that provides 
for consultation at the <i>aimag</i> level is selectively applied, in practice, or simply ignored, 
even where the local government expressly requests that mining licences no longer be 
issued in a particular <i>aimag</i>. Many stakeholders expressed concern that mining operations 
impeded good governance and influenced local elections, and that the interests of mining 
companies had &#8220;merged&#8221; with local politics. The expert was also informed that investment 
contracts and environmental impact assessments are often made public only after they have 
been agreed &#8211; if at all &#8211;, making it impossible for affected stakeholders to monitor the 
process by which they were created or to participate and raise concerns as to their content 
prior to the agreements being finalized.  
</p>
<p>50. The expert also noted some positive developments, including the new Budget Law 
that allows for local oversight of Government expenditure at the <i>soum</i> level; local town hall 
meetings organized by business enterprises in areas where they operate; and initiatives such 
as collaboration between business enterprises, local government and citizens or civil 
society; citizens&#8217; councils identifying and addressing projected impacts; committees 
discussing environmental impact assessments for specific mining projects; and initiatives 
with small local business enterprises ensuring that procurement processes delivered quality 
food to schools. 
</p>
<p>51. The expert noted the negotiations for a proposed cooperation agreement between 
&#214;mn&#246;govi <i>aimag</i> and Oyu Tolgoi LLC on key areas of collaboration; the intention at the 
<i>aimag</i> level to set up a dedicated institutional unit responsible for mining policy; and 
Citizen Halls, aimed at receiving public comments on draft laws and policies. The Working 
Group noted various other initiatives, including an Information Centre, a website and a 
telephone hotline that allows users to register complaints. 
</p>
<p>52. Specifically with regard to mining, the Platform for 2012-2016 stipulates that the 
opinion of local residents should be obtained in the process of issuance of mineral licences. 
The Working Group recommends that the Government take the lead in meaningful 
engagement directly with affected communities, including in environmental impact 
assessments and through its planned revision of the Minerals Law. It should consider 
decentralizing access to information through local government offices. 
</p>
<p>53. It recommends that business enterprises engage regularly and directly with the 
communities where their operations take place, in addition to the local <i>hural</i> (parliament), 
as per the corporate responsibility to respect human rights contained in the Guiding 
Principles. Whether through joint cooperation councils or other forums, business 
enterprises should ensure that communities are consulted and notified before operations 
begin and that they are fully informed of the way their lifestyles, livelihoods and human 
rights may be affected. The Working Group further encourages business enterprises to 
share the lessons of these efforts with others in their industry sector and geographic region.  </p>
<p>54. The Working Group recommends that the Government ensure that meaningful 
consultations with potentially affected stakeholders become an essential component of all 
investment contracts entered into with international investors. It encourages the 
Government to refer to UNCTAD&#8217;s Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development22 and the Principles for responsible contracts.23 The Working Group 
commends the developments relating to Mongolia&#8217;s possible accession to the Economic 
Commission for Europe (ECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation

</p>
<p><b> 5. Need for stronger monitoring and enforcement capabilities 
</b></p>
<p>55. The expert was informed of frequent reports of fatal accidents caused by 
construction companies ignoring basic health and safety requirements. Stakeholders raised 
the issue of lack of Government human resources and technical expertise to monitor 
increasing private-sector activity. This lack of capacity is particularly acute at the local 
level, where the General Agency for Specialized Inspection (GASI) struggles to undertake 
inspections with very limited human, technical and financial resources, and in the 
construction sector where the expert learned of over 80 construction projects in Ulaanbaatar 
that lack the required permits. She noted the 2010 NHRC report that over 60 per cent of 
violations of the building code related to construction standards.24 According to ILO, GASI 
has itself called for provisions in the labour law to empower its inspectors to monitor 
conditions in the workplace. ILO&#8217;s studies in 200525 and 2009,26 comparing Mongolian law 
with international labour inspection standards, highlighted a number of gaps. The 
Government should ensure that inspection standards are compatible with international 
labour inspection standards and consider ratifying the Labour Inspection Convention, 1947 
(No. 81). 
</p>
<p>56. The expert was informed that the Government has initiated a review of all 
occupational and health standards and called for strengthened enforcement of laws in its 
Action Programme. She was also informed that local and national governments have taken 
action recently to address the lack of compliance with safety measures. The Working Group 
urges the Government to prioritize the strengthening of human resources and the technical 
capacity of State entities charged with monitoring and enforcing laws regulating business 
activity. It further encourages international development partners to support efforts in this 
area.  
</p>
<p>57. This should also include reinforcing the capacity of the NHRC, which has the 
potential to serve as an effective tool in monitoring business impacts on human rights and 
providing information and avenues for redress. However, the NHRC suffers from lack of 
resources and a presence in rural <i>aimags</i>. Furthermore, though it has been accredited with 
&#8220;A&#8221; status since 2003 by the ICC, in November 200827 the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
(SCA) recommended that the process for appointing Commissioners be transparent and that 
consultation and engagement with civil society be enhanced, a call which has been echoed 
by United Nations treaty bodies.28 
</p>
<p>58. The Government should devote adequate human, financial and technical resources to 
the NHRC and increase its capacity to effectively monitor human rights impacts, including 
those arising from business. The Government should ensure that the NHRC has sufficient 
resources to increase its efforts to raise awareness throughout Mongolia of its competence 
to receive and consider complaints relating to the negative impacts of business on human 
rights. The Working Group notes that the Platform for 2012-2016 indicates that the NHRC

<p>may be reformed; it urges that any reform strengthen the independence of the NHRC and its 
compliance with the Paris Principles.29 In turn, the NHRC should ensure that it covers the 
broad spectrum of human rights in its activities, and in particular takes guidance from the 
Guiding Principles when investigating individual complaints relating to the human rights 
impacts of business activities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific industries and issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The mining industry 
</b></p>
<p>59. The increase in mining activities and their considerable footprint means numerous 
and severe potential negative human rights impacts if the activity is not managed properly. 
In addition to issues relating to lack of information and consultation (see above), the 
Working Group expert noted four main impacts of this sector relating to the traditional way 
of life of nomadic herders; over-stretched social services; working conditions and the right 
to a healthy and safe environment as protected by the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>60. The expert was informed that mineral exploration and extraction has resulted in 
herders losing access to their traditional herding lands, and that pastureland and surface 
water resources have been destroyed. As a result, the herders enjoyment of the rights to an 
adequate standard of living and to take part in cultural life through farming and animal 
husbandry has been impacted. She noted concerns about the right to water, which is 
essential not only for the preservation of the nomadic lifestyle and culture, but also for 
those who are living in towns across the region. Finally, the expert was informed that 
mineral exploration has required herders to move their herds to more remote regions, for 
longer periods of time, limiting their access to education, health care and social welfare 
services. 
</p>
<p>61. Migration into <i>soums</i> located near mining operations has severely stretched the 
capacity of social services to provide adequate facilities and services: budgets are based on 
the registered population, and economic migrants often do not register until they have 
secured employment. The Minister of Mining himself voiced the concern that when 
extractive industries are developed without any preparedness, in terms of infrastructure, 
there could be a violation of article 16, paragraph 3, of the Constitution (Right to freedom 
of movement within the country and freedom to choose one&#8217;s place of residence).30 The 
Government should ensure adequate access to health and social services in all <i>soums</i>, and 
adequate planning, with regard to infrastructure and services, prior to the start of mining 
operations.  
</p>
<p>62. The expert was informed about the difficult working conditions in the mining sector, 
and several associated negative consequences, including the impact on family life of 
strenuous shift work that is common in mining operations. The Minister of Labour 
indicated that 70 per cent of occupational diseases nationwide are linked to the mining 
sector (largely due to dust in the workplace).31 A related issue of concern is that of civic 
rights; the expert was informed that employees and shift workers do not get time off to vote 
in elections. The Government should address the issue of restrictions to the right to vote as 
a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p>63. The expert was informed of serious impacts on the right to a healthy and safe 
environment, as provided for in the Mongolian Constitution, linked to the contamination of 
</p>
<p>  
 29 General Assembly resolution 48/134, annex.

</p>
<p>soil and water, destruction of land and depletion of ground and surface waters. Stakeholders 
commented on the dust generated by coal mines and its impacts on the health of the local 
population. The expert was also informed that some of these &#8220;coal roads&#8221; cross protected 
areas, causing further potential environmental impacts.32  
</p>
<p>64. The expert was encouraged to note that the Ministry of Nature and Green 
Development is putting in place a programme to restore areas that have been damaged due 
to mining operations; improve awareness of environmental impact assessments and related 
regulations; and improve the enforcement of laws related to environmental damage.33 The 
Working Group notes the Ministry&#8217;s ongoing review of existing environmental legislation, 
and urges prompt action to close any gaps. It also notes that the Law on Natural Resources 
states that business enterprises are responsible for restoring land after mining, and that the 
Government is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the law. The Working 
Group urges business enterprises involved in mining activities to comply with their legal 
obligations to restore land after mining, and urges the Government to ensure adequate 
financial and technical resources to effectively monitor compliance with these provisions. 
</p>
<p>65. The Minister of Mining indicated that he plans to carry out a study on mining and 
human rights violations,34 and that according to the Government Platform for 2012-2016, 
the key economic policy objective is the reduction of dependency on the mining sector; 
achievement of long-term sustainable development; and the creation of a competitive and 
diversified economy. The Working Group notes that Mongolia is Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliant35 and that a Declaration on Responsible Mining 
was developed in 2007 through a multi-stakeholder forum.36 However, it notes with 
concern that the mining contracts signed are very broad and difficult to monitor. The 
Government should ensure that it maintains adequate policy space to meet its human rights 
obligations when entering into investment treaties or contracts with business enterprises. 
The Working Group refers to the Principles for responsible contracts and recommends that 
the Government integrate the management of human rights risks into State-investor contract 
negotiations. The Government should proceed with the review of the Minerals Law, which 
should include provisions requiring meaningful engagement with local government and 
potentially affected stakeholders.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Artisanal miners 
</b></p>
<p>66. According to the Minister of Labour, there are 62,000 citizens engaged in artisanal 
mining, across 49 <i>soums.</i>37 Unregistered artisanal miners face uncertain income, dangerous 
working conditions &#8211; exacerbated by violence,38 and lack of access to basic social services 
in their <i>soum</i> of work. It is also reportedly common for children of artisanal miners to leave 
school to assist in mining activities.39 Despite new laws and regulations aimed at 
formalizing and legalizing their activities, reportedly, only around 5,000 artisanal miners

<p>have done so.40 Many artisanal miners cannot afford to pay the monthly flat rate income tax 
levied on registered small-scale miners. Furthermore, some artisanal miners have tried to 
register with the local government, as required by law, but have been unable to complete 
the process, due to barriers at that level.41  
</p>
<p>67. The Government should investigate all cases of violence against artisanal miners and 
address any generalized discrimination and marginalization linked to their activities, 
whether they are legal or illegal.  
</p>
<p>68. Conversely, the expert noted reports of negative impacts from artisanal mining, 
particularly related to environmental damage and poor working conditions of those working 
in artisanal mines. The Working Group emphasizes that the Guiding Principles apply to all 
business enterprises regardless of size, sector, location, ownership or structure. As such, 
registered small-scale mining operations should abide by the corporate responsibility to 
respect human rights. The Government should ensure that laws and procedures related to 
business enterprises enable, rather than constrain, business respect for human rights. The 
Government should facilitate the registration of artisanal miners by reviewing the 2010 law 
on formalizing artisanal and small-scale mining, while seeking to identify and prevent any 
negative human rights impacts such operations may have on those working in the mines 
and on surrounding communities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Employment and rights of workers, particularly in the construction and cashmere 
</b></p>
<p><b>industries 
</b></p>
<p>69. Article 16(4) of the Constitution protects &#8220;the right to free choice of employment, 
favourable conditions of work, remuneration, rest, and private enterprise. No one may be 
unlawfully forced to work.&#8221; According to ILO, Mongolia has ratified a total of 16 
international labour conventions, including the eight fundamental ILO conventions, 
however, Mongolia discharges its reporting obligations only intermittently. The ILO 
Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) 
identified several legislative shortcomings in the application of international labour 
standards obligations. The Government should proceed with a general revision of the 
Labour Law to identify and remedy these gaps.  
</p>
<p>70. According to the CMTU, common violations in industrial relations relate to the 
hiring and laying off of employees; determination of wages; the establishment of 
employment contracts; occupational health and safety; and the right to freedom of 
association.42 The expert was informed that persons with disabilities, children, older 
persons and women are particularly at risk, and that the Labour Law does not explicitly and 
adequately protect them against direct and indirect discrimination. She also received  
reports indicating that the right to freedom of association, as guaranteed by article 16, 
paragraph 16, of the Mongolian Constitution, is violated as workers are pressured, 
discriminated against and even fired for seeking unionization or being unionized.43 The 
Working Group recalls that the right to freedom of association is protected under ILO 
conventions and international human rights treaties to which Mongolia is a party; it 
recommends that the Government ensure and monitor the effective application of this right.

</p>
<p>71. Despite the establishment of a National Tripartite Committee on Occupational 
Safety and Health in 2009,44 the lack of implementation of the Law on Occupational Safety 
and Health is an issue of serious concern, as it has led to loss of life and health. Statistics 
presented during the Conference indicate that the number of accidents and occupational 
diseases are decreasing, but still remain particularly poor in mining (81 per cent of 
occupational diseases in 2011) and construction (10.7 per cent of occupational diseases in 
2011).45 In 2011, CEACR46 asked the Government to provide information on the impact of 
the measures taken to curb the recorded increase in occupational accidents and diseases in 
the construction sector, and to continue to provide information on the application of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Convention in practice in all sectors. Given its plans with 
regard to &#8220;development of infrastructure and urbanization,&#8221;47 the Government should 
address and remedy issues relating to the construction industry as a matter of urgency.<b> 
</b>Despite initiatives to improve and secure occupational health and safety in mining, 
particularly in larger multinational enterprises, many other companies do not appear to 
employ occupational health and safety specialists and do not have basic safety policies and 
inspections in place.  Health and safety is a major component of business responsibility, 
and the Working Group stresses that all business enterprises are obliged to establish sound 
practices in this area. It encourages those business enterprises that have set up internal 
training, monitoring and inspection processes with a proven success record to share their 
experiences with other business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group welcomes the Government Platform statement that construction 
standards will be reviewed. The Government should ensure that adequate occupational 
health and safety regulations are adopted and enforced, and adequate financial, human and 
technical resources are provided to the appropriate inspection agencies. The Working 
Group notes the initiative of the CMTU and GASI to conduct joint inspections and training 
programmes,48 and recommends that the Government draw on all available technical 
assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child labour 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Working Group recalls that the Special rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
slavery, including its causes and consequences had identified child labour in artisanal 
mining, including in Mongolia, as an area of concern.49 The expert was informed that 
although child labour has decreased in the informal mining sector, child protection is still 
weak in the informal sector.50 
</p>
<p>74. It is estimated that between 13 and 28 per cent of children aged 5-17 are engaged in 
child labour,51 and that children&#8217;s work is concentrated overwhelmingly in the agriculture

working children and the various negative consequences, including school dropout rates 
and negative impacts on health, particularly for those engaged in hazardous work in 
mines.52 The expert was informed that children of recognized herders have access to a 
boarding school and rejoin their families and herding as part of their traditional way of life 
during school holidays. Within the context of its revision of the Labour Law, the 
Government should address these concerns and challenges to maintaining the traditional 
way of life of nomadic herders, while prioritizing protection of the rights of children and 
the elimination of child labour, in line with the CEACR comments on the application of the 
Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 183) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
Convention, 1999 (No. 182).53 The Government should take necessary measures to adopt 
legislation that establishes appropriate and effective penalties for violations of the 
provisions relating to child labour, and draw on all available technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>75. The expert learned that more than 30,000 children participate in races as child 
jockeys every year, performing work which, according to the CEACR, by its nature and the 
extremely hazardous conditions in which it is performed, is likely to harm their health and 
safety.54 The CEACR has expressed concern at the continued use of children in horse 
racing, and requested the Government to ensure that the protective measures in place, 
aimed at protecting the health and safety of child jockeys, are strictly enforced.55 The 
Working Group welcomes the adoption of an action plan on the elimination of child labour, 
and encourages the Government to seek the assistance of the international community in 
meeting this aim across all sectors where child labour is still present.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Foreign workers and the informal sector 
</b></p>
<p>76. According to the International Trade Union Confederation, Mongolian law 
specifically prohibits forced labour, but reports continue to emerge regarding the situation 
of North Korean workers. The expert was informed that<b> </b>they are used in manufacturing and 
construction pursuant to an agreement signed by the Mongolian and North Korean 
Governments, which was extended for a further five years in 2012. She noted allegations of 
forced labour and that their salary is allegedly either paid in full or in part to the North 
Korean Government. The workers reportedly live in secured compounds and are not 
allowed to leave.  
</p>
<p>77. The expert was also informed that the construction sector relies heavily on Chinese 
labour; many of the workers do not have an employment contracts and therefore lack labour 
rights protection and social security. With regard to the informal sector more generally, the 
expert was informed that just over one third of the labour force are waged employees. 
Issues regarding informal labourers include lack of social protection, particularly for 
women, and poor working conditions.  
</p>
<p>78. The Working Group recalls that Mongolia has the obligation to protect the rights of 
all persons within its jurisdiction, whether or not formally employed, and recommends that 
the Government specifically address the situation of foreign workers and informal workers 
as possible vulnerable groups. It notes that the 2003 Action Programme indicates that the

</p>
<p>protection of the rights of foreign citizens residing in Mongolia should be reviewed and 
improved. It urges the Government to improve such protection in law and in practice; and 
encourages it to consider introducing social protection mechanisms for the informal sector. 
</p>
<p>79. The Government should address the issue of forced or slave labour in all economic 
sectors, in accordance with ILO conventions and international standards. This includes 
providing and effectively enforcing adequate legal protection for workers and ensuring that 
forced labour is punishable as a criminal offence, as required by the ILO Forced Labour 
Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and ensuring remedies for victims of human trafficking and 
forced and slave labour. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Working Group expert was informed that corruption is a concern in Mongolia, 
and that it weakens the authorities&#8217; accountability and effectiveness in preventing and 
addressing the negative impacts of business activities. The Working Group notes that 
Mongolia accepted a recommendation by the UPR aimed at tackling corruption,56 and the 
efforts undertaken in this regard,57 including the adoption of the Anti-Corruption Law in 
2006 and the establishment of the Independent Authority Against Corruption. It also recalls 
the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child and its 
recommendation that Mongolia reinforce the State Authority on Anti-Corruption.58 It notes 
that Mongolia adheres to the EITI and various other anti-corruption regimes, including the 
United Nations Convention Against Corruption,59 and that all civil servants and elected 
officials are required to file annual income and asset disclosure forms. It further notes that 
the Implementation Review Group established pursuant to the Convention had highlighted 
areas where improvements could be made.60 The Working Group recalls that the 
Government had announced several anti-corruption measures in its Platform for 2012-2016, 
and that corruption was listed as a priority in the President&#8217;s Programme of Action. The 
Working Group welcomes the adoption of the specific target to &#8220;develop a zero-tolerance 
environment to corruption in all spheres of society,&#8221; as part of Mongolia&#8217;s national 
Millennium Development Goal 9 commitments, but notes the vast remaining challenges 
relating to its implementation.61  
</p>
<p>81. Article 21 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights states that &#8220;the will of the 
people shall be the basis of the authority of the government&#8221;. Corruption not only distorts 
this mandate, but engenders discrimination, compounds existing poverty and facilitates 
human rights abuses by businesses. The Working Group therefore recommends that 
corruption be tackled as a matter of urgency, and that the Government take appropriate 
measures in practice to develop good governance strategies and combat corruption.<b>
