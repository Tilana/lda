OUTLOOK
(I)
Operating Strategies for the Second Half of 2014
CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
In the second half of 2014, affected by the sluggish global macro-economy, coal will continue to be oversupplied in the domestic and international markets.
With gradual implementation of directional control policy by the Chinese government and the end of the competitive strategy to force prices down by large-
scale coal enterprises, it is estimated that the global coal price will run at a low level.
Faced with complex and severe economic situation and unfavorable conditions, the Group will focus on the full implementation of the value recreation to the
whole process of “Three Reductions and Three Enhancements” strategy. The Group will take more effective measures and actively respond to challenges to
ensure steady development of the company. For the second half of 2014, the Group will primarily focus on the implementation of the following operating
measures:
The Group will organize our production in a scientific way to increase production and enhance efficiency. The Group will adhere to increase
production increase, continue assurance, enhance safety and reduce costs in coal mines within Shandong province to maintain stable production and high
efficiency; give priority to production increase, potential development, quality improvement and profitability enhancement in coal mines outside Shandong

(II)
Major Risks Faced by the Group, Impact and Measures
Risks arising from product price volatility
Affected by continuous downturn of the global economy, there are quantitative easing and structural surplus in coal market. Meanwhile, various pressures
such as adjustment of energy policy, suppression from related industries, impact of overseas coal and competition among coal industry will curb the coal
price, thus the product price of the Group is subject to relatively high risks of downside fluctuation.
Counter-measures: In view of the price volatility risk, the Group will proactively analyze and study the market, adjust marketing strategies and innovate
marketing method, accelerate integration of marketing resources, give full play to the marketing advantages in scale, region and brand, implement the
domestic and international integrated marketing strategies, enhance our marketing position to minimize the adverse impact of market price fluctuations on the
Group’s profits.
Risks arising from product trade
The coal trade volume of the Group has been continuously increasing in recent years. However, affected by factors such as variation of supply and demand
and fluctuation of coal price, our profit from coal trade is relatively low. At the same time, as most of the coal trade suppliers are for operation purpose and
large sum of prepaid fund was taken up, thus the product trade risks are high.
Counter-measures: In view of the coal trade risk, the Group will establish and improve market information analysis mechanism and trade risk evaluation
system by monitoring market trend and seize trade opportunities to prevent market risks. The Group will make great effort to enhance offline trade, highlight
scale effect, decrease purchasing cost, improve trade profitability and prevent funding risks.
32      Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited  Interim Report 2014
Risks arising from safety production
CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
Coal mining, coal chemical and power generation are the three main business sectors of the Group. All of them are of high hazardous nature and of complex
uncertainties in production. As the safety production cycle of coal mines in the headquarters has been extending, the ignorance of safety control in mine sites
is obvious. Furthermore, new issues from new projects outside of headquarters, which will be soon put into production, are underway. Thus the Group faces
a high risk of production safety.
Counter-measures: The Group will continue to strictly implement the safety responsibility system, optimize safety management operation mechanism, and
promote employees’ safety management; building up risk pre-control management, strengthening the safety technique support and safety supervision work,
to keep on the effective management and control of safety production.
Risks arising from debt financing
The debt-to-assets ratio of the Group has increased in recent years and the ability of debt repayment has slightly decreased. As a result, it becomes harder to
finance with increased financing cost.
Counter-measures: In order to mitigate risks arising from debt financing, the Group has taken a series of measures: 1) making a reasonable funding plan,
actively expanding fund raising channels and method to allocate fund at home and abroad in the most efficient manner; 2) optimizing the debt structure to
lower the debt-to-assets ratio and financing cost to ensure the fund stock of the Group; 3) strengthening cash inflow management and financing to ensure
sufficient operating cash flow of the Group.
Risks arising from efficiency and effectiveness of management and control
With business expansion across domestic and overseas markets as well as industry sectors, it has become increasingly challenging for the Group to
manage its subsidiaries, which is not in conformity with the rapid development of the Group. Meanwhile, as the basic management to the subsidiaries is
weak, the efficiency and effectiveness of management and control to the subsidiaries is not forceful. Thus the Group faces various risks.
Counter-measures: The Group will accelerate to establish a flexible and efficient management system that is in line with the actual situation and can achieve
synergy at home and abroad. Firstly, the Group will encourage the integration of innovation in management culture and corporate culture; Secondly, the
Group will improve the construction of internal control system and risk control system; Thirdly, the Group will enhance the assets management of its overseas
subsidiaries and synergy management; Fourthly, the Group will establish a reliable and smooth information communication management system; Lastly, the
Group will strengthen the supervision and examination of its subsidiaries.

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2013, except a number of accounting policies that are adopted by the Company and effective for annual periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2014.
In the current period, the Group had applied, for the first time, the new standards and interpretations and revised/ amended standards and interpretations (the
new “IFRSs”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (the
“IFRIC”) of the IASB, which are effective for the financial year beginning on January 1, 2014. The new IFRSs relevant to these interim financial statements
are as follows:
IAS 32 (Amendments)
IAS 36 (Amendments)
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
   Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
IAS 39 (Amendments)
IFRIC-Int 21
Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
   Levies
The adoption of the new IFRSs had no material effect on the results or financial position of the Group for the current or prior accounting periods. Accordingly,
no prior period adjustment has been recognized.
The Group has not early applied the new standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective. The directors of the Company anticipate
that the application of these standards or interpretations will have no material impact on the results and the financial position of the Group.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group is engaged primarily in the coal mining business and the coal railway transportation business. The Company does not currently have direct
export rights in the PRC and all of its export sales must be made through China National Coal Industry Import and Export Corporation (“National Coal
Corporation”) or Minmetals Trading Co., Ltd. (“Minmetals Trading”) or Shanxi Coal Imp. & Exp Group Corp. (“Shanxi Coal Corporation”). The final customer
destination of the Company’s export sales is determined by the Company, National Coal Corporation, Minmetals Trading or Shanxi Coal Corporation.
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and associates are engaged in trading and processing of mining machinery and the transportation business via rivers
and lakes and finance services in the PRC. No separate segment information about these businesses is presented in these financial statements as the
underlying gross sales, results and assets of these businesses, which are currently included in the coal mining business segment, are insignificant to the
Group. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are engaged in production of methanol and other chemical products, and invest in heat and electricity.
For management purposes, the Group is currently organized into three operating divisions-coal mining, coal railway transportation and methanol, electricity
and heat supply. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Principal activities are as follows:
Mining
Coal railway transportation
    
Methanol, electricity and heat supply
–
–    
–
Underground and open-cut mining, preparation and sales of coal and potash mineral
exploration
Provision of railway transportation services
Production and sales of methanol and electricity and related heat supply services
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of corporate expenses and directors’ emoluments, results of associates,
interest income, interest expenses and income tax expenses. This is the measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource
allocation and assessment of segment performance.

INCOME TAXES – CONTINUED
Note: The Australian Minerals Resources Rent Tax (“MRRT”) legislation was enacted on 19 March 2012 and effective from 1 July 2012. According to the
relevant provisions of the MRRT tax laws, subsidiaries in Australia are required to determine the starting base allowance on the balance sheet. Book
value or market value approach can be selected in calculating the starting base and subsequently amortize within the prescribed useful life. Market
value approach was selected for mines in Australia. Under the market value approach, base value is determined based on market value of the coal
mines on 1 May 2010 and amortize based on the shorter of the life of mining project, mining rights and mining production.
During 2013, the Australian Government released an exposure draft legislation which proposed to repeal the MRRT legislation. At June 30, 2014, the
Australian Government had not passed the repeal legislation.

estimated based on the discounted cash flows between the contract floating rate and contract fixed rate. The fair value of other financial assets and financial
liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortized cost in the consolidated financial
statements approximate their fair values.

employer’s contribution. During the year, contributions paid and payable by the subsidiaries pursuant to this arrangement were insignificant to the Group.
The Group’s overseas subsidiaries pay fixed contribution as pensions under the laws and regulations of the relevant countries.

I.
SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED UNDER INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS (“IFRS) AND THOSE UNDER THE PRC ACCOUNTING RULES AND REGULATIONS (“PRC GAAP”)
The Group has also prepared a set of consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant accounting principles and regulations applicable to PRC
enterprises.
The consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS and those prepared under PRC GAAP have the following major differences:
(1)
Future development fund and safety work expense
(1a)
Appropriation of future development fund is charged to income before income taxes under PRC GAAP. Depreciation is not provided
for plant and equipment acquired by utilizing the future development fund under PRC GAAP but charge to expenses when
acquired;
(1b)
Appropriation of the work safety cost is charged to income before taxes under PRC GAAP. Depreciation is not provided for plant
and equipment acquired by utilizing the provision of work safety cost under PRC GAAP but charge to expenses when acquired.
(2)
Consolidation using purchase method under IFRS and using common control method under PRC GAAP
Under IFRS, the acquisitions of Jining II, Railway Assets, Heze, Shanxi Group, Hua Ju Energy, Yangcun Coal Mine and Beisu Coal Mine have been
accounted for using the acquisition method which accounts for the assets and liabilities of the aforesaid acquisitions at their fair value at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill.
Under PRC GAAP, as the Group and the aforesaid acquisitions are entities under the common control of the Parent Company, the assets and liabilities of
the aforesaid acquisitions are required to be included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group at historical cost. The difference between the historical
cost of the assets and liabilities of the aforesaid acquisitions and the purchase price paid is recorded as an adjustment to shareholders’ equity.
(3)
Deferred taxation due to differences between the financial statements prepared under IFRS and PRC GAAP.

Business combinations under common control: Assets and liabilities that are obtained by the acquirer in a business combination
are measured at their carrying amounts at the combination date as recorded by the acquiree. The difference between the carrying
amount of the net assets obtained and the carrying amount of the consideration paid for the combination is adjustment to capital
reserve. If the capital reserve is not sufficient to compensate the difference, any excess shall be adjusted against retained earnings.
Business combinations not under common control: The cost of combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition
date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity securities issued by the acquirer for purpose to gain substantive
control of acquiree. Where the cost of a business combination exceeds the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference shall be recognized as goodwill. Where the cost of
combination is less than the acquiree’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identified assets, liabilities and contingent

Preparation methods for consolidated financial statements
(1)
(2)
The consolidated scope recognition principles: the Group takes the subsidiaries owning the actual controlling power and the
special purpose vehicle into the scope of the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting methods introduced in the consolidated financial statements: The consolidated financial statements are prepared
pursuant to Enterprises accounting criteria No.33 – consolidated financial statements and relevant provisions. All material
intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses in the consolidation scope are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealized
loss from intercompany transactions shall, if there is evidence that the loss is part of the impairment loss of relevant assets, be
recognized in full. Shareholder’s equity which doesn’t belong to the parent company is identified separately as minority interest on
consolidated financial statements.
If the losses to the minority shareholders exceed their shares in the subsidiary’s equity, in addition to the part that minority shareholders have an obligation to
bear according to the articles of association or agreement and the minority shareholders have the ability to bear, the remaining part shall offset the
shareholders’ equity attributable to the parent company. If the subsidiary subsequently reports profits, all profits are attributable to shareholders’ equity of the
parent company before compensating the losses to the minority shareholders which were borne by the shareholders’ equity of the parent company.
If any conflicts between the accounting policies or the accounting period introduced in the subsidiaries and those of the Company, the necessary adjustment
shall be made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries according to the accounting policies or the accounting period used in the Company during the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
For those subsidiaries acquired not under common control, some few financial statements are adjusted based on the fair values of the identifiable net assets
on the acquisition date in preparing consolidated financial statements. For those subsidiaries acquired under common control, which are considered to be
existed at the opening of the consolidation period, the assets, liabilities, the operating results and cash flows from the opening of the consolidation period are
presented in the consolidated financial statement according to the original carrying amounts.
8.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash in cash flow are cash on hand and deposits available for payment at any time. Cash equivalents in cash flow are investments which are short-term
(normally become due within 3 months after purchasing date), highly liquid, readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and subject to an insignificant risk
of changes in value.

Foreign currency and the translation of financial statements denominated in foreign currency
(1)
Foreign currency transaction
Foreign currency transactions are converted to the functional currency at the spot exchange rate of the day when the transaction occurs. At the balance sheet
date, foreign currency monetary items are translated to the functional currency using the spot exchange rate of the day. Exchange differences arising are
recognized in profit or loss for the current period, except for the exchange differences arising on the borrowing costs eligible for acquisition, construction or
production of assets which are qualified for capitalization. Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange
rates at the date when the recognized fair value is determined. The differences between the amount of the functional currency before and after conversion
are recognized in profit or loss or interests of shareholders as changes of fair value. Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are
translated at the spot exchange rates at the date of the transactions, and do not change the functional currency amount.
(2)
Translation of financial statements denominated in foreign currency
The asset and liability items on the balance sheet of foreign currency are converted to RMB at the spot exchange rate of the balance sheet date; other items
are converted at the sport exchange rate of the day when the transaction occurs, except retained earnings on shareholders’ equity. The revenue and
expense items on the income statement of overseas subsidiaries are converted to RMB at the approximate rate (average rate of the year) of the spot
exchange rate of the day when the transaction occurs. Exchange differences arising from the above issues are presented separately under the shareholders’
equity items. When overseas operating units are disposed, then the relevant exchange differences will be transferred from shareholders’ equity to current
disposal income or expense.
For the net investment items, measured at foreign currencies and applied parent or subsidiaries’ reporting currencies, on subsidiaries, exchange difference
results from those items should be recognized as “Difference on foreign currency translation”. For exchange difference results from investment items that are
measured at the currencies other than the one parent or subsidiaries adopting, exchange differences should be offset, and the remaining should be
recognized as “Difference on foreign currency translation”.

Financial Instruments
(1)
Financial assets
1)
Financial assets by category
Upon initial recognition, financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at ‘fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-
maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘receivables’.
A.
Financial assets at FVTPL
A financial asset is held for trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term and presented as the tradable financial assets
in the balance sheet. Except for the purpose of hedging, derivative financial instruments are classified into financial assets or liabilities at FVTPL.
B.
Held-to-maturity investment
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity date that the enterprise has the clear
intention and ability to hold to maturity.
C.
Receivables
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments are not quoted in an active market.
D.
AFS financial assets
AFS financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified as (1) financial assets at FVTPL,
(2) receivables, or (3) held-to-maturity investments.
2)
Recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognized in fair value in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a part of the contractual provisions of the instrument. Transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or
loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized directly in profit or loss. Financial assets are no longer recognised when the
rights to receive cash flows from the assets expire or, the financial assets are transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership of the financial assets.
Financial assets and AFS financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value. The receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried
at the amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.

2)
Recognition and measurement – continued
Changes in fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are included in profit or loss for the period at fair value. The received interest during the period holding
assets shall be recognized as investment income. On disposing of it, the difference between fair value and initial accounting value shall be recognized as in
profit or loss statements on investment, and the profit or loss at the fair value is also adjusted accordingly.
Other than impairment loss and exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency monetary financial assets, the changes in fair value of AFS
financial assets are recorded in the shareholder’s equity. When the financial assets are derecognized, the calculated amount of changes in fair value of AFS
financial assets should be recorded into current profits or losses. The interest of AFS liability instruments calculated by actual interest rate during the holding
period and the cash dividends declared and issued by the investee on available-for-sale equity instruments should be included in current profit or loss as
investment income.
3)
Impairment of financial assets
The Company estimates the carrying amount of a financial asset at the balance sheet date (other than those at FVTPL). If there is objective evidence that the
financial asset is impaired, the Company shall determine to accrue the amount of any impairment loss.
When the financial assets carried at amortized cost impaired, they should be accrued impairment provisions at the amount of the difference that the estimated
future cash flow (exclusive not yet occurred credit loss) lower than the present value. If the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss should be reversed through
current profit and loss.
If the fair value of an AFS financial asset declines substantially or non-temporarily, the accumulated loss arising from this decline that had been recognized
directly in shareholders’ equity shall be recognized in the profit or loss statement. For the AFS liability instrument investment which has been recognized
impairment loss, if the fair value increases in the subsequent period and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment
loss was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss should be reversed through current profit and loss. For the AFS equity instrument
investment which has been recognized impairment loss, the fair value increase in the subsequent period should be directly included in shareholders’ equity.

Transfer of financial asset
Financial assets should be derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the assets expired; or (2) the financial assets have been transferred
and the Group has substantially transferred all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets; (3) the financial assets have been transferred, the Group has
neither transferred nor keep almost all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets but gave up the control of the financial assets.
If the enterprise neither transferred all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets nor gave up the control of the financial assets, the related financial
assets should be recognized based on the degree of involvement into the transferred financial assets by the enterprise, the related liabilities should be
recognized as well. The degree of involvement into the transferred financial assets means the risk level faced by the enterprise, which was caused by the
value change of such financial assets.
If the holistic transfer of financial assets meets the conditions of derecognition, the difference between the carrying value of transferred financial assets and
the sum of consideration from the transfer and the accumulated amount of fair value change originally included in other comprehensive income should be
included into the current loss and profit.
If the partial transfer of financial assets meets the conditions of derecognition, the entire carrying value of transferred financial assets should be apportioned
between the portion whose recognition has been stopped and the portion whose recognition has not been stopped according to the respective fair value.
The difference between the sum of consideration from the transfer and the accumulated amount of fair value change of the derecognized portion which has
been originally included in other comprehensive income and the carrying value of the derecognized portion before apportionment should be included into the
current loss and profit.

Financial liabilities
Upon initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL) or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities at
FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value as well as dividends and interest income related to
such financial liabilities recognized in profit or loss for the period.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
When the present obligation of financial liability entirely or partly discharged, the whole financial liability or the part of the financial liability of which present
obligation has been partly discharged should be derecognized. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the
consideration paid shall be included in current profit and loss.
(3)
Equity instruments
Equity instrument refers to the contract that can prove the residual equity in the assets of an enterprise after deducting all liabilities. Meanwhile, satisfying the
following conditions, the Group classifies the issued financial instruments as equity instruments:
1)
2)
The financial instruments do not include the contractual obligations of delivery of cash or other financial assets to the other
party, or exchanges of financial assets or financial liabilities with other party under the potential adverse conditions.
As the financial instruments must or may be settled through the enterprise’s own equity instruments in future, if the financial
instrument is underivative, the contractual obligation of delivery of own equity instrument with variable amount for settlement
shall not be included; if the financial instrument is derivative, the settlement of the enterprise’s financial instruments shall be
implemented only through the conversion from fix amount of own equity instruments to fix amount cash or other financial
assets.
The Group calculates issued equity instruments on the basis of received amount after deduction of the direct issuing cost.

Method of fair values recognition of financial instruments
Fair value, it is to point to the amount that the market participants can receive after selling assets or the amount that the market participants need to pay after
a liability transfer in the orderly trading of a metrology day, whether the amount can be observed directly or it’s fair value can be evaluated through evaluation
technologies. The evaluation technologies include reference to the prices used by voluntary transaction parties who are familiar with the situation in recent
market transactions, reference to the current fair value of other financial instruments that are essentially the same, confirmation of general pricing model
based on discounted cash flow method or observable confirmation of current market prices, etc.
For the purpose of financial reporting, the observability of the fair value measurement based on the fair value inputs and the significance of the inputs for the
fair value as a whole are classified as the tiers of fair value such as first, second or third tier, specific as follows:
The inputs of the first tier refer to the quotation of the same assets or liabilities can be obtained in the metrology day. This quotation has not been adjusted in
the active markets;
The inputs of the second tier refer to direct or indirect observable inputs of assets or liabilities except for quotation contained in the inputs of the first tier;
The inputs of the third tier refer to unobservable inputs of assets or liabilities.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts of the Company and its overseas subsidiary Yancoal Australia Limited and the belonging subsidiaries
(the “Australian subsidiaries”) are subject to the discounted cash flow between the contracted exchange rate and present value of forward exchange rate.
Fair values of interest swap contracts are subject to the discounted cash flow between the floating interest rate and the fixed interest rate.
11.
Accounting method for bad debt provisions of the receivables
The following situations are considered as criterion of recognizing bad debt as loss of receivables: revocation, bankruptcy, insolvency, seriously shortage of
cash flows, out of business caused by serious natural disaster and unable to pay off the debt within the foreseeable time of the debtors, other solid evidence
indicating that debt can’t be recovered or be of a slim chance.
The allowance method is applied to the possible loss of bad debt, the impairment shall be assessed separately or in combination, the Company shall be
determined to accrue the bad debt provisions which shall be calculated into the current profits and losses. If there is defined evidence for the receivables not
to or not likely to be received, which shall be classified into the loss of bad debt and write off the accrued bad debts provisions after going through the
approval procedure of the Company.

The classification of inventories: The inventories include the raw materials, coal stock, methanol, real estate stock, real estate
development cost, and low value consumables etc.
(2)
(3)
(4)
The pricing method of receiving and issuing inventories: The Company adopts a perpetual inventory system to calculate its
inventory, using the actual cost pricing for procurement and inventories, and weighted average approach for consumptions and
delivery of inventories. Real estate development cost includes the actual cost of land, building, facilities, out sourced construction,
and public facilities. Developing real estate is recognized as real estate stock at actual cost when completion acceptance is
available.
The end-of-period inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. If the inventories are damaged, become
partially or completely obsolete or sold at price lower than the cost, unrecoverable cost shall be estimated and recognized as a
provision for decline in value. The excess of cost over the net realizable value is generally recognized as provision for impairment of
inventories on a separate inventory item.
Net realizable value of inventories directly for sale, such as coal, methanol, real estate, and materials for sale, is the estimated
selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale and other related taxes; Net realisable value of material stocks for
product is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs, the estimated marketing cost and other related taxes of the finished
production occurred.
13.
Long-term equity investments
Long-term equity investments mainly include equity investments held by the Group which exercise control, joint control or significant influence on the
investee.
Joint control means mutual control over certain economic activities under contract. The main basis to define joint control is that any party of the joint venture
cannot control the production and business operations of the venture individually, and the decisions involving the basic production and business operations
need the unanimous consent from all parties.
Significant influence means that the investor has the right to participate decision-making for the finance and operating policies of investee and has no control
or joint control with other parties on policies-making. The main basis to define significant influence is that the Group holds directly or indirectly through
subsidiaries above 20% (included) but less than 50% voting shares of investee. Significant influence cannot be recognized if there is solid evidence
indicating that the investor cannot participate in the decision-making of investee.

Long-term equity investments – continued
For a business combination involving enterprise under common control, the initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment is the carrying amount
of the owner’s equity of the party being absorbed at the combination date. For a business combination not involving enterprises under common control, the
initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment merged (acquired) is the aggregate of the fair value, at the merging (acquisition) date, of the merger
(acquire)’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Besides the above long-term equity investment acquired through business combination, long-term equity investment acquired by cash payment, the initial
investment cost shall be the actual purchase price that has been paid. Initial investment cost also includes those costs, taxes and other necessary
expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the long-term equity investment. For a long-term equity investment acquired by issuance of equity
securities, the initial investment cost shall be the fair value of the securities issued. For a long-term equity investment invested by investors, the initial
investment cost use the values described in investment contract or agreement. For a long-term equity investment acquired by debts re-organization or non-
currency assets transaction, the initial investment cost shall be recognized in accordance with relevant accounting standards.
The cost method is applied in calculating the subsidiaries’ investment, while the equity method is used in adjusting the consolidated financial statements.
The equity method is applied for the accounting of investment in joint ventures and associated enterprises. If the accounting policies of the joint ventures and
associated enterprises do not consistent, the Group’s profit and loss shall be determined on the bases of the necessary adjustments of the financial
statements of the joint ventures and associated enterprises in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies and accounting periods.
Under the cost method, long-term equity investments are measured at initial investment cost, and the investment cost shall be adjusted when the investments
are added and recovered. Under the equity method, the current investment profit and loss are the net profits and losses created by the investee and shared
by the Company. The share of net profits or losses from the investee should be confirmed, based on the fair values of identifiable assets on the acquisition
date, according to the accounting policies and accounting period of the Group, offsetting inter-segment transactions profit and loss created by joint venture
and associated enterprises which belong to the investor in terms of shares proportion, and after adjusting the net profit from investee.

Fixed assets
(1)
(2)
(3)
Recognition of fixed assets: Fixed assets are tangible assets that are held for production or operation, and have a service life more
than one accounting year.
Category of fixed assets: Buildings, coal mine buildings, ground buildings, harbour works and craft, plant, machinery and
equipment, transportation equipment, and land etc.
Measurement of fixed assets: The fixed assets shall be initially measured at actual cost of acquisition considering the effect of any
expected costs of disposing the asset. Among these, the costs of outsourcing fixed assets include duties and expenses such as
purchasing cost, VAT, import tariff, other expenses incurred to ensure estimated usage of the fixed assets that can be directly
included in the assets. The costs to build the fixed assets include necessary expenses incurred to ensure the usage status of the
assets. The accounting value of the fixed assets invested by the investors shall be accordance with the values specified in the
investment contract or agreement, while for not fair value specified in the contract or agreement, shall be regarded as fair value in
accounting value. Fixed assets by financial lease are recognized at the lower of fair value of such assets at leasing date and the
present value of minimum lease payment.
(4)
Subsequent expenditure of fixed assets: the subsequent expenditure includes expenses for repair, renovation and improvement,
which shall be capitalized provided that the expenditures confirm to the conditions of fixed assets recognition. With regard to the
replaced parts, the carrying value shall not be recognized and other subsequent costs incurred shall be recognized in the gain and
loss in the period.

The Company shall review the useful life and estimated net residual value of a fixed asset and the depreciation method applied at
least at each financial year-end. A change in the useful life or estimated net residual value of a fixed asset or depreciation method
used shall be treated as a change in an accounting estimate.
Fixed assets that cannot bring economic returns after treatment or are not expected to bring economic returns after use or treatment
shall be no longer recognized. When a fixed asset is sold, transferred, scraped or damaged, the enterprise shall recognize the
amount of any proceeds on disposal of the asset net of the carrying value and related taxes in profit or loss for the current period.

Construction in progress
(1)
The pricing approach of the fixed assets under construction: To be measured at the actual costs incurred for the construction. The
self-operated construction is recorded at all cost of direct materials, direct salary, and direct construction expenditures etc. And the
contracting construction is recorded at the payable construction cost and so on. The equipment installation cost is measured at
value of the installed equipment, installation cost, all expenses incurred for project test-run. The cost of fixed assets under
construction includes capitalized borrowing costs, gain and loss from currency exchange.
(2)
Standard and time of transfer from the construction in progress to the fixed assets: the construction in progress shall be transferred
to the fixed assets from the date of starting its estimated usable condition based on their construction budget, construction pricing or
project actual cost and so on, and its depreciation will begin from the next month. The difference of the fixed assets original values
shall be adjusted upon the resolution procedures of the project completion.
17.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include loan interests, amortization of premiums or discounts, auxiliary expenses and exchange differences arising on foreign currency
borrowing. When expenditures for the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred, activities relating to the acquisition, construction or production of the
asset that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale have commenced, borrowing costs, which are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset, shall be capitalized. Capitalization of borrowing costs shall be discontinued when acquired and constructed
production is available for use or sale. Other borrowing costs shall be recognized as expenses for the current period.
The amount of interest of specific borrowings occurred for the period shall be capitalized after deducting bank interest earned from depositing the unused
borrowings or any investment income on the temporary investment. The capitalized amount of general borrowings shall to be determined at the basis that the
weighted average (of the excess amounts of cumulative assets expenditures above the specific borrowings) times capitalization rate (of used general
borrowings). The capitalization rate shall be determined according to the weighted average interest rates of general borrowings.
Assets eligible for capitalization represent the fixed assets, investment properties, inventories, etc., which shall take a long time (generally over one year) for
acquisition, construction or production to be ready for the specific use or sale.
If an asset eligible for capitalization is interrupted abnormally and continuously more than 3 months during the purchase, construction or production,
capitalization of borrowing costs shall be suspended until the above interrupted activities restart.

Intangible assets
The pricing method of intangible assets: The intangible assets of the Group include mainly mining rights, unproved mining interests, the land use rights,
patents and know-how etc. For purchased intangible assets, actual paid cost and other relevant expenses are used as the actual cost. For intangible assets
invested by investors, the actual cost is determined according to the values specified in the investment contract or agreement, while for the unfair agreed
value in contract or agreement, the actual cost is determined at the fair value. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized
separately from goodwill are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
(1)
(2)
Mining rights. Coal reserves are amortized over the life of the mine on a unit of production basis of the estimated total proven and
probable reserves or the Australia Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) reserves for the Groups subsidiaries in Australia.
Unproved mining interests. Unproved mining interests represent the fair value of economically recoverable reserves (excluding
the portion of total proven and probable reserves of coal mines of a mining right i.e. does not include the above coal reserves) of
coal mines of a mining right (Details are set out in the accounting policy of exploration and evaluation expenditure).
(3)
Land use rights. The land use rights are evenly amortized over the transferred term since the rights are obtained.
(4)
Patented technologies, non-patented technologies and other intangible assets. The patented technologies, non-patented
technologies and other intangible assets with limited life shall be amortized under the shortest among expected useful life,
beneficial life agreed by contracts, and legally required useful life in composite life method. The patented technologies, non-
patented technologies and other intangible assets with unsure life shall not be amortized and are tested for impairment at the end of
each period.
For an intangible asset with a finite useful life, the Company shall review the useful life and the amortization method applied at each financial year-end. A
change in the useful life or amortization method used shall be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate. For an intangible asset with an indefinite
useful life, the Company shall reassess the useful life of the asset in each accounting period. If there is evidence indicating that the useful life of that
intangible asset is finite, the Company shall estimate the useful life of that asset and apply the accounting requirements of the Standard accordingly.

Exploration and evaluation expenditures
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each separately identifiable area of interest which is at individual mine level.
These costs are only capitalized or temporarily capitalized where the mining rights for the area of interest is current and to the extent that they are expected to
be recouped through successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the area, or where activities in the area have not yet
reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in
relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing of capitalization forward costs in relation to that area of
interest. Accumulated expenditure in relation to an abandoned area are written-off in full in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made. The
carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets is assessed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the assets may
exceed their recoverable amount.
When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortized over the life of the area according to the rate of depletion
of the economically recoverable reserves.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure acquired in a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (the fair value of
potential economically recoverable reserves at the acquisition date which is shown as “unproved mineral interests”).
According to the assets character, capitalized exploration and evaluation expenditure considered to be fixed assets (Note II.15), construction in progress
(Note II. 16) or intangible assets (Note II.18).

Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that the long-term equity investments measured by equity method,
investment property, fixed assets, and construction in progress and intangible assets with finite useful life may be impaired. If there is objective evidence that
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset
which can be reliably estimated, a financial asset is impaired. Goodwill arising in a business combination and an intangible asset with an indefinite useful
life shall be tested for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment
assessment, goodwill shall be considered together with the related asset groups or sets of asset group allocated with goodwill should be assessed for
impairment at each financial year-end.
If the recoverable amount of the asset groups or set of asset groups is less than the book value, the difference will be recognized as impairment loss and
once an impairment loss is recognized, it shall not be reversed in a subsequent period. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value cost
of disposal and the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset costs of disposal.
The signs of impairment are as follows:
(1)
(2)
(3)
The current market price of an asset substantially declines, exceeding obviously the expected decline caused by time changes or
normal application.
The current or future significant changes in the economic, technical or legal environment of the enterprise and in the market of an
asset shall have adverse impacts on the enterprise.
The improved market rate or other return on investment in the period shall have an effect on the discount rate used by enterprise to
calculate estimated cash flow present value, leading to substantial decline in recoverable amount of assets.
(4)
There is evidence to demonstrate that the assets have already gone absolute or its entity has already been damaged.
(5)
The assets have already been or will be left unused, or will stop using, or are under the plan to be disposed in advance.
(6)
The evidences of internal reports demonstrate that economic returns of assets have already been lower or will be lower than
expectations, for example, net cash flow created by assets or operating profit (or loss) realized by assets are much lower (or higher)
than expected amounts.
(7)
Other signs to indicate that assets value have already been impaired.

Goodwill
Goodwill is the difference between equity investment cost or consideration and fair value of net identifiable assets of investees or acquires on acquisition
date or purchase date.
Goodwill related to subsidiaries shall be presented alone in consolidated financial statements, to joint ventures or associated companies shall be included in
the book value of long-term equity investment.
22.
Long-term deferred expenses
The Group’s long-term deferred expenses means mining rights compensations, but which should be undertaken in more than 1 year of amortization period
(not including 1 year) of the current and future periods, the expenses shall be amortized averagely in the benefit period. If the project of long-term deferred
expenses cannot make benefit in the future accounting periods, the unamortized value of the project will be transferred to the profits or losses for the period.
23.
Employee benefits
In the accounting period in which an employee has rendered service to the company, the company shall recognize the employee benefits payable for that
service as a liability, and recorded into related assets or current profit or loss in accordance with the objects that benefited from the service rendered by
employees. Any compensation liability arising from the termination of employment relationship with employees should be charged to the profit or loss for the
current period.
Mainly include salary, bonus, allowance and subsidy, employee welfare expenses, social insurance cost, public accumulation fund for housing construction,
labour union expenditures, employee education funds, annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and other expenses associated with service rendered by
employees which is provided for when it is probable that settlement will be required and it is capable of being measured reliably.
When the Group terminates the employment relationship with employees before the employment contracts have expired, or provides compensation as an
offer to encourage employees to accept voluntary redundancy, a provision for the termination benefits provided, is recognised in profit or loss when both of
the following conditions have been satisfied: the Group has a formal plan for the termination of employment or has made an offer to employees or voluntary
redundancy, which will be implemented shortly; the Group is not allowed to withdraw from termination plan or redundancy offer unilaterally.

Estimated liability
(1)
The recognition principles of the estimated liability: the Company recognizes it as a provision when an obligation related to an
contingency such as reclamation, disposal and environment restoring caused by mining, external guarantee, pending litigation or
arbitration, product quality warranty, downsizing scheme, loss contract, restructuring obligation and so on satisfy all of the following
conditions:
1)
2)
The obligation is a present obligation of the Company;
It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits from the Company will be required to settle the obligation;
3)
The amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
(2)
The measurement approaches of the estimated liability: the estimated liability is primarily measured according to the estimated
optimal value paid to implement the relevant present obligations considering the factors such as the risks, uncertainties and
currency time values related to the contingencies. If the currency time value has major effects, the estimated optimal value is
determined after the discounting of the relevant future cash flow. If any change happens to the estimated optimal value during
reviewing the carrying amount of the estimated liabilities on the balance sheet date, the adjustment will be made to the carrying
amount to reflect the current estimated optimal value.
25.
Overburden in advance
Overburden in advance of open cut coal mine comprises the accumulation of expenditures incurred to enable access to the coal seams, and includes direct
removal costs and machinery and plant running costs. The overburden in advance which can improve future mining capacity and meet special standards will
be recognized as current assets (striping assets). The rest of overburden in advance will be accounted to the current operating cost and be transferred to
inventory.
The overburden in advance which can improve future mining capacity and be recognized as current assets must meet all the following conditions:
(1)
Associated economic benefits are likely to flow into the enterprise.
(2)
Enterprise can identify ore body constituent parts of which future mining capacity have been improved.
(3)
Overburden in advance for the constituent part of ore body can be reliably measured.
Striping assets should be recognized as the part of its related mineral assets.
Striping assets are classified into tangible assets and intangible assets based on the nature present assets comprised by the related stripping assets. If
striping assets and inventory can not be independently identified, overburden in advance should be distributed in striping assets and inventory according to
corresponding production standards.
Striping assets will be depreciated in the remained service life of related identified ore body parts.

Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
The mining activities of the Group may cause land subsidence of the underground mining sites. Usually, the Group may relocate inhabitants from the land
above the underground mining sites prior to mining those sites and compensate the inhabitants for losses or damages from land subsidence. Depending on
the experience, the management estimate and accrue an amount of payments for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental protection of the land, which
may arise in the future after the underground sites have been mined.
In consideration of the time difference between the payments of the fees for relocation, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental protection of the land and
the mining of underground mines, the Group charges the prepayment of such fees regarding to future mining as a current asset. Caused by the paid amount
less than the accrued amount, the fees regarding to future payment for relocation, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental protection of the land are
accounted for as a current liability.

The Principles of Revenue recognition
(1)
Principles: The business revenues are generated mainly from sales of goods, rendering of services and alienating the right
to use assets. The principles of revenue recognition are as follows:
1)
Revenue from sales of goods
Revenue is recognized when the Company has transferred to the buyer the main risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, neither retains continuing
management usually associated with ownership nor effectively controls over the goods sold, and the amount of revenue can reliably measured, the
associated economic benefits are likely to flow into the enterprise, and the related to costs incurred can be reliably measured.
2)
Revenue from rendering of services
When the provision of services is started and completed within the same accounting year, revenue is recognized at the time of completion of the services.
When the provision of services is started and completed in different accounting years and the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services
can be estimated reliably, revenue is recognized at the balance sheet date by the use of the percentage of completion method.
3)
Revenue from alienating the right to use assets
The revenue is recognized when the Company has received the economic benefits associated with the transaction, and can reliably measure the relevant
amount of revenue.
(2)
Policies
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
The Company has transferred to the buyer the main risks and rewards of ownership of the coal, methanol, heat, auxiliary
materials and other sales revenue. The Company neither retains continuing management usually associated with
ownership, nor effectively controls over the goods sold.
Electricity sales revenue is recognized when transmitting power to power companies. The revenue is measured by the
amount of power and the appropriate electricity price settled by related power companies.
The Group recognizes revenue from the sales of products in development when: 1. Development is completed and qualified
for acceptance; 2. Legal force is binded by sales contract signed; primary risk on ownership and compensation of the
product are transferred to buyers; 3. The Group maintains no management or control on the products that are already sold.
Revenue of railway and air transportation and other services are recognized when the services are completed.
Interest revenue is measured by the period of cash borrowings and the actual interest rates.

Government grants
Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the Group is able to comply with the conditions
attaching to them. Government grants in the form of monetary assets are recorded based on as the amount received, whereas quota subsidies are measured
as the amount receivable. Government grants in the form of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value or nominal amount (RMB1) if the fair value
cannot be reliably obtained.
Government grants received in relation to assets are recorded as deferred income, and allocated in the income statement over the assets’ useful lives.
Government grants received in relation to revenue are recorded as deferred income, and recognised as income in future periods as compensation when the
associated future expenses or losses arise; or directly recognised as income in the current period as compensation for past expenses or losses.
30.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences arising from the difference between the carrying amount of an asset or
liability and its tax base (temporary differences). For any deductible loss or tax deduction that can be deducted the amount of the taxable income the next
year according to the taxation regulations, the corresponding deferred income tax asset shall be determined considering the temporary difference. On the
balance sheet date, the deferred income assets and deferred income tax liabilities shall be measured at the tax rate applicable to the period during which the
assets are expected to be recovered or the liabilities are expected to be settled.
An enterprise shall recognize the deferred income tax liability arising from a deductible temporary difference to the extent of the amount of the taxable income
which it is most likely to obtain and which can be deducted from the deductible temporary difference. For the recognized deferred income tax asset, if it is
unlikely to obtain sufficient taxable income to offset against the benefit of the deferred income tax asset, the carrying amount of the deferred income tax
assets shall be written down. Any such write-down should be subsequently reversed where it becomes probable that sufficient taxable income will be
available.
31.
Leases
The Company classifies the leases into financing lease and operating lease on the lease beginning date.
Financing lease is a lease that substantially transfers all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an assets. On the lease beginning date, as the
leaseholder, the Company recognizes the lower of fair value of lease assets and the present value of minimum lease payment as financial leased fixed
assets; recognizes the minimum lease payment as long-term payable, and recognizes the difference between the above two as unverified financing costs.
Operating lease is the other lease except finance lease. As the leaseholder, the Company records lease payments into the related assets cost or the profit or
loss for the period on a straight-line basis over the lease term and; records lease income into revenue in the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.

Accounting calculation of the income tax
The accounting calculation of the income tax adopts the balance sheet liabilities approach. The income taxes include the current and deferred income tax.
The current income tax and deferred income tax expenses and earnings are recorded into the current profit and loss, except those related to the transactions
and events are recorded directly into the shareholder’s equity and the deferred income tax is adjusted into the carrying amount of goodwill arising from the
business combination.
The current income tax expense is the income tax payable, that is, the amount of the current transactions and events calculated according to the taxation
regulations paid to the taxation authorities by the enterprises. The deferred income tax is the difference between the due amounts of the deferred income tax
assets and liabilities to be recognized according to the balance sheet liabilities approach in the period end and the amount recognized originally.
33.
Mineral Resources Rent Tax
Mineral Resources Rent Tax (MRRT) is levied by Australian government for all Australian mineral enterprises on the base of net mining profit after
deductible items, therefore the recognition, measurement and disclosure of relevant expenses, deferred assets and liabilities of MRRT are consistent with
income tax, refer to Note II. 30 and II. 32 for details.
34.
Segment reporting
Reportable segments are identified based on operating segments which are determined based on the structure of the Group’s internal organization,
management requirements and internal reporting system. An operating segment is a component of the Group that meets the following respective conditions:
(1)
Engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses;
(2)
Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s management to make decisions about resource to be allocated to
the segment and assess its performance; and
(3)
For which financial information regarding financial position, results of operations and cash flows are available.

Operation Method of Hedges Business
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps contracts to hedge cash flow for foreign
exchange risks and fluctuation in interest rate.
The relationship between hedging instrument and hedged item is recorded by the Group on hedging transaction date, including the target of risk
management and various hedging transaction strategies. The Group will regularly assess whether the derivatives can continuously and effectively hedge
cash flows of the hedged item during the period of hedging transactions. The Group uses the comparative method of the principle terms of the contract for
prospective evaluations on the effectiveness of hedging, and uses ratio analysis method to do the retrospective evaluation on the effectiveness of hedging at
the end of the reporting period.
Net amounts receivable or payable of hedging transactions is recorded into the balance sheet as assets or liabilities from hedging transaction date. The
unrealized gain or loss shall be recorded into hedging reserve under equity. The change of fair values of forward foreign currency contract or interest swap
contract shall be recognized through hedging reserve until the expected transactions occur. Accumulated balance in equity shall be included in the income
statement or be recognized as part of the cost in relation of its assets once the expected transactions occur.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge accounting
shall not be applicable. Accumulated gain or loss of hedging instruments is recorded in the equity and recognized when transaction occurs. In the event that

Significant accounting policies and accounting estimates
When use the above mentioned accounting policies and accounting estimate, because of the uncertainty of operation, the Group needs to apply the
judgments, estimates and assumptions to book value of inaccurate measured items, which was made on the basis of experiences of the management and
consideration of other related factors. However, the actual conditions are possibly different from the estimates.
The Group makes regulatory check on above mentioned judgments, estimates and assumptions. The Company confirms the influences of the accounting
modifications in the current and future of the modification time, dependently.

STATEMENTS – CONTINUED

Significant accounting policies and accounting estimates – continued
On balance sheet date, the key assumptions and the uncertainties leading to the possible major adjustments for the carrying amounts of the assets, liabilities
in the future are as follows:
(1)
Depreciation and amortization
Fixed assets and intangible assets are depreciated and amortized on the straight-line or production basis over their useful lives. The Group shall regularly
review the useful lives and economically recoverable coal reserves to determine the total amount of depreciation and amortization which will be included in
each period. Useful lives are calculated on the basis of the experience from similar assets and expected change of technology. Economically recoverable
coal reserves are calculated by the economically recoverable coal resources based on actual measurement. If the past estimates change significantly, the
depreciation and amortization shall be adjusted during future periods.
Estimates of coal reserves are involved in subjective judgment, because the estimating technology is inaccurate, so the coal reserves are only approximate
value. The recent production and technology documents shall be considered for the estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves which will be
updated regularly, the inherent inaccuracy of technical estimating exists.
(2)
Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental obligations
The Company needs to relocate the villages on the surface due to the underground coal mining, and bear the cost of relocation of villages, ground crops (or
attachments) compensation, land rehabilitation, restructuring and environmental management and other obligations. The performance of obligation is likely
to lead to outflow of resources, when the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably, it is recognized as an environmental reclamation obligations.
Depending on the relevance with the future production activities and the reliability of the estimated determination, the flow and non-flow reclamation
provision should be recognized as the profit and loss for the period or credited to the relevant assets.
After taking into account existing laws and regulations and according to the past experience and the best estimate of future expenditures, management
determines Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental obligations. If the time value of money is material, the expected future cash
outflows will be discounted to its net present value. Following the current coal mining activities and under the condition that the future impact on land and the
environment has become evident, Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs may be amended from time to time. Discount rate
used by the Group may change due to assessment on the time value of money market and debt specific risks, when the estimate of the expected costs
changed, it will be adjusted accordingly by the appropriate discount rate.
(3)
Impairment of non-financial long-term assets
As described in Note II (20), at the date of the balance sheet the Group assesses impairment of non-financial assets to determine whether the recoverable
amount of assets fell less than its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the difference is recognized as impairment
loss.

Significant accounting policies and accounting estimates – continued
(3)
Impairment of non-financial long-term assets – continued
The recoverable amount is the higher between the net amounts of fair value of the assets (or assets group) less disposal costs and the estimated present
value of future cash flow of the assets (or assets group). As the Group cannot reliably access the open market price of the assets (or asset group), it is not
reliable and accurate to estimate the fair value of assets. When estimating the present value of future cash flows, the company needs to make significant
judgments on the future useful life, the product yield, price, the related operating costs of the assets (or assets group) and the discount rate used for
calculating the present value. When estimating the recoverable amount, the Group will use all possibly available information, including the product yield,
price from the reasonable and supportable assumption and the forecast related to operating costs.
(4)
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The
value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in
order to calculate the present value. Expectation has been determined based on past performance and management’s expectations for the market
development.
(5)
Tax
The Company has obligations to pay a variety of taxes in a number of countries and regions. There are uncertainties for final tax treatments of many
transactions and matters in normal operating activities. If there are differences between the ultimately ascertained results of these tax matters and the
amounts that were initially recorded then the differences will impact the tax balance in the period that the above ultimate assertion being made.
If the management expects probable future taxable profit, and it can be utilized as deductable temporary differences or tax losses, then deferred tax assets
will be recognized based on these deductible temporary differences or tax losses. When the expected amount is different from the original estimation, the
difference will affect the recognition of deferred tax assets in the period in which the estimation changes. If the management expects to not be able to
eliminate future taxable income, deferred tax assets are not recognized on temporary differences and tax losses.
From 1 July 2012, Australian government started the MRRT collection from the mining companies in Australia. Judgment is required for the Group’s
Australian subsidiaries to assess whether deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities arising from MRRT are recognized on the balance sheet. Deferred
tax assets are recognized only when it is considered probable that they will be recovered. Recoverability is dependent on the generation of sufficient future
taxable profits. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on managements estimates of future cash flows. These in turn depend on
estimates of future sales volumes, operating costs, capital expenditure and government royalty payable.

It is the right of Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd, a company jointly controlled by the Company and its subsidiary Gloucester, of collecting the mining
royalties (ie, 4% of its FOB profits) from Middlemount coal mine during the mining period. The management calculated this on every reporting
date based on its present value of the discounted cash flow; the change of profit or loss is recorded as the current profit or loss. As at June 30,
2014, AUD23.8 million of mining royalties receivable within one year is recognized as other current assets and AUD181.93 million of mining
royalties receivable over 1 year is recognized as other non-current asset.
To avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuation, Australian subsidiaries of the Company enter into forward foreign currency contracts to
hedge foreign currency risks caused by daily coal sales and big equipment purchasing program: to exchange USD into AUD on the agreed date
in the future at the agreed exchange rate range, or the spot rate. On the balance sheet date, derivative financial assets or liabilities reflect the fair
value of related outstanding contracts. The fair value will be calculated based on the difference between the forward market exchange rate taken
on the balance sheet date and on the contracts signing date.

Note: At the year end of 2012, the Group’s management assesses that the economic performance of Premier Holding, the subsidiary of the Group, would
be lower than estimation. Therefore, the impairment loss of goodwill is recognized as AUD2.72 million (equivalent to RMB15.8 million) after test of
impairment for assets was completed. The increase in the balance of goodwill and the provision for impairment of goodwill during the reporting
period was mainly due to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation.

Note: Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) is levied on the extraction of certain taxable resources of coal and iron ore in respect of a mining project
interest, and before any extensive processing and value-added activities. The tax rate of MRRT is 22.5%. MRRT legislation was passed by
Australian Senate on March 19, 2012 and started to be effective from 1 July 2012 in Australia. Pursuant to related laws of MRRT, Yancoal Australia
should determine starting to base of MRRT, which can be measured by either book value method or market value method and amortised in certain
period. In current reporting period the Group has recognised MRRT related deferred tax effects in compliance with related accounting standards.
The change in Australian governing party results in the uncertainty of MRRT’s future effectiveness. Therefore, the Company’s Australian office did not accrue
MRRT expenses and related deferred tax for current period.
