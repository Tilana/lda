Proxy.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shares of common stock
represented by properly executed proxies received at or prior to the Annual
Meeting that have not been revoked will be voted in accordance with the
instructions of the stockholder who has executed the proxy. If no choice is
specified in a proxy, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted FOR the

all of the other proposals set forth in the accompanying notice of meeting. The
shares represented by each proxy will also be voted for or against such other
matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting in the discretion of the
persons named in the proxy as proxy holders. We are not aware of any other
matters to be presented for action at the Annual Meeting other than those

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Board of Directors has fixed

determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual
Meeting. At the Record Date, there were [114,716,907] shares of our common stock
issued, outstanding, and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Holders of
common stock are entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting for each share of
common stock held of record at the Record Date. There are no separate voting
groups or separate series of stock. There is no cumulative voting in the
election of directors. The number of record holders of our common stock, $0.01

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be counted for

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broker non-votes occur when
shares held by a broker for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a
particular proposal because the broker has not received voting instructions from
the beneficial owner and the broker does not have discretionary authority to
vote such shares.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Votes Required</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Proposal One &#150; Election 
of
Directors: </U>Assuming a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast of our shares of
common stock is required for the election of our directors. Votes may be cast in
favor of the election of directors or withheld. A vote is withheld when a
properly executed proxy is marked WITHHOLD for the election of one or more
directors. Votes that are withheld and broker non-votes will be counted for the
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Votes that are
withheld will have the same effect as a vote against a director, but broker
non-votes will have no other effect on the election of directors. Further,
brokers may not cast discretionary &#147;uninstructed&#148; votes in any 
election of
directors.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Proposal Two &#150; Changes to
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended: </U>The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the close
of business on the record date is required for the approval of the amendment to
our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the authorized number
of shares of our common stock. Stockholders may vote in favor of or against this
proposal, or they may abstain. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted
for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, and will have
the same effect as a vote against this proposal.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Proposal Three &#150; 
Appointment
of Accountants: </U>The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our
common stock represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy is required
for the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public
accountants. Stockholders may vote in favor or against this proposal, or they
may abstain. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions constitute voting
power present and have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker
non-votes do not constitute voting power present and, therefore, have no effect
on the vote with respect to this proposal.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Proposal Four - Executive
Compensation</U>: The vote on the compensation of our named executive officers
(commonly known as a "say-on-pay" vote) is advisory, and therefore not binding
on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our common stock represented at
the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy is required for the non-binding
advisory vote on executive compensation. Stockholders may vote in favor or
against the proposal or they may abstain. Abstentions constitute voting power
present and will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker
non-votes do not constitute voting power present and, therefore, will have no
effect on the vote with respect to this proposal.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Proposal Five - Frequency of
Executive Compensation Votes</U>: The vote on how often the Company should
include a say-on-pay vote in its proxy materials for future annual meetings of
stockholders is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the
Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. Shareholders may vote to have
the say-on-pay vote every year, every two years or every three years. Broker
non-votes do not constitute voting power present and, therefore, will have no
effect on the vote with respect to this proposal. The option receiving the
greatest number of votes (every one, two or three years) will be considered the
frequency selected by stockholders.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Other Matters</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not expected that any
matters other than those referred to in this proxy statement will be brought
before the Annual Meeting. If other matters are properly presented, however, the
persons named as proxy appointees will vote in accordance with their best
judgment on such matters. The grant of a proxy also will confer discretionary
authority on the persons named as proxy appointees to vote in accordance with
their best judgment on matters incident to the conduct of the Annual
Meeting.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Solicitation of Proxies</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proxy solicitation is made

Further solicitation may be made by our directors, officers and employees
personally, by telephone, facsimile, e-mail, Internet or otherwise, but they
will not be specifically compensated for these services. Upon request, we will
reimburse brokers, dealers, banks or similar entities acting as nominees for
their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding copies of the proxy materials
to the beneficial owners of the shares of our common stock they hold as of the
Record Date. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with printing,
filing and mailing of this proxy statement.</P>

2013, are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the holder for the
purpose of computing the number of shares and percentage ownership of that
holder, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of any other person. </P>

      voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of
      shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or
      direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be
      beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share
      the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition,

      <P align=justify>On July 18, 2013, Mr. Hirsch made a loan of $89,580.48 to
      our Company for the purposes of: (a) application by the Company of
      $77,080.48 to payment in full of the outstanding principal amount and
      accrued interest to such date under those certain convertible promissory
      notes issued by the Company to Mr. Hirsch, as lender, on (i) December 29,

      2012, in the principal amount of $6,250 and
bearing interest at the rate of 15.0% per annum; and (b) general
      working capital purposes. The loan is evidenced by a convertible
      promissory note dated July 18 2013, bearing interest at 10% per annum, and
      maturing on July 17, 2014. The unpaid principal and accrued interest
      outstanding under the note is convertible at the option of Mr. Hirsch at

<P align=justify><B><I>Audit Committee</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Audit Committee is comprised
of Douglas P. Hamilton and John F. Cook, each of whom qualifies as an
independent director under the listing standards of the NYSE MKT Equities
Exchange. Douglas P. Hamilton is the Chairman of the Audit Committee and our
Board of Directors has determined that he satisfies the criteria for an audit
committee financial expert under Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S&#150;K of the 
rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each Audit Committee member is able
to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including our
consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and
consolidated statement of cash flows.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee meets with
management and our external auditors to review matters affecting our financial
reporting, the system of internal accounting and financial controls and
procedures and the audit procedures and audit plans. The Audit Committee reviews
our significant financial risks, is involved in the appointment of senior
financial executives, and annually reviews our insurance coverage and any
off&#150;balance sheet transactions. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee is mandated
to monitor the audit and preparation of our consolidated financial statements
and to review and recommend to the Board of Directors all financial disclosure
contained in our public documents. The Audit Committee is also mandated to
appoint our external auditors, monitor their qualifications and independence and
determine the appropriate level of their remuneration. The external auditors
report directly to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors. The Audit
Committee and Board of Directors each have the authority to terminate the
external auditor&#146;s engagement (subject to confirmation by our 
stockholders). The
Audit Committee also approves in advance any permitted services to be provided
by the external auditors which are not related to the audit. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Company provides appropriate
funding as determined by the Audit Committee to permit the Audit Committee to
perform its duties and to compensate its advisors. The Audit Committee, at its
discretion, has the authority to initiate special investigations, and if
appropriate, hire special legal, accounting or other outside advisors or experts
to assist the Audit Committee to fulfill its duties. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee operates
pursuant to a written charter. A copy of the Audit Committee charter was
attached as an exhibit to our proxy statement for the 2012 annual meeting of
shareholders. Although the Audit Committee Charter contemplates the appointment
of internal auditors, none have been appointed given the nature of the 
Company&#146;s
operations at the current stage of its development, and the internal audit
function is undertaken by senior management. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee discharged
its mandate in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2012, including
the review and recommendation to the Board in respect of all financial
disclosure contained in our company&#146;s public documents.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee held 4
meetings during the year ended December 31, 2012, and also acted through the
adoption of written consent resolutions as permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law and our company&#146;s Amended and Restated Bylaws.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Report of the Audit Committee</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee has reviewed
and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2012 with the Company&#146;s management. In addition, the Audit 
Committee has discussed with the Company&#146;s
independent registered public accounting firm, Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C., the
matters required by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, <I>Communication
with Audit Committees</I>. The Audit Committee has received the written
disclosures and the letter from Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. required by Public
Accounting Oversight Board Rule No. 3526, <I>Communications with Audit
Committees Concerning Independence</I>, and has discussed, with Mayer Hoffman
McCann P.C., their independence. The Audit Committee considered the
compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors&#146; independence. Based
on
the discussions and reviews referenced above, the Audit Committee recommended to
our Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2012 be included in the Company&#146;s Annual Report
on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Audit Committee has selected
Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. to serve as the Company&#146;s Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm for the year 2013.</P>

Plan) (the &#147;2006 Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) which was approved by our 
stockholders
at our Annual General Meeting held on October 18, 2006. Amendments to the 2006
Stock Incentive Plan were approved by our stockholders at our Annual General
Meeting held on October 15, 2008. The amendments have been incorporated into an
Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Amended and Restated

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 11,000,000 shares of
common stock were reserved for issuance under all awards that may be granted
under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. &#147;Eligible

or other entity in which our Company, a parent corporation or a subsidiary
corporation holds a substantial ownership interest, directly or indirectly. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended and Restated 2006

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Award that is subject to a
restriction will become fully exercisable only as set forth in the applicable
Award Agreement. Nevertheless, the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan provides the Administrator with the sole discretion, at any time, to
declare any or all Awards to be fully or partially vested and exercisable,
provided that the Administrator does not have the authority to accelerate or
postpone the timing of payment or settlement with respect to Awards subject to
Section 409A of the Code in a manner that would cause the Awards to be subject
to certain related interest and penalty provisions. The Administrator may
discriminate among Eligible Participants or among Awards in exercising such
discretion. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended and Restated 2006
Stock Incentive Plan has specific provisions which apply to grants of Awards
intended to qualify as &#147;performance&#150;based compensation&#148;, as

purposes of section 162(m)(3) of the Code. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Amended and Restated
2006 Stock Incentive Plan, stock options may be granted as either incentive
stock options under section 422 of the Code and the related regulations, or as
non&#150;incentive stock options under section 83 of the Code. As of December 
31,
2012, we have granted a total of 9,704,243 non&#150;qualified stock options and
200,000 incentive stock options under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we have also
granted non&#150;qualified stock options under individual compensation

the interests of the non&#150;executive directors with the long&#150;term 
interests of
stockholders.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non&#150;executive directors are
entitled to receive a $25,000 annual retainer, with an additional $15,000
payable annually to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and $7,500 payable
annually to the Chairman of the Compensation Committee and the Chairman of the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. All of these fees are payable in
stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or such other equity&#150;based
compensation as the Board of Directors determines.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the equity&#150;based 
fees
have been payable in shares of our common stock pursuant to our Amended and
Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The non&#150;executive directors have 
limited
rights, exercisable within applicable time limits, to elect to have any
percentage of such awards, and any percentage of cash fees, payable in DSUs.
Each of our non&#150;executive directors exercised such rights in respect of the
equity&#150;based fees payable to him for 2012 and 2011. Accordingly, all 
retainer
fees paid during 2012 and 2011 were paid in DSUs. The DSUs are subject to the
Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. DSUs are awarded on a quarterly
basis at the end of March, June, September and December, or as otherwise
determined by the administrator of the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan. The number of DSUs awarded each quarter is calculated by dividing the
total fees payable to each director for that quarter by the fair market value of
our common stock, determined in accordance with the Amended and Restated 2006 
Stock Incentive Plan. Each DSU is the
economic equivalent of one share of our common stock. The DSUs will be converted
into shares of common stock upon the director&#146;s termination of service, or 
as
otherwise provided in their individual deferral election.</P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Ronald Hirsch </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronald Hirsch serves as Chairman
of our Board of Directors pursuant to an executive employment agreement dated
January 2, 2004. The executive employment agreement originally governed the
terms of Mr. Hirsch&#146;s employment as our Chief Executive Officer, until his
resignation from that position effective February 15, 2006. The original term of
this executive employment agreement was for three years, expiring on January 2,
2007. The executive employment agreement has been renewed until January 2, 2014,
and is subject to automatic renewals for successive one year periods unless
cancelled by either of the parties. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive employment
agreement provides that, absent a change in control, if we were to terminate Mr.
Hirsch for any reason not for cause (other than due to death or disability), we
would have to pay to Mr. Hirsch: (i) his accrued unpaid salary, bonuses and
expenses, if any; (ii) his base salary for 12 months; and (iii) his health
insurance premiums until the earlier of the expiration of 12 months and the date
he is eligible for similar health benefits with another employer. Following a
change in control, in the event we were to terminate Mr. Hirsch for any reason
other than for death, disability or cause, we would be required to pay Mr.
Hirsch all accrued unpaid salary, bonuses, and expenses, a lump sum equal to
three times his annual base salary, and we would be required to pay for his
health, medical, and disability insurance premiums for a period of 18 months.
Mr. Hirsch may also elect to terminate his employment following a change of
control and receive these payments. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective October 18, 2006, we
entered into an agreement amending our executive employment agreement with Mr.
Hirsch, pursuant to which we have paid Mr. Hirsch all of his accrued consulting
fees for services provided by him to our Company between May 1, 2001 and October
19, 2003, and all of his accrued and unpaid salary (See &#147;Certain 
Relationships
and Related Transactions &#150; Compensatory Arrangements&#148;). As described 
in more
detail below, the amended executive employment agreement contains certain
provisions that will apply if our Company becomes a party to a &#147;Significant
Transaction,&#148; which is defined to mean a significant transaction in which: 
(i)
any person, together with all affiliates and associates of such person, becomes
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of our Company
representing or convertible into 51% or more of the common stock of our Company;
or (ii) there is a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction
or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any party as a single 
plan) of all or substantially all of
the assets of our Company or of assets of our Company valued at $12,000,000 or
greater.</P>

<P align=center><B>PROPOSAL NUMBER TWO:</B></P>
<P align=center><B>APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO AMENDED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
<BR>TO INCREASE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockholders are being asked
to approve an amendment to the Company&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from
400,000,000 to 600,000,000. On August [21], 2013, the Board of Directors adopted
resolutions approving and authorizing the amendment and directing that the
amendment be submitted to a vote of the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. A
copy of the proposed amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation effecting the
increase in our authorized shares is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Board of
Directors determined that the amendment is in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders and unanimously recommends approval by the stockholders.
</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this proposed amendment is
approved by the stockholders, the Board of Directors may proceed to file the
amendment at any future time, thereby making the increase in authorized capital
effective. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, abandon the amendment
to increase the authorized capital at any future time. If stockholder approval
is obtained and the Board of Directors determines that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders to proceed with the increase in
authorized capital, the Board of Directors will, at its discretion, file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to
the Certificate of Incorporation increasing the Company&#146;s authorized 
capital as
set forth in this proposal. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Certificate of Incorporation
currently authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000,000 shares of stock, of which
400,000,000 shares are designated as common stock, $.01 par value per share. Of
the 400,000,000 shares of common stock currently authorized, as of the close of
business on August 29, 2013, there were [114,716,907] shares of common stock
issued and outstanding. In addition, as of August 29, 2013, the Company has
reserved up to [11,000,000] shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to
outstanding options and common stock purchase warrants. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Reasons for Increase </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in our 
Company&#146;s
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, as filed with
the SEC on August 14, 2013, we are currently in default under our $25,000,000
Credit Agreement with Nedbank, our Copper Hedge Agreement with Nedbank Capital
and our note payable with Fisher Industries, our mining contractor and largest
unsecured trade creditor, who converted approximately $8.2 million of payables
to a two-year unsecured note bearing interest on the outstanding principal at
the rate of 6% per annum, which matured on July 31, 2012. As of June 30,
2013:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>the full amount of the outstanding principal under the Nedbank Credit
  Agreement of $23,257,826 (unaudited) was included in the Company&#146;s 
current
  liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and $8,863,887
  (unaudited) of related interest was included within accrued interest; </P>
  <LI>
  <P>the amount due to Nedbank Capital related to settlement payments
  outstanding under the Copper Hedge Agreement was $16,106,691 (unaudited) and
  was included in current liabilities; and </P></LI></UL>
<P align=center>28</P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center color=black SIZE=5
width="100%" noShade>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_34></A>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>the total principal balance on Fisher Industries&#146; note of $6,164,964
  (unaudited) was included in current liabilities, and $410,899 (unaudited) of
  related interest was included within accrued interest. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nedbank, Nedbank Capital and
Fisher Industries have not exercised their respective rights to note us in
default. However, our Company&#146;s continuation as a going concern is 
dependent
upon our ability to refinance the obligations under the Credit Agreement with
Nedbank, our Copper Hedge Agreement with Nedbank Capital and our note payable to
Fisher Industries, raise approximately $20 million dollars in additional
capital, and on our ability to produce copper to sell at a level where our
Company becomes profitable and generates cash flows from operations, all of
which is uncertain. Although we have continued to produce copper through the
residual leaching of ore already in place on our existing pads following the
suspension of our mining and crushing operations in July 2010, we expect that
the production level will continue to steadily decline until the resumption of
mining and crushing operations, which we anticipate will require us to seek
additional financing from time to time in order for us to meet our current
obligations.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given our financial difficulties,
we have little or no capital to deploy in response to unforeseen adverse changes
in market conditions or operational problems that may arise from time to time.
As a result, our residual leaching and solvent extraction/electro-winning
operations are particularly vulnerable to risk factors such as a material drop
in copper prices, a material increase in the cost of sulfuric acid, or a
material drop in our copper recovery rates (for example, due to heavy rainfall
which could negatively impact our leaching efficiencies) and related copper
production. If our residual leaching and solvent extraction/electro-winning
operations become economically unviable, we would be forced to terminate our
operations, significantly reduce our workforce, place the Johnson Camp Mine on a
care and maintenance program, and, perhaps, sell some of our assets (subject to
the consent of our secured creditors, as appropriate).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has
proposed this amendment to ensure that the Company has sufficient shares
available for purposes including, without limitation, equity financings (taking
into account the fact that the Company&#146;s common stock is currently being 
thinly
traded on the OTCQB in the $0.02 range), acquisitions, establishing strategic
relationships with corporate partners, providing equity incentives to employees,
and payments of stock dividends, stock splits or other recapitalizations. The
Company is actively seeking financing, strategic relationships and other
transactions which could potentially require the issuance of a significant
number of shares of common stock from treasury. Without an increase in the
shares of common stock authorized for issuance, the Company is highly unlikely
to be able to conclude any such transaction in a timely fashion.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Effect of Increase </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stockholders approve the
proposed amendment, the Board of Directors may cause the issuance of additional
shares of common stock without further vote of the stockholders of the Company,
except as may be required in particular cases by the Company&#146;s charter
documents, or applicable law. Under the Company&#146;s Certificate of 
Incorporation,
the Company&#146;s stockholders do not have preemptive rights to subscribe to
additional securities that may be issued by the Company, which means that
current stockholders do not have a prior right to purchase any new issue of
capital stock of the Company in order to maintain their proportionate ownership
of common stock. In addition, if the Board of Directors elects to cause the
Company to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible
into or exercisable for common stock, such issuance could have a dilutive effect
on the voting power
and earnings per share of existing stockholders. </P>
<P align=center>29</P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center color=black SIZE=5
width="100%" noShade>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_35></A>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the number of
authorized shares of common stock could have an anti-takeover effect, although
this is not the intent of the Board of Directors in proposing the amendment. For
example, if the Board of Directors issues additional shares in the future, such
issuance could dilute the voting power of a person seeking control of the
Company, thereby deterring or rendering more difficult a merger, tender offer,
proxy contest or an extraordinary transaction opposed by the Board of Directors.
From time to time, the Board has discussed with various parties the possibility
of transactions requiring significant issuances that might constitute a change
of control.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective May 6, 2003, the
Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before an
independent registered public accounting firm is engaged by us to render any
auditing or permitted non&#150;audit related service, the engagement be: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>approved by our audit committee; or </P>
  <LI>
  <P>entered into pursuant to pre&#150;approval policies and procedures 
established
  by the audit committee, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as
  to the particular service, the audit committee is informed of each service,
  and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the audit
  committee&#146;s responsibilities to management. </P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our audit committee was formed in
February 2006, and has assumed responsibility for the pre&#150;approval of audit
and
permitted non&#150;audit services to be performed by our Company&#146;s 
independent
auditor. The audit committee will, on an annual basis, consider and, if
appropriate, approve the provision of audit and non&#150;audit services by Mayer
Hoffman McCann P.C. Thereafter, the audit committee will, as necessary, consider
and, if appropriate, approve the provision of additional audit and 
non&#150;audit
services by Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. which are not encompassed by the audit
committee&#146;s annual pre&#150;approval and are not prohibited by law. The 
audit
committee has delegated to the chair of the audit committee the authority to
pre&#150;approve, on a case&#150;by&#150;case basis, non&#150;audit services to 
be performed by
Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C.</P>

<P align=center><B>PROPOSAL NUMBER FOUR:</B></P>
<P align=center><B>NON-BINDING VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the
requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act (which was added by the
<I>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</I>) and the
related rules of the SEC, we are providing the Company's shareholders with the
opportunity to vote on a non-binding advisory resolution to approve the
compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as described in this
Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's compensation disclosure rules. This
proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the
opportunity to express their views on our Named Executive Officers' compensation
as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of
compensation or any specific named executive officer, but rather the overall
compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies
and practices described in this Proxy Statement. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The say-on-pay vote is advisory,
and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our
Board of Directors. The say-on-pay vote will, however, provide information to us
regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy,
policies and practices, which the Compensation Committee will be able to
consider when determining executive compensation for the remainder of the
current fiscal year and beyond. Our Board of Directors and our Compensation
Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and, to the extent there is any
significant vote against the Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed
in this Proxy Statement, we may communicate directly with stockholders to better
understand the concerns that influenced the vote, but in all events we will
consider our stockholders' concerns and will share them with the Compensation
Committee which will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those
concerns. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key points of our 2013
executive compensation program are set forth in the "Executive Compensation"
section beginning on page 18.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the information
provided above and within the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy
Statement demonstrates that our executive compensation program was designed
appropriately and is working to ensure management's interests are aligned with
our stockholders' interests to support long-term value creation. Accordingly,
our Company is asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our Named
Executive Officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement by voting
"FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:</P>

      Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2013
      Annual Meeting of Shareholders." </P></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption of this resolution will
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the
Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Abstentions constitute voting power
present and will have the same effect as a vote against this Proposal. Brokers
and other nominee holders do not have discretion to vote uninstructed shares
with respect to this Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers or other nominee holders
do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners of the shares, they 
will not be able to vote
the shares and broker non-votes may occur with respect to this Proposal. Broker
non-votes do not constitute voting power present and, therefore, will have no
effect on the vote with respect to this proposal.</P>

<P align=justify><B>THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
FOR THE ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. </B></P>
<P align=center><B>PROPOSAL NUMBER FIVE:</B></P>
<P align=center><B>NON-BINDING VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF<BR></B><B>THE
NON-BINDING VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in Proposal 4 above,
the Company's shareholders are being provided the opportunity to cast a
non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's Named Executive
Officers. The advisory vote on executive compensation described in Proposal 4 is
commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote. Section 14A of the Exchange Act
(which was added by the <I>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act</I>) and the related rules of the SEC also enables the Company's
shareholders to indicate, at least once every six years, how frequently the
Company should seek a non-binding advisory "say-on-pay" vote.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proposal 5 affords
shareholders the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on how often
the Company should include a say-on-pay vote in its proxy materials for future
annual shareholder meetings (or a special shareholder meeting for which the
Company must include executive compensation information in the proxy statement
for that meeting). Under this Proposal 5, shareholders may vote to have the
say-on-pay vote every year, every two years or every three years. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Board of Directors believes
that say-on-pay votes should be conducted <U>every year </U>so that our
stockholders may provide us with their direct feedback on our named executive
officer compensation decisions, as disclosed in our proxy statement each year.
If say-on-pay votes are held less frequently than annually, then it would be
more difficult for us to understand which compensation decisions are supported
by our stockholders and which are not. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee, which
makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the Company&#146;s
executive compensation program, and our Board of Directors value the opinions
expressed by shareholders in these votes and will consider the outcome of these
votes in making their decisions on executive compensation.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that our
stockholders may have different views as to what is the best approach for the
Company, and we look forward to hearing from our stockholders on this Proposal.
</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of one year, two years
or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast by stockholders
will be the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation that has
been selected by stockholders. However, because this vote is advisory and not
binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors in
any way, the Board of Directors may decide that it is in the best interests of
our stockholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive
compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by our
stockholders.</P>

Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers or other nominee holders do not receive voting
instructions from beneficial owners of the shares, they will not be able to vote
the shares and broker non-votes may occur with respect to this Proposal 5.
However, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in the event a
stockholder proposal is not received by our Company by May 15, 2014, the proxy
to be solicited by the Board of Directors for the 2014 Annual Meeting will
confer discretionary authority on the holders of the proxy to vote the shares if
the proposal is presented at the 2014 Annual Meeting without any discussion of
the proposal in the proxy statement for such meeting.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEC rules and regulations provide
that if the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting is advanced or delayed more than 30
days from first anniversary of the 2013 Annual Meeting, stockholder proposals

be received by us within a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail the
proxy materials for the 2014 Annual Meeting.</P>
