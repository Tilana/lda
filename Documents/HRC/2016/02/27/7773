<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/8, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to undertake, with the assistance of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a questionnaire to seek the views of 
States on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation 
strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. In its resolution 21/24, the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to continue to 
undertake the survey to seek the views of both States and indigenous peoples, with a view 
to completing a final summary of responses for presentation to the Council at its twenty-
fourth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The questionnaires for both States and indigenous peoples focused on the following 
issues: development of an overarching or national strategy; whether specific legal, policy or 
other measures had been adopted to implement the Declaration; whether the Declaration 
has been taken into account when devising relevant laws, policies and other measures; 
whether steps have been taken to raise awareness of the Declaration at the community and 
Government levels; challenges encountered when adopting measures to attain the goals of 
the Declaration; and views on best practices regarding appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration. In their responses, States 
and indigenous peoples were asked to consider six different thematic areas: self-
determination and autonomy; participation in decision-making, including obligations to 
seek to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent; culture and languages; 
non-discrimination and equality; lands, territories and resources; and treaties, agreements 
and other constructive arrangements with States. 
</p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism thanks the States that responded to the questionnaire. State 
responses were received from Australia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Chile, the Congo, Denmark, Finland, France, Guyana, Iraq, 
Kazakhstan, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Mexico, Myanmar, New Zealand, 
Norway, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and the United 
States of America.   
</p>
<p>4. The Expert Mechanism also thanks the indigenous peoples and indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations that responded to the questionnaire. Responses were received from Aldet 
Centre (Saint Lucia); Botswana Khwedom Council (Botswana); Community for the 
Advancement of Native Studies, CANS (United States); Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica Para el 
Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos, CAPAJ (Peru); Centro de Promoci&#243;n y 
Desarrollo Rural Amaz&#243;nico, CEPODRA (Peru); Indigenous Bar Association, IBA 
(Canada); Naga Women&#8217;s Union, NWU and Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights, 
NPMHR (India); National Khoi-San Council (South Africa); National Native Title Council, 
NNTC (Australia); Native Indian Youth Council (United States); Ogoni Indigenous 
Ministers Forum (Nigeria); Programme d&#8217;Int&#233;gration et de D&#233;veloppement du Peuple 
Pygm&#233;e au Kivu (Democratic Republic of the Congo); San Support Organizations&#8217; 
Association of Namibia (Namibia); and Torres Strait Indigenous Peoples of Australia 
(Australia).  
</p><p>5. All responses are available on the website of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>6. The Expert Mechanism also thanks the Faculty of Law at the University of 
Manitoba, Canada, for its assistance in reviewing the responses from States. </p>


<p><b> II. Questionnaire

</p>
<p><b> III. State responses 
</b>10. This section summarizes the responses from States to the questionnaire. It must be 
borne in mind that non-State actors, including indigenous peoples, may have conflicting 
views on the benefits of measures adopted to implement the Declaration or ideal strategies 
to achieve its implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. National implementation strategies 
</b></p>
<p>11. Many States indicated that they had a national strategy to implement the 
Declaration. Guyana indicated that its implementation strategy was adumbrated in several 
policy documents, at least one of which was developed in consultation with the great 
majority of Amerindian communities. The National Development Plan of Mexico addresses 
indigenous peoples specifically and its Commission for the Development of Indigenous 
Peoples is required to assist indigenous peoples in their exercise of their self-determination. 
The plan of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is based on normative and institutional 
aspects, including already existing constitutional, legislative and regulatory norms. The 
national plan of Peru focuses on 12 areas, including participation, intellectual property, 
intercultural and bilingual education, use and transmission of indigenous languages, non-
discrimination, consultation, improvement of economic and social conditions, land, 
territories and natural resources, health, justice administration, access to justice, first 
contact and isolated indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>12. Several States indicated that the principles of the Declaration are reflected in 
national legislation. For example, the Congo indicated that the fundamental principles of 
the Declaration are incorporated in its Loi No. 5-2011, &#8220;Promotion et protection des droits 
des populations autochtones&#8221;. Some States, for example Peru and Myanmar, identified </p>


<p>existing national laws and policies which relate to specific areas of the Declaration such as 
education and culture. However, it is unclear whether these laws and policies were 
developed specifically to implement the goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>13. Some States, such as Finland, New Zealand and Norway, indicated that existing 
national laws and policies already conformed to the principles contained in the Declaration 
and therefore they have not developed additional strategies to implement the Declaration. 
Australia noted synergies between existing policies addressing Aboriginal peoples and the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>14. The response of the Plurinational State of Bolivia did not explicitly indicate whether 
it had a specific strategy to implement the Declaration. However, its national development 
plan, entitled &#8220;Bolivia digna, soberana, productiva y democr&#225;tica para vivir bien&#8221;, was 
developed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the objectives of the second 
International Decade of Indigenous Peoples. Chile&#8217;s strategy to implement its international 
obligations in relation to indigenous peoples domestically is focused on five areas: culture, 
identity and education; land; institutional capacity; participation and consultation; and 
integral development. This policy was developed through dialogue with the nine indigenous 
peoples in the country.  
</p>
<p>15. Australia, despite not having a formal strategy for implementing the Declaration, 
cited its 2009 National Apology to Australia&#8217;s indigenous peoples, and in particular to the 
stolen generations, as a symbolic gesture signalling its commitment to implementing the 
Declaration. In addition, Australia indicated that the principles of the Declaration are 
consistent with the Government&#8217;s Closing the Gap policy, a national strategy to address 
indigenous disadvantage. 
</p>
<p>16. The majority of the responses did not provide details on the scope and nature of 
States&#8217; national implementation plans. Nor did State responses indicate how these laws and 
policies were developed or whether they were developed in consultation with indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy or other measures adopted especially to implement the 
rights in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. All the rights in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Plurinational State of Bolivia has passed Law No. 3760 of 7 November 2007, 
on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In its response, 
Bolivia provided extensive information on laws and programmes that are relevant to the 
implementation of the rights in the Declaration, including in the areas of education and 
languages, communications and media, housing, economic policies, food security, land and 
agricultural development, justice and women&#8217;s rights in the administration of justice in 
particular, human rights, land, water, consultation processes, decolonization and processes 
to reduce patriarchy. 
</p>
<p>18. Chile also provided a comprehensive overview (article by article) of measures to 
implement the rights set out in the Declaration. Its response focused on five areas: culture, 
identity and language; land; institutions; participation and consultation; and development. 
These measures ranged from laws to policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p>19. In 2011, the Congo passed a law for the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, which incorporates the fundamental principles of the Declaration. The 
law addresses many areas, including consultation, administration of internal affairs and 
recourse to customs to resolve internal conflicts, protection of customs and traditional </p>


<p>institutions, intellectual property relating to traditional knowledge, protection of sacred 
sites, education, and individual and collective property rights. 
</p>
<p>20. The Mexican Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has as one of 
its principal objectives the harmonization of federal and state-level laws with respect to the 
rights of indigenous peoples. It has referenced the Declaration in its work in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Self-determination and autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Constitution of Mexico, as a result of amendments in 2001, recognizes 
indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determination and their collective rights. 
</p>
<p>22. Several States identified legislation that recognized indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
autonomy. Most of the legislative provisions recognizing or creating indigenous 
autonomous areas require indigenous peoples to vote in favour of becoming autonomous. 
Indigenous jurisdiction over these autonomous areas varies. Some States indicated that 
these autonomous areas utilize indigenous peoples&#8217; own laws and institutions.  
</p>
<p>23. The Plurinational State of Bolivia has begun a process of recognizing the autonomy 
of indigenous communities. Several communities have voted in favour of autonomy and 
have begun the process of developing their statute for autonomy with technical support 
from the Ministry of Autonomy. The process recognizes the need for equal participation of 
women in the governance structure. 
</p>
<p>24. Burkina Faso has also begun a process of decentralization through its Loi No. 055-
2004/AN. This law entrenches the right of territories to govern themselves and to manage 
their own affairs to promote their own development and reinforce local governance. This 
decentralization process has transferred jurisdiction in socioeconomic and cultural matters, 
specifically in the areas of education, health, culture and economic development projects. 
</p><p>25. The law in the Congo guarantees indigenous peoples the right to administer their 
internal affairs and to have recourse to their customs to resolve internal conflicts. The law 
also protects indigenous peoples&#8217; customs and traditional institutions. 
</p>
<p>26. The Constitution of Guyana established the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Commission, which 
is one of five constitutional rights commissions. The objective of the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; 
Commission is to &#8220;establish mechanisms to enhance the status of indigenous peoples and to 
respond to their legitimate demands and needs&#8221;. As part of its mandate, the Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Commission offers recommendations on indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in 
national decision-making and other decisions that affect their lives. In Guyana, the 
Amerindian Act 2006 provides for Village Councils to govern internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>27. Denmark passed the Act on Greenland self-government in 2009. Under the 
preamble, the people of Greenland are recognized as a people under international law with 
the right to self-determination. The current Government of Greenland is a democratically 
elected public Government where all the current members of Parliament and Government 
are of Inuit descent. 
</p>
<p>28. The Constitution of Finland recognizes the right of self-government of the Saami 
people and that the Saami have linguistic and cultural self-government in their native 
region. The Act on the Saami Parliament regulates the implementation of the system of 
self-government.   
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation in decision-making, including obligations to seek to obtain indigenous 
peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>29. Most States provided information on legislative and policy measures to implement 
the right to participate in decision-making. There were two aspects to the information </p>


<p>provided: participation in national decision-making and consultation on decisions affecting 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>30. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, indigenous peoples are represented in 
legislative bodies. In the Parliament of Burkina Faso there are Peulh and Tourareg elected 
representatives and ministers of the Government. 
</p>
<p>31. In the Congo, legislation ensures the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-
making. Peru has also passed a law on the right to prior consultation as recognized in 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169, which was promulgated on 
23 August 2011. 
</p>
<p>32. France indicated that in its department of French Guiana an advisory board of 
Amerindians and Bushinengu&#233; was established in 2010. The regional councils and the 
general council consult this board on any plans or proposals which may affect the 
environment or the cultural activities of the Amerindians and Bushinengu&#233;. 
</p>
<p>33. Chile undertook a consultation on indigenous institutions, which was modified after 
receiving complaints from indigenous leaders on the process. The first stage of consultation 
is now aimed at a consultation on developing consultation procedures. 
</p>
<p>34. In 2005 the Government of Norway and the Saami Parliament concluded an 
agreement on procedures for consultations to ensure that new measures and legal provisions 
are in accordance with the Sami peoples&#8217; rights. The Procedures for Consultations also seek 
to ensure that the Saami peoples can genuinely participate in and have a real influence on 
decision-making processes that may directly affect Saami interests. The Government has by 
Royal Decree confirmed that the agreed procedures apply to the whole central Government 
administration. 
</p>
<p>35. The Finnish Act on the Saami Parliament includes an obligation to negotiate with 
the Saami Parliament on various issues, including: community planning; the management, 
use, leasing and assignment of State lands, conservation areas and wilderness areas; 
applications for licenses to stake mine claims; legislative or administrative changes to the 
occupations belonging to the Saami culture; the development of the teaching of and in the 
Saami language in schools, as well as the social and health services; or any other matters 
affecting the Saami language and culture and the status of the Saami as an indigenous 
people. The obligation to negotiate applies to all levels of administration.   
</p>
<p>36. In Guyana, titling and demarcation of Amerindian lands and territories requires their 
free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>37. Australia has an indigenous engagement framework which, it states, captures its 
aspirations to engage effectively with indigenous peoples. The National Congress of 
Australia&#8217;s First Peoples is a vehicle to provide a voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander peoples in strategic national matters. 
</p>
<p>38. In the United States of America, pursuant to Executive Order 13175 on 
&#8220;Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments&#8221;, federal agencies are 
required to consult with tribal officials when making decisions that affect tribal 
communities. 
</p>
<p>39. The Mexican Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has 
established a system for consultation with indigenous peoples which allows for their 
participation in the definition, design, implementation and evaluation of programmes, 
projects and Government actions. 
</p><p>40. Peru passed a law on the right to consultation under which the purpose of 
consultation is agreement between the State and indigenous peoples. Based on this law, a </p>


<p>methodological guide was developed with the technical assistance from the ILO and the 
United Nations Development Programme.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Culture and languages 
</b></p>
<p>41. There were examples of indigenous languages being recognized in State 
constitutions. However, the most common response was to highlight the importance of 
education to promote and implement indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to culture and language. 
There were a few examples of indigenous languages being taught in national schools. A 
few States explicitly indicated that curricula were developed in consultation with 
indigenous peoples. Some States indicated a need to overcome negative stereotypes of 
indigenous cultures and languages in order to preserve and promote their use. 
</p>
<p>42. The Bolivian education system has been undergoing changes, based on an ideology 
and political practice of decolonization, liberation, revolution, anti-imperialism and 
transformation without discrimination or exploitation. The revamped education system 
provides cultural education, which contributes to the affirmation and strengthening of 
cultural identities, recognition, assessment and development of indigenous peoples&#8217; culture 
in dialogue with other cultures and language. The Bolivian Constitution provides for 
education to begin in the mother tongue of each region. The Bolivian Constitution also 
provides for the creation of indigenous universities for indigenous youth. 
</p>
<p>43. In Peru, the Declaration was explicitly invoked by the Minister of Education in the 
creation of the National Commission on Intercultural Bilingual Education (CONEIB). Peru 
has also passed a law on intercultural bilingual education, which aims to recognize cultural 
diversity and promote intercultural bilingual education in regions inhabited by indigenous 
peoples. Peruvian law also recognizes and guarantees the right of indigenous peoples to 
conditions of education equal to the rest of the nation. The Minister of Education is to 
design and implement a national plan for intercultural bilingual education. Indigenous 
peoples are to participate in the formulation and implementation of these education 
programmes. Peru has also developed a capacity-building programme for interpreters 
participating in consultation processes.  
</p>
<p>44. Chile identified programmes for the teaching and learning of indigenous languages 
and cultures in the nation&#8217;s schools. The Constitution of Guyana provides protection of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right &#8220;to protection, preservation and promulgation of their languages, 
cultural heritage and way of life&#8221;. The Constitution of Iraq guarantees an Iraqi individual&#8217;s 
right to education in his or her mother tongue. 
</p>
<p>45. The Constitution of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic recognizes the Lao 
language as the official language and dialect of the country. However, in day-to-day life, 
each ethnic group is free to preserve and use its dialect in family and community for the 
preservation of their culture and traditions. 
</p>
<p>46. In the Congo, the law guarantees collective and individual rights of indigenous 
peoples to their intellectual property relating to traditional knowledge. The law also protects 
cultural, religious and spiritual property. 
</p>
<p>47. The Finnish Saami Language Act regulates the right of the Saami to use their own 
language before courts and other authorities. The Act also obligates public authorities to 
realize and promote the linguistic rights of the Saami.   
</p>
<p>48. In Trinidad and Tobago, in 2011, the Government approved 25 acres of land for the 
creation of an Amerindian Heritage Village to protect Amerindian culture and traditions. </p>


<p><b> 5. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>49. Several States indicated that their constitutions provide for non-discrimination and 
equality, such as the Chilean Constitution. The Guyana Constitution also prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of race. 
</p>
<p>50. Some States indicated that the principle of equality prohibited States from treating 
any one group differently from another group. The Constitution of the Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic stipulates that all Lao citizens are equal before the law. According to 
the Government, in accordance with the principle of equality, every ethnic group is special 
and therefore no one is more special than any other group, which has contributed to peace 
and harmony and solidarity among Lao&#8217;s multi-ethnic peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Lands, territories and resources; 
</b></p>
<p>51. Several States mentioned processes under way to demarcate and title indigenous 
peoples&#8217; lands. A few States referenced the collective nature of these titles. Several States 
indicated that indigenous peoples have certain governmental authority or jurisdiction over 
their lands. 
</p>
<p>52. The Plurinational State of Bolivia is strengthening the process of land redistribution 
and community self-management. Bolivia has also published and distributed an Atlas of 
Indigenous Territories. Chile relaunched mechanisms to transfer land to indigenous peoples 
in transparent and objective conditions. The collective property rights of indigenous 
peoples in the Congo are protected by the law. 
</p>
<p>53. France identified the creation of the Guyana Amazonian Park in French Guiana as 
providing protection to indigenous peoples in the area to maintain and preserve their 
subsistence practices, as well as preserving the natural resources they exploit. 
</p>
<p>54. In Guyana, the 2003 Constitution provides protection over property, including 
Amerindian property. Under the Amerindian Act 2006, Amerindians are granted title to 
their lands absolutely and forever. Titling and demarcation of Amerindian villages must 
occur with Amerindians&#8217; free, prior and informed consent. These lands and resources are 
governed by Village Councils, who have rule-making powers governing &#8220;the management, 
use, preservation, protection and conservation of village lands and resources or any part 
thereof&#8221;. To date, there has been an increase in the percentage of Amerindian land titled 
and demarcated. 
</p>
<p>55. New Zealand respects the importance of Maori peoples&#8217; relationship with their land 
and resources, but also maintains the existing legal regimes for ownership and management 
of land and natural resources. 
</p>
<p>56. The Peruvian Constitution protects the rights to land and there is a process for the 
recognition and entitlement of such lands. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States 
</b></p>
<p>57. New Zealand indicated that the Treaty of Waitangi is the foundational document for 
the relationship between the Government and Maori. New Zealand is committed to settling 
outstanding treaty grievances by 2014. New Zealand indicated that increased resources and 
funding are being provided to continue the settlement process. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consideration of the Declaration when devising new laws and policies 
</b></p>
<p>58. Based on the responses, no State has passed explicit laws requiring the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to be considered when devising new laws, policies or </p>


<p>other measures. However, there are examples where the goals and principles of the 
Declaration inform processes leading to new laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>59. Several States have formalized processes and enacted legislation requiring 
indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making. These laws generally require prior 
consultation when States make decisions that directly affect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
Some States make specific reference to the requirement of free, prior and informed consent 
in relevant laws and policies. Many States indicated that measures requiring consultation 
were developed in consultation with indigenous peoples. There were a few examples of 
consultation occurring through indigenous peoples&#8217; own institutions and decision-making 
processes. 
</p>
<p>60. The Congo&#8217;s law on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples was elaborated through a process which allowed for public participation including 
governmental actors, civil society and international experts. Indigenous peoples were 
consulted in their localities in all departments where there is a significant concentration of 
indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples also played an active role in the discussions leading 
to the final draft of the legislation. 
</p>
<p>61. Consultation with indigenous peoples in the Plurinational State of Bolivia is part of 
the principles of openness and transparency promoted by the Government. In Bolivia, there 
are several laws in place that require consultation with indigenous peoples and their 
participation in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>62. The Chilean Indigenous Act recognizes and safeguards indigenous peoples and their 
lands in Chile, as well as recognizes indigenous institutions and cultures. The Indigenous 
Act provides special measures for the practical application of the obligations of 
consultation and participation. This Chilean law recognizes that indigenous peoples should 
be consulted through their traditional organizations as well as those communities, 
organizations and associations recognized under the Indigenous Act. In one instance, when 
indigenous peoples expressed concern with the process used for consultation, the 
government adjusted the process for discussing new indigenous institutions and 
constitutional recognition. 
</p>
<p>63. In Guyana, the Amerindian Law 2006 requires free, prior and informed consent of 
Amerindian Villagers on issues that require their involvement or support in the areas of 
land or mining, titling and demarcating lands, entry and access to Amerindian villages, and 
use of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>64. In New Zealand, one example of Maori participation in decision-making occurs 
through negotiated agreements for the co-management of resources, such as Crown-owned 
conservation lands and National Parks. Additionally, recent jurisprudence concluded that 
the common law is to be developed consistently with emerging human rights norms and the 
Treaty of Waitangi. 
</p>
<p>65. Peru has enacted a law that recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to prior 
consultation on legislative or administrative measures that directly affect their collective 
rights in the areas of physical existence, cultural identity, territory, education, health, 
quality of life and development of their peoples. This law also extends to national and 
regional plans, programmes and development projects that directly affect indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights. The regulations of this Act are being drafted with the participation of 
various government agencies and representatives of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>66. Several States indicated that, based on principles of formal equality of all citizens, 
there is no law that provides special recognition or processes for indigenous peoples to 
participate in decision-making. In Burkina Faso, the decentralization law takes into account 
the considerations set out in the Declaration. However, Burkina Faso does not wish to </p>


<p>create a hierarchy among populations within the State and thus does not explicitly consider 
the Declaration when devising new laws and policies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives to raise awareness of the Declaration at community and 
government levels 
</b></p>
<p>67. State responses indicated several direct measures to raise awareness of the 
Declaration. Some States indicated a preference to focus awareness campaigns on general 
human rights instruments, such as national laws or human rights treaties. Awareness-raising 
initiatives were aimed at both Government and indigenous peoples. One State emphasized 
the importance of indigenous peoples knowing their rights and Governments knowing the 
Declaration. There were a few examples where education and training on indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights was part of the awareness initiatives. 
</p>
<p>68. The Mexican Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has 
disseminated the Declaration within the Government and been instrumental in the 
translation of the Declaration into 18 indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p>69. The Congo has focused awareness-raising on national and international human 
rights and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights instruments. During &#8220;Parliamentary days&#8221; there were 
efforts taken to educate Congolese parliamentarians on the rights of indigenous peoples and 
the Declaration was explained to the parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p>70. The Ministry of External Relations of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, with the 
ILO South America Regional Office, developed a series of workshops on &#8220;The scope of the 
ILO Convention 169: Challenges for application and implementation and strategies for 
action&#8221;. These workshops were directed at various officials in Bolivia, public servants and 
indigenous peoples. Bolivia has also created and distributed materials (books, pamphlets 
and audiovisual material) on collective rights. 
</p><p>71. Chile has a programme, &#8220;Strengthening national capacities for conflict prevention 
and intercultural management in Chile&#8221;, which includes support for activities whose 
purpose is the dissemination of information and training related to indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights recognized by international law with an emphasis on ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>72. France indicated that it has an ambassador for human rights and that on the 
International Day of Indigenous People, round tables were organized as well as cultural 
events held in Guyana. 
</p>
<p>73. Following the enactment of the Amerindian Act in Guyana, there was a recognized 
need for education and awareness for the Village Councils and community members. 
Several training programmes have been conducted and an &#8220;Amerindian Act Made Simple&#8221; 
brochure was published and distributed to all leaders and community members, which 
provided a non-technical explanation of the law. The Government of Guyana also executes 
capacity-building programmes and workshops for government employees. As well, 
indigenous leaders can seek clarification of the Amerindian law during their biennial 
meetings. 
</p>
<p>74. The national human rights institution of Australia developed an overview, a 
community guide and a poster on the Declaration, which sought to highlight practical 
examples of how the Declaration can benefit indigenous Australians. 
</p>
<p>75. A few States indicated that, while they were not taking action to promote the 
Declaration, information on the Declaration is distributed by other organizations within the 
State. With the announcement of support for the Declaration, there was widespread 
publicity of the Declaration in New Zealand. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission </p>


<p>has translated the Declaration into Te Reo Maori and has publicized the content and 
significance of the Declaration. While different organizations that work in Peru have 
produced some materials, there is no national campaign to provide understanding of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>76. Some States expressed hesitation about directly promoting the Declaration and the 
rights of indigenous peoples. Burkina Faso notes that its national cultural policy promotes 
principles of respect, but does not indicate any measures to promote the rights of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges in adopting measures and implementing strategies to attain 
the goals of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>77. One of the biggest challenges identified is the lack of awareness and knowledge of 
the Declaration and other international instruments on the rights of indigenous peoples to 
ensure the respect for these rights. One State indicated that this lack of knowledge is 
exacerbated by a lack of larger civil society engagement in indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
Moreover, the rights of indigenous peoples are often not priorities. 
</p>
<p>78. A few States indicated that a challenge they experienced was a lack of information 
on how to implement the Declaration. In particular, there was an identified need to improve 
mechanisms for dialogue and information exchange between the State and indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>79. One State cited the lack of definitional consensus on the meaning of terms such as 
self-determination, sovereignty and free, prior and informed consent as an impediment to 
the practical implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>80.  Another main challenge identified was the cost of implementing the Declaration and 
the limited resources available to undertake this work. Specifically, the cost of land 
demarcation and titling was identified. One State indicated that the remoteness of 
indigenous communities poses challenges to access to and timely delivery of goods and 
services, as well the inherent prohibitive costs in delivering these goods and services. In 
addition, there are challenges in preserving and publishing State materials in all of the many 
indigenous languages that may exist within a single State. 
</p>
<p>81. Another challenge identified was the need for regional variances in implementation. 
Specifically, each Government&#8217;s policies are not organized in the same manner. Moreover, 
each indigenous people has its own history, culture, needs and perspectives.   
</p>
<p>82. One State indicated that it is a challenge to develop national legislation. Further, 
there is a need to incorporate and implement international commitments in public policies. 
Also, one State expressed concern because there is a need to ensure that policies developed 
for indigenous peoples also contribute to the development of the national society. 
</p>
<p>83. One State indicated that it is a challenge to ensure consistency across states due to 
the constitutional division of legislative powers between federal and state governments.  
</p>
<p>84. A major challenge discussed was in relation to monitoring and enforcement of laws, 
particularly mining and forestry laws. One State indicated that it is a challenge to prevent 
unethical foreign researchers and non-governmental organizations from misappropriating 
indigenous peoples&#8217; intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>85. Some States did not identify any challenges but rather reiterated the rights enjoyed 
by indigenous peoples within the State. </p>


<p><b> F. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>86. In their responses, States indicated many measures and best practices for 
implementing the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. To fully realize the 
goals of the Declaration, Governments need to commit to an ongoing implementation 
process and continue building on achievements. 
</p>
<p>87. Where treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements already exist, these 
instruments can provide the foundation for partnership, mutual respect, cooperation and 
good faith between States and indigenous peoples. The Noum&#233;a Accord between France 
and the Kanaks of New Caledonia recognized the harmful effects of colonization, returned 
confiscated land to the indigenous peoples, provided full participation of Kanak people in 
decision-making, and established a consultation process. 
</p>
<p>88. Chile&#8217;s approach to hold regional round tables for a &#8220;historic reunion&#8221; is an example 
of a process to create a national plan to attain the goals of the Declaration. Government, 
churches, civil society organizations, and indigenous representatives participated in these 
roundtables. The goals were to build trust and identify topics that are important to 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>89. Many States set out a multi-pronged approach to implementing the rights in the 
Declaration. Some States used constitutional, legislative and policy measures to implement 
the Declaration. Some States drafted new legislation, amended existing legislation, created 
new programmes and initiatives, and increased involvement in international indigenous 
issues. This multi-pronged approach can include a special law recognizing the rights of 
indigenous peoples, which is developed with the effective participation of indigenous 
peoples based on the principle of free, prior and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>90. The Plurinational State of Bolivia particularly demonstrated good practices of 
gender equality by recognizing the need to ensure that programmes specifically target and 
benefit indigenous women. As part of its strategy to address violence against indigenous 
women, the national plan of Australia includes strengthening indigenous communities 
through the fostering of leadership of indigenous women within communities and broader 
Australian society. 
</p>
<p>91. States can work with United Nations agencies to substantially improve the situation of 
indigenous peoples, especially with those agencies providing technical assistance. Chile 
identified the need for ongoing support by the international community in the implementation 
of strategies to achieve the Declaration, especially in studying and publicizing best practices 
to assist States in achieving the goals of the Declaration. Norway demonstrated good practice 
by responding to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
(A/HRC/18/35/Add.2), indicating how the Government plans to follow up the 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>92. Many States pointed to the relationship between the Declaration and other 
international human rights treaties, including ILO Convention No. 169, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, in the promotion and protection of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>93. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples supported the Congo in the adoption 
of the special law for indigenous peoples. Technical assistance from the international 
community, including information and capacity-building, will, in the opinion of some 
States, significantly benefit and improve implementation. </p>


<p>94. To attain the goals of the Declaration, States promoted capacity-building for 
indigenous peoples. Further, States encouraged efforts to strengthen indigenous peoples&#8217; 
institutions, non-governmental organizations and self-government structures. There was 
also a recognized need to provide opportunities for indigenous peoples to participate as 
equal partners in the development process of the entire country. Australia pursues a policy 
of focusing on addressing indigenous disadvantage in areas such as education, health 
services, community development and community safety. 
</p>
<p>95. States also identified best practices in the area of education and promoting 
indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures. It is important to include indigenous languages 
within the education system. This includes developing strategies for implementing bilingual 
and intercultural education, which includes indigenous peoples&#8217; participation. In addition, 
cultural centres can be created to promote indigenous cultures. Finally, some States 
recognized indigenous languages as official languages. 
</p>
<p>96. To attain the goals of the Declaration, some States indicated that a special budget for 
consultation with indigenous peoples was created. Other States provided funds to address 
issues facing urban indigenous peoples and undertake studies on employability. To this end, 
States indicated that international financial institutions will need to aid developing countries 
throughout the implementation process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Responses from indigenous peoples, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overarching implementation strategies  
</b></p>
<p>97. A number of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations indicated that they had developed 
strategies to implement the Declaration. In some cases, organizations, such as CANS and 
the San Support Organizations&#8217; Association of Namibia, had themselves been created 
specifically as an implementation strategy. The Aldet Centre noted the establishment of 
Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore International, which focused on 
the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair 
and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on 
Biodiversity, and World Intellectual Property Organization instruments on intellectual 
property and genetic resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.  
</p>
<p>98. CAPAJ noted that it had developed an overarching strategy to attain the Declaration&#8217;s 
goals, basing its activities on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to equality and self-determination. 
One activity had included promoting the creation of a Parliament of Qollana Aymara and 
Quechua peoples across the Peruvian, Chilean and Bolivian borders to develop transborder 
relationships. 
</p>
<p>99. Some indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations focused on awareness-raising among 
indigenous communities and their leadership, the legal community and academics, as well 
as broader society. IBA has pursued this objective by hosting workshops, posting material 
for accessible online use and producing an article on the implementation experiences in 
Canada. IBA cites the Declaration in all its advocacy work. NWU and NPMHR have 
developed implementation strategies to translate the Declaration into indigenous languages 
and awareness-raising campaigns.  
</p>
<p>100. Some indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted that their implementation strategies 
included engagement with the United Nations system, in some instances bringing cases 
before treaty bodies and, in others, participating actively in international activities and 
mechanisms related to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, such as the Committee on the </p>


<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, to secure compliance with the goals of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>101. The primary strategy of the NNTC is to advocate for governments and other 
organizations to actively reference the principles and goals of the Declaration. This process 
entails, inter alia, the inclusion of indigenous representation in relevant legislative, policy 
and administrative processes, the promotion of the principle of free, prior and informed 
consent for traditional land owners, and agreement-making on issues and developments 
affecting traditional lands and territories.  
</p>
<p>102. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations indicated that Declaration implementation 
strategies were in place, but did not describe them in detail, while several others noted that 
that they did not have specific strategies.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific legal, policy or other measures to implement the rights in the 
Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>103. In some cases, indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations were not aware of any measures 
adopted by respective national Governments to implement the Declaration. Several 
organizations noted that they had made efforts, without success, to encourage States to 
adopt specific measures to implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>104. One organization noted that the national Government was preparing legislation that 
would address indigenous issues and that indigenous peoples were being consulted, 
however, the process was considered to be inconsistent with the Declaration. The proposed 
bill did not mention the Declaration.   
</p>
<p>105. In terms of measures taken by indigenous governments, while the Declaration was 
not mentioned specifically in the resolution of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe that created CANS, 
the organization&#8217;s work was intended to implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Self-determination and autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>106. CAPAJ noted that the 15 annual assemblies of the Parliament of the Qollana 
Aymara People of the Andes had been held in accordance with the form of self-government 
as envisioned under the <i>ayllu-marka</i> system. Practicing traditional forms of governance 
provided guarantees for its continuity, even where not recognized by States.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Participation in decision-making, including obligations to seek to obtain indigenous 
peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>107. One organization noted evidence of the lack of commitment by the Government to 
upholding the principle of free, prior and informed consent, citing the example of the 
development by the State of a plan that, although set out as a strategy to attain the goals of 
the Declaration, was flawed. In particular, indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed 
consent was not sought for aspects of the policies that would most directly impact them.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Culture and languages 
</b></p>
<p>108. CAPAJ noted its efforts to advance the use of Aymara language in some Chilean 
municipal schools to revitalize traditional culture.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Non-discrimination and equality  
</b></p>
<p>109. CEPODRA noted that it was working to promote equal opportunities and non-
discrimination in the hiring of indigenous health technicians by the Regional Health </p>


<p>Directorate of Ucayali, Peru. Its efforts to do so were consistent with the Declaration, and 
with technical standards regarding the mainstreaming of intercultural approaches to health, 
particularly with regard to those health practitioners working in indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Lands, territories and resources 
</b></p>
<p>110. NNTC noted its advocacy for the Government of Australia to enshrine the principles 
of the Declaration in the development of the Murray Darling Basin plan, especially with 
regard to the right of indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their distinctive 
relationship with their lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other resources. In 
relation to the Basin plan, NNTC, together with partners, is also currently undertaking the 
National Cultural Flows Research Project, which incorporates the principles of the 
Declaration, especially article 32, paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States 
</b></p>
<p>111. CAPAJ noted its sponsorship of the Awuayala Tribunal of Justice (TOAJ), a body 
whose decisions, while not binding, appeal to the conscience and reason of humanity. 
TOAJ, hosted by the Kallawaya Nation in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, held its first 
hearing in June 2012 to hear the demand of the Jacha Suyu Pakajaki Nation to reclaim 
territories taken on the basis of the doctrine of discovery. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consideration of the Declaration when devising new laws and policies 
or other measures that affect indigenous individuals 
</b></p>
<p>112. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations reported that the Declaration is not 
routinely taken into account in State efforts to devise laws, policies or other measures that 
affect indigenous peoples. In some cases, this is attributed to the lack of recognition of 
indigenous peoples in the country or the view that indigenous peoples are an impediment to 
development. In some cases indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations had made unsuccessful 
efforts to encourage States to adopt specific legal, policy and other measures to implement 
the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>113. A number of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted their own use of the 
Declaration as a basis for setting standards and in advocacy.  
</p>
<p>114. CANS noted that its activities were aimed at working with Native nations, 
communities and organizations in identifying, prioritizing, formulating and implementing 
projects in accordance with their will, priorities and concerns. Going forward, CANS 
intended to explicitly insert, whenever feasible, the Declaration into its work.  
</p>
<p>115. CAPAJ is leading processes to rebuild traditional forms of self-government, to 
advocate for the respect of free, prior and informed consent, to adopt measures aimed at 
strengthening Andean cultures and intercultural education, to protect traditional lands, 
territories and resources and collective property, and to open spaces for traditional justice. 
In this work, CAPAJ explicitly cites the Declaration and ILO Convention No. 169.  
</p>
<p>116. NWU and NPMHR expressed that the Declaration is a source of strength and power 
to claim their rights as indigenous peoples. The Declaration is not especially mentioned in 
collective decisions of the Naga people, as collective approaches to decision-making reflect 
traditional practice.  
</p>
<p>117. The Native Indian Youth Council has developed a specific policy of advocating for 
the inclusion of urban indigenous peoples in attaining the goals of Declaration. The 
organization consciously cites the Declaration within its advocacy efforts. </p>


<p>118. NNTC follows the Declaration within its own work and practices. It noted that its 
policy submissions refer to principles in the Declaration, particularly those related to free, 
prior and informed consent and self-determination.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives to raise awareness of the Declaration at community and 
government levels 
</b></p>
<p>119. Indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations described a number of measures taken or under 
way to raise awareness regarding the Declaration. Activities focused particularly on 
translation and dissemination of the Declaration and on carrying out training and 
workshops. Some organizations noted financial constraints on awareness-raising activities. 
</p>
<p>120. The Aldet Centre had initiated discussions with State officials to make them more 
sensitive to the Declaration and had also disseminated and publicized the content of 
Declaration in both English and the Kw&#233;y&#242;l language.  
</p>
<p>121. The Botswana Khwedom Council noted its use of the Declaration as a point of 
reference in workshops it organizes and in discussions with the national Government.  
</p>
<p>122. CAPAJ emphasized the importance of dissemination of the Declaration and reported 
that it had led workshops and seminars about the Declaration, noting that there was wide 
demand among indigenous peoples for such capacity-building tools. However, CAPAJ 
expressed concerns about providing these workshops, due to a lack financial resources. 
CEPODRA also noted that it was not able to disseminate the Declaration on a large scale 
due to very few financial resources.  
</p>
<p>123. CANS recently began efforts to raise awareness about the Declaration at various 
levels of the community and governance to enhance prospects of its implementation. 
</p>
<p>124. IBA published <i>Understanding and Implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples: An Introductory Handbook</i>,1 which explains the Declaration in 
thematic clusters and concludes with information on implementation and additional 
resources. The handbook has been shared with national and provincial authorities, treaty 
relations commissions, human rights commissions and some domestic courts and was 
distributed at a series of workshops conducted across Canada for lawyers, educators, 
community leaders and human rights workers.  
</p>
<p>125. Initiatives taken by NWU and NPMHR to raise awareness about the Declaration 
include the organization of trainings, workshops, seminars, meetings and community 
consultations on the Declaration, human rights and United Nations mechanisms. This 
process included translation and dissemination of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>126. The National Khoi-San Council has conducted various workshops relating to the 
Declaration with indigenous leaders and community representatives in different parts of 
South Africa, through institutions such as the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating 
Committee. It was also noted that the Declaration has been translated from English into 
Afrikaans, a language spoken widely among Khoi and San peoples. 
</p>
<p>127. The Native Indian Youth Council reported efforts to integrate the Declaration in its 
advocacy activities, as well its participation in efforts to raise and promote awareness of the 
Declaration among Navajo Nation and other tribal leaders.  
</p><p>128. NNTC works to raise awareness of the Declaration by incorporating the goals and 
rights stated in the Declaration into submissions, interventions and recommendations

<p>presented to various levels of governance and stakeholders, both domestically and 
internationally. The Council emphasized the importance of raising awareness about the 
Declaration among indigenous peoples. The Council further works to raise awareness 
among Government, industry and indigenous peoples of the need for extractive industries to 
engage more efficiently and effectively with indigenous peoples to realize their right to 
free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>129. The Programme d&#8217;Int&#233;gration et de D&#233;veloppement du Peuple Pygm&#233;e au Kivu 
reported its use of press, media, meetings and workshops to disseminate information about the 
Declaration. In particular, such efforts were intended to reach concerned indigenous peoples, 
national and local authorities, community leaders, the army, the police and civil society 
organizations. It further noted that the Declaration had not been translated into relevant 
indigenous languages, which was a key issue that should be resolved in the short term.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges in adopting measures and implementing strategies to attain 
the goals of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>130. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted that there was a lack of awareness of 
the Declaration, including on the part of indigenous organizations. In some cases, this was due 
to the lack of availability of the Declaration and information about it in relevant languages. 
</p>
<p>131. One indigenous peoples&#8217; organization noted that the lack of awareness in its country 
related also to the relevance of international law at the national level. Lack of clarity in this 
regard was contributed to by a government view of the Declaration as being an aspirational 
document. This position had influenced the views of some indigenous peoples, as well as 
lawyers and members of the judiciary. 
</p><p>132. Another challenge identified was the Declaration&#8217;s perceived complexity in 
overtaking the traditional dichotomy between individual and collective rights in societies. 
This was seen as a concern in terms of making the Declaration more effective and better 
understood.  
</p>
<p>133. One organization noted that the costs of raising awareness regarding the Declaration, 
which included costly travel to remote areas with dispersed populations, often fell to 
indigenous peoples and their allies.  
</p>
<p>134. One of the biggest challenges identified was a lack of political will on the part of the 
States to implement the Declaration and to consider indigenous peoples&#8217; rights more 
broadly. One organization observed slow progress from the national Government in 
capturing the essence of the principles and goals of the Declaration. In some cases, there is 
also a lack of attention paid by authorities to indigenous issues or public support for 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. One indigenous peoples&#8217; organization noted challenges with 
regard to, in particular, the implementation of free, prior and informed consent. In some 
cases, lack of political will also manifests itself in a lack of legislation or public policies 
directed to indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples also expressed concern regarding a lack 
of respect for indigenous land and sea rights. 
</p>
<p>135. The principle of equity was stated as another challenge in implementing the 
Declaration, as formalistic interpretations of equality and concerns regarding special or 
differential treatment of indigenous peoples were used to excuse failures to implement it. 
</p>
<p>136. One indigenous peoples&#8217; organization noted challenges relating to a lack of 
recognition of indigenous peoples in its country. Another noted that, although recognized in 
the country in question, indigenous peoples confronted racial discrimination.  </p>


<p>137. A number of organizations expressed concerns regarding their lack of inclusion and 
participation in relevant State discussions, public affairs and political processes, including 
in processes related to laws, policies and programmes. One organization observed that the 
government was perceived to be inaccessible. It was further observed that the lack of 
inclusion of indigenous peoples in relevant discussions resulted in an avoidance of 
constructive dialogue between indigenous peoples and public authorities. Moreover, in 
some cases, there was no dialogue with indigenous peoples even where extractive industries 
activities were being carried out on indigenous lands.  
</p>
<p>138. One organization also pointed out the lack of enforcement mechanisms likely to 
engage States to abide by the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>139. Another main challenge identified was the lack of sufficient funding and resources 
for indigenous representative organizations to function effectively and so to promote the 
Declaration. Challenges relating to poor infrastructure and communications facilities were 
also noted.  
</p>
<p>140. In terms of challenges within indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations or institutions, one 
organization noted that the many pressures facing indigenous peoples and scepticism of the 
Declaration&#8217;s potential to effect change present a potential barrier to its implementation. 
Some indigenous peoples expressed scepticism over how the Declaration could solve the 
daily pressing concerns that are common in indigenous communities.   
</p>
<p><b> F. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>141. Many indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations described measures that would constitute 
best practices of the implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>142. In terms of the role of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, best practices could 
include taking initiatives to implement the Declaration by ensuring their policies, 
regulations and laws are in line with these norms, to better educate all stakeholders on the 
Declaration, and to encourage judges and lawyers to cite it in pleadings and in court. It was 
also noted that, where States lacked the will to implement the Declaration, indigenous 
peoples should take initiatives to advocate for implementation before relevant national, 
regional and international mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>143. It was also proposed that best practices regarding appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies should include education initiatives to raise awareness of the 
Declaration. Best practices also included the capacity-building of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>144. The United Nations system can work with indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations to 
provide capacity development regarding the Declaration, and to support their work and 
their participation. In this regard, the United Nations was encouraged to continue to support 
indigenous peoples&#8217; participation, including through the provision of financial assistance. 
Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations observed that the United Nations could play a 
positive role in supporting and encouraging States to recognize indigenous peoples and to 
implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>145. Best practices could also include the strengthening of links between United Nations 
institutions and grassroots communities, as well as the strengthening of support provided by 
United Nations institutions for such communities. It was also proposed that the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and relevant United Nations mechanisms 
collaborate with non-governmental organizations to better assist indigenous peoples in 
proposing measures and implementations strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>146. Recommendations were also offered to the United Nations system, including that it 
evaluate in particular indigenous peoples&#8217; issues during universal periodic review sessions.  </p>


<p>147. NNTC noted that an intensified effort to create awareness of the Declaration among 
Government officials and departments was necessary and could yield positive results in 
achieving the goals of the Declaration. As an example, the NNTC explained that the Social 
Justice Commissioner of Australia became sensitive to this standard and thus emphasized 
the importance of a collaborative partnership between the Government of Australia and 
indigenous peoples to develop a sustainable and empowering strategy that fully realizes the 
Declaration.  
</p>
<p>148. Indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations emphasized that best practices would include the 
recognition of indigenous peoples in countries where this has not yet occurred; enforcement 
of the Declaration and its inclusion in public policies; engagement in consultation processes 
with indigenous peoples on matters affecting their lives and activities; provision of support 
for the work of indigenous peoples organizations to promote the Declaration; 
demilitarization; and access to justice. CEPODRA proposed the creation in Peru of an 
intercultural committee in charge of indigenous interests.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Concluding comments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>149. <b>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples very much 
appreciates the responses of States and of indigenous peoples, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to its questionnaire, especially 
because the responses can provide inspiration to creatively devise strategies to 
implement the Declaration.   
</b></p>
<p><b> B. States 
</b></p>
<p>150. <b>The majority of responses received from States provided information at a very 
general level. In particular, there was almost no information provided indicating the 
effectiveness of the measures taken. Most States only provided positive answers to 
questions. Negative answers would also provide greater understanding of the 
challenges States face when implementing the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>151.<b> Many States identified national legislation that recognizes and protects 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, which the Expert Mechanism acknowledges as a 
significant achievement. However, States did not indicate whether there were 
sufficient administrative measures in place to ensure that the legal measures result in 
effective protection of the rights.   
</b></p>
<p>152.<b> While not explicitly stated in the responses to the questionnaire, some States 
appear to perceive there to be a struggle to balance the recognition and 
implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples as articulated in the Declaration 
and the principle of equality. Equality continues to be interpreted by some States to 
prohibit specialized programmes aimed at achieving the goals of the Declaration. The 
Expert Mechanism stresses that substantive equality can require treating indigenous 
peoples as distinct groups facing unique circumstances.  
</b></p>
<p>153. <b>Some State responses suggested a vagueness on the definition of indigenous 
peoples, including in terms of distinctions between minorities and indigenous peoples. 
Some States also indicated that indigenous peoples constituted the numerical majority 
within the State and thus did not present any concern for the recognition of their 
rights, which, in the view of the Expert Mechanism, is not always the case.   </b></p>


<p>154.<b> One challenge raised was &#8220;attempts by a few persons and NGOs to undermine 
the land titling and demarcation process by advising Indigenous peoples to claim more 
lands than they traditionally occupy, reject the process of titling and demarcation and 
or to make no request for such demarcation&#8221;. Such frustration indicates that a tension 
may exist between States and indigenous peoples and non-governmental organizations 
on the best approach to achieving the goals of the Declaration. Again, additional 
information by States on how to work through these differences to promote harmonious 
relations would greatly assist other States to continue to work towards implementation</b>. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous peoples, indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and non-
governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>155.<b> Many indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations detailed their approaches, which 
included activities at all levels, for attaining the goals of the Declaration. Most of the 
responding indigenous organizations were engaged in at least one of the following 
activities: advocacy; capacity-building, including by developing and disseminating 
resources and conducting training on the Declaration for communities, indigenous 
peoples and public authorities; conducting research regarding indigenous concerns; and 
translating the Declaration into indigenous languages.  
</b></p>
<p>156.<b> Very few organizations proposed overarching national-level strategies. 
However, some indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations are focused mainly on thematic 
issues and, as mentioned by many organizations, their institutional activities are 
generally limited due to a lack of financial resources and to deficiencies regarding the 
will of States to cooperate with indigenous peoples. Some organizations tend to 
develop articulated activities on both the national and international levels to maximize 
the impact of their strategies with respect to State implementation of the Declaration.  
</b></p>
<p>157.<b> Most of the responding indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations reported the 
integration of the Declaration&#8217;s spirit and standards within their internal guidelines, 
practices and activities. Several also noted that they are disposed to participate in local 
or national public processes when established in cooperation and good faith with 
indigenous peoples and organizations. Nevertheless, several alleged reluctance on the 
part of States to engage adequately or at all with indigenous peoples in matters that had 
impacts on them.  
</b></p>
<p>158.<b> Most organizations reported a lack of attention from the States in considering 
the Declaration and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, a lack of understanding of the 
Declaration&#8217;s status and legal value in domestic legal systems and a lack of public 
support for indigenous peoples. All these concerns prevent the full implementation of 
the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>159.<b> Relevant best practices cited included asking United Nations mechanisms to 
better assist indigenous peoples in advancing implementation strategies. Nationally 
and locally, efforts, on the part of both States and indigenous peoples, were needed to 
raise awareness regarding the Declaration. 
</b></p>
