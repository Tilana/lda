</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/21. Elaboration of international complementary 
standards to the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in 
</p>
<p>September 2001 by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
</p>
<p>Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (A/CONF.189/12 and Corr.1), 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
</p>
<p>of Racial Discrimination, proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 2106 A 
</p>
<p>(XX) of 4 January 1969, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 2200 A (XXI) of 16 December 
</p>
<p>1966, in particular article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant, which stipulates that any 
</p>
<p>advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, hostility or violence, shall be prohibited by law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of the Declaration on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, proclaimed by 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly in its resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that general recommendation No. 15 (1993) of the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on article 4 of the International Convention 
</p>
<p>stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial 
</p>
<p>superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action urged 
</p>
<p>States that had not yet done so to accede to the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as a matter of urgency, with a 
</p>
<p>view to achieving its universal ratification by 2005, to consider making the </p>

<p>declaration envisaged under article 14 thereof, and to withdraw reservations contrary 
</p>
<p>to the object and purpose of the Convention, all of which have regrettably not been 
</p>
<p>accomplished to date, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply alarmed</i> at the sharp increase in xenophobic tendencies and intolerance 
</p>
<p>towards various racial and religious groups and cultures, where people belonging to 
</p>
<p>minorities, migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal migrants are the worst 
</p>
<p>affected victims of such tendencies and acts, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i> the imperative need to find the necessary political will to 
</p>
<p>address comprehensively, by all available measures, the various forms and 
</p>
<p>manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p>and to provide adequate remedies to the victims, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006, by which, heeding the 
</p>
<p>decision and instruction of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, it decided to establish the Ad 
</p>
<p>Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration of Complementary 
</p>
<p>Standards, with the mandate to elaborate, as a matter of priority and necessity, 
</p>
<p>complementary standards in the form of either a convention or additional protocol(s) 
</p>
<p>to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, filling the existing gaps in the Convention, and also providing new 
</p>
<p>normative standards aimed at combating all forms of contemporary racism, including 
</p>
<p>incitement to racial and religious hatred, 
</p>
<p><i> Regretting </i>that the mandate of the Five Experts on Complementary Standards 
</p>
<p>was not accomplished in accordance with the requirements set out in its decision 
</p>
<p>3/103, 
</p>
<p><i> Decides</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To convene the inaugural session of the Ad Hoc Committee in the first 
</p>
<p>quarter of 2008 to commence its mandate; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To allocate no more than two days at the beginning of the inaugural 
</p>
<p>session of the Ad Hoc Committee, to reflect on all contributions and studies presented </p>

<p>by various stakeholders and the relevant mechanisms which are necessary for the 
</p>
<p>realization of its mandate.
