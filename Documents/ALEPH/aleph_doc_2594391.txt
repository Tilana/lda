Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Expressed in US dollars)
 
Note 1 – Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business
 
General
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and
note disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information
not misleading.
 
In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and reflect all adjustments,
which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial
position as of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the six month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other information disclosed in the notes to the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The results for the three
and six month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
subsequent quarter or the entire year ending December 31, 2016.
 
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015,
included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.
 
Nature of Operations
 
Bio-AMD, Inc. (“Bio-AMD” the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) (formerly known as Flex Fuels Energy, Inc. and
Malibu Minerals, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 10, 2006 to engage in the business
of exploration and discovery of gold, minerals, mineral deposits and reserves.
 
On April 15, 2011, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to
which we merged with our newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Bio-AMD, Inc., a Nevada corporation
("Merger Sub" and such merger transaction, the "Merger"). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the
separate existence of Merger Sub ceased and shareholders of the Company became shareholders of the
surviving company named Bio-AMD, Inc. As permitted by Chapter 92A.180 of Nevada Revised Statutes, the
sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of our name to Bio-AMD, Inc. to better reflect our core
business area. Upon the filing of Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of
Nevada on April 15, 2011 to effect the Merger, our Articles of Incorporation were deemed amended to reflect
the change in our corporate name.  We are quoted on OTC Markets and the OTC Bulletin Board under the
symbol “BIAD”.
 
During the fourth quarter of our 2006 fiscal year, for the purpose of diversifying our business, acquiring
capital, gaining greater access to the capital markets and with the assistance of newly acquired capital, we
entered into an Agreement with Flex Fuels Energy Limited (“FFE Ltd”) and the stockholders of FFE Ltd by
which FFE Ltd became our wholly-owned subsidiary effective on May 29, 2007. FFE Ltd engaged in the
development of the business of manufacturing and distributing Oil Seed Rape (“OSR”) products.
 
Effective September 5, 2009, after having carefully evaluated all options, we abandoned our proposed oil
seed business, as we no longer considered the business to be economically viable on either a go alone or
partnered basis.  The proposed project initiated by prior management involved building an oil seed crushing
plant at Cardiff, Wales was compromised by delays, sub-optional design and substantial legal costs.  We
were unable to raise the necessary financing, to locate a project partner, or to divest our interest in the project
for value.  Accordingly, we determined that our best course of action was to preserve value by winding down
the oil seed operations of FFE Ltd.

Table of Contents
From our inception through the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we
have not generated any revenues and have incurred significant expenses. The Company intends to fund its
development of the currency risk technology, diagnostic technology and on-going operations through equity
and/or debt financing arrangements.  However, there can be no assurance that these arrangements will be
sufficient to fund its ongoing capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements.
Consequently, our operations are subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in the establishment of a
new business enterprise.
 
WOCU Limited Acquisition
On May 1, 2009, we entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with WDX
Organisation Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and the founding
shareholders of WDX Organisation Limited (the “Founders”), the owners of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of WDX Organisation Limited.  On the same date, we entered into a related Loan Agreement (the
“Loan Agreement”) and a related Option and Funding Agreement (the “Funding Agreement”) with WDX
Organisation Limited.  The Investment Agreement, Loan Agreement and Funding Agreement are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “Agreements”. Pursuant to the Agreements, we acquired 51% ownership of
WDX Organisation Limited. WDX Organisation Limited changed its name to WOCU Limited (“WL”) effective
January 29, 2013.
WL is the developer of the WOCU technology, an algorithm and system of providing reference data for its
WOCU global currency unit, designed to mitigate currency risk. On August 14, 2009, we provided a further
£150,000 (approximately $247,800) to WL by way of a loan and have exercised certain call options. On
November 20, 2009, we loaned an additional £150,000 (approximately $249,840) to WL and increased our
equity position in WL. WL has been working to develop contracts with a variety of banks, currency exchange
networks, data providers, and derivative exchanges in an effort to commercialize its WOCU technology
through licensing agreements.
On March 8, 2010, we loaned an additional £150,000 (approximately $224,055) to WL and executed certain
call options to further increase our equity position in WL. The loans were the result of our ongoing investment
in WL as contemplated by our May 1, 2009 Investment Agreement with WL.
 
Altogether, these transactions resulted in a total loan of £600,000 (approximately $904,000) to WL and the
ownership of 93% of WL by the Company on March 8, 2010.
 
On July 23, 2010, we entered into a Subscription Agreement with WL and the founders of WL under which
we purchased 500,000 preference shares of WL (the “Preference Shares”) at a price of one British Pound per
share (approximately $750,000).   The Preference Shares earn in priority to any other class of stock of WL, a
cumulative dividend equal to 5% of the subscription price of such Preference Shares per annum. These
Preference Shares carry a preference over all other classes of WL stock in the event of a sale, liquidation or
listing of WL. Upon liquidation, sale or listing and after repayment of the outstanding loans made by us to
WL, other liabilities of WL and related transaction costs, the holder of the Preference Shares is entitled to a
payment equal to three times the subscription price (the “Preference Shares Payment”) paid for such
Preference Shares.  The Preference Shares are redeemable upon a sale, listing or winding down of WL.
The Subscription Agreement also provided for WL to allot up to an aggregate of 16,900 C Ordinary Shares of
WL to employees, directors and consultants of WL to secure their continued service to WL and incentivize
them in the performance thereof.  An aggregate of 14,061 C Ordinary Shares were issued, for nominal
consideration, to three employees and Robert Galvin, our former Chief Financial Officer on July 23, 2010.
The issuance of the 14,061 C Ordinary Shares reduced our ownership in WL from 93% to 77.54%.
Effective June 30, 2011, WL agreed with all three of its employees to terminate existing employment
agreements so as to reduce the monthly cash outflows. As a result of the termination of employment
contracts, and in accordance with the WL Articles of Association, terminated employees gave up 9,243 C
Ordinary Shares. This increased our ownership in WL to 87.13%.
During November 2011, we loaned an additional £50,000 (approximately $77,000) to WL as a short-term
unsecured intercompany loan. On July 12, 2012, it was agreed that this loan would be settled through the
issuance of 5,000,000 common shares, increasing our ownership in WL to 99.81%.

Table of Contents
Since January 2013, the Company has provided further advances totaling £196,000 (approximately
$260,000) into WL to fund its operations based on the prospective pipeline of opportunities that have been
generated.
As at June 30, 2016, there were no commercial agreements in place, and no revenues had been generated
by WL. Given the Company’s limited resources, it is unlikely that the Company can support WL operations
going forward, as a contractor to WL vital to its technical operation has indicated it is not willing to continue to
provide its services at the current much reduced rate of payment and accordingly further investment will be
required to support WL. The Company will consider any option that might preserve any value in WL.
Bio-AMD Holdings Limited Acquisition
On February 25, 2010, we entered into a Subscription and Shareholders Agreement with Bio-AMD Holdings
Limited (“Bio-AMD Holdings”), a United Kingdom company, and the managers of Bio-AMD Holdings, under
which we acquired a 63% interest in Bio-AMD Holdings for £865,000 British Pounds (approximately
$1,335,000) through the purchase of preferred shares.  The preferred shares accrue dividends at the rate of
5% per year and provide for a preference in liquidation equal to £865,000, plus accrued unpaid dividends
(the preference on a sale is £850,000, plus accrued and unpaid dividends). Bio-AMD Holdings is a
development stage company, formed in February 2010, which, through its operating subsidiary, Bio
Alternative Medical Devices Ltd. (“Bio-Medical”), principally operates in the Medical Point of Care (“POC”)
diagnostic space. Where context requires, reference to Bio-AMD Holdings also includes reference to Bio-
Medical. Bio-AMD Holdings owns a portfolio of patent applications on technologies, which it expects to
enable it to develop highly accurate, low cost, hand held electronic diagnostic devices capable of reading
certain third party assays. Since 2010 Bio-AMD Holdings has been developing its technology into three
initial product types (1) a digital strip reader targeted initially into the “over the counter” female well-being
market (including digital pregnancy, ovulation and fertility testing, (2) a blood coagulation device and (3)
early stage development work into a POC immunoassay detection system based on magnetic nanoparticle
manipulation.  In addition, Bio-AMD Holdings is working to develop various commercial relationships with
manufacturers, bio-chemistry companies and sales distributions partners to enable commercialization of its
products through licensing agreements.
 
Since January 2014, the Company has provided additional working capital by way of cash injections via
intercompany loans amounting to £100,000 (approximately $132,000) to Bio-AMD Holdings to further fund
operations. These loans are secured against the assets of Bio-AMD Holdings and its wholly owned
operating subsidiary, Bio-Medical.
Restructuring of Bio-AMD Holdings and Bio-Medical operations
On June 1, 2016, the intellectual property relating to the Company's DSR, COAG and MIDS projects (the
"IP") and depreciated physical equipment assets (together the IP, the "Assets"), formerly under the control of
Bio-AMD Holdings and Bio-Medical, were brought into the full control of Bio-AMD, Inc. under loan security
agreements put in place by the Company during 2015.
 
On June 17, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription and Shareholders' Agreement with Bio-AMD
UK Holdings Limited ("UKH"), a United Kingdom company, and the managers of UKH, under which we
acquired a 70% interest in UKH in exchange for the Assets. See exhibit 10.1.
 
UKH is a development stage company, formed in May 2009 by the Company's two principal and key
scientists formerly contracted to Holdings, Dr. Nasser Djennati and Dr. Andrew Mitchell. UKH was formerly
dormant and has never traded. Immediately prior to the transaction UKH formed a new subsidiary, MIDS
Medical Limited ("MML") as a dedicated vehicle to develop our MIDS universal immunoassay detection
technology in a joint venture, further described below. UKH has taken over the operations of Holdings and
Bio-Medical.
 
The 30% of UKH not owned by the Company is owned by Dr. Nasser Djennati (15%) and Dr. Andrew
Mitchell (15%), whose experience and qualifications were reported on Form 8K filed on March 3, 2010. The
board of directors of both UKH and MML consists of Drs. Djennati and Mitchell, and Mr Barr, the Company's
CEO.
 
The effect of the restructuring was to beneficially increase the Company's interest in its UK medical
operations from 63% to 70%, to simplify and gain better voting control of its UK subsidiaries, and to eliminate
two employee profit share arrangements.

As a result of the incremental increase in the ownership of the Assets, the Company recorded a charge to
Additional Paid-in Capital and the Non-controlling Interest of $12,513. The amount represents the
Company’s additional interest in the net book value of the group of Assets determined by voting control.
MIDS Medical Limited Operations
On June 20, 2016, the Company and its UKH and MML subsidiaries entered into a joint venture by way of a
Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“Agreement”) with a third party medical detection device
developer (“Partner”) a Nevada corporation, under which the Partner, in exchange for its participation and
funding to support MML during a Phase 1 development, owns a 40% interest in MML as of July 1, 2016, The
Partner also prospectively agreed to fund a Phase 2 development of our MIDS universal immunoassay
detection technology within the MML vehicle. MML will have the right to use the MIDS Intellectual Property
(“MIDS IP”) under license during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event
that MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party. See exhibit 10.2.
The Agreement provides for a series of payments (“Phase 1 Payments”) in an aggregate amount of £450,500
(approximately $650,000 based on the current rate of exchange). The Partner made a Phase 1 Payment to
MML, of $130,000 (the “First Payment”), which was received on August 2, 2016 and converted to £92,857.
Subsequent Phase 1 Payments are expected to be received as follows; (a) on or before September 20,
2016, a payment £106,093, (b) on or before November 20, 2016, a payment of £100,640; (c) on or before
January 20, 2017 a payment of £100,640; and (d) on or before March 20, 2016 a payment of £50,320.
The Agreement also provides for a contingency funding (“Contingency”) to be made available by the Partner
after March 31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to £45,000 (approximately $64,000) to be paid by the
Partner within 20 days of receiving a written notice from  MML.
The parties to the Agreement envisage a second phase of development (“Phase 2”) to follow Phase 1. This
is expected to be broadly over a similar timeframe and at a similar cost. MML may independently obtain
funding for Phase 2 at MML’s option, or invite the Partner to fund.
The Agreement contains various provisions to govern the funding obligations of the Partner: if any Phase 1
Payment is not made within 14 days of it falling due (“Default”), the Partner’s shareholding in MML may be
reduced to zero; if no Contingency is drawn during Phase 1, UKH will be awarded an enduring 2.5% profit
after tax right in MML (“Override”) which will increase to a 15% Override if the Partner declines to fund Phase
2; if the Partner declines to fund Phase 2 and any Contingency has been drawn, UKH will be awarded a
15% Override decreased by 0.5% for each £7,500 tranche of Contingency drawn down during Phase 1. Any
Override will convert pro rata into ordinary shares in the event of a sale of MML.
Provided that each Phase 1 Payment is made within 14 days of falling due, the Partner also has additional
control rights over MML, including representation on the MML board of directors, rights over the appointment
and employment of senior management persons, indebtedness, major transactions, budget approval rights,
accounting practices and general operational management supervisory rights.
As a condition of the Agreement, MML has entered into Supply of Services Agreements under which it
receives the services of Drs. Djennati and Mitchell, being key personnel related to the MIDS development.
Initial development project planning has commenced on the MIDS project, including the specification of a
bench rig printed circuit board designed to support first stage testing of a sample of Hall Effect Sensors
already supplied to MML in order to examine their behavior in the detection of magnetic nanoparticles – the
core MIDS technology – and to determine how these Hall Effect Sensors should be optimized prior to
integration in a micro fluidic test strip.
The Company has agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”), to prospectively issue
3,000,000 five year warrants in the Company exercisable at $0.10, to certain third parties (or their nominees)
who have introduced the Partner to the Company (“Introducer Warrants”). The Warrant Agreement provides
for the Introducer Warrants to be issued at the discretion of the Company at any time up to MML receiving the
final Phase 1 Payment, and may not be exercised prior to June 15, 2017. In the event the Phase 1 Payments
are not made in full, the Company will have the right to cancel the issuance of the Introducer Warrants, or to
negotiate revised terms, at the Company’s sole option. No other fees have been paid in regard to the
Agreement. See exhibit 4.1.

Going Concern
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business.  The Company has not commenced its planned principal operations. As shown in the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has not generated
any revenue and has incurred recurring losses through June 30, 2016.  Additionally, the Company has
recurring negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of $41,384,326 as at June 30,
2016.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
  
The Company's ability to continue its existence is dependent upon commencing its planned operations,
management's ability to develop and achieve profitable operations and/or upon obtaining additional
financing to carry out its planned business. The Company intends to fund the development of its diagnostic
technology and on-going operations through equity and debt financing arrangements.  However, there can
be no assurance that these arrangements will be sufficient to fund its ongoing capital expenditures, working
capital, and other cash requirements.  The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time.
There can be no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory
terms and conditions, if at all.  In the event we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may elect or be
required to seek protection from our creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to
an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not considered this alternative.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Principles of consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bio-AMD, Inc., WOCU
Limited (a 99.81% owned subsidiary as of June 30, 2016), Bio-AMD Holdings Limited (a 63% owned
subsidiary as of June 30, 2016), along with Bio-AMD Holdings Limited’s wholly owned subsidiary Bio-
Medical, and Bio-AMD UK Holdings Limited (a 70% owned subsidiary effective June 30, 2016), along with
its then wholly owned subsidiary MIDS Medical Limited. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  
 
The third party ownerships of 0.19% of WL, 37% of Bio-AMD Holdings, and 30% of UKH are recorded as
non-controlling interests in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Patents
Patents are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of patent applications on
technologies which the Company expects to enable it to develop highly accurate, low cost, hand held
electronic diagnostic devices capable of reading third party assays. The patents are amortized straight-line
over the estimated useful life but not to exceed 17 years.
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, no significant Company obligations remain, collection of the related receivable is
reasonably assured, and the fees are fixed or determinable. The Company acts as a principal in its revenue
transactions as it is the primary obligor in the transactions.
12
Table of Contents
Deferred Revenue and Deferred Costs
The Company defers revenue on contracts which contain a performance commitment until such time as the
services have been completed and no significant Company obligations remain.
The costs associated with contracts for which revenue is deferred, including personnel costs and
incremental contract costs, are initially capitalized as deferred costs. Subsequently these costs are
recognized as a component of cost of revenue when the associated revenue is recognized.
In May 2016, the Company received formal written notice of termination of its Master Agreement with Sysmex
Corporation (“Sysmex”) in a letter dated April 22, 2016. As a result of the termination, the Company has no
further obligations with respect to the research agreement and related funding received.  Due to the
unexpected termination by Sysmex, the Company recorded a gain from the contract termination of $248,074.
Foreign currency translation
The Company's reporting and functional currency is US Dollars. The accounts of the Company's 99.81%
owned subsidiary, WL, and the Company's 63% owned subsidiary, Bio-AMD Holdings, and Bio-AMD
Holdings' wholly owned subsidiary, Bio-Medical, and the Company's 70% owned subsidiary UKH and its
wholly owned subsidiary MML, are maintained using the local currency (Great British Pounds) as the
functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into US Dollars at the balance sheet date, equity
is translated at historical rates, and revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year or the reporting period. The translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other
comprehensive income.  Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations.
The relevant translation rates are as follows: For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 closing rate at
1.3242 US$:GBP, average rate at 1.4319 US$:GBP and for the six month period ended June 30, 2015
closing rate at 1.5717 US$:GBP, average rate at 1.5233 US$:GBP.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis, which is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal
entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized
debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). The ASU
focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from
four to two, the new standard simplifies the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and improves current
US GAAP by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest,
reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial
interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and changing consolidation conclusions for companies in several
industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU
2015-02 did not have any effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40)". ASU 2014-15 provides guidance related to management's responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016,
and for interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of
ASU 2014-15 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target
Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.” This ASU requires that a performance target that
affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have any effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
13
Table of Contents
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”
ASU 2014-09 affects any entity using US GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer
goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are
within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). ASU 2014-09 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are still
evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09. On April 1, 2015, the FASB voted to propose to defer
the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year.
Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the SEC did not or are not believed by
management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial
statements.

Bio-AMD currently has eight patent applications covering its three proprietary technology platforms, the
Company having elected to abandon one redundant patent relating to DSR which was due for renewal in
April 2016 (other patents relating to DSR are being maintained). We continue to review our intellectual
property strategy with the intention of sufficiently protecting our key intangible assets, and that any new IP
generated is reviewed as far as possible to optimize the novel nature of the IP and freedom to operate in key
jurisdictions.
 
In June 2015, Bio AMD Holdings Limited received a grant of U.S. patent dated June 2, 2015, under U.S.
Patent No. US 9,046,512 protecting twenty one claims central to the Company’s microfluidic strip and reader
technology designed to test PT/INR by a POC device.
In January 2016, the Company received a grant of patent from the State Intellectual Property Office of the
People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) for our MIDS technology. The Company has made similar MIDS
technology patent applications in the U.K. and in more than 145 Contracting States under the international
Patent Cooperation Treaty, and separately in the USA, the European Union and India.
In March 2016, the Company received notice of grant of patent from the State Intellectual Property Office of
the PRC relating to our microfluidic strip and reader technology designed to test PT/INR by a POC device.
 
Note 4 – Related Party Transactions
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we paid $nil (2015 - $49,156), to The ARM Partnership
(“ARM”), a partnership in which Robert Galvin, our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer is a partner,
for services provided to us by Mr. Galvin in all capacities. During the six month period ended June 30, 2016,
we paid an aggregate of $10,030 (2015 - $99,319) to ARM. Mr. Galvin owns 12.33% of the outstanding share
capital of Bio-AMD Holdings. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company paid $nil
(2015 - $11,500 (£7,500)) for the use of ARM’s offices in central London located at 3rd Floor, 14 South
Molton Street, London, UK. The rental expense was set at £500 per month for Bio-AMD Inc. (approximately
$760), this ceased on July 31, 2015 and £750 per month for Bio-AMD Holdings (approximately $1,150),
reduced to £500 (approximately $760) for each of the months of August and September 2015, and which
ceased in October, 2015.
 
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, we paid an aggregate of $24,138 (2015 - $36,461) to
Thomas Barr, our Chief Executive Officer, for services provided to us by Mr. Barr in all capacities.  During the
six month periods ended June 30, 2016, we paid an aggregate of $59,290 (2015 - $72,351) to Mr. Barr.
14
Table of Contents
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, we paid an aggregate of $15,733 (2015 - $23,614) to
David Miller, our Chief Financial Officer, for services provided to us by Mr. Miller in all capacities. During the
six month period ended June 30, 2016, we paid an aggregate of $38,563 (2015 - $46,988) to Mr. Miller.
 
Note 5 – Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue consists of funds received in advance of services being performed. The Company’s
revenue recognition policy dictates that revenues will be recognized when the services have been
completed and no significant Company obligations remain. As at June 30, 2016, the Company had $nil
(December 31, 2015 - $950,402 (£642,077)) of deferred revenues.
The costs directly associated with the performance of services for which revenue has been deferred are
initially capitalized as deferred costs. These costs will be recognized as a component of cost of revenue
when the associated revenue is recognized.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had $nil (December 31, 2015 - $645,534 (£436,113)) of deferred costs.
In May 2016, the Company received notice of termination of its Master Agreement with Sysmex. Upon
receiving notice, management has determined that the Company has no further material obligations under
the research agreement. The net difference between the deferred revenues and deferred costs of $248,074
has been recognized as a gain on termination of research agreement in the statement of operations.
 
Note 6 – Segmented Information
We currently operate in two segments: 1) the development of a technology designed to mitigate currency risk
through our 99.81% owned subsidiary, WL as of June 30, 2016, and 2) the development of highly accurate,
low cost, hand held, electronic medical diagnostic devices capable of reading third party assays through our
63% and 70% owned subsidiaries, Bio-AMD Holdings and Bio-AMD UK Holdings Limited, respectively.

Note 7 – Subsequent Event and Commitment
As previously described in Note 1, effective July 1, 2016, the Company has formed a joint venture agreement
for the Phase 1 development of MIDS technological application.
 
The Company has agreed, to prospectively issue 3,000,000 five year warrants in the Company exercisable
at $0.10 per share, to certain third parties (or their nominees) who have introduced the joint venture partner to
the Company. The warrants may  be issued at any time up to MML receiving the final Phase 1 Payment and
they may not be exercised prior to June 15, 2017.
Management evaluated all activities of the Company through the issuance date of the Company's interim
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and concluded that no further subsequent events
have occurred that would require adjustments or disclosure into the interim unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding our financial position, estimated working capital,
business strategy, the plans and objectives of our management for future operations and those statements
preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believe”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “intends”,
“estimates”, “projects”, “target”, “goal”, “plans”, “objective”, “should”, or similar expressions or variations on
such expressions are forward-looking statements. We can give no assurances that the assumptions upon
which the forward-looking statements are based will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. There are many risks, uncertainties and other important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including, but not
limited to, the availability and pricing of additional capital to finance operations.
 
Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we disclaim any obligations or undertaking to
publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events,
conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
 
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Malibu Minerals, Inc. on March 10, 2006, to
engage in the business of exploration and discovery of gold, minerals, mineral deposits and reserves. On
July 6, 2007 we changed our name to Flex Fuels Energy, Inc. through a merger effected for that sole
purpose. On April 15, 2011 we changed our name to Bio-AMD, Inc. through a merger effected for that sole
purpose. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we acquired a 15% interest in Flex Fuels Energy Limited (“FFE
Ltd.”). In May 2007 we completed the acquisition of the remaining 85% of FFE Ltd., making FFE Ltd. a wholly
owned subsidiary of ours.  FFE Ltd. was formed on November 26, 2006 under the laws of England and
Wales to engage in the business of manufacturing and distributing Oil Seed Rape (“OSR”) products.
Effective September 5, 2009, we determined to abandon FFE Ltd.’s proposed OSR business and related
projects as we no longer considered the business to be economically viable on either a go alone or
partnered basis. FFE Ltd was dissolved in February 2011 and the final winding down accounting transaction
took place in May 2011.
 
On May 1, 2009 we acquired stock of WDX Organisation Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws
of England and Wales representing a 51% interest in the company. WDX Organisation Limited changed its
name to WOCU Limited (“WL”) effective January 29, 2013. Since May 1, 2009, we have acquired additional
stock of WL and since July 12, 2012 we have owned 99.81% of WL making it a majority owned subsidiary of
ours. WL is the developer of a technology designed to mitigate currency risk.
 
On February 25, 2010, we entered into a Subscription and Shareholders Agreement with Bio AMD Holdings
Limited (“Bio-AMD”), a UK limited company, and the managers of Bio-AMD, under which we acquired 63% of
the fully diluted equity in Bio-AMD for £865,000 GBP (approximately $1,287,000 at the time of purchase).
Bio-AMD is a technology company focused in the rapidly expanding medical diagnostic Point Of Care
(“POC”) market. Bio-AMD currently has eight patent applications pending or granted covering its three
technology platforms.
Restructuring of Bio-AMD Holdings and Bio-Medical operations
On June 1, 2016 the intellectual property relating to the Company’s DSR, COAG and MIDS projects (the “IP”)
and depreciated physical equipment assets (together the “Assets”), formerly under the control of Bio-AMD
Holdings and Bio-Medical, into the full control of Bio-AMD, Inc. as a result of the loan security put in place by
the Company during 2015.
17
Table of Contents
On June 17, 2016 the Company entered into a Subscription and Shareholders' Agreement with Bio-AMD UK
Holdings Limited ("UKH"), a United Kingdom company, and the managers of UKH, under which we acquired
a 70% interest in UKH in exchange for the Assets.
UKH is a development stage company, formed in May 2009 by the Company's two principal and key
scientists formerly contracted to Holdings, Dr. Nasser Djennati and Dr. Andrew Mitchell. UKH was formerly
dormant and has never traded. Immediately prior to the transaction UKH formed a new subsidiary, MIDS
Medical Limited ("MML") as a dedicated vehicle to develop our MIDS universal immunoassay detection
technology in a joint venture, further described below. UKH has taken over the operations of Holdings and
Bio-Medical.
 
The 30% of UKH not owned by the Company is owned by Dr. Nasser Djennati (15%) and Dr. Andrew
Mitchell (15%). The board of directors of both UKH and MML consists of Drs. Djennati and Mitchell, and Mr
Barr, the Company's CEO.
 
The effect of the restructuring was to beneficially increase the Company's interest in its UK operations from
63% to 70%, to simplify and gain better voting control of its UK subsidiaries, and to eliminate two employee
profit share arrangements.
 
MIDS Medical Limited Operations
 
On June 20, 2016 the Company and its UKH and MML subsidiaries entered into a joint venture by way of a
Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“Agreement”) with a third party medical detection device
developer (“Partner”) a Nevada corporation, under which the Partner, in exchange for its participation and
funding to support MML during a Phase 1 development, owns a 40% interest in MML as of July 1, 2016, The
Partner also prospectively agreed to fund a Phase 2 development of our MIDS universal immunoassay
detection technology within the MML vehicle. MML will have the right to use the MIDS Intellectual Property
(“MIDS IP”) under license during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event
that MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party.
 
The Agreement provides for a series of payments (“Phase 1 Payments”) in an aggregate amount of £450,500
(approximately $597,000 based on the current rate of exchange).
 
Business Overview
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we were engaged in the following sectors:
·developing our POC medical diagnostic business; and
·developing our currency risk mitigation business.
Operations - Medical
The trend toward greater POC testing is driven by the faster diagnostic benefits it provides.  Other reasons
have also emerged for the high demand of POC testing, including clinical staff shortages, an ageing
population, long-term healthcare cost savings and a decrease in reliance on conventional laboratory
services.

We believe that Bio-AMD is an innovator in the field of diagnostic sensor technology, with the attributes of its
technology platform fitting well with these key trends:
·           A disposable micro-fluidic test strip which has been adapted to measure prothrombin time (PT/INR)
and designed to be capable of performing additional coagulation related tests such as APTT and DTI,
through a POC blood coagulation monitoring device (“COAG”) enabling patient based, anticoagulant drug
therapy monitoring;
·           A Digital Strip Reader (“DSR”) able to read a wide variety of lateral flow based immunoassay
diagnostic test strips already in the POC market including, but not limited to, cardiac markers, infectious
diseases, drugs of abuse and female wellbeing (pregnancy/ovulation testing) to provide semi-quantitative
results; and
·           A disposable test strip combining micro-fluidics and ‘lab-on-chip’ technology providing fully
quantitative measurement into a highly sensitive and accurate immunoassay POC platform that detects
nanoparticles through magnetic manipulation using a novel magnetic and optical double detection technique
– Magnetic Immunoassay Detection System (“MIDS”).
COAG
Bio-AMD’s micro-fluidic strip technology has been applied for use in a POC hand-held device to detect
prothrombin time (“PT”)/International Normalized Ratio (“INR”), or the speed of blood coagulation. In 2013,
the POC coagulation market for PT/INR measurement was estimated to be worth approximately US$870
million globally and projected to grow to an estimated US$1.1 billion by 2017.  Market growth is driven by the
rising number of patients using anti-coagulation therapy, growing clinical evidence supporting the use of
such testing and strong patient demand for patient self-testing. The market is dominated by a small number
of major players including Alere, Roche, Siemens and Philips who have either developed products internally
or have acquired exclusive rights to license appropriate technologies from smaller companies.  Patients with
cardiac problems are often on life-long oral anticoagulation therapy, for example Warfarin. Frequent testing
and careful monitoring of the PT/INR or blood coagulation to regulate the doses of anticoagulation therapy is
a necessity.  A patient taking too much anticoagulant is at risk of serious bleeding events and if too little is
taken they may be at risk of thrombosis.   PT/INR measurement products currently in the market are often
cited as being expensive and complicated to use.
Bio-AMD has established a design that allows for low cost manufacture of the disposable strip whilst
ensuring scalability and repeatability.  We have performed extensive in-house bench tests at our laboratory
and further tested in an initial hospital study producing comparable results to the current ‘best in market’
devices, which we believe validates the feasibility of our design.
In late 2013, we filed a patent application for a multi-chamber microfluidic strip design, incorporating a novel
locking mechanism that allows for the control of fluid flow through the strip.  In addition to being able to test
for PT/INR which requires the presence of a single reagent in the immunoassay testing process this
enhanced strip design enables additional coagulation based tests requiring the use of multiple reagents in
the immunoassay process, e.g. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (“APTT”), a laboratory based test
used to measure the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors.
In June 2015 we received notice of the grant of a U.S. patent dated June 2, 2015, under U.S. Patent No. US
9,046,512 protecting twenty one claims central to the Company’s microfluidic strip and reader technology
designed to test PT/INR by a POC device.
 
We plan to apply the new strip design to multiple, different coagulation specific tests utilizing a common hand
held reader device to display the results.  For example, a clinician testing for PT/INR would use a specific
PT/INR strip and record the result from the reader. The clinician would then be able to test for APTT using a
separate APTT specific strip using the same reader device. The test strips would use a common plastic
component design, which we believe will reduce overall production costs.
 
Launching a product into the coagulation market that incorporates our COAG technology will require us to
partner with a much larger, suitable business with the requisite capital resources and skills including
distribution and sales channels, and ideally global marketing expertise in sectors such as hematology and
immunochemistry.  Our strategy for commercialization of COAG has centered on attracting a suitable partner
that fits this profile, and which is keen to add coagulation based POC system to its existing product line.

On December 17, 2014, Bio-Medical entered into a Master Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Sysmex
Corporation (“Sysmex”) pursuant to which the parties planned to jointly conduct a feasibility study (the
“Study”) for the potential development of our POC COAG system including a reader device with disposable
test strips for PT-INR assays and potentially new future assays in the field of hemostasis (the “Products’).  An
expense advance of £642,067 (approximately $980,000) was made to Bio-Medical by Sysmex in 2015. The
Study, we believe, was successfully completed and the preliminary results were presented to Sysmex in late
2015. Notwithstanding the conclusions of the Study, Sysmex decided in April 2016 to discontinue funding
the Study and indicated that it would not proceed with it in the future. No new intellectual property was
developed during the Study and the temporary research license granted to Sysmex by the Company to use
the Company’s intellectual property has been automatically terminated.
 
The Company believes that its COAG technology is now well advanced and performs better than expected
when compared to gold standard lab analyzers and the market-dominant POC PT/INR self-test device,
CoaguChekXS. The Company believes that COAG broadly matches the accuracy performance of those
tests even in an un-optimized device. Our data suggest that a finalized, optimized COAG device is expected
to be a leader on POC accuracy, with a sub 5% coefficient of variance, in an environment where the FDA is
seeking higher PT/INR self-test accuracy requirements. We believe that COAG has been proven to operate
on a patient-friendly, minimal 5 microliter pin prick blood sample, which is materially smaller than any other
device available in the market. Accordingly the Company believes that COAG will be of interest to major
POC providers.
We are in the process of contacting and exchanging information with major medical companies with a view
to obtaining a new development deal for COAG. Whilst we have received some interest there can be no
assurance that we will enter into any new agreement to jointly develop COAG or to otherwise commercialize
COAG.
DSR
The DSR technology platform utilizes a patented proprietary method for reading and quantifying traditional
chromatography based, nitro-cellulose, lateral-flow immunoassay tests, centered on what we believe to be a
unique optical sensor arrangement.  The DSR technology comprises a proprietary design incorporating
sensors, diagnostics, display and power management capabilities.  We believe that a key feature of the DSR
technology is that its platform can be adapted and applied to numerous and disparate lateral flow diagnostic
tests.
 
Bio-AMD has created designs for both single and multi-test versions of the DSR hand-held reader device
and laboratory based bench tests have been performed by us in our premises using a variety of third party
lateral flow strips.  The DSR device is designed to be fully disposable and can be powered by solar power
cells, although traditional battery power sources can also be used.  Our multi-test device utilizes a
replaceable cap system in which a new test strip is fitted, thereby enabling the hand-held reader to be used
multiple times for the same test.  By way of example, existing over the counter (“OTC”) home fertility testing
packs normally contain up to 20 separate identical tests; for this fertility application our device would require
just one reader device with 20 caps, each cap containing the test strip, thereby reducing the number of
component parts and manufacturing cost.
The market for female well-being, which includes digital home pregnancy and fertility testing, was estimated
to be worth approximately $1.5 billion globally in 2012.  Whilst the market for pregnancy testing is very
competitive and dominated by a small number of large global brands e.g. Clearblue, Predictor and First
Response, in several regions, particularly Asia, there is demonstrated demand from local distributors for
OEM produced digital pregnancy test kits (“PTK”), the key factors being price and marketability by way of
unique product features. Options for DSR might include creating our own branded and/or OEM digital
pregnancy testing kit, or partnering with a qualified distributor aiming to launch a branded product into the
region.  This will entail our finalizing a product manufacturing design file and obtaining appropriate territorial
regulatory approval specifically for the Asian market. Such a strategy will require additional capital, which we
cannot guarantee would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
 
We have also been exploring, at an early stage, the potential to add value to diagnostic screening
campaigns led by the National Health Service (“NHS”) in the UK.

MIDS
Demand is increasing for POC tests that can detect very low concentrations of a target analyte and to
quantify the result.  Current lateral flow based immunoassays can detect analyte at high levels of
concentration.  However, at low concentration levels, the assay system requires amplification either of the
signal or the target, which will typically increase the complexity and the costs of the testing device. 
Consequently, current POC tests remain largely unreliable for targets that require quantification.
We believe there to be an opportunity to develop a universal immunoassay based POC testing system
which:
●
●
Is capable of detecting biomarkers at a nanoparticle level, providing fully quantitative measurement of
results i.e. giving a numerical value for each biomarker detected and not just an indication on whether a
specified biomarker is actually present,
●Is capable of multiplexing i.e. performing multiple types of test from the same sample,
●Provides full connectivity and networking for collection, storage and transfer of data and results,
●Displays test results in minutes (less than 8 minutes for a panel of up to 3 tests),
●Requires a finger prick sample size for a single test,
●Utilizes a handheld reader and single disposable cartridge designed to be operated by a minimally trained
person, requiring modest manual operation, other than for sample collection,
Contains all necessary reagents and where all steps are automated into an integrated encompassing pre-
treatment, analyte specific reaction, signal production, signal reaction and final result: from sample to result
in one step,
●Can be adapted to perform different immunoassays for testing in areas such as infectious diseases, drugs
of abuse or oncology, especially where rapid diagnosis is critical, and
●Has a simple system design, requiring minimal direct input costs and inline manufacturing processes to
keep unit costs as low as possible.
 
The technology will incorporate what we believe to be a novel microfluidic strip design, magnetic
nanoparticle manipulation and a unique double detection technique using bespoke ‘Hall Effect’ sensors and
bespoke optical sensor which, when combined, will increase significantly the sensitivity and accuracy of the
result.  We are not aware that this method is being used in products currently being offered in the market or in
development.
We plan to develop the immunoassay platform initially for the high sensitivity cardiac marker POC testing
market, which are measured to evaluate heart function.  Cardiac markers are used in the diagnosis and risk
stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome.  The detection of these
markers is used to diagnose myocardial infarction and its severity, typically troponin (cTnI or cTnT),
myoglobin and Creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB). Our ultimate aim is to commercialize a product for
the multiple cardiac marker testing market which was estimated by BCC Research to be worth US $1.3
billion globally in 2013 (including device, reagent and supply sales), and is expected to grow to $2.4 billion
by 2018.
Additionally, we envisage the technology platform to be adaptable and be extended into new test areas, e.g.
infectious diseases, drugs of abuse and oncology; having potential to expand into a multifunctional device,
i.e. one analyzer using different strips for different tests; and can be introduced into high growth areas such
as companion diagnostics (where POC devices are used to optimize the personalized dosage of a
therapeutic drug).
We believe that our MIDS technology has considerable potential to create a next generation of POC test
devices. Our proposed method aims to bring together biology, chemistry, nano-fluidics, and electronics and,
'lab-on-chip' technology together into what we believe can be unique, economically viable products.
To date some very early stage work has been completed in conjunction with the Science, Technology and
Facilities Council, one of Europe’s largest independent scientific research public body organizations in-part
funded by the UK Government. .  In April 2011 we made an initial patent application for the technology and in
October 2012 we entered into the national phase stage, making applications in Europe, US, India and China,
with a Chinese patent being granted in March 2016

On June 20, 2016 the Company and its UKH and MML subsidiaries entered into a joint venture by way of a
Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“Agreement”) with a third party medical detection device
developer (“Partner”) a Nevada corporation, under which the Partner, in exchange for its participation and
funding to support MML during a Phase 1 development, owns a 40% interest in MML as of July 1, 2016, The
Partner also prospectively agreed to fund a Phase 2 development of our MIDS universal immunoassay
detection technology within the MML vehicle. The Agreement provides for a series of payments (“Phase 1
Payments”) in an aggregate amount of £450,500 (approximately $596,500 based on the current rate of
exchange).
Initial development project planning has commenced on the MIDS project, including the specification of a
bench rig printed circuit board designed to support first stage testing of a sample of Hall Effect Sensors
already supplied to MML in order to examine their behavior in the detection of magnetic nanoparticles – the
core MIDS technology – and to determine how these Hall Effect Sensors should be optimized prior to
integration in a micro fluidic test strip.
Since January 2014, the Company has provided additional working capital by way of cash injections via
intercompany loans amounting to £100,000 (approximately $133,000) to Bio-AMD Holdings to further fund
operations. These loans were secured against the assets of Bio-AMD Holdings and its wholly owned
operating subsidiary, Bio Medical. These assets have now been transferred to UKH as a result of the
security.
To date, no revenues had been generated by Bio-AMD Holdings or UKH. 
Operations - WL - Currency Risk Mitigating Business
WL is the creator of a proprietary algorithm that produces a global currency derivative quotation known as the
WOCU®.  The WOCU can be applied to financial products provided by third parties such as index structure
products, exchange traded funds or derivate contracts, with a view to mitigating any currency risk inherent
within those products. The WOCU algorithm was completed in June 2009, with further work including back-
testing using historical foreign exchange data, to prove the attributes of the WOCU design, taking place
throughout 2010 until the WOCU’s launch late that year.  Since that time, the WL management team has
sought to achieve licensing deals with a variety of financial institutions that are seeking to create financial
products denominated in WOCU.
The WOCU’s generally low volatility against fiat currencies offers huge commercial advantages as a unit of
account for the denomination of world trade, compared to the status quo of cross border trade denominated
in fiat currency pairs, or in US Dollars.  Transactions across currencies (except in isolated cases where one
exchange rate is “pegged” to the other) inevitably involve potential foreign exchange risk caused by
movements in exchange rates. The advantage of denominating a transaction involving foreign exchange in
WOCU’s is that can lower the foreign exchange (“FX”) volatility as compared to traditional exchange rate
pairs.
The WOCU, subject to the achievement of the WL corporate strategy and business model described below,
is expected to have application to:
 
·           Multinational corporate treasury operations;
·           Reference pricing for general global trade;
·           Reference pricing for currency, fixing, including virtual, online currencies;
·           Commodity pricing and trade;
·           Currency balanced savings accounts;
·           Fund management, including Exchange Traded Funds;
·           FX and derivative trading and speculation;
·           Global index calculations; and
Reserve ratio applications (similar to the IMF’s Special Drawing Right or SDR).

Table of Contents
The WOCU’s apolitical, bank-independent, transparent, instant availability and universal nature are believed
to be a key differentiator compared to alternative methods of hedging against currency risk.
 
The WOCU quotation is calculated and published by WL as daily and hourly fixed reference prices for a total
of 169 fiat currencies, digital currencies and commodities. In addition WOCU Foreign Exchange (“FX”) 1, 2,
3, 6, 9 and 12 month Forward quotations will be produced by WL against the USD, from which a Forward
WOCU rate can be calculated for any currency for which Forward rates are currently quoted, plus WOCU
Interest Rate forward quotations covering the Overnight 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month money market periods.
The WOCU reference price is fixed daily at 16:00 UTC against all major currencies and is also available as
an hourly reference price, from 00:00 Monday to 23:00 Friday, and as hourly price captures for gold, silver
and oil.
 
The WOCU quotation is available (non-exclusively) from WL’s re-seller Interactive Data Corporation (“IDC”)
via its data terminals and data feeds under the ticker symbol XCU. IDC currently calculates and offers
quotations for 47 WOCU based currency pairs, and 6 commodities, as cross rates and supplies a stand-
alone WOCU real-time charting package application via IDC’s PrimePortal™ application. WOCU rates are
also available on the professional Thompson Reuters platform and on the UK’s leading retail price data
platform ADVFN.
 
The WOCU quotation is also available via a mobile application for Apple mobile devices known as “WOCU”.
This application supports five languages; English, simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Japanese and
Korean.  The WOCU quotation is also available as an hourly reference price available directly from WL by
RSS feed, e-mail and via WL’s FTP server. The WOCU quotation as an hourly updated price is also
available from the Company’s corporate website www.wocu.com
WL has established relationships with a number of individuals and organizations authorized to serve as
introducing agents ("IAs") to the WL business, charged with identifying suitable prospects that fit the WL
target profile.   These IAs are remunerated purely on a contingent basis linked only to successful results and
each IA generally is responsible for its own expenses. The exact terms of any IA arrangement is agreed
between WL and the IA on a case by case basis.  IAs are chosen based on their experience and knowledge
of the financial markets and their deep contact network. To date six such IAs have been appointed.
 
Since January 2013, the Company has provided further advances totaling £196,000 (approximately
$260,000) into WL to fund its anticipated operations based on the prospective pipeline of opportunities that
have been generated.
WL has not achieved any operating revenues to date and does not expect to achieve operating revenues
until such time, if ever, that the WOCU is successfully marketed.
Given the Company’s limited resources, it is unlikely that the Company can support WL operations going
forward, as a contractor to WL vital to its technical operation has indicated it is not willing to continue to
provide its services at the current much reduced rate of payment and accordingly further investment will be
required to support WL. The Company will consider any option that might preserve any value in WL.

(1)           Consulting expenses decreased by $21,678 to $74,343 for the three month period ended June 30,
2016, compared to $96,021 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and decreased by $51,549 to
$174,505 for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $226,054 for the six month period
ended June 30, 2015. Consulting expenses includes consultants engaged with the management and
administration of the Company utilized in the course of our operations and those of our subsidiaries. These
officers/consultants have recently received a reduced fee which commenced at the beginning of March
2016.  However the majority of the decrease was primarily due to certain consulting costs initially capitalized
as deferred costs and which are directly associated with the performance of services for which revenue has
been previously deferred. These costs have been netted in the gain on termination of research agreement
due to the termination of the Master Agreement by Sysmex.
   
(2)           Legal fees increased by $185 from $5,780 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 to
$5,965 for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 and increased by $208 to $6,483 for the six month
period ended June 30, 2016 from $6,275 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. We continue to
monitor all advisor related expenditure to ensure maximum value at minimal cost
 
(3)           Professional fees comprised primarily of audit and financial compliance related costs, decreased by
$3,331 from $9,369 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 to $6,038 for the three month period
ended June 30, 2016 and decreased by $42,332 from $72,389 for the six month period ended June 30, 2016
to $30,057 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. The reduction was primarily due to a change of
auditor.
 
(4)           Rent, Office related, Telecoms and Travel expense was $6,993 for the three month period ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $25,245 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and was $21,576 for
the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $46,445 for the six month period ended June 30,
2015. The decrease of $24,869 for the six month period ended June 2016 can mainly be attributed to a
decrease in rent expense incurred in Bio-AMD and a decrease in travel expenses in Bio-Medical.
(5)           Stock-based compensation was $nil for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to
$199,000 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and was $nil for the six month period ended June
30, 2016 compared to $208,000 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. The decrease of $208,000 for
the six month period ended June 2016 can mainly be attributed to that fact the Company did not issue any
stock-based compensation during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 whereas the Company issued
1,150,000 restricted shares of common stock with a fair value of $184,000 in relation to a consulting
agreement dated June 9, 2015 as well as recognizing $24,000 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015
in relation to 300,000 restricted shares of stock options issued for investor relationship services provided to
the Company over a period of twelve months.
Revenues
 
We have not generated any revenues from operations for the three and six month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015.
 
Other Income
 
We recorded other income during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 of $248,564 and
$249,036, respectively, as compared to $731 and $1,524 for the three and six month periods ended June 30,
2015, respectively.  The increase in other income over the three and six month periods relates to a $248,074
gain on termination of research agreement due to the termination of the Master Agreement by Sysmex.

Net Losses
We generated net income in the amount of $144,171 and a net loss of $8,558 ($0.00 and ($0.00) per share)
for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to a net loss of
$354,132 and $576,972 (($0.01) and ($0.01) per share) for the three and six month periods ended June 30,
2015, respectively, for the reasons discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We have limited cash reserves and may need substantial amounts of capital to implement our planned
business strategies.  Given the currently unsettled state of the capital markets and credit markets, there is no
assurance that we will be able to raise the amount of capital that we may seek to support our working capital
requirements or for further investment in current and future operations.  If we are unable to raise the
necessary capital at the times we require such funding, we may have to materially change our business plan,
delaying implementation of aspects of our business plan or curtailing or abandoning our business
plan.  Investing in us is a speculative investment and investors may lose all of their investment.
 
Since our inception, we have been financed primarily by the sale of equity in private placements.  We raised
$10,000 for shares issued to founders in 2006, $1,635,000 on December 29, 2006 (net of expenses of
$20,000), $13,391,879 on May 29, 2007 (net of expenses of $1,492,000), and $3,940,189 on July 29, 2007
(net of expenses of $444,654) by way of three separate private placements of shares of common stock.  At
June 30, 2016, we had cash of $68,754; other current assets of $13,427 consisting of amounts receivable,
and prepaid expenses, and we had current liabilities of $52,450, consisting of accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, and other liabilities.  We attribute our operating loss to having no operating revenues to sustain our
operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
  
Net Cash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities
 
Net cash used in operating activities of operations was $341,750 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to net cash provided of $289,055 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is
primarily attributable to our net loss from operations of $8,558 and the net change in the balances of
operating assets and liabilities in the aggregate amount of $612,176.
 
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company paid $18,824 for patent applications. During the
six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company paid $nil for patent applications.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
 
We did not raise any funds through financing activities of operations during the six month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Significant Accounting Policies
 
Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all companies include a
discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements. While all these
significant accounting policies impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, we view
certain of these policies as critical.  Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree
of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable
judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our unaudited condensed
consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. 
25
Table of Contents
General
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue, if any, and expenses, and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources.  Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these
estimates with the Board of Directors.  Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and
the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on
assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates
reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially
impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies
reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, no significant Company obligations remain, collection of the related receivable is
reasonably assured, and the fees are fixed or determinable. The Company acts as a principal in its revenue
transactions as the Company is the primary obligor in the transactions.
Deferred Revenue and Deferred Costs
The Company defers revenue on contracts which contain a performance commitment until such time as the
services have been completed and no significant Company obligations remain.
 
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The Company’s reporting and functional currency is US Dollars. The accounts of the Company’s 99.81%
owned subsidiary, WL, and the Company’s 63% owned subsidiary, Bio-AMD Holdings, and Bio-AMD
Holdings Limited’s wholly owned subsidiary, Bio-Medical, and the Company’s 70% owned Subsidiary UKH
and its 60% owned subsidiary MML, are maintained using the local currency (Great British Pound) as the
functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into US Dollars at balance sheet date, equity is
translated at historical rate and revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rate
for the year or the reporting period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity, captioned as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) gain.  Transaction gains and
losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
The relevant translation rates are as follows: For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 closing rate at
1.3242 US$:GBP, average rate at 1.4319 US$:GBP and for the six month period ended June 30, 2015
closing rate at 1.5717 US$:GBP, average rate at 1.5233 US$:GBP.

Recent accounting pronouncements
 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis, which is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal
entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized
debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). The ASU
focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from
four to two, the new standard simplifies the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and improves current
U.S. GAAP by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest,
reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial
interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and changing consolidation conclusions for companies in several
industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU
2015-02 did not have any effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40)". ASU 2014-15 provides guidance related to management's responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016,
and for interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of
ASU 2014-15 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target
Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.” This ASU requires that a performance target that
affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have any effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”
ASU 2014-09 affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer
goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are
within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). ASU 2014-09 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are still
evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09. On April 1, 2015, the FASB voted to propose to defer
the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the SEC did not, or are not believed by
management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Inflation
We believe that inflation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our operations.
Climate Change
We believe that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had,
or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
Not applicable.
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC's rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the 1934 Act. Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of June 30, 2016, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because (1) the Company lacks a functioning audit
committee and there is a lack of independent directors on the board of directors, resulting in reduced
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) the Company
has inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) the Company has ineffective
controls over its period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The Company operations are also
ineffective due to the lack of operating funding.
 
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial
Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 
Changes in Internal Controls
During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, there has been a change in our internal control over financial
reporting due to the reduced cash and other liquid assets to fund the operations of the Company that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
