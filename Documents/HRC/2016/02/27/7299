<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its resolution 26/27, the Human Rights Council held a full-day 
</p>
<p>discussion on 6 March 2015 on specific themes relating to human rights and climate 
</p>
<p>change. Two panel discussions were held, the details of which are provided in the present 
</p>
<p>report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR).   
</p>
<p>2. The discussion was chaired by the President of the Human Rights Council and 
</p>
<p>opened with a video message from the Secretary-General, followed by an address from the 
</p>
<p>Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>3. The first panel discussion focused on identifying challenges and ways forward 
</p>
<p>towards the realization of all human rights, including the right to development, for all, in 
</p>
<p>particular those in vulnerable situations. It included the measures and best practices to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect human rights that could be adopted by States in addressing the adverse 
</p>
<p>effects of climate change on the full and effective enjoyment of human rights. The panel 
</p>
<p>was moderated by the Executive Director of the South Centre, Martin Khor. The panellists 
</p>
<p>were: the President of Kiribati, Anote Tong; the Minister for Foreign Affairs of 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh, Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali; the President of the Mary Robinson Foundation &#8211; 
</p>
<p>Climate Justice, Mary Robinson; the Coordinator and Principal Legal Adviser in the 
</p>
<p>secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Dan Bondi 
</p>
<p>Ogolla; the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz; 
</p>
<p>and the Secretary-General of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, Mithika Mwenda. 
</p>
<p>4. The second panel discussion focused on the adverse impact of climate change on 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; efforts to progressively realize the right to food, as well as policies, lessons learned 
</p>
<p>and good practices. It opened with a video message from the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>right to food, Hilal Elver, and was moderated by the Independent Expert on the issue of 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
</p>
<p>environment, John Knox. The panellists were: the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sosene 
</p>
<p>Sopoaga; the Administrator of the National Food Authority of the Philippines, Renan B. 
</p>
<p>Dalisay; the Director of the Geneva Liaison Office of the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Xiangjun Yao; the General Secretary of the 
</p>
<p>World Council of Churches, Olav Fykse Tveit; the General Coordinator of La Via 
</p>
<p>Campesina, Elizabeth Mpofu; and the Permanent Representative in Geneva of FoodFirst 
</p>
<p>Information and Action Network International, Ana-Maria Suarez Franco. 
</p>
<p>5. Ms. Robinson provided closing remarks drawn from the two panel discussions. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening session 
</b></p>
<p>6. In his video message, the Secretary-General stated that climate change posed a threat 
</p>
<p>to sustainable development and, in some cases, even to human survival. It could fuel 
</p>
<p>famine, political upheaval and conflicts over resources and had disproportionate impacts on 
</p>
<p>women, the poor, indigenous peoples, traditional farmers, coastal communities and 
</p>
<p>migrants. He observed that people living in developing countries, particularly in small 
</p>
<p>island developing States, in Africa and in the least developed countries had contributed the 
</p>
<p>least to dangerous carbon emissions but were bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of 
</p>
<p>climate change. He demanded immediate climate action to transform economies and 
</p>
<p>harness the potential of a low-carbon future. He called upon States to come to a meaningful 
</p>
<p>universal agreement at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
</p>
<p>Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December 2015, and called for the </p>


<p>Human Rights Council to demonstrate leadership and do its part to achieve urgently needed 
</p>
<p>progress. 
</p>
<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Flavia Pansieri, stated that 
</p>
<p>human-induced climate change undercut the rights to health, food, water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p>adequate housing and &#8212; for the people of small islands and coastal communities &#8212; even 
</p>
<p>the rights to self-determination and survival as distinct peoples. The Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Panel on Climate Change &#8212; the world&#8217;s most authoritative voice on climate science &#8212; had 
</p>
<p>conclusively documented the immediate and long-term harm that climate change brings to 
</p>
<p>our environment, and the seven resolutions of the Human Rights Council on climate change 
</p>
<p>clearly detailed the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>8. She said that the Intergovernmental Panel and the Human Rights Council had 
</p>
<p>highlighted the disproportionate impact that climate change had on poor, vulnerable and 
</p>
<p>marginalized communities, and on people already at risk owing to factors such as gender, 
</p>
<p>poverty, age, minority status and disability. Those who had contributed the least to 
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions, including the poorest people in the poorest countries and future 
</p>
<p>generations worldwide, would be affected the most.  
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Pansieri called for immediate action to implement a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach to climate change that identified and satisfied the most pressing needs of 
</p>
<p>vulnerable persons living in our highly inequitable global society, and that promoted careful 
</p>
<p>stewardship of the world&#8217;s resources and higher levels of accountability for the benefit of 
</p>
<p>all. A new legally binding climate agreement would strengthen the commitments made by 
</p>
<p>States in the 2010 Cancun Agreements to ensure that &#8220;parties shall, in all climate change-
</p>
<p>related actions, respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights for all&#8221;1 and include clear 
</p>
<p>references to the human rights principles of equality, non-discrimination, accountability, 
</p>
<p>participation, empowerment, solidarity and transparency, among others.  
</p>
<p>10. Discussing the larger global context, including the post-2015 development agenda 
</p>
<p>and financing for development negotiations, she emphasized that a rights-based approach 
</p>
<p>must not only be integrated within all relevant international discussions and outcomes, but 
</p>
<p>also followed by action. The Deputy High Commissioner exhorted States to take real steps 
</p>
<p>to reduce the harmful effects of climate change, in ways that are fully consistent with their 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>11. Equitable climate action,  which is designed to limit climate change and prevent and 
</p>
<p>mitigate its negative impacts,  must have people&#8217;s rights at its core. Care must be taken to 
</p>
<p>prevent and remedy any negative impacts on the human rights of groups that are vulnerable, 
</p>
<p>marginalized, discriminated against or at risk, including indigenous peoples, minorities, 
</p>
<p>persons living in poverty, migrants and displaced persons, older persons, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and children, and to empower and protect the rights of women.  
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Pansieri said that, at the most recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group on 
</p>
<p>the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action on climate change, held in Geneva in February 
</p>
<p>2015, several States had expressed support for the inclusion of strong language on human 
</p>
<p>rights in forthcoming agreements, and 18 States had signed the &#8220;Geneva Pledge on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and Climate Action&#8221;.2 She urged all States to make this commitment and called 
</p>
<p>upon participants to highlight the critical linkages between human rights and climate 
</p>
<p>change and to promote action-oriented outcomes to facilitate global, local, individual and 
</p>
<p>collective efforts to save humanity from irreversible global warming and its devastating 
</p>
<p>impact on human rights.

<p><b> III. Summary of the first panel discussion 
</b></p>
<p>13. Opening the panel as moderator, Mr. Khor asserted that climate change must be 
</p>
<p>considered as a package that included the environment, development and equity. Climate 
</p>
<p>change, development and human rights should be addressed in an equitable and integrated 
</p>
<p>manner. A human rights-based approach demands the inclusion of climate justice, as well 
</p>
<p>as international cooperation and solidarity, all of which are essential in supporting 
</p>
<p>developing countries, including through finance and technology. Such coordination and 
</p>
<p>cooperation at the global level should be based on solidarity, equity, justice and respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p> <b>A. Contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>14. Relating the story of his island nation&#8217;s struggle for survival, the President of 
</p>
<p>Kiribati, Mr. Tong, said that it was time for everyone to listen and to act. He said that 2015 
</p>
<p>would be a critical turning point in human existence, when solidarity and a revitalized 
</p>
<p>approach to multilateralism would become essential. He said that human rights 
</p>
<p>considerations must be reflected in climate change discussions and that the actions of the 
</p>
<p>international community would determine whether or not the generations to come have a 
</p>
<p>future. He said it was time to move forward from abstract discussions, as the real human 
</p>
<p>impacts were being felt in countries like Kiribati.  
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Tong said that climate change was the biggest moral challenge facing 
</p>
<p>humankind. It threatened the very survival of peoples and nations. It was a global problem 
</p>
<p>demanding global leadership. To spur action, the human face of climate change must be 
</p>
<p>understood. The previous week, Kiribati had recorded its highest tides, which caused 
</p>
<p>substantial damage to a hospital and a road construction project. In countries on the front 
</p>
<p>line, immediate action to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change was essential. 
</p>
<p>Despite this, he said, Kiribati would continue to gradually fall victim to the rising tides. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Tong asked what the Human Rights Council and others would do about it.  
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Tong condemned the relative lack of action by the international community in 
</p>
<p>the face of the moral imperative to protect humanity from the ravages of climate change. 
</p>
<p>Recent negotiations had been disappointing, making the 2015 Paris Conference of the 
</p>
<p>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change all the more 
</p>
<p>critical. He called upon all States to sign the Geneva Pledge and to ensure that the outcome 
</p>
<p>of the upcoming negotiations protected human rights.  
</p>
<p>17. Mr. Tong emphasized that the threat climate change posed to Kiribati was real, and 
</p>
<p>demanded immediate action. He said that the Government had taken steps to protect its 
</p>
<p>people and plan for the future. It had bought land in Fiji and aimed to prepare its people so 
</p>
<p>they could migrate with dignity. However, he said, Kiribati could not address the problem 
</p>
<p>or protect its people alone. Therefore, the President urgently appealed for assistance from 
</p>
<p>the international community and for an immediate call to action from the Council as the 
</p>
<p>voice of the vulnerable and the moral authority of the international community. 
</p>
<p>18. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, 
</p>
<p>described climate change as one of the greatest challenges ever faced. He emphasized the 
</p>
<p>need for a transformative shift and a robust, legally binding outcome at the 2015 Paris 
</p>
<p>Conference of the Parties. This outcome should recognize that small island developing 
</p>
<p>States, the least developed countries and African nations faced unique threats from climate 
</p>
<p>change and had special needs. He said that, although slow-onset climate-induced disasters 
</p>
<p>like river erosion, desertification and salinity intrusion did not make headlines, they 
</p>
<p>affected peoples&#8217; lives and could lead to internal displacement and transnational migration. </p>


<p>In Bangladesh, climate change was estimated to cause the loss of between 2 and 3 per cent 
</p>
<p>of gross domestic product per annum. This had a real impact on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights, particularly for the most vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>19. Mr. Ali said that it was necessary to increase resilience and improve coping 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. By focusing on impacts on the poorest communities, peoples and countries, 
</p>
<p>the human rights perspective offered a way forward in addressing the existential threat 
</p>
<p>posed by climate change. Its magnitude varied across countries, communities and peoples 
</p>
<p>according to their geographic location, wealth and other factors, raising questions of 
</p>
<p>fairness and equity. In the developing world, there were limited resources for prevention, 
</p>
<p>mitigation and adaptation measures. Despite this, Bangladesh had taken several measures. 
</p>
<p>It had installed around 4 million solar home systems and more than 1 million improved 
</p>
<p>cooking stoves, had developed stress tolerant crop varieties and had mobilized over 
</p>
<p>385 million dollars in domestic resources for adaptation and mitigation measures.  
</p>
<p>20. However, he said, this was not sufficient. States must recognize their shared 
</p>
<p>responsibility to address climate change and its impacts, including by advancing the 
</p>
<p>discussion on human rights and climate change in the Council and other forums. The 
</p>
<p>international community must step up its commitments and actions to address climate 
</p>
<p>change so that the silent millions who faced its worst impacts could survive. Mr. Ali hoped 
</p>
<p>that the voice of 160 million Bangladeshis, many of whom lived in low-lying coastal areas, 
</p>
<p>would be heard by the Council. 
</p>
<p>21. The President of the Mary Robinson Foundation &#8211; Climate Justice, Mary Robinson, 
</p>
<p>stated that climate change had real impacts on the enjoyment of human rights and that time 
</p>
<p>was running out to avoid further impacts. She said that, in 2015, the international 
</p>
<p>community had before it a unique opportunity to set a new path for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development on the basis of alternatives to fossil fuels that would ensure the rights of 
</p>
<p>generations to come. Such a change must be climate just and ensure full participation of all 
</p>
<p>countries regardless of their current levels of emissions and development. Climate change, 
</p>
<p>more than any other issue, highlighted our interdependence. No country could alone protect 
</p>
<p>its citizens from the impacts of climate change, which meant that the international 
</p>
<p>community must work together to address the challenges that climate change posed for the 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, especially the right to development. 
</p>
<p>22. Ms. Robinson said that, in the future, society would have to employ low-carbon 
</p>
<p>technologies, guarantee decent work for all, promote equality, build sustainable cities and 
</p>
<p>preserve vital ecosystems. A human rights-based approach to development should focus on 
</p>
<p>fulfilling for all persons the minimum conditions necessary for a life of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>Faced with climate change, persons in vulnerable situations must have their rights 
</p>
<p>protected, be given access to measures of adaptation and resilience and receive the support 
</p>
<p>of the international community. A rights-based response should also maximize inclusion, 
</p>
<p>participation and equality. 
</p>
<p>23. Ms. Robinson advocated for a renewed focus on good practices and the use of 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations, standards and principles to inform and strengthen national 
</p>
<p>policymaking in climate change. The Foundation had identified 12 countries that actively 
</p>
<p>linked human rights and climate change in policymaking in their national reports to both 
</p>
<p>the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council; however, she said, more work was required to learn from those 
</p>
<p>experiences and scale up good practices. There was also a need to bring climate change 
</p>
<p>negotiators and human rights experts together to collaborate more closely. Ms. Robinson 
</p>
<p>called for the creation of a forum under the Convention and the Council for the sharing of 
</p>
<p>experiences and good practices, in order for the human rights community to prepare 
</p>
<p>guidelines for the integration of human rights in climate change policymaking &#8211; noting that 
</p>
<p>the Geneva Pledge was encouraging this to happen at the national level &#8211; and for States to </p>


<p>consider the linkages between human rights and climate change during the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. 
</p>
<p>24. The Coordinator and Principal Legal Adviser in the secretariat of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Framework Convention on Climate Change, Dan Bondi Ogolla, described the interface 
</p>
<p>between human rights and climate change. He said that climate change could directly affect 
</p>
<p>human rights, for example, by loss of land through rising sea levels, which threatened 
</p>
<p>livelihoods and culture. Response measures to climate change could also violate human 
</p>
<p>rights. For instance, mitigation activities under the clean development mechanism 
</p>
<p>implemented in indigenous lands could affect the rights to housing, property, culture and 
</p>
<p>self-determination. Human rights principles, such as participation and freedom of 
</p>
<p>information, may inform the implementation and development of relevant policies. 
</p>
<p>25. He said that the States parties to Convention had always been sensitive to the human 
</p>
<p>dimensions of climate change. Under the Convention, the definition of the adverse effects 
</p>
<p>of climate change included impacts on socioeconomic systems, human health and welfare 
</p>
<p>and its provisions required States parties to minimize the adverse impacts of response 
</p>
<p>measures and promote and facilitate public participation in addressing the effects of climate 
</p>
<p>change. 
</p>
<p>26. He said that, in addressing issues such as adaptation, response measures and 
</p>
<p>reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, the 
</p>
<p>decisions of the Conference of the Parties had elaborated on the provisions of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, offering guidance on implementation at the national level. They had held, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, that responses to climate change should be integrated with social and economic 
</p>
<p>development plans; all stakeholders should be engaged in the development and 
</p>
<p>implementation of climate change policies; and adaptation actions should follow a 
</p>
<p>participatory approach, taking into account the views of and likely impacts on vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups and communities.  
</p>
<p>27. Mr. Ogolla said the key challenges to be addressed were integrating human rights 
</p>
<p>into international and national climate change policy frameworks and ensuring the full and 
</p>
<p>effective protection of human rights in the implementation of climate-related actions. The 
</p>
<p>Cancun Agreements represented a key step, wherein States parties agreed that they should 
</p>
<p>fully respect human rights in all climate-related actions and recognized the need to engage a 
</p>
<p>broad range of stakeholders. They established safeguards for activities aimed at reducing 
</p>
<p>emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, including requirements that such 
</p>
<p>activities must be made consistent with relevant international conventions, respect the 
</p>
<p>knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and involve the full and effective participation 
</p>
<p>of relevant stakeholders. Going forward, he said that the negotiating text adopted recently 
</p>
<p>by the Ad Hoc Working Group contained several ideas for further integrating human rights 
</p>
<p>within the multilateral climate change regime. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, 
</p>
<p>stated that, although indigenous peoples were among those who had contributed the least to 
</p>
<p>climate change, they suffered some of its worst impacts. They often lived in and relied on 
</p>
<p>fragile ecosystems, damage to which threatened their homes, livelihoods and cultural 
</p>
<p>survival. Climate change threatened their rights to self-determination, development, food, 
</p>
<p>water, land and culture. Efforts to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change could also 
</p>
<p>threaten their rights. Production of biofuels could lead to land&#8211;grabbing, and displacement 
</p>
<p>and construction of hydroelectric dams and other renewable energy projects could cause 
</p>
<p>displacement and ecological damage. These activities should not be permitted without the 
</p>
<p>consent of potentially affected peoples.  
</p>
<p>29. She said that indigenous peoples could contribute to mitigation and adaptation 
</p>
<p>efforts. Their knowledge of ecosystems could support the effective use of resources for </p>


<p>agriculture and forestry. Titling of their lands and territories may support preservation of 
</p>
<p>forests and improved carbon storage. A study by the World Resources Institute found that 
</p>
<p>strengthening indigenous peoples&#8217; and local communities&#8217; rights to their forests helped 
</p>
<p>Governments to meet climate goals, safeguard forests and protect livelihoods. Indigenous 
</p>
<p>climate observations and community-based monitoring could help to reduce monitoring 
</p>
<p>costs and enhance early warning systems. 
</p>
<p>30. Ms. Tauli-Corpuz said the outcome of the 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties must 
</p>
<p>ensure that respecting all human rights for all is integral to all decisions and actions for 
</p>
<p>mitigation and adaptation. The Conference should request inputs and advice from OHCHR 
</p>
<p>and human rights mechanisms on operationalizing human rights protections in climate 
</p>
<p>policy and any new agreement should include language on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. She 
</p>
<p>said that participation was critical and indigenous peoples must have a voice and vote in 
</p>
<p>climate-related decisions. Climate funds must include seats for indigenous peoples as 
</p>
<p>observers. More States should sign the Geneva Pledge and act to protect the rights of those 
</p>
<p>most vulnerable to climate change.  
</p>
<p>31. Mr. Mwenda highlighted the need to ensure that human rights were protected in 
</p>
<p>climate policymaking affecting Africa. He said there was a need for a broad understanding 
</p>
<p>of human rights that emphasized the right to development, especially achieving equitable or 
</p>
<p>even equal development between States. In addition to having the obligation to protect 
</p>
<p>human rights within their borders, States and the international community had broader 
</p>
<p>responsibilities to promote the realization of all human rights for all. States must act 
</p>
<p>collectively, including through the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention 
</p>
<p>on Climate Change. 
</p>
<p>32. Mr. Mwenda advocated for a paradigm shift that took into account concepts such as 
</p>
<p>indigenous rights and the rights of Mother Earth. He said these were embedded in the 
</p>
<p>cooperative values of the peoples of Africa and were essential for realizing the right to food 
</p>
<p>in Africa. Nearly all States had accepted the extraterritorial reach of their legal obligations 
</p>
<p>in relation to human rights. Therefore, discussions on climate change and human rights 
</p>
<p>should focus on how best States could fulfil their responsibility. He called for the 
</p>
<p>appointment of a special rapporteur on human rights and climate change, as recommended 
</p>
<p>by the 2010 Social Forum. In the countdown to the 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties, 
</p>
<p>establishing such a mandate would be timely and effective. 
</p>
<p>33. He recalled the statement of the Chair of the Group of 77 and China during the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009, Lumumba Diaping, 
</p>
<p>according to which 100 million sub-Saharan Africans would die owing to the unaddressed 
</p>
<p>consequences of climate change in the twenty-first century. He said that, in Kenya, the 
</p>
<p>Government had just issued a famine alert and was shipping emergency supplies to farming 
</p>
<p>communities facing starvation owing to prolonged climate-related drought. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>funds earmarked for infrastructure projects were being diverted. This was a vicious cycle 
</p>
<p>that was an everyday reality for many in Africa. Mr. Mwenda concluded that those who had 
</p>
<p>caused the problem could not be allowed to abdicate responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive discussion 
</b></p>
<p>34. During the plenary discussion, representatives of the following States took the floor: 
</p>
<p>Algeria (on behalf of the Group of African States), Bangladesh (on behalf of Belarus, 
</p>
<p>Bolivia (Plurinational State of), China, Cuba, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p>Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Venezuela 
</p>
<p>(Bolivarian Republic of]), Chile, Ecuador (on behalf of the Community of Latin American 
</p>
<p>and Caribbean States), El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, France, Ghana, the Holy See, India, 
</p>
<p>Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland, Maldives, Morocco, Namibia, Nepal, </p>


<p>Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines (on behalf of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Barbados, 
</p>
<p>Bhutan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Nepal, Rwanda, Saint 
</p>
<p>Lucia, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, the United Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu and Viet Nam), 
</p>
<p>Sierra Leone, Spain, Sweden (on behalf of Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway), 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, the United States of America, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam. Representatives of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Population Fund and the European Union also participated in the discussion. 
</p>
<p>35. Representatives of the Scottish Human Rights Commission and the following non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations spoke: Centre Europe &#8211; Tiers Monde &#8211; Europe &#8211; Third World 
</p>
<p>Centre, Franciscans International (on behalf of 13 like-minded organizations), International 
</p>
<p>Youth and Student Movement for the United Nations, Lutheran World Federation (also on 
</p>
<p>behalf of ACT Alliance) and Verein S&#252;dwind Entwicklungspolitik. 
</p>
<p>36. Statements by the following States were not delivered owing to lack of time: 
</p>
<p>Algeria, Bahrain, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Madagascar, Mauritius, New Zealand, 
</p>
<p>Panama, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, South Africa, the Sudan  and Uruguay. For the 
</p>
<p>same reason, statements by the International Development Law Organization, the 
</p>
<p>International Organization for Migration and the United Nations Environment Programme 
</p>
<p>(UNEP) were not delivered. 
</p>
<p>37. Delegations emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent, mitigate and adapt to 
</p>
<p>climate change, which was described as an immutable fact that required immediate action, 
</p>
<p>illustrated the growing interdependence of all peoples and States and posed an imminent 
</p>
<p>threat to the environment, development and security. Delegations agreed that the upcoming 
</p>
<p>negotiations in Paris were the best vehicle for reaching a universal, legally binding 
</p>
<p>agreement on climate change. They agreed that 2015 presented another crucial opportunity 
</p>
<p>to address climate change through the post-2015 development agenda and related processes 
</p>
<p>as sustainable development was of critical importance. Stressing the need for drastic 
</p>
<p>measures to promote sustainability, one delegation called for a shift from market-based 
</p>
<p>systems to a life in harmony with Mother Earth. 
</p>
<p>38. All delegations concurred that human rights and climate change were interlinked and 
</p>
<p>that the human rights dimension should be included in the Paris discussions. Several 
</p>
<p>delegations cited their commitment to the Geneva Pledge as a positive step in that direction. 
</p>
<p>One delegation emphasized that any new agreement in Paris should not override the human 
</p>
<p>rights commitments made in the Cancun Agreements. However, another delegation 
</p>
<p>cautioned that discussion of climate change by the Human Rights Council and of human 
</p>
<p>rights at the 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties should not hinder climate negotiations. 
</p>
<p>39. Delegations agreed that climate change would continue to have an impact on many 
</p>
<p>human rights. Several delegations described actual and anticipated impacts in their 
</p>
<p>countries as well as their efforts to address those impacts. Delegations agreed that it was 
</p>
<p>important to put a human face on climate impacts and to address climate-related migration. 
</p>
<p>Delegations called for mitigation and adaptation efforts to place people at the centre, be 
</p>
<p>gender sensitive and ensure the rights of the most vulnerable, including women, children, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and the poor. 
</p>
<p>40. Delegations reiterated that the poorest countries and the most vulnerable people had 
</p>
<p>contributed the least to climate change yet were likely to suffer its worst impacts. This was 
</p>
<p>particularly true of children and future generations and was a matter of justice and fairness. 
</p>
<p>They called for recognition of the historical responsibility of the largest contributors to 
</p>
<p>climate change through the application of the principle of common but differentiated 
</p>
<p>responsibilities in efforts to address it. Research and development, technology transfer, 
</p>
<p>capacity-building, development assistance, innovative finance and clean development 
</p>
<p>mechanisms were critical to those efforts. </p>


<p>41. Several delegations made specific action-oriented recommendations. They called for 
</p>
<p>developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change; adequate funding and 
</p>
<p>research into adaptation measures to help the poorest countries and the most vulnerable 
</p>
<p>people; intensified research and development into renewable sources of energy and energy 
</p>
<p>conservation to reduce the emissions intensity of growth; equitable access to technology, 
</p>
<p>including, if necessary, the lowering of intellectual property standards; increased scrutiny of 
</p>
<p>the impacts of climate change on human rights by special procedures mandate holders; the 
</p>
<p>appointment of a special rapporteur on human rights and climate change; the creation of a 
</p>
<p>climate justice fund; the establishment of an international climate court; and the exploration 
</p>
<p>and expansion of the role of nuclear energy as a clean alternative energy source.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Responses and concluding remarks  
</b></p>
<p>42. During and after the interactive discussion, the panellists were given the opportunity 
</p>
<p>to respond to questions and issues raised from the floor and to make concluding remarks.  
</p>
<p>43. Mr. Mwenda referred to the situation in Kiribati, which he said was literally sinking, 
</p>
<p>and many States in Africa where multitudes were facing starvation. He compared the plight 
</p>
<p>of humanity in the face of climate change to that of passengers struggling for survival 
</p>
<p>during the sinking of the Titanic: the weak might suffer and die first but, in the end, 
</p>
<p>everyone would sink. Given this reality, he called for a paradigm shift to address climate 
</p>
<p>change and transition to low-carbon economies in an equitable, fair and ecologically sound 
</p>
<p>manner that permitted continued growth in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>44. Ms. Tauli-Corpuz emphasized that the Paris agreement must provide for respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples, and described climate change as 
</p>
<p>proof of a broken economic model that perpetuated inequalities. She proposed the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle and stressed the need for current actions to 
</p>
<p>take into account likely impacts on future generations.  
</p>
<p>45. Mr. Ogolla asserted that human rights had already substantially influenced the 
</p>
<p>climate change discourse, as evidenced by the Cancun Agreements and the negotiating text 
</p>
<p>for Paris. He called for increased cooperation between the climate change and human rights 
</p>
<p>communities, in order to better understand linkages and develop practical options for 
</p>
<p>implementing policies. 
</p>
<p>46. Ms. Robinson reiterated the need for improved cooperation between the human 
</p>
<p>rights and climate change constituencies. She referred to a recent event organized by the 
</p>
<p>Climate Vulnerable Forum and her Foundation that highlighted the need for such 
</p>
<p>cooperation and sharing of experiences. The Human Rights Council and mechanisms 
</p>
<p>should continue their efforts to address the interlinkages, as sharing knowledge and good 
</p>
<p>practices would be critical to the effective integration of human rights into climate action. 
</p>
<p>She encouraged States to sign the Geneva Pledge. Affirming that countries needed 
</p>
<p>development and had a right to development, she reiterated the need for climate actions to 
</p>
<p>help realize the right to development for all people and promote intergenerational justice.  
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Ali described climate change as a political issue steeped in concerns over equity, 
</p>
<p>fairness and dignity. Adaptation and mitigation measures in developing countries faced 
</p>
<p>limitations and the mere recognition of climate change and its impacts was not sufficient. 
</p>
<p>Instead, he called for a political commitment to a legally binding document addressing 
</p>
<p>effective cooperation, compensatory finance, technology transfer and other issues. 
</p>
<p>48. Mr. Tong reiterated his plea for immediate, concrete action to address climate 
</p>
<p>change. The continuing discussions on climate change had not yielded concrete actions. 
</p>
<p>The people of Kiribati and other affected nations needed actions to deal with its impacts 
</p>
<p>now. Mr. Tong concluded that climate change was the greatest moral challenge facing </p>


<p>humanity, that its reality and impacts were the subject of consensus and that it was time the 
</p>
<p>international community actually did something about it. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of the second panel discussion  
</b></p>
<p>49. At the outset, the moderator, Mr. Knox, recalled the 2014 Human Rights Day 
</p>
<p>message from all special procedures mandate holders, which described climate change as 
</p>
<p>one of the greatest challenges of our generation, highlighted its disproportionate effects on 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged, marginalized, excluded and vulnerable individuals and groups, and urged 
</p>
<p>the incorporation of human rights obligations into climate change negotiations. In the 
</p>
<p>Geneva Pledge, States made a concrete commitment to further this objective. In a recent 
</p>
<p>report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/28/61), Mr. Knox identified good practices, 
</p>
<p>particularly on climate change. The right to food was most affected by climate change and 
</p>
<p>required concrete action.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>50. In a video message, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Hilal Elver 
</p>
<p>articulated the link between food security and climate change, pointing out that fossil fuels 
</p>
<p>and intensive chemical agricultural practices were unsustainable and contributed to 
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions. She said that, currently, food production exceeded global needs 
</p>
<p>but failed to reach almost a billion chronically hungry people and another billion 
</p>
<p>malnourished people. Climate change threatened to worsen the situation of those afflicted 
</p>
<p>by hunger, including many small holder farmers, fishing communities, indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>and urban poor. Furthermore, mitigation and adaptation policies, including the production 
</p>
<p>of biofuels and clean development mechanisms, such as the advanced mechanism for 
</p>
<p>reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, could shift land use away 
</p>
<p>from agriculture and threatened the enjoyment of the right to food. Women&#8217;s and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; knowledge of biodiversity and agroecology must inform mitigation 
</p>
<p>and adaptation strategies. Small-scale farmers should be the cornerstone of any global 
</p>
<p>strategy to address climate change and hunger. The Geneva Pledge offered hope that a 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach to climate change would be included in the outcome of the 2015 
</p>
<p>Paris Conference of the Parties, but making this a reality would require profound societal 
</p>
<p>change. 
</p>
<p>51. The Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, expressed how critically important 
</p>
<p>the theme of the panel discussion was to him and to his nation. He echoed the stories and 
</p>
<p>sentiments of Mr. Tong, noting the incredibly serious situation on the ground in Tuvalu. He 
</p>
<p>said that climate change had significant impacts on food security-related to saltwater 
</p>
<p>intrusion, loss of croplands and coral bleaching, among others. But, more fundamentally, it 
</p>
<p>was an issue of basic survival and development. Therefore, it was almost irrelevant to talk 
</p>
<p>about food security when the entire nation and all its people were threatened. 
</p>
<p>52. Mr. Sopoaga called on the Human Rights Council to employ a human response to 
</p>
<p>the impacts of climate change that considered the need to preserve traditions and 
</p>
<p>livelihoods, protect the economic rights of communities and ward off or mitigate the 
</p>
<p>impacts of displacement. In that regard, sovereign continuity was necessary and would pose 
</p>
<p>complex challenges for the international community as rising sea levels threatened the 
</p>
<p>entire land area of low-lying island States. It was important that the international 
</p>
<p>community take up the work of the Council to address climate change in a broader sphere. 
</p>
<p>Although the global response to climate change would continue to be negotiated under the 
</p>
<p>aegis of the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
</p>
<p>the Council offered a critical and complementary perspective, and the linkages between 
</p>
<p>climate change and human rights must be recognized and strengthened. </p>


<p>53. Consequently, Mr. Sopoaga suggested that the Council consider establishing a 
</p>
<p>mechanism to link human rights and the impacts of climate change, and called for the 
</p>
<p>Council to hold a special session to examine the impact of climate change on human rights 
</p>
<p>and identify ways forward to address them. The 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties 
</p>
<p>needed an ambitious agenda. The plight of States like Tuvalu and Kiribati must receive 
</p>
<p>more attention and become a cause of action for the international community. The United 
</p>
<p>Nations was not present on the ground in Tuvalu, where its support was desperately needed. 
</p>
<p>Addressing the human rights impact of climate change was an issue of justice, mandating 
</p>
<p>immediate action. 
</p>
<p>54. The Administrator of the National Food Authority of the Philippines, Renan Dalisay 
</p>
<p>described the horrendous impact of super typhoon Haiyan on his country. In total, 7,500 
</p>
<p>people were killed and millions were affected across 14 provinces. The damage caused the 
</p>
<p>loss of billions of dollars and massive production losses for food. There was abundant 
</p>
<p>evidence that climate change affected the intensity and frequency of typhoons and other 
</p>
<p>extreme weather events, which were increasingly regular in the Philippines. These 
</p>
<p>destroyed crops, augmented costs of staple foods and increased reliance upon emergency 
</p>
<p>food relief. Climate change directly affected the enjoyment of the right to adequate food 
</p>
<p>and nutrition. It destroyed land. It took lives and had a disproportionate impact on the 
</p>
<p>poorest and most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>55. Mr. Dalisay said that the Government of the Philippines had taken steps to address 
</p>
<p>the growing threat of climate change. Policymakers had enacted laws and put in place a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive set of policies, programmes and institutions to help identify strategies and 
</p>
<p>actions towards mitigation and adaptation. These included the 2009 Climate Change Act, 
</p>
<p>the National Climate Change Action Plan and the Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in 
</p>
<p>Agriculture. Aligning climate policies with human rights had been central to these efforts 
</p>
<p>and reflected both international and national commitments. Agricultural development was 
</p>
<p>of supreme importance and efforts must be made continuously to protect livelihoods, 
</p>
<p>provide access to food for children, ensure gender equality and respect indigenous 
</p>
<p>perspectives.  
</p>
<p>56. Mr. Dalisay stated that all were victims of climate change and all must work 
</p>
<p>together to stop it. He called for a serious commitment to address the global threat of 
</p>
<p>climate change and to implement the obligations of States on the basis of historical 
</p>
<p>responsibilities. Recalling the Philippines&#8217; experience of solidarity with the international 
</p>
<p>community in the aftermath of typhoon Yolanda, he asserted that States and people must 
</p>
<p>come together again to agree on a lasting solution to save our children and our children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>children from the devastation wrought by the terrible consequences of climate change. He 
</p>
<p>called on all to honour the victims of climate change by taking immediate action to protect 
</p>
<p>future generations. 
</p>
<p>57. The Director of the FAO Geneva Liaison Office, Xiangjun Yao, stated that realizing 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate food is directly and indirectly affected by climate change. She said 
</p>
<p>that more than 800 million people currently suffered from hunger and 2 billion were 
</p>
<p>affected by some form of malnutrition. Substantial production increases would be required 
</p>
<p>to feed growing world populations. Climate change threatened food production and 
</p>
<p>physical access to food. It endangered livelihoods. In a world already afflicted by famine 
</p>
<p>and substantial food price volatility, some States had made progress in the fight against 
</p>
<p>hunger that could inform future efforts. The analysis by FAO of national efforts to achieve 
</p>
<p>the hunger target in the Millennium Development Goals revealed four key areas of 
</p>
<p>intervention: nutrition and education; social protection; equitable access to resources and 
</p>
<p>assets; and awareness-raising. Effective strategies included short-term provision of essential 
</p>
<p>assistance coupled with protection and development of productive assets and infrastructure </p>


<p>that support livelihoods, and the establishment of cross-sectoral links to ensure decent 
</p>
<p>employment and social welfare.  
</p>
<p>58. Ms. Yao recommended future measures that were adapted to the situation and 
</p>
<p>conditions of those most affected by climate change and developed with the involvement of 
</p>
<p>all stakeholders. Mechanisms that enabled communities to share knowledge and good 
</p>
<p>practices and to participate in decision-making, monitoring and accountability processes 
</p>
<p>should be strengthened. Participants at the recent International Forum on Agriculture and 
</p>
<p>Climate Change discussed climate-smart agriculture that adapted to environmental pressure 
</p>
<p>and had fewer adverse environmental impacts. A multi-stakeholder global alliance on 
</p>
<p>climate-smart agriculture had been established to promote sustainable and equitable 
</p>
<p>increases in agricultural productivity and incomes, build resilience of food systems and 
</p>
<p>farming livelihoods and achieve reductions or removals of greenhouse gas emissions by 
</p>
<p>agriculture.  
</p>
<p>59. She said that, as it becomes increasingly clear that climate change had adverse 
</p>
<p>impacts on the enjoyment of the right to food, the international community must take 
</p>
<p>action, including by implementing the FAO Right to Food Guidelines, Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure and Principles for Responsible 
</p>
<p>Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems. These tools offer critical human rights-based 
</p>
<p>guidance to help realize the right to food and take climate action. Ms. Yao proposed a 
</p>
<p>strong commitment in the post-2015 development agenda to ensure the empowerment of 
</p>
<p>key actors, especially women and vulnerable groups, who played a crucial role in realizing 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate food. 
</p>
<p>60. The General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, Olav Fykse Tveit, 
</p>
<p>asserted that climate change was a matter of life or death. It brought home messages from 
</p>
<p>religious traditions worldwide that the world is one creation, that all persons share 
</p>
<p>responsibility for its stewardship and that the actions of the few can impact the basic 
</p>
<p>conditions of life for all. He said that climate change was about universal human rights. The 
</p>
<p>problems highlighted by the panellists were real and climate change was already affecting 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to food. Many communities were 
</p>
<p>suffering from rising sea levels, salinization of fresh water sources, increased frequency and 
</p>
<p>intensity of tropical storms, changing rainfall patterns, droughts and floods and changing 
</p>
<p>temperatures, which had a direct impact on food security.  
</p>
<p>61. He said that, in its resolutions, the Human Rights Council had for years highlighted 
</p>
<p>the human rights impacts of climate change and special procedures mandate-holders had 
</p>
<p>reported on climate change in relation to several human rights. The 2010 Social Forum 
</p>
<p>recommended the establishment of a special rapporteur on climate change and human rights 
</p>
<p>who would work to enhance the enjoyment of human rights by those most vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>climate-related hazards. Mr. Tveit reiterated that call, emphasizing that the disproportionate 
</p>
<p>impact of climate change on those most vulnerable and least responsible was an issue of 
</p>
<p>fundamental injustice.  
</p>
<p>62. Since the scientific consensus on human-induced climate change was clear, the 
</p>
<p>world needed urgent and collective action on behalf of all humanity, including in 
</p>
<p>preparation for the 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties. The World Council of Churches 
</p>
<p>had specifically addressed climate change since the late 1980s, linking it to issues of peace, 
</p>
<p>economic justice and the environment. Climate change had environmental, political, ethical 
</p>
<p>and spiritual dimensions. Therefore, efforts to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change 
</p>
<p>and its impacts should be the focus of a broad-based approach rooted in human solidarity. 
</p>
<p>Those who lived in rich countries would need to change their lifestyle patterns. Those in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable countries should have the means to build resilience and adapt. Change must 
</p>
<p>occur at the individual, community, national and international levels. States, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, civil society and faith-based organizations should cooperate to ensure </p>


<p>justice for those who had contributed the least to climate change. All should show through 
</p>
<p>their actions that they understood their mutual interdependence and were prepared to 
</p>
<p>defend the rights of the most vulnerable. Mr. Tveit advocated for action as an expression of 
</p>
<p>hope for the future, for next generations, for Earth and for humanity. 
</p>
<p>63. The General Coordinator of La Via Campesina, Elizabeth Mpofu, drew attention to 
</p>
<p>the need to give voice to the voiceless in the discussion of climate change. She said that she 
</p>
<p>represented over 200 million marginalized people, including peasants and fishermen. She 
</p>
<p>demanded that those voices be heard and that the international community take the impacts 
</p>
<p>of climate change more seriously, noting that her speech on behalf of the voiceless and the 
</p>
<p>vulnerable represented by La Via Campesina merited more than a mere five-minute 
</p>
<p>presentation. 
</p>
<p>64. As a practicing woman farmer from Zimbabwe, she had witnessed first-hand the 
</p>
<p>impacts of climate change on human rights, particularly the rights to life, food, health, 
</p>
<p>housing, education, self-determination, development and water and sanitation. She had seen 
</p>
<p>the abdication of State responsibilities to protect human rights in favour of corporate 
</p>
<p>interests. She said that companies had engaged in unsustainable and indefensible practices, 
</p>
<p>including land-grabbing, excessive exploitation of mineral resources, over-reliance on fossil 
</p>
<p>fuels and destruction of nature and livelihoods. The most vulnerable populations, including 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, peasants and women, had suffered the greatest impacts of these actions. 
</p>
<p>Many had been displaced from their lands to make way for corporations. 
</p>
<p>65. Developed countries that had contributed the most to climate change had imposed a 
</p>
<p>huge burden on developing countries and refused to take responsibility. Faced with the 
</p>
<p>harsh impacts of climate change, many developing countries had been forced to shift 
</p>
<p>financial and human resources from development priorities like health, education and 
</p>
<p>agrarian support to confront the new challenges. In extreme cases, food insecurity caused 
</p>
<p>by drought or floods resulting from climate change had virtually paralysed some 
</p>
<p>developing countries and reversed critical development gains. Meanwhile, developed 
</p>
<p>countries, through their trade and investment negotiations and even their efforts to mitigate 
</p>
<p>climate change through the mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest 
</p>
<p>degradation, had further perpetuated human rights abuses and land-grabs and prioritized the 
</p>
<p>interests of the few over those of the many. For example, biofuels and export crops had 
</p>
<p>been favoured over locally grown and consumed food. Forests were being taken away from 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples who relied on them for their livelihoods, shelter, balanced diets and way 
</p>
<p>of life. People were losing their right to self-determination. Ms. Mpofu asked if this was 
</p>
<p>justice. 
</p>
<p>66. The Permanent Representative in Geneva of FoodFirst Information and Action 
</p>
<p>Network International, Ana-Maria Suarez Franco, argued that the international community 
</p>
<p>must ensure the primacy of human rights across international legal regimes. Human rights 
</p>
<p>must be integrated in the climate change discussion. Climate change was affecting the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to food and nutrition through several means, including droughts, 
</p>
<p>desertification, tropical diseases and ocean acidification. Persons displaced by climate 
</p>
<p>change impacts may not have access to sufficient, acceptable and healthy food. In its 
</p>
<p>2007/2008 report on climate change, 3  the United Nations Development Programme 
</p>
<p>estimated that climate change would render an additional 600 million people at risk of

<p>experiencing hunger by 2080. It would disproportionately affect peasants, indigenous

<p>peoples, pastoralists, small farmers and fishermen, who, paradoxically, had contributed the 
</p>
<p>least to the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>67. States must take immediate action to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food and 
</p>
<p>nutrition as required by international law. Climate change was a problem with international 
</p>
<p>origins and impacts; therefore, it would require an international solution. States must 
</p>
<p>recognize their extraterritorial obligations, as enunciated in the Maastricht Principles on 
</p>
<p>Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>They should use their political influence to promote an enabling environment for the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to food and other rights, including by cooperating to slow climate 
</p>
<p>change and mitigate its impacts. They must act to ensure the accountability of non-State 
</p>
<p>actors for their actions. 
</p>
<p>68. Ms. Suarez Franco stressed the need to provide children with nutritious food, not 
</p>
<p>just in infancy but also through later years, while simultaneously addressing the structural 
</p>
<p>causes of hunger, including climate change, to ensure the health and nutrition of future 
</p>
<p>generations. She said that ecological production of food would mitigate climate change, 
</p>
<p>boost the earnings of rural residents and increase the availability of food. She called upon 
</p>
<p>States to adopt policies that supported ecological food production by peasants, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples, fishermen and pastoralists and to respect their relationship with Mother Nature. 
</p>
<p>Clean development mechanisms must respect human rights, and States must ensure that 
</p>
<p>efforts to address climate change do not negatively affect their enjoyment. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive discussion 
</b></p>
<p>69. During the plenary discussion, representatives of the following States spoke: 
</p>
<p>Algeria, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, China, Cuba, the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Fiji, Gabon, Ireland, Maldives, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, 
</p>
<p>Qatar, Slovenia, South Africa, the Sudan and Uruguay. The European Union, the 
</p>
<p>International Development Law Organization, the International Organization for Migration 
</p>
<p>and UNEP also spoke, as did a representative of the non-governmental organization Action 
</p>
<p>Canada for Population and Development. Delegations called for urgent action to address 
</p>
<p>the impacts of climate change on human rights, especially the right to food. They 
</p>
<p>elaborated on specific threats to food security in their countries, including salinization of 
</p>
<p>arable land and irrigation water. In sharing national efforts to address these threats, 
</p>
<p>delegations highlighted the need for heightened efforts at the international level, including 
</p>
<p>through development assistance, technology transfer, capacity-building and the adoption of 
</p>
<p>a universal, legally binding agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
</p>
<p>Climate Change. The Paris Agreement should integrate human rights, and cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the Human Rights Council, the secretariat of the Convention and their respective 
</p>
<p>constituencies must be enhanced, including through stronger and broader participation of 
</p>
<p>States in the Geneva Pledge.  
</p>
<p>70. Several delegations supported the common but differentiated responsibilities 
</p>
<p>principle and individual and collective action to promote mitigation and adaptation. Some 
</p>
<p>focused on respect for Mother Earth, a shift to sustainable production and consumption, and 
</p>
<p>realizing the right to development. Delegations stressed the need to protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>women and indigenous peoples and to recognize the contribution of their knowledge to 
</p>
<p>adaptation strategies, enhanced enjoyment of the right to food and promotion of sustainable 
</p>
<p>livelihoods. Delegations called for State commitments to ensure adequate funding for the 
</p>
<p>Green Climate Change Fund for disaster adaptation and mitigation to be fulfilled. They 
</p>
<p>highlighted the importance of integrating human rights in climate policy, including 
</p>
<p>participation, access to information and access to justice. Delegations sought information 
</p>
<p>about good practices in promoting human rights-based approaches to climate policy, 
</p>
<p>particularly relating to the right to food.  </p>


<p><b> C. Responses and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>71. During and after the interactive discussion, panellists were given the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>respond to questions and issues raised from the floor and to make concluding remarks.  
</p>
<p>72. Ms. Suarez Franco referred to the utility of agroecology in reducing emissions, 
</p>
<p>delivering more nutritious foods and providing more income. She called for human rights 
</p>
<p>impact assessments of climate mitigation and corrective measures to promote informed, 
</p>
<p>rights-based decision-making. Policies should ensure that people do not lose their 
</p>
<p>autonomy to feed themselves. Ms. Suarez Franco advocated for a strong, legally binding 
</p>
<p>agreement integrating human rights throughout the entire outcome document of the 2015 
</p>
<p>Paris Conference of the Parties. She supported the call for a special rapporteur on human 
</p>
<p>rights and climate change to identify good practices, strengthen accountability mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>engage with the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
</p>
<p>Change and further explore the links between climate change and human rights.  
</p>
<p>73. Ms. Mpofu argued that the problems posed by climate change called for new 
</p>
<p>solutions. The corporate world must be regulated to protect human rights. Systems must be 
</p>
<p>changed and processes must become people-oriented. States should support the adoption of 
</p>
<p>a United Nations declaration on the rights of peasants. They should also adopt and 
</p>
<p>implement policies on food sovereignty that comprehensively addressed the human rights 
</p>
<p>impacts of climate change and corporate actors and focused on supporting the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable, including women. States must ensure their words are followed by actions and 
</p>
<p>act now.  
</p>
<p>74. Mr. Tveit asserted that we must act now to address climate change, the impacts of 
</p>
<p>which were already a reality and would affect even more our future generations. Actions 
</p>
<p>now would determine whether or not generations to come have access to the most basic 
</p>
<p>elements of life, including food and water. Mr. Tveit called on global leaders to adopt a 
</p>
<p>legal agreement affirming human dignity and promoting human sustainability. Noting that 
</p>
<p>women constituted 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force, Ms. Yao agreed that 
</p>
<p>engaging women in relevant policymaking was critical to food security. She called for 
</p>
<p>intensified research and development into mitigation and adaptation. Investment in the 
</p>
<p>agricultural sector and climate-smart agriculture were important ways forward. Resilient 
</p>
<p>and productive farming practices must be identified and adopted. Ms. Yao advocated for 
</p>
<p>political will and cooperation across sectors to adequately address climate change in Paris 
</p>
<p>and beyond.  
</p>
<p>75. Mr. Dalisay described efforts in the Philippines to develop hazard maps, improve 
</p>
<p>agricultural support services, reengineer irrigation systems, reinforce infrastructure, 
</p>
<p>establish early warning systems in partnership with communities and promote access to 
</p>
<p>credit for risk reduction measures. He said the Philippines was implementing a gender-
</p>
<p>sensitive approach to climate and agricultural policy as women and children were the most 
</p>
<p>affected. The call for action by the Presidents of the Philippines and France advocated for a 
</p>
<p>shift from intention to action as the point of no return was being reached. He said that the 
</p>
<p>Philippines President had emphasized the need to transcend paralysis by debates on 
</p>
<p>obligations of individual countries and act together now for the benefit of all. 
</p>
<p>76. Mr. Sopoaga made a plea for urgent action on climate change to enable small islands 
</p>
<p>and low-lying countries to address and adapt to rising sea levels. He said that States like 
</p>
<p>Tuvalu had a limited domestic capacity to cope with the impacts of climate change and 
</p>
<p>needed international assistance to take appropriate measures. He advocated for improved 
</p>
<p>access to financing and better coordination of international efforts. He called for greater 
</p>
<p>involvement of OHCHR in the Pacific and other severely affected regions, for enhanced 
</p>
<p>collaboration between the Human Rights Council and the secretariat of the United Nations </p>


<p>Framework Convention on Climate Change and for the Council to hold a special session on 
</p>
<p>climate change.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Closing session 
</b></p>
<p>77. In closing, Ms. Robinson offered brief conclusions and recommendations drawn 
</p>
<p>from the full day of discussions. Depicting climate change as the greatest human rights 
</p>
<p>challenge of the twenty-first century, she noted that panellists and participants had left no 
</p>
<p>doubt as to the terrible reality of its impacts. The international human rights system was 
</p>
<p>focused on the role and accountability of States in realizing the human rights of their 
</p>
<p>people. However, the impacts of climate change exceeded the capacity of many States to 
</p>
<p>protect their people. Members of the Human Rights Council must therefore assume 
</p>
<p>responsibility for safeguarding those whose rights were undermined and destroyed by those 
</p>
<p>impacts.  
</p>
<p>78. She said that climate justice necessitated urgent action and solidarity. It required 
</p>
<p>States to look beyond their responsibility to their own people and accept responsibility for 
</p>
<p>all those who are particularly vulnerable to climate change, including future generations. 
</p>
<p>Developing countries were making extraordinary efforts to address climate change and 
</p>
<p>increase their resilience. However, they needed the support of the international community 
</p>
<p>to protect the rights of their people and gain equitable access to sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>79. Ms. Robinson noted that participants had called for a human rights dimension to be 
</p>
<p>included in the outcome of the 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties; improved reporting on 
</p>
<p>human rights and climate change to the Human Rights Council and to the secretariat of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Council to hold a special 
</p>
<p>session on human rights and climate change; the identification and sharing of good 
</p>
<p>practices in human rights informing climate action; the examination of climate change by 
</p>
<p>all special procedures mandate holders, including recommendations to the Council; and the 
</p>
<p>creation of a legal instrument to protect the rights of climate displaced people among other 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>80. She observed that climate change, sustainable development and human rights were 
</p>
<p>interlinked. Therefore, efforts to move towards a more equitable world must address them 
</p>
<p>jointly. Gender equality, access to information and the rights to participation, education, 
</p>
<p>water, food and development should also inform more effective climate policies. All 
</p>
<p>countries should be able to participate in low-carbon, climate-resilient development, and 
</p>
<p>those most responsible for climate change should rapidly reduce their emissions and honour 
</p>
<p>their commitments to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support. The 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council must act now to ensure people-centred, rights-based action on 
</p>
<p>climate change as both a priority for the Paris Conference of the Parties and a longer-term 
</p>
<p>commitment. Recalling the words of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Wangari Maathai, 
</p>
<p>she concluded with a call for humanity to reach a higher moral ground and take immediate 
</p>
<p>action on climate change.
