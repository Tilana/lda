MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – SECOND QUARTER, 2016 
 
The  following  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (“MD&A”)  was  prepared  on  August  8,  2016  and  is 
management’s  assessment  of  Journey  Energy  Inc.’s  (“Journey”  or  the  “the  Company”)  financial  and  operating 
results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with 
the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 along with the notes related thereto. 
 
Additional  information  on  the  unaudited  interim  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements,  this  MD&A  and 
other  factors  that  could  affect  the  Company’s  operations  and  financial  results  are  included  in  Management’s 
Report  to  shareholders  included  with  the  financial  statements.  Furthermore,  the  forward-looking  statements 
contained  in  this  MD&A  are  made  as  of  the  date  of  this  MD&A  and  the  Company  does  not  undertake  any 
obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
new  information,  future  events  or  otherwise,  except  as  may  be  required  by  applicable  securities  laws.  The 
Company’s forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 
 
Journey prepares its financial statements in accordance with  International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).  
 
 
Forward-Looking Information 
 
This  MD&A  contains  forward-looking  statements.  More  particularly,  this  MD&A  contains  statements  concerning 
anticipated:  (i)  timing  and  completion  of  the  acquisitions,  expectations  and  assumptions  concerning  timing  of 
receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals  and  the  satisfaction  of  other  conditions  to  the  completion  of  the 
acquisitions,  (ii)  potential  development  opportunities  and  drilling  locations  associated  with  the  acquisitions, 
expectations  and  assumptions  concerning  the  success  of  future  drilling  and  development  activities,  the 
performance  of  existing  wells,  the  performance  of  new  wells,  the  successful  application  of  technology  and  the 
geological characteristics of the acquisitions, (iii) oil and natural gas production growth during 2016 (iv) debt and 
bank  facilities,  (v)  capital  expenditures,  (vi)  primary  and  secondary  recovery  potentials  and  implementation 
thereof,  (vii)  decline  rates,  (viii)  funds  from  operations,  (ix)  operating  and  cash  flow  netbacks,  (x)  operating 
expenses, (xi) general and administrative expenses, and (xii) realization of anticipated benefits of acquisitions. 
 
The  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  certain  key  expectations  and  assumptions  made  by  Journey, 
including  expectations  and  assumptions  concerning  the  performance  of  existing  wells  and  success  obtained  in 
drilling  new  wells,  anticipated  expenses,  cash  flow  and  capital  expenditures,  the  application  of  regulatory  and 
royalty regimes, prevailing commodity prices and economic conditions, development and completion activities, the 
performance  of  new  wells,  the  successful  implementation  of  waterflood  programs,  the  availability  of  and 
performance  of  facilities  and  pipelines,  the  geological  characteristics  of  Journey’s  properties,  the  successful 
application of drilling, completion and seismic technology, prevailing weather conditions, exchange rates, licensing 
requirements, the impact of completed facilities on operating costs and the availability, costs of capital, labour and 
services, and the creditworthiness of industry partners. 
 
Although  Journey  believes  that  the  expectations  and  assumptions  on  which  the  forward-looking  statements  are 
based  are  reasonable,  undue  reliance  should  not  be  placed  on  the  forward-looking  statements  because  Journey 
can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events 
and  conditions,  by  their  very  nature  they  involve  inherent  risks  and  uncertainties.  Actual  results  could  differ 
materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited
Page 1
to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and 
production;  delays  or  changes  in  plans  with  respect  to  exploration  or  development  projects  or  capital 
expenditures;  the  uncertainty  of  reserve  estimates;  the  uncertainty  of  estimates  and  projections  relating  to 
production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks), commodity price and exchange rate 
fluctuations  and  constraint  in  the  availability  of  services,  adverse  weather  or  break-up  conditions,  and 
uncertainties  resulting  from  potential  delays  or  changes  in  plans  with  respect  to  exploration  or  development 
projects or capital expenditures. Certain of these risks are set out in more detail in this MD&A under the heading 
‘Risk Factors’.  
 
The following table outlines Journey’s updated forward-looking information included in, and as of the date of this 
MD&A  and  has  been  updated  from  previous  forward-looking  information.  The  disclosure  below  is  intended  to 
provide the reader with the key assumptions that the forward looking information is based upon and the relevant 
risk  factors  that  would  be  considered  key  in  preventing  Journey  from  achieving  these  results.  This  table  also 
represents Journey’s outlook on the balance of 2016:
Forward-Looking Information
Key Assumptions
Completion of the budgeted 
drilling program and no 
significant 3rd party facility or 
pipeline outages. 
Dependent on: Journey achieving 
average production of oil, NGL 
and natural gas as per guidance; 
realizing forecasted average 
commodity prices of: USD 
$42.50/bbl WTI; AECO natural 
gas prices of $2.15/mcf; and 
using an average US/CAN 
exchange rate of $0.76 
Focus will be mainly on drilling 
6.0 net wells, water flood 
projects and exploitation 
projects.  
Mainly dependent on commodity 
prices achieving forecast 
amounts 
Achieving projected production 
volumes; no significant changes 
to cost structures
Bank prime rates and renewal 
fees remaining at current levels. 
No significant inflation above 
current levels  
G&A savings to be realized with 
reduced staff levels
Journey has a large tax pool 
position in excess of $700 million
Production for 2016 of between 
8,600 and 8,900 BOE/d (54% liquids)
2016 funds flow from operations of 
$24 - 26 million
2016 exploration and development 
capital spending of $19 million ($9 
million net of acquisitions/ 
divestitures) 
Year end net debt between $86-$88 
million
Operating and transportation costs 
in the high $12/boe range
Interest costs. Bank prime rates 
remain at current levels
General & administrative costs in 
the $3.00/BOE range (net of 
capitalized G&A and recoveries) 
Income taxes – no current income 
tax is projected to be payable for 
2016
Relevant Risk Factors 
Well performance; 3rd party 
outages.
WTI oil prices; Edmonton par 
differentials; adequate 
transportation of oil; AECO gas 
prices; Journey well performance, 
downtime and drilling success
Achieving the projected cash flow

small increments
G&A is fairly predictable as they are 
mainly fixed costs such as rent and 
salaries  
Potential tax law changes; 
significant and sustained increase in 
commodity prices

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
This  MD&A uses the terms  “netbacks” and “net  debt”, which  are terms not  recognized under  General  Accepted 
Accounting  Principles  (“GAAP”).  The  Company  uses  these  measures  to  help  evaluate  its  performance,  leverage, 
and liquidity as well as to assess potential acquisitions.  
 
The Company considers corporate netbacks as a key measure as it demonstrates its profitability relative to current 
commodity prices. Corporate netbacks are comprised of operating, cash flow and net earnings netbacks. Operating 
netback  is  calculated  as  the  average  sales  price  of  its  commodities  less  royalties,  transportation  costs  and 
operating  expenses.  Cash  flow  netback  starts  with  the  operating  netback  and  further  deducts  general  and 
administrative  costs,  interest  expense  and  then  adds  or  deducts  any  realized  gains  or  losses  on  derivative 
contracts.  To  calculate  the  net  earnings  netback,  Journey  takes  the  cash  flow  netback  and  deducts  all  non-cash 
expenses including: unrealized gains/losses on derivative contracts, share-based compensation expense, depletion, 
depreciation,  accretion,  loss  (gain)  on  dispositions,  bad  debt  expense,  impairments,  exploration  and  evaluation 
expenses and deferred income taxes. There is no GAAP measure that is reasonably comparable to netbacks. 
 
 
Additional GAAP Measures  
 
In  this  MD&A,  we  refer  to  additional  GAAP  financial  measures  that  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning  as 
prescribed by GAAP. Additional GAAP financial measures are line items, headings or subtotals in addition to those 
required under GAAP, and financial measures disclosed in the notes to the financial statements which are relevant 
to  an  understanding  of  the  financial  statements  and  are  not  presented  elsewhere  in  the  financial  statements. 
These measures have been described and presented in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with 
additional  measures  for  analyzing  our  ability  to  generate  funds  to  finance  our  operations  and  information 
regarding our liquidity. Users are cautioned that additional GAAP financial measures presented by the Corporation 
may not be comparable with measures provided by other entities.  
 
Additional GAAP financial measures include cash flow from operations and net debt.  
 
The Company considers cash flow from operations (also referred to as “cash flow”) a key performance measure as 
it  demonstrates  the  Company’s  ability  to  generate  funds  necessary  to  repay  debt  and  to  fund  future  growth 
through capital investment. Journey’s determination of cash flow from operations may not be comparable to that 
reported by other companies. The reconciliation between cash flows from operating activities and cash flow from 
operations can be found in the table below. Journey also presents cash flow from operations per share whereby 
per share amounts are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net 
earnings per share, which per share amount is calculated under IFRS and is more fully described in the notes to the 
financial statements.  
 
Cash  flow  from  operations  is  calculated  as  cash  from  operating  activities  before  changes  in  non-cash  working 
capital, transaction costs and decommissioning costs incurred. Cash flow from operations per share is calculated as 
cash flow from operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the period. Because 
cash flow from operations and cash flow from operations per share are not impacted by fluctuations in non-cash 
working  capital  balances,  we  believe  these  measures  are  more  indicative  of  operational  performance  than  cash 
from operating activities.

A  reconciliation  of  cash  flow  from  operations  to  the  GAAP  measured  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  is 
presented in the following table:

Restatement of first quarter results 
 
As  a  result  of  the  review  of  previous  accruals,  it  was  determined  that  the  Company  had  over-accrued  operating 
expenses  in  the  first  quarter  of  2016  by  $2,184.    The  impact  of  the  restatement  on  the  key  reporting  metrics  is 
detailed as follows:

For purposes of the June 30, 2016 financial statements and these MD&A, the Company has incorporated the above 
revisions into the six months data. 
 
 
Barrel of Oil Equivalents 
 
Where amounts are expressed in a barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”), or barrel of oil equivalent per day (“BOE/d”), 
natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent at six (6) thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) to one 
(1) barrel. Use of the term BOE may be misleading particularly if used in isolation. The BOE conversion ratio of 6

Mcf  to  1  barrel  (“Bbl”)  of  oil  or  natural  gas  liquids  is  based  on  an  energy  equivalency  conversion  methodology 
primarily applicable at the burner tip, and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion 
conforms to the Canadian Securities Regulators’ National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and 
Gas Activities. 
 
 
Amounts 
 
All dollar amounts quoted are in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. All share data is quoted in

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 
 
 
Financial 
 
Journey realized cash flow of $8,218 in the second quarter of 2016 bring the year to date amount to $11,547.  This 
translates into $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the quarter and $0.26 per basic and diluted share for the six 
months ended June 30.  Net loss was $ 9,714 for the quarter ($0.22 per basic and diluted share) and $15,104 for 
the six months ended June 30 ($0.35 per basic and diluted share).  Total capital expenditures were $4,421 during 
the quarter and brining the six months year-to-date total to $8,140.  Journey exited the period with a net debt of 
$103,477.  At the end of the quarter, Journey was drawn $100 million on its syndicated bank facility. 
 
Capital program 
 
During  the  second  quarter,  the  Company  did  not  complete  the  drilling  of  any new  wells.    However,  Journey  did 
perform optimization work on its assets and also closed the acquisition of an oil processing facility in Brooks.  The 
acquisition was concluded on June 24 for $3.5 million and included 200 boe/d of production (70% liquids) as well 
as key pipeline and water disposal infrastructure which will aid in the future development of Journey  lands in the 
area. 
 
Production 
 
For the second quarter, production volumes decreased by 19% to 8,640 BOE/day in 2016 from 10,609 BOE/day in 
2015.    For  the  comparable  six  months,  production  decreased  to  9,087  BOE/day  from  10,939  BOE/day.    The 
reduced drilling program due to low commodity prices has resulted in production naturally declining. 
 
Outlook 
 
While there has been some appreciation in oil and natural gas prices toward the end of the second  quarter and 
into the beginning of the third quarter, oil prices have recently begun to fall again.  Accordingly, the Company is 
being  cautiously  optimistic  about  the  near  future.    Preserving  the  balance  sheet  is  of  paramount  importance. 
Journey has embarked on a strategic rationalization of high cost properties and has partially used the proceeds to 
do accretive acquisitions such as the one in Brooks.  Journey still plans on spending approximately $9 million of net 
capital  during  2016,  after  talking  into  the  effects  of  $9  million  in  divestitures.    As  a  result  the  annual  average 
production remains at between 8,600 and 8,900 BOE/d despite the divestitures.  Cash flow from operations in now 
anticipated to be in the range of $24-26 million resulting in year-end net debt of between $86 and $88 million.

DETAILED FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
PRODUCTION REVENUE AND VOLUMES 
 
Aggregate production volumes decreased by 19% during the second quarter of 2016 to 786,268 BOE as compared 
to 965,461 BOE for the second quarter in 2015.  The decrease was attributable to pipeline curtailments during the 
quarter, economic shut-ins due to commodity prices, and no wells drilled.  For the six month comparative period, 
aggregate production volumes decreased by 16% from 1,979,988 BOE to 1,653,805 BOE. 
 
For  the quarter, natural gas production contributed  46% (2015 – 47%) of total  volumes, with oil at 47% (2015 – 
47%) and natural gas liquids at 7% (2015 – 6%).  Of the total volumes for the six months ended June 30, natural gas 
production contributed 45%, a 4% decrease from 2015, with oil at 48% as compared to 43% in 2015 and natural 
gas liquids at 7% compared to 6% in 2015.

United  States  natural  gas  prices  are  usually  referenced  to  the  New  York  Mercantile  Exchange  Henry  Hub  in 
Louisiana (NYMEX), while in Canada the generally recognized benchmark is the AECO hub in Alberta.  Gas prices 
are influenced by a variety of factors such as: weather patterns; LNG imports; supplies in western Alberta; demand 
in eastern Canada and the United States, relative storage levels in North America and alternative fuel sources.  As a 
result  of  warmer  than  usual  winter,  AECO  benchmark  pricing  was  47%  lower  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  as 
compared to  the same  period  in  2015.  This was combined with  a decrease in WTI prices of 21% over the same 
comparable periods.  The decrease in WTI oil prices were somewhat softened by a 5% depreciation in the Canadian 
dollar  against  the  US  dollar.    This  is  reflected  in  the  Edmonton  par  oil  prices  being  only  34%  lower  in  2016 
compared to 2015.  The differentials between WTI and Edmonton par have been in $3 - $4 CDN per barrel range 
during the quarter, but continue to be volatile.

Average  commodity prices decreased by 29% as compared to  the  second quarter in  2015.  The decline in prices 
were  led by the decrease in  natural gas prices  as they were 51% lower  in the  quarter as compared to  the same 
quarter in 2015.  Journey’s realized oil price decreased by 24% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 
with natural gas liquids prices decreasing significantly by 21% for the same comparable period.  For the six months 
ended  June  30,  2016  as  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2015,  Journey’s  average  realized  commodity  prices 
decreased by 30%.  Realized natural gas prices decreased by 43%, realized oil prices decreased by 28% and natural 
gas liquids prices also decreased by 23%.  The low oil prices in the first quarter reversed their trend in the second 
quarter and rose as WTI prices began to increase.  However, in July and August to date, WTI prices have started to 
decline again to the $40 USD level as refined product inventories have continued to rise with an unseasonably low 
consumption  rate  so  far  this  summer.    Natural  gas  prices  have  recently  showed  some  strength  with  a  warm 
summer in North America.  For the remainder of 2016, Journey is planning for oil and gas prices to be consistent 
with the current strip levels.

The fair value of Journey’s unrealized commodity contracts are based upon Level 2 inputs, having been provided by 
the  financial  intermediary  with  whom  the  transactions  were  completed  and  tested  by  management  for 
reasonableness  based  on  current  prices  and  market  data.  The  fair  value  of  financial  derivatives  are  recurring 
measurements and are determined using third-party models and valuation methodologies that utilize observable 
market data, including forward commodity prices and interest rates to estimate the current fair value of financial 
derivatives.  Journey  characterizes  inputs  used  in  determining  fair  value  using  a  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  inputs 
depending on the degree to which they are observable. The three levels are as follows:
Page 8
a)
b)
c)
Level  1  –  inputs  represent  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities.  Active 
markets  are  those  in  which  transactions  occur  in  sufficient  frequency  and  volume  to  provide  pricing 
information on an ongoing basis.
Level  2  –  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  in  Level  1  that  are  observable,  either  directly  or 
indirectly  as  of  the  reporting  date.  Level  2  valuations  are  based  on  inputs  which  can  be  observed  or 
corroborated  in  the  marketplace  from  sources  such  as  New  York  Mercantile  exchange  or  the  Natural 
Gas Exchange.
Level  3  –  inputs  are  less  observable,  unavailable  or  where  the  observable  data  does  not  support  the 
majority of the instruments fair value.
A  10%  change  in  commodity  prices  would  have  resulted  in  unrealized  gains  or  losses  on  commodity  contracts 
impacting net income by $6,402.
Journey  enters  into  commodity  based  derivative  contracts  to  actively  manage  the  risks  associated  with  price 
volatility and thereby partially protect cash flows, which are used to fund both our capital program and dividend 
payments. The risk associated with using these derivative contracts include: commodity prices moving materially in 
favour of the counter-party and the credit risk associated with the collection of settlements from price movements 
in Journey’s favour. Journey mitigates these risks by entering into risk management contracts for oil, natural gas 
and foreign exchange.
PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (“P&NG”) SALES 
 
In the second quarter of 2016, aggregate P&NG sales decreased by 42% to $20,450 as compared to $35,329 for the 
same period in 2015.  The decrease was largely due to a 29% reduction in realized commodity prices.  For the six 
months ended June 30, aggregate P&NG sales decreased by 42% to $38,505 in 2016 from $66,283 in 2015.  For the 
six months, the decrease in P&NG sales was primarily the result of a 30% decrease in average commodity prices, 
but was also the result of a 17% decrease in production volumes.  Realized prices decreased for oil (24%), natural 
gas (51%) and natural gas liquids (21%) over the comparative quarters and also decreased for oil (28%), natural gas 
(43%) and natural gas liquids (23%) over the comparative six month periods.

ROYALTIES 
 
For the second quarter royalties were $1,352 in 2016 as compared to $4,039 for the same period in 2015.  On a 
per BOE basis, the royalty rate decreased to $1.72 in 2016 as compared to $4.18 from last year.  As a percentage of 
revenue,  the  rate  for  the  second  quarter  of  2016  was  6.6%  or  42%  lower  than  the  11.4%  realized  in  2015.    The 
drop in these rates is a direct impact of lower commodity prices experienced over the same periods as well as the 
recognition of annual gas cost allowance adjustments. 
 
For  the six months ended June 30, royalties were $3,579  in  2016 as compared to $8,154 for the same period in 
2015.  On a per BOE basis, the royalty rate decreased 48% to $2.16 in 2016 as compared to $4.12 from last year.  
As a percentage of revenue, the rate for 2016 was 9.3% or 30% lower than the 12.3% realized in 2015. 
 
On  Crown  royalty  lands  in  Alberta  horizontal  oil  wells  are  subject  to  a  maximum  5%  royalty  rate  for  18  to  48 
months or 50,000 to 100,000 BOE of production, whichever comes first, and depending on the measured depth of 
the  well.    During  the  first  six  months  of  2016  Crown  royalty  rates  decreased  primarily  as  a  result  of  lower 
commodity prices.  Journey is anticipating a corporate royalty rate  of approximately 10% for the balance of 2016 
based  on  Journey’s  internal  forecast  of  oil  prices  and  anticipated  productivity  of  its  wells.    However,  this  could 
change  significantly  as  Crown  royalty  rates  are  dependent  on  a  combination  of  realized  commodity  prices  and 
specific well production volumes.

OPERATING EXPENSE 
 
Operating costs were $8,743 or $11.12 per BOE for the second quarter in 2016 as compared to $14,120, or $14.63 
per  BOE  in  2015.    Aggregate  operating  costs  decreased  by  38%  reflecting  improved  efficiencies,  cost  reductions 
from suppliers and a 19% reduction in produced volumes.  For the six months ended June 30, operating costs were 
$18,885 or $11.42 per BOE in 2016 as compared to $28,925, or $14.61 per BOE in 2015.  The six months ended 
June  30,  2016  includes  a  downward  adjustment  of  $2,184  resulting  from  the  correction  of  an  over-accrual  in 
operating  expenses  in  the  first  quarter  (see  “Restatement”  section  for  a  full  description  on  this  matter).    The 
Company  continually  reviews  field  activities  to  derive  efficiencies  and  scalability  in  its  operations.    For  the 
remainder  of  2016,  Journey  expects  the  per  BOE  rate  to  average  in  the  high  $12  range  as  Journey  will  have 
divested itself of higher operating cost properties throughout July and August.

TRANSPORTATION 
 
Transportation expenses were $333 for the second quarter of 2016, and amounted to 1.6% of P&NG sales for the 
period as compared to $588 and 1.7% for 2015.  The cost per BOE averaged $0.42 in 2016, which is 31% lower than 
the same period in 2015.  For the six months ended June 30, transportation expenses were $677 for 2016 or 59% 
lower than $1,653 for the comparable period in 2015.  On a per BOE basis costs were $0.41 or 51% lower than the 
$0.83 incurred in 2015.  Aggregate transportation costs are lower in 2016 as the trucking market has become more 
competitive  and  better  rates  in  all  producing  regions  were  realized.    Transportation  costs  include:  clean  oil 
trucking,  trucking  of  natural  gas  liquids,  and  transportation  associated  with  the  usage  of  third  party  natural  gas 
sales lines used before custody transfer and sale of the gas.   Transportation costs are dependent on a variety of 
factors such as: the type of production facilities; the method of transportation; the distances covered; quantities 
shipped; the type of service offered (interruptible versus firm service) as well as ownership of the transportation 
facilities.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (G&A) EXPENSE 
 
For  the quarter,  net G&A expense after recoveries, decreased  28% to $2,292 in  2016  from $3,181 in  2015.  The 
decrease  was  significantly  attributable  to  the  cost  cutting  measures  including  staff  reductions  during  the  first 
quarter.  The second quarter was the first full quarter of the realized reductions.   For the six months ended June 
30, 2016 net G&A expense remained flat at $6,154 as compared to $6,189 for the comparable six month period in 
2015.    Included  in  the  six  month  results  are  $1,070  of  severance  costs  resulting  from  Journey’s  staff  reduction 
program.  On a per BOE basis, Journey realized net G&A of $2.91 for the second quarter of 2016, 12% lower than 
the $3.29 realized in 2015.  This slight increase reflects the lower volumes associated with the quarter.  For the six 
months ended June 30, net G&A was $3.72 in 2016 or 19% higher than $3.13 in 2015.  On a per BOE basis, net G&A 
is expected to be in the low $3.00 range for the balance of 2016.

FINANCE EXPENSE 
 
Net  finance  expense  is  comprised  of  interest  on  bank  debt,  amortization  of  financing  fees,  accretion  on 
decommissioning obligations, and other bank charges.  Interest expense and bank fees for the second quarter of 
2016  increased  37%  to  $1,172  from  $853  in  2015.    For  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  the  average  bank  debt 
outstanding was $97,867 which was a 10% increase from $88,791 for the comparable period in 2015.  Due to the 
combination of increased borrowing costs from the banks as well as the decrease in cash flows from 2015 and the 
resultant move to a higher level in its interest cost pricing grid, the effective interest rate on outstanding bank debt 
for the quarter increased by 23% to 4.8% in 2016 from 3.9% in 2015.  On a per BOE basis, net finance expense was 
$1.49 for 2016 as compared to $0.88 for 2015, representing a 69% increase period over period. 
 
For  the  comparable  six  month  period,  cash  finance  expenses  for  2016  increased  20%  to  $2,082  from  $1,731  in 
2015.  The average interest rate on outstanding bank debt increased to 4.4% in the first six months of 2016 from 
4.1%  in  2015.    On  a  per  BOE  basis,  cash  finance  expense  was  $1.26  for  2016  as  compared  to  $0.87  for  2015, 
representing a 45% increase. 
 
For the balance of 2016 Journey expects the average bank debt outstanding to decrease as Journey divests some 
non-core assets in July and August and repays outstanding debt.  In addition, Journey plans on spending less than 
its cash flow on its capital program and concentrates on strengthening the balance sheet during these periods of 
uncertain commodity prices.

SHARE BASED COMPENSATION 
 
Share based compensation expense was $835 for the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $842 in 2015.  For 
the six months ending June 30, the expense was $1,559 for 2016, a decrease of 16% over the $1,855 expensed in 
2015.    During  the  second  quarter,  the  Company  capitalized  $111  of  share  based  compensation  expense  as 
compared  to  $328  in  2015.    The  capitalization  is  attributable  to  technical  staff,  who  are  directly  related  to 
exploration  and  development  activities  and  is  lower  in  2016  due  to  reduced  activity  levels.    The  fair  value  of  all 
stock options is amortized over the options’ vesting period.  In the second quarter of 2016, 572 stock options were 
granted  at  an  average  strike  price  of  $1.91  per  option.    As  well,  210  stock  options  were  forfeited  at  an  average 
strike price of $6.57 per option.  The decrease in the expense for the six month period is attributable to the 2012 
options and performance warrants reaching their full amortization.

DEPLETION AND DEPRECIATION (“D&D”) 
 
Aggregate  D&D  decreased  from  $12,452  in  the  second  quarter  of  2015  to  $7,385  in  2016.    The  41%  decrease 
primarily reflects the reduced carrying values attributable to the impairment recorded at December 31, 2015 but 
also reflects the decrease in production volumes.  For the quarter, and on a per BOE basis, D&D was $9.39 for 2016 
as compared to of $12.90 in 2015, representing a 27% decrease. 
 
For the six months ending June 30, aggregate D&D decreased 41% from $25,363 in 2015 to $14,909 in 2016.  On a 
per BOE basis D&D was $9.01 in 2016, a 29% decrease from $12.76 in 2015.

period in 2015.  On a per BOE basis, the recovery decreased 56% to $4.17 from a recovery of $9.40 in 2015.  For 
the six months ended June 30, deferred income tax  recovery for 2016 was $4,884 as compared to  a recovery of 
$9,783 for the same period in 2015.  On a per BOE basis, the decrease was 40% to $2.95 from a recovery of $4.94 
in 2015.  The decrease in both the three and six month periods was attributable to lower net loss realized.

NETBACKS 
 
Operating  netback  of  $12.75  per  BOE  for  the  second  quarter  of  2016  decreased  by  26%  as  compared  to  $17.17 
realized for the same period in 2015.  For the six months ended June 30, the operating netback was $9.29 per BOE 
for 2016 which was a 33% decrease from $13.92 for 2015.  Significant decreases in realized commodity prices were 
somewhat  offset  by  decreases  to  royalties  and  operating  costs.    This  effect  was  compounded  in  the  six  month 
period as daily volumes also increased period over period. 
 
Cash flow netback per BOE for the second quarter was 28% lower in 2016 than 2015.  The main contributor to the 
decrease was a 29% decrease in average commodity prices realized.  Journey’s cash cost cutting measures in the 
face of declining commodity prices have had their desired impact as the controllable costs, transportation, lease 
operating  and  G&A  all  declined  by  31%,  24%  and  12%  respectively.    Realized  hedging  gains  were  37%  higher 
contributing $2.11 to our cash flow netback of $10.46 per boe.  For the six months, cash flow netback decreased by 
56% from $15.86 per BOE in 2015 to $6.98 in 2016.  For the balance of 2016, cash flow netbacks are expected to 
improve  as  natural  gas  prices  have  shown  recent  strength  and  Journey  believes  its  cash  costs  will  also  decrease 
primarily lead by operating cost reductions due to the disposal of higher operating cost properties.   
 
After  including  the  non-cash  items  the  net  income  netback  for  the  second  quarter  of  2015  of  $7.09  per  BOE 
became  a  loss  of  $12.34  per  boe.    Most  of  this  loss  is  attributable  unrealized  losses  on  derivative  contracts  of 
$12.80 per BOE.   Realizations on these contracts may or  may not  be  comparable to this amount  as the  mark-to 
market value is measured at the end of the reporting period.

$11,547 in 2016.  The decrease was largely attributable, period over period, to a 42% decrease of P&NG sales for 
both the second quarter and six months ended June 30.  There was net income for the three months ended June 
30, 2015 of $6,846  as compared to  a  net  loss of $9,714 in 2016.  For  the six month period, the net income was 
$3,474 in 2015 as compared with a net loss of $15,104 in 2016.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
 
Journey spent  $966 on capital expenditures (before acquisitions/dispositions) during the second quarter of 2016 
representing  a  decrease  of  80%  from  $4,752  in  2015.    There  were  no  wells  drilled  during  the  quarter  which  is 
reflective of the scaled back capital program as cash was conserved to reduce bank debt.  For the first six months 
of 2016, $4,057 was spent on capital expenditures (before acquisitions/dispositions), a decrease of 82% from the 
$22,343 spent in 2015.

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 
 
As at June 30, 2016 the Company had initiated a process for the disposition of certain non-core assets and, as such, 
are classified as assets held for sale at the end of the period.  The assets consist of the Company’s entire interests 
in the Manola, Enchant and Majorville CGU’s as well as properties in the Herronton, Peace River Arch, Pine Creek 
and Pincher creek CGU’s.  All of these dispositions are considered to be highly probable before the next reporting 
period and accordingly are reported at their carrying value.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
Corporate  working  capital  liquidity  is  maintained  by  drawing  from  the  unutilized  facility  as  needed  and  then 
repaying it periodically through production revenues. As new reserves are added and as the financing needs of the 
Company are expanded, Journey may apply for interim reviews of the credit facility with a view to upgrading it.

For  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  funded  its  net  cash  capital  expenditures  from 
cash flow from operations, increase in debt and changes in non-cash working capital. 
 
The  reduction  in  commodity  prices  and  the  expectation  of  reduced  cash  flows  for  the  balance  of  the  year  have 
caused  the  Company  to  re-assess  and  reduce  its  remaining  capital  expenditure  program  for  the  year.    Journey 
currently has a future drilling inventory of over 280 identified locations to exploit in future years. The Company will 
fund  its  future  capital  programs  through  a  combination  of  cash  flows  from  operations  as  well  as  the  unutilized 
bank lines. 
 
As at June 30, 2016, Journey had a $110,000 credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This facility was comprised of 
a  production  facility  of  $95,000  and  a  working  capital  facility  of  $15,000.  The  production  and  working  capital 
facility are available on a revolving basis until the maturity of the facility on April 29, 2017, which is the next annual 
review and renewal date. As a condition of the most recent annual review, the Company’s credit facility is reduced 
by the amount of any proceeds from the disposition of assets, equity issuances or other debt issuances. As of the 
date  hereof,  the  available  credit  facility  is  $103,933  with  approximately  $89,000  drawn.  Advances  under  the 
production  facility  are  available  by  way  of  prime  rate  loans  with  interest  rates  of  between  1.0  percent  and  4.5 
percent over the banks’ prime lending rates. Borrowings in excess of $75,000 carry a 3.0% premium to the regular 
price grid. In addition to these prime rate advances, the Company has access to bankers’ acceptances and LIBOR 
loans, which are subject to stamping fees and margins ranging from 2.0 percent to 5.5 percent and depending on 
the debt to cash flow ratio as calculated at the Company’s immediately preceding quarters’ end. Standby fees are 
charged  on  the  undrawn  facilities  at  rates  ranging  from  0.5  percent  to  1.375  percent  depending  on  the  debt  to 
cash  flow  ratio  as  calculated  at  the  Company’s  immediately  preceding  quarters’  end.  The  effective  annualized 
interest rate for the period ended June 30, 2016 was 4.8% (2015 – 4.1%). At June 30, 2016 the Company had an 
outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $375 that expires June 30, 2017. 
 
The credit facilities are secured by a $500,000 fixed and floating charge debenture over the petroleum and natural 
gas properties and all other assets of Journey.  The facilities are subject to a semi-annual review, at which time the 
lenders  may  re-determine  the  borrowing  base.    The  next  semi-annual  review  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  by 
October 31, 2016.  In addition, there are certain customary non-financial covenants in its credit facility agreement. 
Journey is in compliance with all covenants as at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 
Corporate  working  capital  liquidity  is  repaid  and  thereby  maintained  by  drawing  from  the  unutilized  facility  as 
needed  and  then  repaying  it  periodically  through  production  revenues.  While  Journey  believes  it  currently  has 
sufficient liquidity to carry on its operations, it is Management’s intention to enhance the financial position of the 
Company  and  has  embarked  on  a  variety  of  initiatives  to  ensure  the  Company’s  liquidity.  These  initiatives  have 
included the following: a new debt structure; equity issuances; asset divestitures; further cost reduction strategies; 
and capital management initiatives. It is possible that the syndicate will not renew the facility at maturity or will 
renew it at a lower level than what is currently drawn. Should a renewal not occur, or if renewed and the amount
Page 17
renewed  is  below  the  amount  drawn,  all  of  the  facility,  or  the  portion  of  the  facility  that  is  below  the  drawn 
amount  will  come  due  at  the  maturity  date.  While  Management  believes  that  a  renewal  of  the  facility  is  likely, 
and/or  that  the  Company  can  find  alternative  financing,  there  is  no  assurance  that  such  a  refinancing  will  be 
successful. Should this be the case the entire facility will come due on April 29, 2017. 
 
 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
Journey had the following related party transactions during the six month period ended June 30, 2016: 
 
Journey had the following related party transactions  with Gas Lite Energy Inc. (“Gas Lite”).  Journey and Gas Lite 
are related by virtue of a common significant shareholder and a common director.
(a)  Pursuant to an administration agreement between Gas Lite Energy Inc. (“Gas Lite”), Journey charges a fee for 
managing the assets of  Gas Lite. For  the period ended June 30, 2016 the  management  fee  was $250 (2015  - 
$100) of which $125 was still in the Company’s receivables.
(b)  Journey owns a proportionate 1% interest in, and is the operator of, certain oil and gas properties with Gas Lite 
owning the remaining 99% interest. As the operator of these properties Journey receives all revenues and pays 
all expenses on behalf of the joint venture. Gas Lite’s net share of revenues and expenses are billed to them on 
a  monthly  basis.  As  at  the  current  reporting  period,  a  net  receivable  has  accumulated  from  Gas  Lite  in  the 
amount  of  $2,238  for  operational  losses  and  administration  fees  for  the  period  of  April  1,  2016  to  June  30, 
2016.
As at June 30, 2016 Journey had an outstanding receivable from Gas Lite of $1,279 (2015 - $2,105).  As at the date 
of these MD&A, this entire outstanding amount has been paid. 
 
The related party transactions above were recorded at the above disclosed exchange amounts and provides 
Journey with the ability to reduce its G&A costs.

Note 1: The March 31, 2016 results have been revised to correct to the overstatement of operating expenses by 
$2,184. 
 
Petroleum  and  natural  gas  sales  are  impacted  by  production  levels  and  volatile  commodity  pricing.  Production 
levels are impacted by decline rates and the Company’s capital program. Commodity prices are affected by both 
domestic  and  international  factors  that  are  beyond  the  Company’s  control.  Petroleum  and  natural  gas  sales  are 
impacted  by  production  levels  and  the  volatility  of  commodity  pricing.  In  addition,  royalties  are  affected  by  the 
underlying commodity pricing.  
 
Significant  factors  and  trends  that  have  affected  the  Company’s  results  during  the  above  periods  are  outlined 
below:

The second quarter of 2016 saw average Journey commodity prices appreciate by 25% from the first 
quarter. Leading the way was a 43% increase in realized oil prices and a 23% increase in NGL prices. The 
price appreciation coupled with the cost savings strategies, this led to an increase in cash flow from 
$3,329 in the first quarter to $8,218 in the second quarter. Journey concentrated on debt reduction and 
consequently spent only $965 in capital during the quarter. Journey did not drill any wells in the quarter. 
Due to the lack of drilling, the Company’s production declined from 9,533 BOE/d in the first quarter to 
8,640 BOE/d in the second quarter. Towards the end of the second quarter the Company embarked on a 
strategic acquisition and divestiture program, which when fully implemented in August are expected to 
yield better operating cost synergies going forward.


The first quarter of 2016 experienced further declines in commodity prices across all product types. On 
average realized prices were 32% lower than the previous quarter. Capital spending was reduced to 
maintenance capital and the drilling of 1 (1.0 net) commitment well in Skiff. Total capital spent in the 
quarter was $3,719. The reduced capital program had minimal impact on production levels compared to 
the fourth quarter of 2015 with production coming in at 9,533 BOE/d as compared to 9,593 in the fourth 
quarter of 2015. Declines will start having their impact in the second quarter. The realized cash flow in the 
quarter was $3,329 as a result of the depressed commodity prices. 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, production volumes decreased by 2% or 193 BOE per day to 9,593 BOE per 
day from 9,786 BOE per day the third quarter.  During the quarter, average realized commodity prices 
decreased by $3.45 per BOE or 11%.  Combined, this resulted in a decrease to P&NG sales of 13% or 
$3,609 from the previous quarter.  Operating netback per BOE was 18% higher than Q3, due to a

combined 26% decrease in operating costs and royalties more than offsetting reduced P&NG sales.  As a 
result, cash flow netback per BOE was 8% higher over the previous quarter.  There were five (3.1 net) 
wells drilled during the fourth quarter as compared to five (4.4 net) wells in the third quarter. 
 
In the third quarter of 2015, production volumes decreased by 9% or 823 BOE per day from the second 
quarter of 2015.  Average realized commodity prices decreased by $4.81 per BOE resulting in a 20% 
decrease to P&NG sales of $6,712 from the previous quarter.  Operating netback per BOE was 32% lower 
than Q2, primarily due to decreased realized commodity prices.  This resulted in a 34% lower cash flow 
netback per BOE from the previous quarter.  There were five (4.4 net) wells drilled during the third 
quarter as compared to no new wells in the second quarter.  During the quarter, pursuant to the Normal 
Course Issuer Bid, 1,267 common shares of the Company were purchased and retired for a total cash 
consideration of $2,133. 
 
In the second quarter of 2015, production volumes decreased by 6% or 664 BOE per day from the first 
quarter of 2015.  Average realized commodity prices increased by $6.08 per BOE resulting in a 14% 
increase to P&NG sales of $4,374 over the previous quarter.  Operating netback per BOE was 59% higher 
than Q1, primarily due to increased realized commodity prices.  However, the cash flow netback per BOE 
in the quarter was 15% lower than the first quarter, due to a significant reduction of realized hedging 
gains.  There were no new wells drilled in the quarter as compared to 6 (5.7 net) in the previous quarter. 
 
In the first quarter of 2015, production volumes decreased by 500 BOE per day over the fourth quarter of 
2014, with average commodity prices decreasing significantly by $14.05 per BOE.  P&NG sales decreased 
36% from the previous quarter.  Operating netback per BOE was 54% lower than Q4, 2014 primarily due 
to  reduced  commodity  prices.    However,  the  cash  flow  netback  per  BOE  in  the  quarter  was  24%  lower 
than the fourth quarter, 214 as a result of realized hedging gains.  Six (5.7 net) wells were drilled in the 
quarter with a 100% success rate as compared to 4 (2.8 net) in the previous quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, production volumes increased by 771 BOE per day over the fourth quarter, 
however  average  commodity  prices  decreased  significantly  by  $14.56  per  BOE.  For  the  quarter,  overall 
P&NG sales decreased 19%. Operating netback per BOE was 36% lower than Q3 primarily due to reduced 
P&NG sales. However, cash flow netback per BOE in the quarter was only 20% lower than Q3 as a result of 
realized hedging gains. Four (2.8 net) wells were drilled in the quarter with an 82% (net) success rate as 
compared to 8 (4.1 net) in Q3.
In  the  third  quarter  of  2014,  production  volumes  decreased  marginally  from  the  second  quarter  and 
average  commodity  prices  decreased  as  well.  For  the  quarter,  overall  P&NG  sales  decreased  6%. 
Operating  netback  per  BOE  was  only  2%  lower  than  Q2  due  to  reduced  operating  costs  and  royalties. 
However, cash flow netback per BOE in the quarter  was 20% higher than Q2 as a result of reductions in 
G&A  expenses,  finance  expenses  and  realized  hedging  losses.  Twelve  (9.6  net)  wells  were  drilled  in  the 
quarter with a 100% success rate as compared to 7 (6.0 net) in Q2.
Production volumes and commodity  prices for all products increased during the second quarter of 2014 
reflecting  a  full  quarter  effect  of  the  Q1  acquisition.  While  average  realized  prices  decreased  slightly, 
overall P&NG sales were up 49% for the quarter. Operating netback per BOE was 22% lower than Q1 due 
to increased operating costs and royalties associated with the new assets. Cash flow netback per BOE in 
the quarter was 55% lower than Q1 as a result of increased finance expenses and realized hedging losses. 
Eight (7 net) well were drilled in the quarter with a 100% success rate.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
The consolidated  financial statements for the three  months ended  June 30, 2016 have been prepared using the 
same accounting policies and methods as those used in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 
A summary of the significant accounting policies used by Journey can be found in Note 3 of the December 31, 2015 
audited consolidated financial statements. Note 4 of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for 
the  year  ended  December  31,  2015  discloses  the  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  complexity,  or 
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Company’s financial statements. The December 31, 
2015, audited consolidated financial statements are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.  
 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and 
reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  By  their  nature,  these  estimates  are 
subject  to  measurement  uncertainty  and  the  effect  on  the  financial  statements  of  changes  in  such  estimates  in 
future  periods  could  be  material.  Estimates  and  judgments  are  continuously  evaluated  and  are  based  on 
management’s  experience  and  other  factors,  including  expectations  of  future  events  that  are  believed  to  be 
reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can materially differ from these estimates.  
 
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Effective  January  1,  2016  the  Company  adopted  the  amendments  to  International  Accounting  Standards  Board 
(“IASB”) IFRS 11 “Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations” which provided specific guidance on 
the accounting for the acquisition  of an interest  in a  joint operation that is a  business.  Journey determined that 
there is no material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
Effective  January  1,  2016  the  Company  adopted  the  amendments  to  International  Accounting  Standards  Board 
(“IASB”)  IAS  1  “Presentation  of  Financial  Statements”  which  clarify  guidance  on  materiality,  use  of  subtotals, 
aggregation and disaggregation of financial statement line items, the order of the notes to the financial statements 
and  disclosure  of  significant  policies.  Journey  determined  that  there  is  no  material  impact  on  the  Company’s 
financial statements. 
 
Effective  January  1,  2016  the  Company  adopted  the  amendments  to  International  Accounting  Standards  Board 
(“IASB”)  IFRS  7  “Financial  Instrument  Disclosures”  which  clarify  whether  a  servicing  contract  is  continuing 
involvement in an transferred asset for the purpose of determining the disclosure required and the applicability of 
amendments  to  IFRS  7  on  offsetting  disclosures  to  condensed  interim  financial  statements.  Journey  determined 
that there is no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Page 22
Effective  January  1,  2016  the  Company  adopted  the  amendments  to  International  Accounting  Standards  Board 
(“IASB”) IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” which clarifies the requirements relating to information required by 
IAS  34  that  is  presented  within  the  financial  report  but  outside  the  interim  financial  statements.  Journey 
determined that there is no material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
Future Changes in Accounting Standards 
 
On January 13, 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, “Leases” (“IFRS 16”), which requires entities to recognize lease assets 
and lease obligations on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 removes the classification of leases as either operating leases 
or finance leases for the lessee, effectively, treating all leases as finance leases. Short term leases of less than 12 
months  and  leases  of  low  value  assets  are  exempt  from  the  requirements  and  can  continue  to  be  treated  as 
operating leases. Lessors will continue with the dual classification and that classification will determine how and 
when lease revenue will be recognized and what assets will be recorded. IFRS 16 is effective for years beginning on 
or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 “Revenue From Contracts With Customers” has 
already been adopted. Journey is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 on the Company’s financial statements 
and the merit of early adoption. 
 
On January 29, 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS  7, “Statement  of Cash Flows” (“IAS 7”),  which  require 
disclosure  of  information  enabling  users  of  financial  statements  to  evaluate  changes  in  liabilities  arising  from 
financing activities. IAS 7 is to be applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017. 
Journey is currently assessing the impact of IAS 7 on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
On April 12, 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“IFRS 15”). 
The amendments address implementation questions that were discussed by the Joint Transition Resource Group 
for  revenue  recognition  regarding;  identifying  performance  obligations,  application  guidance  on  principal  versus 
agent  and  licenses  of  intellectual  property  and  transition.  The  amendments  are  also  intended  to  ensure  a  more 
consistent application and reduce costs and complexity of adoption.  Journey is currently assessing the impact of 
IFRS 15 on the Company’s financial statements and the merit of early adoption. 
 
 
RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
 
The risks in the oil and gas industry are varied and wide-ranging. The primary risks and how the Company mitigates 
them are as follows:  
 
Commodity Price Risk 
The Company’s operating results and financial condition are dependent  on prices received for the production of 
natural gas, NGL and oil.  Commodity prices have historically been subject to wide fluctuations and have the most 
material impact on funds flow.  These prices are determined by supply and demand factors including: weather and 
general economic conditions in places that Journey does not operate and therefore are largely outside of Journey’s 
control.    Prices  received  in  Canada  also  reflect  changes  in  the  Canadian/US  currency  exchange  rate.    Journey’s 
strategy to mitigate these risks focuses on the use of puts, swaps, costless collars and fixed price contracts to limit 
exposure to downturns in commodity prices while allowing, to the maximum extent possible, maximum exposure 
to commodity price increases.  The Company’s hedging activities are conducted pursuant  to the Company’s Risk 
Management  policy approved by the Board of  Directors.   Revenues and the resulting  funds flows fluctuate with 
commodity  prices,  which  are  tied  directly  to  the  US/Canadian  dollar  exchange  rate.    Commodity  prices  are 
determined on a global basis and circumstances that occur in various parts of the world are outside of the control 
of the Company.  The Company protects itself from fluctuations in prices by maintaining an appropriate hedging 
strategy,  diversifying  its  asset  mix  and  strengthening  its  balance  sheet  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  low  price 
environments by making strategic acquisitions.  Journey enters into commodity price contracts to actively manage
Page 23
the  risks  associated  with  price  volatility  and  thereby  partially  protect  funds  flows,  which  are  used  to  fund  our 
capital program.  
 
The risk associated with using these derivative contracts include: commodity prices moving materially in favor of 
the  counter-party  and  the  credit  risk  associated  with  the  collection  of  settlements  from  price  movements  in 
Journey’s  favor.    Journey  mitigates  these  risks  by  entering  mainly  into  collar  transactions  that  give  acceptable 
ranges of prices and furthermore by dealing with its chartered banks as the primary counterparty. 
 
Foreign Exchange Risk  
Journey  is  also  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate  between  the  Canadian  and  US  dollar.    Most 
commodity prices are based on US dollar benchmarks, which result in our realized prices being influenced by the 
Canadian/U.S. currency exchange rates.  
 
Credit Risk  
Credit risk arises from the potential loss resulting from a counterparty failing to meet its obligations in accordance 
with  the  agreed  terms.    The  Company  may  be  exposed  to  third  party  credit  risk  through  its  contractual 
arrangements  with  its  current  or  future  joint  venture  partners,  marketers  of  its  petroleum  and  natural  gas 
production and other parties.  In the event such entities fail to meet their contractual obligations to the Company, 
such  failures  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of 
operations and prospects. 
 
Poor  credit  conditions  in  the  industry  and  of  joint  venture  partners  may  impact  a  joint  venture  partner's 
willingness  to  participate  in  the  Company's  ongoing  capital  program,  potentially  delaying  the  program  and  the 
results of such program until the Company finds a  suitable alternative partner.  Substantially  all of the accounts 
receivable are with its marketers and joint venture partners in the oil and gas industry and are subject to normal 
industry  credit  risks.    The  Company  generally  extends  unsecured  credit  to  these  parties  and  therefore,  the 
collection  of  accounts  receivable  may  be  affected  by  changes  in  economic  or  other  conditions.    Management 
believes  the  risk  is  mitigated  by  entering  into  transactions  with  long-standing,  reputable,  counterparties  and 
partners. In many cases, the Company has offsetting receivables and payables with its joint venture partners and 
makes use of these offsets to mitigate any payment risk.  Wherever possible, the Company requires cash calls from 
its partners on capital projects before they commence.  On a regular basis, the Company assesses the potential for 
bad debts associated with these parties and provides for accordingly. 
 
Receivables  related  to  the  sale  of  the  Company’s  petroleum  and  natural  gas  production  are  mainly  from  major 
marketing companies who have excellent credit ratings.  These revenues are normally collected on the 25th day of 
the month following delivery.  
 
The  counter-parties  with  which  the  Company  maintains  its  risk  management  contracts  are  major  Canadian 
chartered banks having investment grade rating.  
 
Credit Facility Risk  
As  at  the  date  of  these  MD&A  the  Company  has  a  revolving  bank  credit  facility  for  $103,933.    The  facility  is  a 
revolving facility from a syndicate of lenders with a maturity date of April 28, 2017.  Given the decline in oil prices 
from  those  realized  in  2015,  lenders  have  generally  reduced  their  borrowing  base  calculations  for  the  industry. 
While Journey believes it currently has sufficient liquidity to carry on its operations, it is Management’s intention 
to  enhance  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  and  has  embarked  on  a  variety  of  initiatives  to  ensure  the 
Company’s  liquidity.  These initiatives  have  included the following: a  new debt  structure; equity issuances; asset 
divestitures; further cost reduction strategies; and capital management initiatives. The current credit facility has a 
maturity  date  of  April  29,  2017.    It  is  possible  that  the  syndicate  will  not  renew  the  facility  or  will  renew  it  at  a 
lower level than what is currently drawn. Should a renewal not occur, or if renewed and the amount renewed is 
below the amount drawn, all of the facility, or the portion of the facility that is below the drawn amount will come 
due  at  the  maturity  date.    While  Management  believes  that  a  renewal  of  the  facility  is  likely,  and/or  that  the
Page 24
Company can find alternative financing, there is no assurance that such a  refinancing  will be  successful.   Should 
this be the case the entire facility will come due on April 29, 2017. 
 
Access to Capital Markets  
The  Company’s  business  plan  includes  the  making  of  significant  capital  expenditures  for  the  acquisition, 
exploration,  development  and  production  of  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  in  the  future.    As  funds  flow  from 
operations  may  not  be  sufficient  to  fund  its  ongoing  activities  at  all  times,  the  Company  may  require  additional 
financing in order to carry out its oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development activities over and above its 
lending facility.  Failure to obtain such financing on a timely basis could cause the Company to forfeit its interest in 
certain  properties,  miss  out  on  acquisition  opportunities,  and  reduce  or  terminate  operations.    There  can  be  no 
assurance  that  debt  or  equity  financing,  or  cash  generated  by  operations  will  be  available  or  sufficient  to  meet 
these requirements or for other corporate purposes or, if debt  or equity financing is available, that it will be on 
terms acceptable to the Company.  The inability of the Company to access sufficient capital for its operations could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
Should circumstances affect the funds flow from operations in a detrimental way, the Company would respond by 
increasing  debt  within  the  Company’s  self-imposed  debt  guideline  and/or  reducing  capital  expenditures.    The 
Company relies on various sources of funding to support its capital expenditure program including:
Internally generated funds flows;
 
  Debt may be utilized to expand capital programs when deemed appropriate; and 
  Additional  equity,  if  available  and  on  terms  acceptable  to  the  Company,  may  be  used  to  expand  or
support exploration and development programs and fund acquisitions.
Interest Rate Risk  
Journey is exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk arises from changes in market interest rates that 
may  affect  the  future  funds  flows  from  the  Company’s  financial  assets  or  liabilities.    The  Company’s  revolving 
demand  loan  facility  is  subject  to  floating  rates  and  is  therefore  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  the  market  rates  of 
interest.  
 
The maturing Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin  
Land and producing assets are becoming increasingly scarce and more expensive.  The Company mitigates these 
risks  by  developing  its  core  areas  to  gain  efficiencies.    In  addition,  the  Company  participates  in  several  farm-in 
opportunities  wherein  its  exposure  to  increasing  land  prices  is  minimized.    For  riskier,  exploration  projects,  the 
Company will solicit partner participation to limit the downside exposure.  
 
Increasing United States Oil and Natural Gas Supply  
Over the last several years, the advent of multi-stage fracking has unlocked previously uneconomic oil and natural 
gas supplies that are readily available in the United States.  The Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford shale gas 
plays  in  the  Eastern  United  States  and  the  Bakken  in  North  Dakota  have  created  a  supply  within  the  major 
consuming regions of the United  States.   This has  caused  a  reduction in demand from  Western Canada  and this 
could possibly continue for many years to come.  As a result, the Company has shifted capital to oil targets on its 
existing lands and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.  
 
Operating and finding and development costs are decreasing each year  
The industry has experienced decreased costs for services in the past year.  Demand for all services decreased as 
companies had to become more efficient in the drilling activities due to low commodity prices and demanded price 
reductions  from  all  service  suppliers.    The  Company  mitigates  risks  by  entering  into  strategic  joint  ventures  to 
reduce exposure to high costs and diversify drilling risks.  The Company employs experienced and motivated staff 
to  evaluate  and  generate  high  quality  drilling  prospects.    In  addition  the  Company  seeks  to  utilize  appropriate 
technology  and  responsible  operating  practices  in  operating  its  wells.    The  Company  utilizes  appropriate  safety 
programs and insurance coverage to guard against potential losses.  Concentrating on core areas wherein Journey

has high degrees of ownership and operatorship further mitigates increasing operating costs as economies of scale 
are gained.  Journey attempts to minimize finding risk by:
Focusing its efforts on its core areas wherein its expertise and experiences can be properly leveraged;
 
  Generating as many internal projects as possible;  
  Being the operator on the majority of projects;  
 
  Making prudent use of seismic data to identify prospects – either by purchasing trade data or by shooting
Identifying drilling opportunities with multi-zone prospects; and
new seismic.
Administrative Risks  
The  increased  transparency  required  by  the  securities  regulators  and  constantly  evolving  accounting  guidelines 
dictate significant resources be devoted to these areas.  Journey maintains processes designed to comply with the 
required disclosures; has a strong Board of Directors and engages technical advisors to assist in meeting securities 
guidelines.    In  addition,  the  industry  will  continue  to  experience  competitiveness  with  respect  to  finding  and 
retaining qualified employees.  Retention issues are at least partially mitigated by having all employees participate 
in its LTI program and paying competitive salaries. 
 
Competition  
The petroleum industry is competitive in all its phases. The Company competes with numerous other organizations 
in the search for, and the acquisition of, oil and natural gas properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas.  
The  Company's  competitors  include  oil  and  natural  gas  companies  that  have  substantially  greater  financial 
resources,  staff  and  facilities  than  those  of  the  Company.    The  Company's  ability  to  increase  its  reserves  in  the 
future will depend not  only  on  its ability to explore and  develop  its present  properties, but  also on its ability to 
select and acquire other suitable producing properties or prospects for exploratory drilling.  Competitive factors in 
the  distribution  and  marketing  of  oil  and  natural  gas  include  price  and  methods  and  reliability  of  delivery  and 
storage.  Competition may also be presented by alternate fuel sources. 
 
Environmental Regulations  
All  phases  of  the  oil  and  natural  gas  business  present  environmental  risks  and  hazards  and  are  subject  to 
environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial and local laws and regulations.  Environmental 
legislation provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of various 
substances produced in association with oil and natural gas operations.  The legislation also requires that wells and 
facility  sites  be  operated,  maintained,  abandoned  and  reclaimed  to  the  satisfaction  of  applicable  regulatory 
authorities.    Compliance  with  such  legislation  can  require  significant  expenditures  and  a  breach  of  applicable 
environmental  legislation  may  result  in  the  imposition  of  fines  and  penalties,  some  of  which  may  be  material.  
Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger 
fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs.  The discharge of oil, natural 
gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and 
may require the Company to incur costs to remedy such discharge.  Although the Company believes that it will be 
in  material  compliance  with  current  applicable  environmental  regulations,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that 
environmental laws will not result in a curtailment of production or a material increase in the costs of production, 
development  or  exploration  activities  or  otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  business, 
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
Regulatory Risk  
There can be no assurance that government regulations including: royalties, income taxes, environmental laws and 
other regulatory requirements will not be changed in a manner which would adversely affect the Company or its 
shareholders.  While Journey has no control over these regulatory risks, it monitors these changes by participating 
in  industry  organizations  and  wherever  possible  offering  assistance  in  lobbying  for  any  proposed  changes  which 
will  benefit  all  stakeholders.    The  Alberta  government  has  recently  announced  changes  to  its  royalty  structure 
framework  effective  January  1,  2017.    In  general,  the  changes  appear  not  to  be  financially  onerous  but  the
Page 26
Company will continue to monitor and assess as the details become known.  The AER has made changes to its LLR 
program whereby operators  are rated with respect the  value of their assets versus the estimated abandonment 
and reclamation obligation.  Operators with a rating of less than one-to-one are required to post deposits with the 
AER.    Journey’s  rating  is  well  above  this  limit  and  does  not  expect  to  post  any  such  deposits  in  the  foreseeable 
future. 
 
 
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
Journey is required to comply with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure on Issuers' Annual and 
Interim  Filings  (“NI  52-109”).    NI  52-109  requires  that  Journey  disclose  in  its  interim  MD&A  any  material 
weaknesses in Journey’s internal control over financial reporting and/or any changes in Journey’s internal control 
over financial reporting that occurred during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect Journey’s internal controls over financial reporting.   
 
As  a  result  of  certain  staffing  changes  and  reassignment  of  tasks  during  the  first  quarter,  the  CEO  and  CFO 
embarked on a detailed review of the operating expense accrual process during the second quarter.  As a result of 
this review, the CEO and CFO concluded that there was a material weakness in the accrual process and therefore 
have  concluded  that  the  disclosure,  controls  and  procedures  were  not  effective.    The  rapid  descent  in  oil  and 
natural gas prices towards the end of 2015 and continuing through the first quarter of 2016 caused the industry to 
focus harder than ever on cost controls.  The decline in operating costs for Journey was as expected throughout 
the  last  two  quarters  of  2015  but  the  combination  of  cost  savings  and  the  decrease  in  discretionary  spending 
accelerated during the first quarter.  Journey was realizing substantial gains to its operating cost structure due to: 
reduced maintenance, chemical, and well servicing costs and the curtailment of high cost uneconomic production.  
These  savings  were  not  easily  quantifiable  in  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  and  therefore,  Journey’s  actual  field 
operating  costs  for  the  first  quarter  were  lower  than  what  was  previously  accrued  for.    The  result  was  that  the 
operating expenses for the first quarter should have been $2,184 lower than what was previously reported.  This 
over-accrual  was  rectified  in  the  six  months  data  for  2016.    In  addition,  the  CEO  and  CFO  implemented  new 
internal controls to ensure that the accrual process was strengthened and that data is being captured on a more 
timely basis, which will result in a better accrual process. 
 
It should be noted that while the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company believe 
that the Company’s controls provide a reasonable level of assurance with regard to their effectiveness, they do not 
expect  that  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  will  prevent  all 
errors or fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable but not 
absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
