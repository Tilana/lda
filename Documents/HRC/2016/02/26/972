<p>and cultural rights,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the commitment to human rights as expressed in General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 55/2 of 8 September 2000, entitled &#8220;United Nations Millennium Declaration&#8221;, 
</p>

<p>and its follow-up resolutions 60/1 of 16 September 2005, entitled &#8220;2005 World Summit

</p>
<p>&#8220;Outcome document of the special event to follow up efforts made towards achieving the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals&#8221;,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to achieve 
</p>
<p>fully the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing in that context the resolve of Heads 
</p>
<p>of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to 
</p>
<p>halve, by 2015, the proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe drinking water, and 
</p>
<p>to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as agreed in the Plan of 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of 
</p>
<p>Implementation&#8221;) and the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: 
</p>
<p>united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human right to 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water and sanitation, including the Abuja Declaration, adopted at the first 
</p>
<p>Africa-South America Summit, in 2006; the Sharm el-Sheikh Final Document, adopted at 
</p>
<p>the Fifteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Movement of 
</p>
<p>Non-Aligned Countries, in 2009; the Panama Declaration, adopted at the third Latin 
</p>
<p>American and Caribbean Conference on Sanitation, in 2013<b>; </b>the Kathmandu Declaration, 
</p>
<p>adopted at the fifth South Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2013; and the commitments 
</p>
<p>made on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation at the Sanitation and Water 
</p>
<p>for All High-Level Meeting, in 2014,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation</i> of the work of the World Health Organization and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund in their 2014 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme 
</p>
<p>for Water Supply and Sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the fact that, according to the 2012 Joint Monitoring Programme report 
</p>
<p>of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal target relating to the reduction by 50 per cent of people without access 
</p>
<p>to an improved water source was formally met five years before its deadline of 2015, while 
</p>
<p>being deeply concerned, however, that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme 
</p>
<p>update,<b> </b>a large number of the world&#8217;s population still does not enjoy access to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water, as 748 million people, nearly half of them in sub-Saharan Africa, still lack access to 
</p>
<p>improved drinking-water sources, and that at least 1.8 billion people are estimated to be 
</p>
<p>using an improved or unimproved drinking water source that is unsafe, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, </p>
<p>more than 2.5 billion people still do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, 
</p>
<p>including 1 billion people who still practice open defecation, and<b> </b>that the world remains off 
</p>
<p>track to meet the sanitation component of Millennium Development Goal 7, which called 
</p>
<p>for halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to an improved 
</p>
<p>sanitation facility; and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of 
</p>
<p>sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in 
</p>
<p>which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through 
</p>
<p>scaled-up ground-level action, and the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day 
</p>
<p>in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 
</p>
<p>2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking 
</p>
<p>water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and 
</p>
<p>therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking </p>


<p>water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the 
</p>
<p>need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain 
</p>
<p>data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and the safe management of sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights 
</p>
<p>principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal 
</p>
<p>and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality 
</p>
<p>and non-discrimination issues,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, 
</p>
<p>including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with 
</p>
<p>menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women 
</p>
<p>and girls, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should 
</p>
<p>increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, 
</p>
<p>including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface 
</p>
<p>and groundwater pollution, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled &#8220;Sanitation for All&#8221;, in 
</p>
<p>which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach 
</p>
<p>the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including 
</p>
<p>hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater 
</p>
<p>treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>the need to adequately consider<b> </b>the human right to safe drinking water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while 
</p>
<p>defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for 
</p>
<p>development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets 
</p>
<p>on water and sanitation,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the 
</p>
<p>progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, </p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where 
</p>
<p>appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, 
</p>
<p>including international watercourse law, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles 
</p>
<p>everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically 
</p>
<p>accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and 
</p>
<p>affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially 
</p>
<p>and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity;  
</p>
<p>1.<i> Reaffirms</i> that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is 
</p>
<p>essential for the full enjoyment of life and to all human rights, and recalls that it is derived 
</p>
<p>from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inextricably related to the right to the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and 
</p>
<p>human dignity;  
</p>
<p>2<i>. Recalls</i> that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made 
</p>
<p>available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision </p>


<p>of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Alarmed</i> by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme 
</p>
<p>update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation 
</p>
<p>facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends 
</p>
<p>continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more 
</p>
<p>than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the 
</p>
<p>global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign &#8220;Sustainable sanitation: the five-
</p>
<p>year drive to 2015&#8221;, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called 
</p>
<p>for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes</i> the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals<b> </b>proposed<b> </b>in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and 
</p>
<p>targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in 
</p>
<p>particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and 
</p>
<p>sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater 
</p>
<p>treatment, and that<b> </b>special attention<b> </b>be<b> </b>given to the needs of women and girls and those in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situations,<b> </b>and invites States to consider adequately the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations 
</p>
<p>conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and 
</p>
<p>the undertaking of country missions; 
</p>
<p>6.<b> </b><i>Further welcomes</i> the annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly<b> </b>on managing wastewater, curbing water pollution and improving 
</p>
<p>water quality<b> </b>for the realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation,1 in 
</p>
<p>which she emphasized the need to ensure that respect for<b>, </b>protection of and fulfilment of 
</p>
<p>human rights are integrated into wastewater management and to develop a holistic approach 
</p>
<p>to sustainable water resource management, including wastewater management; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes </i>the annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on common violations of the human rights to water and sanitation,2 
</p>
<p>and encourages Governments and other stakeholders to use, as appropriate, the &#8220;Handbook 
</p>
<p>for realizing the human rights to water and sanitation: from policy to practice&#8221;, presented in 
</p>
<p>an addendum to that report3 as a tool for the progressive realization of the human right to 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>8.<b> </b><i>Reaffirms </i>that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
</p>
<p>realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international 
</p>
<p>assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their 
</p>
<p>available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of 
</p>
<p>legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>9<b>. </b><i>Stresses</i> the important role of international cooperation and the technical 
</p>
<p>assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and 
</p>
<p>international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the 
</p>
<p>timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development
