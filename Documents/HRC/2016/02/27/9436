<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of [her] activities, 
in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. On the issue of mass exoduses, a comprehensive 
biannual report (E/CN.4/2005/80) was submitted to the sixty-first session of the Commission on 
Human Rights pursuant to its decision 2003/52. The Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 as preserving the 
previous biennial reporting cycle in respect of this issue<b> </b>until otherwise decided by the Council, 
and accordingly the current report addresses the issue of  human rights and mass exoduses. 
 
2. At its sixty-first session the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 2005/48 in 
which it expressed concern about &#8220;the scale and magnitude of exoduses and displacements of 
people in many regions of the world and by the human suffering of refugees and displaced 
persons&#8221;. In the resolution the Commission also reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to 
ensure the protection of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) within their territories.   
It further recognizes the complementarity between the systems for the protection of human rights 
and for humanitarian action and that coordination between the human rights, political and 
security components of United Nations operations makes an important contribution to the 
promotion and protection of human rights of persons forced into mass exodus and displacement. 
 
3. In paragraph 19 of its resolution 2005/48 the Commission requests the High Commissioner 
to prepare and submit to the Commission an analytical report on measures taken to implement 
the present resolution and on obstacles to its implementation, including information on measures 
taken by OHCHR and other relevant United Nations bodies, taking into account information and 
comments provided by Governments, intergovernmental organizations, human rights treaty 
bodies, specialized agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
 
4. Pursuant to that request, a comprehensive note verbale was sent on 14 December 2006 by the 
High Commissioner to the Member States of the United Nations, the relevant international 
organizations and a number of civil society organizations working on the issue of mass exoduses, 
asking them to provide the office with information on developments in this area. At the time of 
drafting this report, information had been received from the following countries: Argentina, 
Costa Rica, Finland, Georgia, Jamaica, Japan, Lebanon, and the Philippines. Information was 
also received from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR). 
 
5. The present report is composed of five sections dealing respectively with: the status of 
ratification of relevant international instruments; activities of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights; overview of information provided by Member States; 
information provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR); and conclusions.

 <p></p>
<p> 
<b>I. STATUS OF RATIFICATION OF RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>6. In its resolution 2005/48, paragraph 5, the Commission &#8220;encourages States that have not 
already done so to consider acceding to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 
and its 1967 Protocol, as far as possible without reservations, and to relevant regional 
instruments concerning refugees, as applicable, and other relevant international instruments of 
human rights and humanitarian law, and also encourages States to consider lifting reservations 
that they may have made to such instruments and to take appropriate measures to disseminate 
and implement those instruments domestically in order to encourage compliance with provisions 
against arbitrary and forcible displacement and greater respect for the rights of those who flee&#8221;. 
7. Since the last report of the High Commissioner on human rights and mass exoduses1, a 
number of countries have acceded to international instruments directly relevant to the issue of 
mass exoduses. Most recently, Montenegro has acceded to the 1951 Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The total number of States parties which have acceded 
to one or both of these instruments is now 144.2  On 23 October 2006, Montenegro also ratified 
the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. There are now 62 States parties 
to this instrument3. That same month, Rwanda ratified the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of 
Statelessness, bringing the number of States parties to 33.4 
 
8. At the regional level, 45 countries have ratified the African Union Convention governing the 
specific aspects of refugee problems in Africa. A number of countries, including Djibouti, 
Madagascar, Mauritius and Somalia, have signed but not yet ratified the treaty.5 
 
9. Regarding international human rights instruments, the High Commissioner notes with 
appreciation that a number of States have acceded to the core human rights treaties, notably the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 
and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict.6

6 Since the last report of the High Commissioner on human rights and mass exoduses, a number of States have 
become parties to the core human rights treaties. A non-exhaustive list is presented below. All information regarding 
the status of ratifications of human rights treaties can be found on the OHCHR website:

10. The High Commissioner welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly, in December 
2005, of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol 
which, inter alia, obliges future States parties to &#8220;take, in accordance with their obligations under 
international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, 
all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in 
situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the 
occurrence of natural disasters&#8221;. The specific obligations of States in this regard are set up in the 
other provisions of the treaty, which refer notably to the rights to life, health, social protection 
and non-discrimination. This provision is of particular relevance to refugees and displaced 
persons with disabilities. 
 
11. Moreover, in the humanitarian law field, a number of States have acceded to the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 and to their Additional Protocols relating to the protection of victims of 
international and non-international armed conflicts.7 The Additional Protocol to the Geneva 
Conventions relating to the adoption of an additional distinctive emblem was adopted on 8 
December 2005. Nine States have ratified this third Additional Protocol at the time of drafting 
this report.8

<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>12. During the last two years, and in line with the report of the Secretary-General &#8220;In larger 
freedom&#8221; (A/59/2005), OHCHR has been undergoing the most far-reaching reform process in 
the history of the institution. The first Strategic Management Plan was issued, providing a

<p> 
comprehensive picture of the objectives, activities and requirements of OHCHR. It is based on 
the Plan of Action released in May 2005 with the objective of closing a range of implementation 
gaps and thereby increasing the protection of people. To this end, the plan set forth five action 
points: greater country engagement; an enhanced leadership role for the High Commissioner; 
closer partnerships with civil society and with other United Nations agencies; greater synergy in 
the relationship between OHCHR and the other United Nations human rights bodies; and 
strengthened management and planning for OHCHR. 
</p><p> 
13. As a result, OHCHR has given increasing attention to the need to strengthen its engagement 
at the country level by, inter alia, following more closely the human rights situations in some 
countries or regions and enhancing its dialogue with all partners, in order to promote the 
implementation of human rights. 
 
14. In addition to strengthening its capacity at headquarters, notably with the establishment of a 
rapid response unit which will assist in conducting assessments and fact-finding missions and 
starting up new operations, great emphasis was put on strengthening the presence of OHCHR in 
the field.  For example, a regional office for Central America was recently opened in Panama 
and country offices have been established in Nepal, Guatemala and Uganda. 
 
15. These developments are key to the realization of the fundamental goals of OHCHR &#8211; to 
protect human rights and empower all people to realize those rights. A stronger capacity on the 
ground is also translating into an increased monitoring and assistance capacity to respond to 
human rights situations that lead to mass exoduses, as well as the problems resulting therefrom. 
 
16. OHCHR has intensified its involvement in inter-agency efforts to strengthen the inter-agency 
humanitarian response in emergencies. In this regard, OHCHR has further contributed to 
humanitarian coordinating mechanisms at both the global and country levels. At the field level, 
for example in Uganda, OHCHR actively shares with UNHCR the responsibility of chairing the 
Protection Cluster Working Group and coordinating the protection activities of the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee (IASC) country team; in Colombia, after the last IASC mission in 2006, 
OHCHR supported the strengthening of the inter-agency response in the area of protection by the 
establishment of a thematic working group; in Sri Lanka, a human rights advisor deployed by 
OHCHR assisted the United Nations country team (UNCT) by providing advice on rights-based 
approaches to the humanitarian response following the tsunami. 
 
17. In the context of the IASC, OHCHR has contributed to the development of materials 
designed to guide humanitarian actors in responding to humanitarian needs in case of crises. In 
particular, OHCHR participated in the drafting of the Human Rights Guidance Note for 
Humanitarian Coordinators, the Gender Handbook for Humanitarian Action and is currently 
actively participating in the design of an IDP handbook. 
 
18. OHCHR, in its mandated capacity to provide support to special procedures mandate holders, 
has continued to assist the Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally 
displaced persons in carrying out his mandate.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. OVERVIEW OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MEMBER STATES 
</b> 
19. In accordance with Commission resolution 2005/48, the High Commissioner sent a 
comprehensive note verbale on 14 December 2006 to the Member States of the United Nations, 
the relevant international organizations and to a number of civil society organizations working 
on the issue of mass exodus, asking them to provide information to be included in this report. 
 
20. As of 19 February 2007, information had been received from the following Governments: 
Argentina, Costa Rica, Finland, Georgia, Jamaica, Japan, Lebanon, and the Philippines.   In 
addition, information was received from UNHCR. The content of each of these replies is 
summarized below. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Argentina 
</b> 
21. In a communication dated 4 January 2007, the Government of Argentina transmitted its reply 
to the note verbale. In particular, it recalled that Argentina is a party to the 1951 Convention 
related to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and reported that the institution in charge 
of determining refugee status has supported diverse actions aimed at improving the mechanism 
for determining the eligibility of refugees and reducing the time it takes to evaluate their cases. 
Significant advances in the matter of protection of the rights of refugees have been achieved and 
UNHCR, according to the information received, has praised the level of technical analysis. 
 
22. In Argentina, the status of refugee is recognized for &quot;individuals who have been 
discriminated against for religious reasons, objections of conscience, gender, or sexual 
orientation&quot;. Argentina has interpreted the definition of refugee broadly and regularly accords the 
status of refugee to individuals persecuted by State agents. 
 
23. The Government has strengthened the agency in charge of determining refugee status, 
equipping it with appropriate resources. The agency includes psychologists and lawyers and 
consists of about 16 people. The work on eligibility of refugees is based on the implementation 
of the recommendations of UNHCR. Each request triggers a personal assessment and the 
possibility of a review of the case by the Ministry of Interior prior to the decision of the 
Secretary of human rights of the Ministry of Justice. New challenges have been undertaken, one 
of the most important being the adoption of a refugee law that has systematized the existing 
regulations and that will open up possibilities for international cooperation in this area.  It will 
also institutionalize the distribution of tasks among local institutions which will guarantee the 
best integration of refugees into society. 
 
24. The authorities also reported that the general law for the recognition and protection of 
refugees (law 26.165) was adopted by Congress in November 2006. This law encodes the basic 
principles enshrined in international instruments regarding the protection of refugees and 
asylum-seekers: non-refoulement, including the prohibition on sending them back to the border; 
non-discrimination; no sanction for illegal entry into the country; confidentiality; and family 
unity. 
 
25. The new law establishes a National Commission for Refugees (CONARE), which replaces 
the former Refugee Eligibility Committee (CEPARE), until now composed of immigration 
officials and staff of the Foreign Ministry.  Under the new law, a representative of each of the </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Racism (INADI), and the Ministry of Social Development and the Environment will also 
participate in the new organization. With the inclusion of a representative of the Ministry of 
Social Development and the Environment, the Commission will be able to provide assistance to 
the refugees, in particular the most vulnerable groups, by incorporating them into national, 
provincial or municipal programmes. 
</p><p> 
26. The new law clarifies the appeal process in case of a negative decision by CONARE and 
introduces prima facie recognition of refugee status in case of a mass influx of displaced persons. 
 
27. In addition, the law anticipates the possibility of requesting relocation to Argentina for a 
refugee who has obtained the recognition of his status in another country in which he cannot 
remain, due to risk of violation of his fundamental rights. 
 
28. The Argentine authorities reported that, in June 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding  was 
signed with UNHCR to allow for the resettlement of refugees in Argentina. The Government 
recognizes that resettlement is an important instrument in the search for durable solutions for 
refugees. In 2005, for the implementation of the first stage of this programme, nine Colombian 
refugee families traveled to Argentina from Costa Rica and Ecuador. In 2006, seven families 
came from Ecuador to be resettled in Argentina. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Costa Rica 
</b> 
29. In its reply dated 31 January 2007, the Government of Costa Rica reported that the country is 
host to a substantial number of refugees - especially of Colombian origin. Every month, the 
Directorate General for Migration and Foreign Nationals receives an average of 130 new 
requests for refugee status. At the end of the 1970s and in the first four years of the 1980s, Costa 
Rica accorded refugee status to 50,000 individuals, mainly Nicaraguan and Salvadoran, who left 
their countries due to internal armed conflicts. This is a large number for a country of 51,000 
square kilometres and a population of 4 million inhabitants. As of the second half of 2000, Costa 
Rica experienced a new influx of applicants due to the renewed internal conflict in Colombia. 
From January to April of 2002 Costa Rica received 2,232 requests for asylum. 
 
30. Costa Rica is little known as a host country for refugees. This is both because it is not in a 
conflict region itself and because it is located in a region (Central America and Mexico) where 
irregular migration and the illicit traffic of migrants are considered bigger issues. 
 
31. The phenomenon of migration generates important challenges for Costa Rican society, 
notably in regard to protection of the human rights of refugees, the need to provide humanitarian 
assistance, and to work towards their integration into society. 
 
32. In its response, the Government states that its institutions have demonstrated responsibility 
and sensitivity in acting according to its international commitments in the matter of protection of 
refugees. These institutional efforts have been complemented by the work of academic 
institutions, civil society organizations and international organizations. The Government 
recognizes however that it still faces a challenge in ensuring the necessary arrangements are in 
place for the integration of the refugees into Costa Rican society until durable solutions are </p>

 <p> 
found for them. To achieve this objective, the country will need the assistance of the 
international community. 
</p><p> 
33. In order to assist with the integration of the refugees, UNHCR, the Government and civil 
society organizations have developed micro-credit programmes to facilitate or consolidate the 
entrepreneurial activities of refugees. The main initiative in this area is the one implemented by 
the Asociaci&#243;n de Consultores y Asesores Internacionales (ACAI) which has allowed the 
formalization of about 150 productive projects, whose beneficiaries are mainly members of poor 
families. In order to promote greater acceptance of the refugees amongst the host population, as 
of September 2003 UNHCR recommended the inclusion of Costa Rican nationals among the 
beneficiaries of these programmes, channelling a percentage of the funds to local micro-
entrepreneurs. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the State must guarantee the refugees 
access to bank credits, without discrimination based on their migratory status or the 
documentation they have received. 
 
34. ACAI also runs a programme of refugee integration and provides assistance to the most 
vulnerable, giving priority to female heads of household, family groups with dependent minors, 
and elderly people. 
 
35. With regard to integration in the labour market, an agreement was signed between the 
Ministry of Work and UNHCR, and the Labour Insertion Unit (ULI) was created to facilitate 
access to work for refugees. 
 
36. In addition, occupational and labour training are also provided. However, the main limitation 
to the integration of refugees in the labour market is the economic situation of Costa Rica, which 
is characterized by limited opportunities for work, and the fact that, when these opportunities do 
exist, refugees are ill-equipped to compete with nationals or permanent residents, as they have 
difficulty in demonstrating previous experience, producing references, or providing evidence of 
their university degrees and the validity of their qualifications. 
 
37. Recognizing that documentation is key to effective integration, the Government provides 
refugees with a standard identity document in order to guarantee them access to basic services 
such as health and education, as well as to the labour market. 
 
38. The Government reported that a protection network has also been established. This network 
deals with the specific situation and needs of refugees. It also facilitates the exchange of 
information, access to education, and mutual support to guarantee the protection of asylum 
seekers and refugees in the country. This network functions via three institutions: the Permanent 
Forum on the Migrant Population and Refugees; the National Network of Civil Organizations for 
Migration; and the universities. 
 
39. Today, according to the authorities, the great challenge for Costa Rica is to find durable 
solutions for the refugee population that has entered the country during the last six years. In 
order to further its programmes of local integration and resettlement of refugees, it will need the 
assistance of the international community and the support of other States in the region. 
 
 
 </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
<b>Finland 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>40. In its letter dated 31 January 2006, the Government indicated that human rights are high on 
its foreign and security policy agenda and that Finland takes an active part in their promotion. In 
particular, the country is active in questions related to human rights and mass exoduses. 
Financial support from Finland to UNHCR increased to 16.1 million euros in 2006. 
 
41. At the suggestion of UNHCR, Finland has been taking in refugees since 1979. Since 2001, 
the annual quota for refugees has been 750. The Finnish Aliens Act of 2004 lays down the 
definition of the refugee quota and the requirements and procedures for admitting aliens to 
Finland under the quota. The conditions are as follows:  
 
- The need for international protection of the alien with respect to his or her home country; 
 
- The need for resettlement of the alien with respect to the country where he/she is 
</p>
<p>residing; 
 
- The conditions for reception and integration in Finland have been assessed; 
 
- There are no grounds relating to public order and security, public health, or international 
</p>
<p>relations for not issuing a residence permit. 
</p><p> 
42. In an emergency and in urgent cases, foreigners are admitted to Finland without a personal 
interview on the basis of a written document provided by UNHCR. 
 
43. In addition, the Finnish authorities also reported that temporary protection may be given to 
aliens who need international protection and who cannot return safely to their home country or 
country of permanent residence, because there has been a massive displacement of people in the 
country or its neighboring areas, as a result of armed conflict, some other violent situation or an 
environmental disaster. Temporary protection lasts for a maximum of three years in total. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Georgia 
</b> 
44. In its response dated 1 February 2007, the Government of Georgia reported on legislative 
developments as well as major challenges obstructing or hindering the full protection of IDPs 
and refugees in Georgia. For several years, the problem of internally displaced persons has been 
one of the major challenges for the Government of Georgia. In addition, internal conflicts in 
neighbouring countries have generated large numbers of asylum-seekers seeking refuge on its 
territory. 
 
45. The Government also reported that Georgia is party to all the major instruments, including 
the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Optional Protocol. 
 
46. The 1998 law on refugees determines the legal status of refugees and persons seeking 
refugee status; the grounds and procedures for granting, termination and deprivation of refugee 
status; and legal, social and economic guarantees for refugees. An individual who enters the 
country due to persecution on the grounds of race, religion, ethnic affiliation, membership of any 
social group, or political opinion is obliged to personally apply to the Ministry of Refugees and </p>

 <p> 
Accommodation and request recognition as a refugee. The decision on the recognition of refugee 
status is made by the Ministry within four months of registration and a refusal to grant refugee 
status can be appealed. 
</p><p> 
47. A draft law on refugees and persons granted temporary asylum is envisaged, in order to bring 
the definition of refugee into complete compliance with the definition contained in the 1951 
Convention. It will further simplify the process of obtaining refugee status and will subject all 
decisions in this regard to the scrutiny of the judiciary. Special attention will be paid to the 
situation of children. This draft law will also regulate the issue of asylum-seekers who do not 
qualify for refugee status but cannot be expelled from the territory for humanitarian reasons. 
 
48. According to the Charter on the granting of asylum, the President is responsible for granting 
asylum to foreigners who are persecuted in their own country because of their activities for the 
protection of peace and human rights, or progressive social, political, scientific and other 
creative activity. 
 
49. The law on forcibly displaced and/or internally displaced persons (FDPs/IDPs) of 1996 
provides the legal basis for the definition of the legal status of FDPs/ IDPs and sets the rules 
regulating the process of granting, cancellation, termination and deprivation of that status. It also 
provides legal, social and economic guarantees. Apart from assuring the right to live in a 
temporary place of residence and receive other assistance, the basic obligation of the State is to 
assist FDPs/IDPs in returning to their habitual place of residence. FDPs/IDPs are entitled to 
receive different types of assistance such as a temporary place of residence; social assistance; 
their medical expenses covered by the State; or assistance in enjoying the right to education. 
 
50. In regard to refugees, the Georgian authorities reported that, due to the lack of financial 
resources, assistance was somewhat limited. However, in recent years the amount and type of 
assistance has been steadily increasing. 
 
51. Most refugees are settled in the north-eastern part of the country and several programmes 
have been implemented with the assistance of the international community. In particular, 
UNHCR and the World Food Programme (WFP) are implementing a programme of food 
assistance to the refugees. A durable solution for those refugees who have already been on 
Georgian territory for more than seven years remains the most problematic issue. 
 
52. According to the authorities, the conflict with Abkhazia resulted in the displacement of some 
300,000 persons and the conflict in the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia led to the displacement 
of some 60,000 persons. Displacement brought about by conflicts remains one of the major 
challenges for the Government of Georgia, since it has to guarantee the FDPs/IDPs what they 
need to enable them to continue a normal life. The main problem hampering assistance to 
FDPs/IDPs remains the lack of financial and other resources. 
 
53. The Government of Georgia has been drafting a national strategy on internally displaced 
persons in order to establish a detailed and durable solution for IDPs in Georgia. This strategy 
serves two major objectives: securing the conditions for IDPs to live in dignity and their 
integration into Georgian society; and creating the necessary conditions to enable them to return 
home voluntarily, in dignity and safety. It has been developed in line with the recommendations 
of the Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced persons </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
and in consultation with civil society, IDP associations and the international community. It is 
based on international human rights standards and on the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement.  In particular, it incorporates the principle of allowing and assisting IDPs to 
integrate into society while also respecting their right to return to their homes and communities, 
not as mutually exclusive options, but rather as mutually reinforcing options. The strategy covers 
various aspects of the problem, such as: 
 
- Securing dignified conditions for IDPs and their integration into Georgian society; 
- The social integration of IDPs (improving their living conditions and socio-economic 
</p>
<p>status); 
- Creating conditions of voluntary return for IDPs and support for the process; 
- Supporting IDPs who have spontaneously returned to their permanent residence. 
</p><p> 
54. This strategy will, according to the Government of Georgia, be implemented by all relevant 
government ministries, agencies and authorities at both national and local levels, and should be 
widely disseminated, especially among internally displaced persons in Georgia and organizations 
(local and international) working with IDPs. 
 
55. The Government is planning to develop an action plan for the implementation of the national 
strategy. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Jamaica 
</b> 
56. In its reply dated 2 February 2007, the Government of Jamaica affirmed its commitment to 
ensuring that it adheres to its obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of 
Refugees and the 1967 Optional Protocol, and that those who are fleeing persecution are given 
the protection they need. Each application for refugee status is considered on its individual merit 
to determine whether the applicant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution in his or 
her home country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social 
group or political opinion. 
 
57. The Government reported that it is aware of the economic and social impact that a mass 
influx of refugees can have on an individual country, and therefore it continues to be engaged in 
efforts aimed at sustaining peace, stability, democracy and development in countries throughout 
the Caribbean region and beyond, that will remove the need for persons to flee their countries.  
This is accomplished through engagement with relevant international and regional organisations 
and with other countries at the bilateral and regional levels. 
 
58. In view of its obligations, the Government of Jamaica has taken the necessary steps to ensure 
adequate protection of the basic human rights of refugees and asylum-seekers, including through 
the provision of adequate food and shelter, and the safety and security of individuals and their 
personal property.  The enforcement of this right is no less than that afforded to each citizen of 
Jamaica by the security forces. 
 
59. Meeting the welfare needs of refugees and asylum seekers requires a multi-faceted approach, 
involving the Ministries of Foreign Affairs &amp; Foreign Trade, National Security, and Health. The 
Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), also assists in 
providing safe and secure shelter, as well as the basic necessities to ensure that their stay in the </p>

 <p> 
shelters provided is of a high standard. While under the care of the Government of Jamaica, 
every effort is made to ensure that refugees and asylum-seekers are treated according to 
internationally recognized human rights standards, including the granting of access by 
representatives of human rights groups and other NGOs operating in Jamaica. 
</p><p> 
60. In Jamaica, the refugee determination process involves initial screening and status 
determination by an eligibility committee comprising representatives from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs &amp; Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of National Security.  
Where an application for refugee status is denied, the applicant can appeal to a tribunal for a 
reconsideration of the decision. In instances where children are involved in asylum cases, the 
Government of Jamaica, to the extent possible, has always sought to keep the family unit 
together. 
 
61. The Government of Jamaica has developed a refugee policy which establishes procedures for 
managing the refugee status determination process. The refugee policy document takes account 
of the provisions of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 
Protocol, as well as the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee 
Status. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Japan 
</b> 
62. In its reply dated 29 January 2007, the Government of Japan reported that, with regard to the 
various human rights issues involving foreign nationals, the Ministry of Justice is responsible for 
providing remedies in cases of human rights infringements and preventing harm caused by such 
infringements through human rights counselling, investigation and resolution of cases. The 
Ministry of Justice has established human rights counselling centres for foreign nationals to 
respond to various human rights inquiries from foreign nationals. In addition, the human rights 
organs of the Ministry of Justice actively organize promotional campaigns to promote the 
principle of respect for human rights, in order to make a wider audience aware of the importance 
of the rights of all people, including foreign nationals. In addition to the regular promotional 
activities, various other activities are carried out during Human Rights Week (every year from 
December 4 to 10), with emphasis on certain issues, including respect for the human rights of 
foreign nationals. 
 
63. The authorities also reported that Japan has been responding to the assistance and protection 
needs of those countries affected by mass exoduses of refugees and displaced persons through 
assisting humanitarian organizations. Most recently, in December 2006, Japan contributed US$ 
30 million to WFP, UNHCR, United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) and International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) operations in Sudan. 
 
64. Regarding the protection of refugees, the Government recalled that Japan signed the 1951 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees in 1981 and subsequently its 1967 Protocol in 
1982. Refugee recognition procedures were incorporated in the Immigration Control and 
Refugee Recognition Act (the Immigration Act), which clearly regulated the principle of non-
refoulement. The amended Immigration Act which substantially changed the previous refugee 
recognition system came into force on 16 May 2005. This new refugee recognition system 
established the process for permitting illegal foreign residents who have applied for refugee 
status a provisional stay in Japan, with the aim of ensuring a stable legal status for them.  It also </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
established the system of refugee examination counsellors aimed at enhancing the fairness and 
neutrality of refugee status recognition procedures. If the applicants for refugee status are female 
or children, careful consideration is given to their situation in light of their circumstances. In 
particular, if an applicant is female, a female official will take charge of the examination as far as 
possible. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Lebanon 
</b> 
65. The Government of Lebanon responded to the request for information in a communication 
dated 13 February 2007. It reported that mass exoduses in Lebanon are related to: internal 
displacements brought about by the wars that have ravaged the country; people who have left the 
country as a result of the last conflict; and the Palestinian refugees who sought refuge in 
Lebanon in 1948. 
 
66. The Government referred to the fact that about two million people were displaced during the 
last war, among whom were 180,000 foreigners who returned to their countries of origin. 
 
67. The Lebanese authorities also stated that, at this stage, Lebanon could not ratify the Geneva 
Conventions and their Additional Protocols. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Philippines 
</b> 
68. In its response dated 6 February 2007, the Government reported that in the Philippines, the 
displacement of individuals, families and communities is due to a number of factors: natural 
disasters, man-made disasters and development-related projects. 
 
69. In regard to natural disasters, from 2005 to 2006, the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development - Disaster Response Operations Monitoring and Information Centre (DSWD-
DROMIC) documented 535,205 individuals who took refuge in evacuation centres due to 
typhoons alone. Flooding also caused the evacuation of 79,704 individuals to designated centres 
in their respective local government units. Landslides forced 5,011 individuals to abandon their 
homes, while eruptions of the Mayon Volcano and Mount Bulusan in 2006 also forced 46,754 
individuals to evacuate. 
 
70. In addition, the authorities reported that the Philippines is host to two of the longest-running 
armed conflicts in the world, while counter-insurgency operations and terrorism related activities 
also remain a cause of internal displacement. In 2005 and 2006, DSWD-DROMIC reported that 
92,334 individuals were driven from their homes to evacuation centres due to armed conflict. 
Fire incidents also led to more than 12,000 families seeking refuge in evacuation centres in 2005 
and 2006. The oil spill resulting from the Petron-chartered oil tanker <i>M/V Solar</i> incident also 
caused 358 individuals to seek refuge in evacuation centres in the area. 
 
71. Development projects like the expansion and rehabilitation of major railways also have 
unintended effects on the displacement of families and individuals. For example, the Manila-
Calabarzon Express (MCX) Rail Project required the clearing of railroad tracks and the 
relocation of 600 informal family settlers from the Buli and Cupang Barangays in Muntinlupa 
City. 
 </p>

 <p> 
72. As the Chair of the National Committee on Disaster Response of the National Disaster 
Coordinating Council (NDCC-NCDR), DSWD-DROMIC acts as the lead agency in providing 
relief services to victims of disasters with the support of local government units and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). 
 
73. The Department has also implemented various programmes under its Disaster Management 
Programme, such as the core shelter assistance (CSA) and emergency shelter assistance (ESA), 
to address the number of families rendered homeless due to natural and man-made disasters. The 
CSA provides environmentally friendly and well-built shelter units which can withstand various 
disasters, while the ESA provides some degree of financial or material assistance to augment the 
scarce resources of families in reconstructing houses that have been destroyed due to natural and 
man-made disasters. 
 
74. DSWD also served as the Chair of the Project Steering Committee for the slum improvement 
project of the Asian Development Bank which was intended to reduce urban poverty in 
vulnerable communities through an off-site, off-city relocation package for vulnerable urban 
communities affected by the MCX Rail Project. This project adopted a strategic framework 
anchored in a multi-stakeholder or tripartite approach: the active participation of people&#8217;s 
organizations, NGOs, the local government unit and national government agencies were 
highlighted during the implementation of the project. The 600 displaced informal settlers moved 
to their new homes in Dreamland Heights after the project was completed. 
 
<b>IV. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH 
</b></p>
<p><b>COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES 
</b> 
75. In its communication dated 20 February 2007, UNHCR provided the following information. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Global development related to displacement and refugee flows 
</b> 
76. At the end of 2005 the total number of persons of concern to UNHCR rose to 21 million, as 
compared to 19.5 million at the end of 2004. This figure includes refugees, asylum-seekers, 
returnees, stateless people and a proportion of the global population of internally displaced 
persons (IDPs). As a result of major repatriation operations the number of refugees fell to 8.7 
million in 2005 reaching its lowest level since 1980. 
 
77. In 2006 further progress was made with regard to some major repatriation operations. Since 
return to Afghanistan resumed in 2002, more than 4.8 million Afghans have been repatriated, 
however approximately 3.5 million Afghans still remain in the two neighbouring countries of 
Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the African context repatriation in 2006 included 
the return of almost 80,000 registered Liberians (half of them assisted by UNHCR); 
approximately 45,000 Burundians; about 32,000 Congolese refugees repatriating to the DRC, of 
which 23,000 from Tanzania; and about 28,000 returns to Angola assisted by UNHCR, bringing 
the organized repatriation operation nearly to a close. 
 
78. On the other hand new humanitarian crises have emerged and in 2006 UNHCR had to 
dispatch its emergency teams inter alia to Lebanon, Timor-Leste, northern Pakistan and northern 
Kenya. Developments in Somalia have led to a renewed outflow of more than 34,000 individuals </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
into northern Kenya, while further individuals were unable to reach the neighbouring country 
when the border was closed. 
</p><p> 
79. Ongoing displacement from and within Iraq is of the utmost concern to UNHCR. In early 
February 2007 estimates reached a total of 2 million Iraqis who have fled to neighbouring 
countries, primarily Syria and Jordan, and the number is increasing by approximately 50,000 per 
month. In addition approximately 1.8 million Iraqis are currently displaced within Iraq. 
 
80. UNHCR is also concerned about the increasingly evident spillover effect of the crisis in the 
Darfur region of Sudan into neighbouring countries, which is resulting in increased 
displacement. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Protection challenges and the response of UNHCR 
</b> 
81. While global numbers of refugees have been reduced during recent years, not least due to a 
number of large-scale and successful repatriation operations, protection challenges remain in a 
climate of increased security concerns, disrespect for international law in the conduct of warfare, 
and mounting xenophobia and intolerance in general across the globe. In this environment the 
protection of the human rights of refugees, internally displaced people and others of concern to 
UNHCR remains a top priority and an integral element of all forms of humanitarian action in 
which the Office engages. 
 
82. UNHCR revised its global strategic objectives in 2006. Priority is given to ensuring that 
international standards of protection are met for all refugees and others of concern to UNHCR, 
taking into account their age, gender or personal background. Priority will also be given to 
improving protection against refoulement and reducing incidents of violence, in particular of a 
sexual and gender-based kind; ensuring civil, social and economic rights; and improving the 
coverage and quality of registration and documentation. 
 
83. Furthermore the efforts of UNHCR will focus on the development and maintenance of an 
international protection regime by advocating and providing support to Governments in the 
establishment of national protection regimes in accordance with international standards. This 
includes: preserving asylum space through the effective implementation of the 1951 Convention 
and its 1967 Protocol and related international standards; strengthening the capacity of host 
countries to undertake refugee status determination, provide asylum and offer durable solutions; 
and protecting refugees within broader migration movements. A ten-point plan of action has 
been developed to better address the challenges of mixed migration flows and is to be piloted in 
the context of the Mediterranean situation. 
 
84. Further objectives high on the agenda for UNHCR are the search for durable solutions, with 
a focus on self-reliance and integration; the use of resettlement as a strategic protection tool; and 
the protection of and assistance to IDPs. While resettlement on some occasions has been 
hampered by a very restrictive implementation of anti-terrorist legislation, efforts have been 
made to widen the scope of countries offering resettlement. Argentina, Benin, Brazil, Burkina 
Faso, Chile, Iceland and Ireland have now agreed to introduce annual resettlement quotas and 
although these are still quite small, they complement the possibilities provided by traditional 
resettlement countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States of America. 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>85. Addressing the challenges of an ever-changing environment, UNHCR is reassessing its 
mission and is engaged in a thorough structural and management reform process in order to 
become a more flexible, effective and results-oriented organization. The change process 
launched in March 2006 serves the review of all structures, systems, processes and staffing 
arrangements. In order to permit prompt and efficient emergency response, the emergency team 
at UNHCR and its stockpiles are further strengthened, with the aim of establishing by 2007 an 
emergency response capacity allowing the deployment within 72 hours at any time of 
humanitarian staff and relief items sufficient for an exodus of up to 500,000 people. 
 
</p>
<p><b>V. CONCLUSIONS 
</b> 
<b>86. Mass exodus, whatever form it might take - internal or involving the crossing of 
borders - is a source of great suffering and of numerous violations of the human rights and 
dignity of the men, women and children affected. As recalled by the Commission on 
Human Rights in its resolution 2005/48, the primary responsibility for ensuring the 
protection of displaced populations present on their territories lies with States. They have 
the primary role in the initiation, organization, coordination and implementation of 
humanitarian assistance for people living within their territory. The international 
community has a responsibility to cooperate with countries affected by mass exoduses of 
refugees and displaced persons, in particular developing countries. 
 
87. Recent developments have shown growing recognition of the magnitude of exoduses 
and displacements, as well as the linkages between mass exoduses and human rights. 
However, major challenges still remain in preventing these situations and responding 
appropriately to the protection problems they raise. Further cooperation among all actors 
involved will be required to address these challenges and respond to the protection needs of 
the numerous victims.
