first significant contributions from Bozshakol and Aktogay. We have also been able to further
reduce our operating costs with 34% lower gross cash costs in the East Region and Bozymchak
supporting an improved EBITDA despite weaker commodity prices. Our growth is set to
accelerate as Bozshakol continues its ramp up in the second half of the year followed by the
commissioning of Aktogay sulphide in the first half of 2017."

NOTES TO EDITORS
KAZ Minerals PLC ("KAZ Minerals" or "the Group") is a high growth copper company focused on
large scale, low-cost, open pit mining in Kazakhstan. It operates four mines and three
concentrators in the East Region of Kazakhstan, the Bozymchak copper-gold mine in
Kyrgyzstan, the Bozshakol open pit copper mine in the Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan and the
oxide phase of the Aktogay project. In 2015, total copper cathode output from the East Region
and Bozymchak was 81 kt with by-products of 94 kt of zinc in concentrate, 3,135 koz of silver and
35 koz of gold bar.
The Group's major growth projects at Bozshakol and Aktogay are expected to deliver one of the
highest growth rates in the industry and transform KAZ Minerals into a company dominated by
world class, open pit copper mines.
Bozshakol is a first quartile asset on the global cost curve and will have an annual ore
processing capacity of 30 million tonnes when fully ramped up, with a mine life of 40 years at a
copper grade of 0.36%. The mine and processing facilities will produce 100 kt of copper cathode
equivalent and 120 koz of gold in concentrate per year over the first 10 years of operations.
The Aktogay project in the East of Kazakhstan is the Group's second copper mining asset under
construction. Aktogay commenced production of copper cathode from oxide ore in December
2015, and the production of copper in concentrate from sulphide ore is expected to begin in the
first half of 2017. The sulphide concentrator will have an annual ore processing capacity of 25
million tonnes when fully ramped up. The deposit has a mine life of more than 50 years with
average copper grades of 0.33% (sulphide) and 0.37% (oxide). Aktogay is competitively
positioned on the global cost curve and will produce an average of 90 kt of copper cathode
equivalent from sulphide ore and 15 kt of copper cathode from oxide ore per year over the first 10
years of operations.
KAZ Minerals is listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange and the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange and employs around 12,000 people, principally in Kazakhstan.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
Our results for the first half of 2016 position KAZ Minerals as a high growth and low-cost copper
producer. Copper output has grown by 43% compared to the first half of 2015 as the Bozshakol
and Aktogay oxide projects made material contributions to the Group's output. The East Region
and Bozymchak delivered strong results at a gross cash cost of 178 USc/lb and a competitive net
cash cost of 72 USc/lb, significantly below the prior year period and firmly in the first quartile of
the industry cost curve. Construction work at Aktogay has progressed well and production at the
main sulphide concentrator is expected to commence in the first half of 2017. We have also
reduced the Aktogay capital budget by $100 million as a result of contracting and procurement
efficiencies.
Whilst the Group is successfully executing its strategy to deliver low-cost growth, we face a
challenging external environment as the prices of our key products remain at depressed levels.
As a first quartile producer with modern, long-life assets, KAZ Minerals is now better positioned
to navigate the current downturn in commodity markets and we are taking measures to
strengthen the balance sheet, reduce operating costs and scale back capital expenditure where
possible.
Major growth projects
The Bozshakol concentrator commenced production of copper concentrate in February 2016 and
the first shipment to China was in March. Output in the second quarter was disrupted by a
planned shutdown for 17 days in May for bolt tightening and other maintenance required by the
mill manufacturers, and in June capacity was restricted by minor commissioning issues requiring
repair. Following the commissioning works in the first half which limited output to 10.6 kt of
copper in concentrate, copper cathode equivalent production in 2016 is now expected to be 45-
55 kt and gold bar equivalent guidance is revised to 50-60 koz. The gross cash cost guidance for
Bozshakol in 2016 has been reduced to 140-160 USc/lb following the results for the first half. In
July and August, throughput at the concentrator has been rapidly increasing. The plant is now
operating at over 60% of capacity and is on course to achieve commercial production in the
second half of 2016.
Mining operations at Bozshakol ramped up in the first half of 2016 with over 11 million tonnes of
ore extracted, including 4.6 million tonnes of sulphide ore to feed the concentrator and 6.4 million
tonnes of clay ore. Clay ore is being stockpiled for processing at the clay plant, which is expected
to launch later in 2016. The average grade of sulphide ore extracted was 0.56%, which is
significantly higher than the reserve grade of 0.36% and will help us to quickly increase copper in
concentrate production and achieve our cash cost targets.
The SX/EW facility at Aktogay started producing copper cathode from oxide ore in December
2015 and has been steadily ramping up production in the first half of 2016, with output of 5.4 kt of
copper cathode. In the month of July, the oxide facilities averaged 61 tonnes of cathode per day,
although throughput may be lower in the winter months due to reduced temperatures. After
considering the performance of the plant in the second quarter of 2016, the oxide project was
declared commercial from 1 July 2016. The SX/EW facility is on track to achieve our guidance of
around 15 kt of copper cathode in 2016.
Construction has progressed well at Aktogay in the first half of the year with the permanent camp,
crusher, conveyor and tailings facilities on track for commissioning in 2017. At the sulphide
concentrator, the gearless motor drive and mill lining installations are now close to completion for
both the SAG and ball mills and the project is expected to commence production from sulphide
ore in the first half of 2017. A review of the project in July 2016 resulted in the expected capital
cost of construction being reduced by $100 million to $2,200 million. Aktogay has benefited from
the experience gained at Bozshakol and from the use of local contractors following the 2015
tenge devaluation.
The lower budget for Aktogay results in revised capital expenditure guidance for the project in
2016 of $230 million and $350 million in 2017. The final payment of $300 million to the principal
construction contractor for work performed in 2016 and 2017 remains deferred to 2018, after the
project has been completed.
Operational performance
The Group produced 52.6 kt of copper cathode equivalent in the first half of the year, an increase
of 43% compared to the prior year period, with the East Region and Bozymchak contributing 39.4
kt, Bozshakol 7.8 kt and Aktogay 5.4 kt. Following a strong first half the East Region and
Bozymchak mines are now expected to produce around 75 kt of copper cathode equivalent in
2016. Copper cathode equivalent production includes the finished metal equivalent of copper in
concentrate sold in the period. Bozshakol completed 18 shipments of copper concentrate to
smelting customers in China in the first half whilst output from the Aktogay oxide operations and
the East Region and Bozymchak mines was principally sold as copper cathode.
Zinc in concentrate production in the first half of the year was 39.6 kt, a reduction of 21%
compared to the prior year period mainly driven by a lower zinc grade at Artemyevsky. Output in
the second half is expected to be lower due to maintenance work at Orlovsky. The East Region
remains on track to achieve its full year production guidance of 70-75 kt of zinc in concentrate.
Gold bar equivalent production in the first half more than doubled to 39.1 koz compared to the
first half of 2015, as the Bozymchak concentrator operated at 100% of design capacity throughout
the period and as output from Bozshakol ramped up. Group gold bar equivalent production
comprises 17.9 koz from Bozymchak, 9.1 koz from Bozshakol and 12.1 koz from the East Region.
Gold bar equivalent production includes the finished metal equivalent of gold in concentrate sold
from Bozshakol and 5.2 koz of gold in concentrate from Bozymchak that was carried over from
2015 and sold to a third party processor in the first quarter. After strong output from Bozymchak in
the first half, the Group now expects gold bar equivalent production from the East Region and
Bozymchak to be 5 koz higher than previously guided, at 45-55 koz and Group gold bar
equivalent guidance has been narrowed to 95-115 koz.
Silver bar equivalent output of 1,430 koz reduced by 14% compared to the prior year period due
to a build-up of work in progress at the Balkhash smelter and lower silver in ore mined in the East
Region. Silver production in the East Region and Bozymchak will be lower in the second half but
the mines are on course to achieve their full year production guidance of 2,250-2,500 koz. At
Bozshakol we have achieved a payable silver in concentrate grade during the ramp up phase,
recognising 44 koz of silver bar equivalent production in the first half. Approximately 200 koz of
payable silver bar equivalent production is now expected from Bozshakol in the second half of
2016 and Group silver guidance is therefore increased to 2,500-2,750 koz.
Financial performance
The Group sold 45.5 kt of copper cathode and 8.7 kt of copper cathode equivalent in concentrate
in the first half. By-product sales volumes were 39.3 kt of zinc in concentrate, 39.1 koz of gold bar
equivalent and 1,383 koz of silver bar equivalent. The Group recognised $302 million of revenue,
excluding $61 million of sales from pre-commercial production at Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide,
a decrease of 11% compared to the first half of 2015 as the higher revenue from Bozymchak only
partially offset the effect of lower base metal and silver prices compared to the prior year period.
The East Region and Bozymchak recorded a gross cash cost of 178 USc/lb in the first half,
significantly below the first half 2015 cost of 270 USc/lb and below the 2016 full year guidance of
200-220 USc/lb. Following the strong cost performance in the first half, we have lowered our full
year guidance for gross cash cost in the East Region and Bozymchak by 10 USc/lb to 190-210
USc/lb. Unit costs are expected to increase in the second half as volumes will be lower due to
maintenance at Orlovsky and depletion at Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky. In addition, supplier
contracts renegotiated following the August 2015 devaluation of the tenge were not in effect for
the full first six months of the year.
The Group generated $115 million of EBITDA in the first half, or $147 million of Gross EBITDA
which includes capitalised EBITDA from Bozshakol and Aktogay. Gross EBITDA represents an
increase of $53 million or 56% versus the first half of 2015, as lower commodity prices were more
than offset by volume growth from Bozymchak, Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide and lower
operating costs in US dollar terms following the devaluation of the tenge in 2015. Operating profit
increased to $68 million from $15 million in the first half of 2015. The reported profit before tax
was $91 million and underlying profit was $76 million, both of which benefited from $32 million of
net foreign exchange gains, of which $23 million arose at Bozymchak on intercompany balances.
Sustaining capital expenditure was limited to $22 million in the first six months of the year and we
have reduced the full year guidance for the East Region by $10 million to $60-70 million, as we
continue to defer non-essential investments where possible. As a result of the reduction to the
Aktogay project budget, expansionary capex in 2016 is now guided to be approximately $525
million, consisting of $270 million at Bozshakol, $230 million at Aktogay, $20 million in the East
Region and $5 million at Koksay. The Group generated free cash flow before interest and
expansionary capital expenditure in the first half of $20 million.
Financial position
The Group's net debt position as at 30 June 2016 increased to $2,531 million as we continued to
invest in the development of our major growth projects. Available liquidity at 30 June was $1,066
million, consisting of $1,056 million of gross funds and $10 million of undrawn facilities.
The CDB loan facilities are now fully drawn with the remaining $250 million available for
financing Aktogay drawn down in March and June 2016. No changes have been made to any of
the Group's debt facilities during the first half, although lenders have been appraised of progress
on the ramp up at Bozshakol and construction progress at Aktogay on a regular basis. Monthly
principal repayments under the PXF facility commenced in January 2016, with all repayments to
date being met on schedule. The Group has built a strong track record with its lenders by
maintaining debt service and taking a proactive approach to its financing in order to avoid any
breach of terms of its debt facilities. With the recent encouraging progress in the commissioning
of Bozshakol and throughput increasing during July and August, the Group plans to commence
discussions with its lenders in the near future with a view to putting in place financing
arrangements that are appropriate to the business for 2017 and beyond.
Health and safety
We are disappointed to report five fatalities as a result of three incidents at our operations in the
year to date. We are continuing to make great efforts to improve our health and safety
performance and our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate in the first half of 2016 has
reduced to 1.38 per million man hours worked, compared to 1.59 in the prior year period. We are
establishing a new culture and an incentive system at the major growth projects focused on
leading indicators, which seeks to reward behaviour likely to prevent incidents before they occur.
Shareholder returns
The Group's dividend policy, established at the time of listing, is for the Board to consider the
cash generation and financing requirements of the business before recommending a suitable
dividend. This maintains flexibility, which is appropriate given the underlying cyclicality of a
commodity business. Given the financing requirements of the major growth projects during their
construction and ramp up, the Board does not recommend an interim dividend in respect of the
first half of the 2016 financial year. It is the Board's intention that the Group resumes dividend
payments in the future.
Outlook
Lower commodity prices have continued to affect the profitability and cash flow generation of the
Group in the first half of the year but we remain positive on the medium term outlook for copper. In
the first half, KAZ Minerals has continued to deliver its high growth and low-cost strategy with a
43% increase in copper production and significantly reduced costs in the East Region and
Bozymchak. Our growth is set to accelerate as we continue to ramp up production at Bozshakol,
followed by the commissioning of Aktogay in the first half of 2017.
operating review
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Group's operations include the four mines and three concentrators in the East Region, the
Bozymchak copper-gold mine in Kyrgyzstan and the major growth projects of Bozshakol and
Aktogay. Bozshakol produced its first copper in concentrate from sulphide ore in February 2016.
Aktogay commenced cathode production from oxide ore in December 2015 with production of
copper in concentrate from sulphide ore scheduled to begin in the first half of 2017. Bozshakol
and Aktogay are expected to deliver one of the highest growth rates in the industry.

Group copper cathode equivalent production increased by 43% to 52.6 kt against the
comparative period as a result of contributions from the major growth projects at Bozshakol and
Aktogay. Aktogay produced 5.4 kt of cathodes as the SX/EW facility continues to ramp up.
Production at Bozshakol commenced in February 2016, with the first sales of copper concentrate
recorded in March. Bozshakol concentrate is reported as copper cathode equivalent when sold,
after adjustment for the payable metal content, with a contribution of 7.8 kt in the period. The East
Region and Bozymchak operations produced 39.4 kt of copper cathode equivalent, an increase
of 2.7 kt or 7% from the prior period following successful optimisation works at Bozymchak in late
2015.

Ore output from the East Region totalled 1,904 kt in the first half of 2016, which was 99 kt or 5%
below the comparative period, principally due to lower volumes from Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky
as the residual reserves are extracted. The mine is expected to cease operation by the end of
2016. At Orlovsky there was a reduction in ore output as mining continued at deeper horizons.
As expected the average copper grade of 2.27% was below the prior year period, with lower
grades at Artemyevsky due to mining in a transitional area between two ore bodies, at Irtyshsky
which benefited from the mining of high grade areas in the first half of 2015 and at Yubileyno-
Snegirikhinsky as the grades continue to decline as the residual reserves are extracted. The 5%
lower ore output and the reduction in grade led to a 9% decrease in copper in ore mined.

Copper in concentrate output of 38.5 kt was 3.5 kt or 8% below the prior year period, consistent
with the reduction in copper in ore mined. The average recovery rate at the concentrators was in
line with the prior year period, despite the lower grade material processed.
The copper concentrate produced by the East Region is processed into cathode on a tolling
basis at the Balkhash smelter. In the first half of 2016, cathode production was in line with the
prior year period when there was a build-up of work in progress at the Balkhash smelter.
In the second half of the year output is expected to fall at Orlovsky as the mine switches to a six-
day rota to allow shaft maintenance works which will continue for approximately two years.
Output will also reduce at Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky as the mine approaches the end of its life.
The full year guidance for copper cathode equivalent production from the East Region is
unchanged at around 70 kt.

The volume of zinc in ore mined was 15% lower than the comparative period. This was the result
of grade depletion at Artemyevsky and Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky as extraction moved to lower
by-product content zones, as in the second half of 2015.
Zinc in concentrate production fell by 10.3 kt to 39.6 kt reflecting the lower extraction volumes
and a reduction in grade at Artemyevsky. The average zinc recovery rates at the concentrators
declined slightly due to the lower zinc grade in ore processed.
Due to scheduled maintenance at Orlovsky, zinc output will be lower in the second half of the
year. Full year zinc in concentrate production is expected to be between 70 kt and 75 kt.

The East Region mined 2,768 koz of silver in ore in the first half of 2016 which was 414 koz or
13% below the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a fall in output and lower
silver grades at Orlovsky as mining continues at deeper horizons and at Irtyshsky due to lower
grades and higher dilution rates.
Silver in concentrate production of 1,459 koz was 162 koz or 10% below the prior year period
due to the lower volume of silver in ore mined. The average silver recovery rate increased
following optimisation works at the Nikolayevsky concentrator in 2015 and the processing of
higher grade material from the Artemyevsky mine.
Silver bar output of 1,268 koz was 361 koz below the prior year period due to a build-up of work
in progress at the Balkhash smelter and lower silver in ore mined.
Silver bar production is expected to be in line with guidance of 2,250 koz to 2,500 koz for the full
year.

The East Region mined 35.6 koz of gold in ore in the first half of 2016, a decrease of 5.2 koz or
13% when compared to the prior year period. This was due to the reduction in ore mined and
lower gold grades at all mines.
Gold in concentrate production of 11.5 koz was 1.3 koz or 10% below the first half of 2015,
reflecting the lower gold in ore mined partially offset by a small improvement in concentrator
recovery rates.
Gold bar production increased by 1.1 koz to 12.1 koz in the first half of 2016 as a release of work
in progress at the Balkhash smelter more than offset the reduction in gold in concentrate output.
Gold bar output from the East Region is expected to be in line with guidance of between 18.0 koz
and 22.0 koz in 2016 as gold metal extracted will reduce in the second half of the year as the
Orlovsky mine moves to a six-day rota.

1   Excludes the cost of acquiring the third party cathode sold in 2015.
Revenues
The revenues generated by the East Region decreased by 23% to $261 million, reflecting lower
pricing for copper and a decrease in zinc sales volumes.
Revenue from copper cathode sales fell by 20% to $184 million as a result of a lower realised
copper price. The average LME copper price decreased by 21% to $4,701 per tonne in the first
half of 2016, from $5,929 per tonne in the comparative period. Cathode is sold to customers in
China or Europe based on the LME price plus a premium to reflect the terms of trade.
Cathode sales volumes in the first half of 2015 included 4 kt of cathode which was purchased
externally to compensate for variances in monthly cathode output, mainly because of
maintenance at the Balkhash smelter. The sale of the externally purchased cathode contributed
revenue of $22 million at a small margin. Excluding externally purchased material, the prior year
period copper cathode volumes were lower by 4 kt at 35 kt.
Revenue from by-products fell by a total of $35 million or 31% to $77 million due largely to a 25%
reduction in zinc volumes and a fall in zinc prices. The average market price for zinc in the first
half of 2016 was 16% below the first half of 2015. Gold revenues were marginally above the prior
year period, whilst there was a small reduction in silver revenues due to lower sales volumes.
EBITDA (excluding special items)
EBITDA of $108 million was in line with the comparative period as lower revenues were offset by
a reduction in cash operating costs. Cash operating costs of $153 million fell by 27% compared
to the first half of 2015 (excluding the $22 million cost of acquiring third party cathode) despite an
increase in copper sales volumes.
The reduction in operating costs was largely the result of foreign exchange. A significant portion
of the East Region's operating costs are denominated in tenge which, following a move to a free
float in August 2015, has traded at an average of 346 KZT/$ in the first half of 2016, compared to
an average of 185 KZT/$ in the first half of 2015. Input inflation has so far been muted as
management has taken a robust position in the renegotiation of contracts following the
devaluation and where possible, has delayed tenge related re-pricing. There has also been a
continued focus on cost control and optimisation initiatives, which, combined with a fall in the
cost of key input prices such as fuel has reduced costs.
As the repricing of contracts following the tenge devaluation was only completed during the first
half of 2016, the full impact will only be seen in the second half of the year.
Cash costs
The cost efficiency of the operations is measured by the gross and net cash cost of own copper
cathode sold. The gross cash cost of 177 USc/lb for the first half of 2016 was 34% below the 270
USc/lb recorded in the prior year period. The fall in gross cash cost reflects the reduction in
operating costs noted above as well as the increase in own cathode sales volumes.
The fall in net cash costs from 125 USc/lb to 88 USc/lb is due to the reduction in gross cash cost,
partially offset by lower by-product credits due largely to lower zinc prices and zinc volumes.
The Group previously gave gross cash cost guidance for the combined East Region and
Bozymchak operations of 200-220 USc/lb. As a result of the strong cost performance in the first
half, the full year gross cash cost guidance for the East Region and Bozymchak has been
lowered to 190-210 USc/lb. It is expected that the timing of some operating costs, in particular
summer maintenance works, will be weighted to the second half of the year which will include
the full impact of contract repricing from the devaluation. The per unit cost of copper will also be
affected by a reduction in volume due to scheduled maintenance at Orlovsky and from
Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky as the mine reaches the end of its life. In addition, sales volumes in the
first half of 2016 benefited from the one-off sale of Bozymchak concentrate material relating to
2015 production. In setting the cash cost guidance the tenge is assumed to trade in the mid-300s
over the second half of the year.
Capital expenditure
Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure totalled $18 million in the first half of the year, consistent with the
level in the corresponding period of 2015. Expenditure in the period included mine development
works, the purchase of mine equipment, expansion of tailings facilities and improvements to
ventilation at the Orlovsky mine. Also within sustaining capital expenditure was $3 million for
ongoing modernisation work at the Nikolayevsky concentrator.
Management has sought to defer capital projects where possible and as a result the sustaining
capital requirement for 2016 has been reduced by $10 million, to $60 million-$70 million,
including optimisation projects of $15 million. Similar to 2015, expenditure is expected to be
weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of works and when scheduled payments
under contracts fall due. Optimisation projects include the finalisation of the Nikolayevsky
modernisation works and the construction of a railway line between Artemyevsky and the
Nikolayevsky concentrator.
Expansionary
Expansionary capital expenditure of $4 million in the period relates to the initial mine
development works for the extension of the operational life of the existing Artemyevsky mine.
Total expenditure in 2016 is expected to be in the region of $20 million subject to contractor
progress in developing a ventilation tunnel. Following further reviews of the project schedule, the
majority of the expenditure will occur from 2019. The project is expected to incur around $30
million per year in 2017 and 2018 to progress shaft development.

Following the successful completion of optimisation works during the fourth quarter of 2015 when
the concentrator was closed for 36 days, the Bozymchak operations have operated at design
capacity throughout the first half of 2016. This has resulted in significantly higher copper in
concentrate produced, increasing from 1.3 kt in the prior period to 4.2 kt. Ore output has risen to
provide the additional feed required by the concentrator. Ore was extracted at an average copper
grade of 0.86%, which is above the reserve grade of 0.75% as higher grade sections are mined
in the initial years.
Copper cathode equivalent production includes 0.9 kt of copper in concentrate processed in
2015 and sold to a third party processor in the first half of 2016 to avoid a build-up of inventory
due to capacity restrictions at the Balkhash smelter. The concentrate contained 0.9 kt of copper,
5.2 koz of gold and 34 koz of silver in concentrate. The metal content in this concentrate has
been converted into finished metal equivalent based on the paid metal and reported as copper
cathode, gold bar and silver bar equivalent within the production figures for the first half of 2016.
Bozymchak is on track to exceed full year production guidance of 6 kt copper cathode equivalent.

The mine produced 24.5 koz of gold in ore in the first half of 2016, a 96% increase when
compared to the prior year period, reflecting the higher ore mined. The gold grade of 1.53 g/t is
below the prior year period, but above the average of the mine's ore reserves of 1.21 g/t as higher
grade sections are extracted in the initial years of the mine's operation.
Gold bar equivalent production of 17.9 koz was below the gold in concentrate production levels
due to a build-up of work in progress. Gold bar equivalent and silver bar equivalent production
benefited from the sale of concentrate material produced in 2015 and sold in the first half of 2016,
which included 4.7 koz of gold and 31 koz of silver in concentrate.
As a result of the higher output achieved in the first half of 2016, the gold bar equivalent
production guidance from Bozymchak has been increased to between 30 koz and 35 koz in
2016.

1   Includes revenues and operating costs prior to 1 July 2015 before the operation was declared
commercial.
The Bozymchak operations achieved commercial production from 1 July 2015 and during the first
half of 2015 project related revenues and operating costs were capitalised, including capitalised
EBITDA of $6 million. Therefore, the second half of 2015 is considered a more appropriate
comparison of performance.
During the first half of 2016, Bozymchak recorded revenues of $41 million, a significant increase
from the $16 million recorded in the second half of 2015. The optimisation works completed at
the end of 2015 have enabled operations to perform at design capacity throughout the period,
resulting in a doubling of production volumes. Revenues include $8 million from the sale of
copper concentrate (containing 0.9 kt of copper and 5.2 koz of gold in concentrate) carried
forward from 2015 as a result of the build-up of work in progress at the Balkhash smelter. Within
revenues are $18 million from the sale of 3.8 kt of copper cathode equivalent and $22 million
from the sale of 18 koz of gold bar equivalent. Copper cathode and gold bar is sold on the same
terms as the East Region operations.
Bozymchak recorded EBITDA of $26 million, an increase of $20 million from the second half of
2015 due to higher revenues from increased volumes. The gross cash cost of copper cathode
equivalent sold in the period was 184 USc/lb which compares to 362 USc/lb in the second half of
2015. The significant decrease reflects higher sales volumes, from 1.4 kt of copper cathode
equivalent in the second half of 2015 to 3.8 kt. Cash operating costs, similar to the East Region,
have benefited from lower input costs for key consumables. In addition, the weakening of the
Kyrgyz som to the US dollar, from an average of 68 KGS/$ during the second half of 2015 to 71
KGS/$ in the current period, has also reduced local costs. The cash cost is expected to increase
for the full year as the som is now trading at around 69 KGS/$ and the timing of certain works are
expected to be weighted to the second half of the year.
Due to the significant gold by-product credit Bozymchak recorded a negative net copper cash
cost of 94 USc/lb.
Capital expenditure
Sustaining
Sustaining capital expenditure totalled $4 million in the period, including stripping works at the
open pit mine as well as equipment and infrastructure. Sustaining capital for the full year is
expected to be around $10 million, in line with guidance.
Expansionary
The expansionary capital has reduced as the project is now complete and operational.
REVIEW OF MINING PROJECTS
Bozshakol
The development of the Bozshakol mine and on-site ore processing facilities in the north of
Kazakhstan is one of the Group's major growth projects. Bozshakol will have an annual ore
processing capacity of 30 million tonnes when fully ramped up and the deposit has a mine life of
40 years with an average copper grade of 0.36%. The mine and processing facilities will produce
100 kt of copper cathode equivalent and 120 koz of gold in concentrate per year on average over
the first 10 years of operations. Bozshakol is a first quartile asset on the global cost curve, with an
estimated net cash cost of 70-90 USc/lb (in 2016 terms) on average for the first 10 years after the
concentrator has been commissioned.
The first half of 2016 was a significant landmark for the project as the first production of copper in
concentrate was achieved from sulphide operations in February and the first sale of material
successfully completed in March. The ramp up of the sulphide plant to a design capacity of 25
MT of ore per annum is now ongoing. Commercial levels of production are expected to be
achieved in the second half of 2016 and full capacity achieved during 2017. Construction of the
clay plant has progressed during the period and is on track for commissioning in the fourth
quarter of the year.

The mining of sulphide ores at Bozshakol began in the second half of 2015. The 11,016 kt of ore
extracted in the first half of 2016 consisted of 4,569 kt of sulphide ore and 6,447 kt of clay ore.
The clay ore has been stockpiled for processing at the separate 5 MT per annum clay plant
ahead of its commissioning later in 2016.
The copper grade of 0.56% of the ore extracted was above the life of mine copper grade as
operations in the initial years are focused on the higher grade zones of the deposit. The deposit
also contains gold, silver and molybdenum. The gold grade in 2016 averaged 0.28 g/t which is
expected to decrease during 2016, but, similar to copper, will remain above the life of mine
average during the initial years as higher grade zones are mined.

Bozshakol started producing copper concentrate in February 2016. No major issues have been
encountered during commissioning and the main sections of the plant are now in operation.
100% load tests have been successfully performed on key equipment.
In the first half of 2016 the concentrator produced 10.6 kt of copper in concentrate and 13 koz of
gold in concentrate. Throughput increased in the second quarter but was limited by a planned 17
day shutdown in May for bolt tightening and other maintenance procedures required by the mill
manufacturer, and minor commissioning issues requiring repair in June. The plant is continuing
to ramp up and has achieved over 60% of ore throughput capacity in August to date. Commercial
production is expected to be achieved in the second half of 2016. Following commissioning
works in the first half of the year the production guidance in 2016 has been narrowed to 45-55 kt
of copper cathode equivalent and 50-60 koz of gold bar equivalent.
Bozshakol recorded copper cathode equivalent output of 7.8 kt and gold bar equivalent output of
9.1 koz in the period, calculated as the payable metal equivalent of the concentrate sold in the
period. In addition, the successful recovery of silver was achieved at a commercially payable
level which has resulted in silver bar equivalent sales of 44 koz in the period and silver bar
equivalent output from Bozshakol of 250 koz for 2016 is expected. Sales shipments are operating
smoothly, with 18 loads dispatched to China in the period.

The project has not yet reached commercial levels of production and therefore all revenues and
operating costs continue to be capitalised as capital expenditure. The negative EBITDA
represents overhead costs incurred in preparing the operations for commercial production. The
sulphide operations are expected to achieve commercial production during the second half of
2016.
Total revenues of $45 million have been recorded and capitalised during the first half of 2016.
The first shipment of copper concentrate was dispatched to China-based customers in March,
with shipments totalling 7.8 kt of copper cathode equivalent, after adjustment for the copper
payable. Copper revenues were $32 million at a realised price of $4,057/t of copper in
concentrate. In addition, by-product revenues were $12 million and $1 million from 9 koz and 44
koz of gold and silver in concentrate respectively. The realised price for copper concentrate sales
is based on the LME price, minus a deduction applied for TC/RCs.
The gross cash cost for Bozshakol is expressed on a unit of cathode basis, after applying copper
recovery and TC/RC terms. In the first half of 2016, a period of initial ramp up and commissioning
and with limited sales volumes, the gross cash cost was around 152 USc/lb. During this period
costs have benefited from the weak tenge, the mining of higher grade and softer material and a
deferral of certain fixed costs prior to the operations approaching design capacity. As a result of
performance in the first half of the year the gross cash cost guidance for the full year 2016 has
been reduced to 140-160 USc/lb, including the period prior to the achievement of commercial
levels of production. The gross cash cost will be dependent on a successful ramp up of ore
throughput rates in the second half of 2016.
In the first half of 2016 direct project capital expenditure, excluding capitalised interest on debt
facilities, was $87 million. Capital activities during this period included expenditure relating to the
completion and pre-commissioning of the sulphide operations, including the pebble crusher, high
pressure grinding roller, bagging plant and the molybdenum circuit. The majority of the capital
expenditure relates to the clay plant, which is expected to begin commissioning in the fourth
quarter of 2016. The project cost includes $21 million relating to the mining and stockpiling of
clay ore, to enable access to sulphide ore prior to commissioning the clay plant. Other activity in
the period included the final mechanical installation and commissioning of the ball and SAG mill
and installations for the grinding, thickener, flotation and regrind circuits.
As at 30 June 2016 around $1,970 million had been spent on the project. The total anticipated
cost of the project remains unchanged at $2,150 million, with expenditure of around $270 million
expected for the full year 2016, including the final payments to complete the clay plant and for
contractual retentions.
An additional amount of $20 million has been incurred and recorded as expansionary capital
expenditure relating to the revenues and operating costs incurred and capitalised during the
period prior to commercial levels of production, as well as initial working capital. As previously
guided the project is forecast to require around $50 million of working capital in 2016, depending
on the speed of the ramp up.
Aktogay
The Aktogay project in the East of Kazakhstan is the Group's second large scale, open pit,
copper mining asset under construction. The deposit has a mine life of more than 50 years with
average copper grades of 0.33% (sulphide) and 0.37% (oxide). Aktogay is competitively
positioned on the global cost curve with an estimated net cash cost of 100-120 USc/lb (in 2016
terms) for the first 10 years after the concentrator has been commissioned. The project will
produce an average of 90 kt of copper cathode equivalent from sulphide ore and 15 kt of copper
cathode from oxide ore per year over the first 10 years of operations.
Significant progress was made at Aktogay in the first half of the year, with the ramp up of the
SX/EW plant following first production from oxide operations in December 2015 and the
construction of the sulphide concentrator. Following a period of steady output, the oxide
operations have achieved commercial levels of production from 1 July 2016. Construction at the
main sulphide concentrator is on track for commissioning in the first half of 2017.

Following the commencement of mining operations at Aktogay in the second quarter of 2015,
8,679 kt of oxide ore has been extracted to supply the heap leach process in the first half of 2016.
The copper grade of 0.41% of the ore extracted was above the life of mine copper grade as
operations in the initial years are focused on the higher copper grade zones of the deposit.
Mining activity ramped up during early 2016, increasing the rate at which oxide ore is placed on
the heap leach pads. At the end of the period, heap leach cells #101 to #106 were loaded with
oxide ore and cells #102 to #105 were under irrigation. Each of the nine heap leach cells has a
capacity of approximately 1,000 kt of ore per cycle. Each cycle of irrigation lasts around four
months.
Mining of sulphide ore, which will be stockpiled in preparation for use at the new concentrator in
2017, is expected to commence in the second half of 2016.
In the first half of 2016, 5.4 kt of copper cathode was produced as the SX/EW processing facility
ramped up. Improvements were made at the SX/EW plant during the second quarter increasing
the capacity and efficiency of the automated cathode stripping system in the EW facility. The
facility is on track to achieve the Group's production guidance of 15 kt in 2016.

The oxide operations achieved commercial levels of production from 1 July 2016, following a
stable level of output during the second quarter of 2016. As a result, going forward all revenues
and operating costs will be recognised in the income statement. During the first half of 2016 the
project had not achieved commercial levels of production, therefore, as in the comparative period
all revenues and operating costs have been capitalised. The negative EBITDA represents
administrative and operational readiness costs incurred relating to the sulphide plant.
Following the first production of copper cathode in December 2015, the first sale was recorded in
January 2016. Revenues of $16 million from the sale of 3.3 kt of copper cathode at a realised
price of $4,734/t have been capitalised during the period.
The gross operating cost for production from the oxide plant is expected to be 110-130 USc/lb
over the full year, including the period prior to commercial levels of production. The gross cash
cost during the first half of the year, from limited sales volumes during the commissioning period,
was around 156 USc/lb. This is expected to reduce in the second half of the year as output
increases and processing and efficiency gains from scheduled works and the increased
automation of cathode stripping are achieved.
In the first half of 2016 direct project capital expenditure, excluding capitalised interest on debt
facilities, was $73 million. This expenditure included final completion and commissioning of the
oxide SX/EW plant. In addition, works have continued at the sulphide concentrator where activity
has included installation of the primary crusher, ball and SAG mills, overland conveyor and
stockpile and reclaim areas. The sulphide plant is on target to begin operations in the first half of
2017. Construction work for the rest of the year will be focused on mechanical completion and
commissioning of the concentrator as well as the completion of non-process buildings and the
tailings storage facility. Additional local subcontractors are being mobilised to accelerate
mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation works.
Following a review, the total project cost has been reduced by $100 million to $2,200 million. The
project has benefited from the experience gained at Bozshakol and from the use of local
contractors following the tenge devaluation.
At the end of the period around $1,395 million had been spent on the project. Aktogay is now
expected to require approximately $230 million in 2016 and $350 million in 2017. As previously
announced, the final payment of $300 million to the project's principal construction contractor is
deferred to 2018. There was no change to the overall amount payable to NFC. At 30 June 2016,
the amount payable under this agreement was $179 million and is included within other non-
current payables.
In addition to direct project costs, expansionary capital expenditure includes capitalised pre-
commercial cash flows and working capital of $12 million.
Koksay
In 2014 the Group acquired a third major growth project, Koksay, which is located in south
eastern Kazakhstan. The project is estimated to have a life of over 20 years with average annual
production of around 80 kt of copper cathode equivalent along with gold, silver and molybdenum
by-products.
The project is expected to incur expenditure of around $5 million in 2016 to continue scoping
study works, of which $1 million has been incurred during the period.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU,
using accounting policies consistent with those adopted in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Bozshakol sulphide and Aktogay oxide plants commenced sales during the six months to 30
June 2016 and were in pre-commercial production throughout the period. During the pre-
commercial production phase, revenues and operating costs are capitalised within property,
plant and equipment as part of the cost of construction and are not included in the income
statement. The Financial Review and the condensed consolidated financial statements (note
4(a)(i)) include the metrics Gross Revenues and Gross EBITDA, which incorporate the results of
the Bozshakol sulphide and Aktogay oxide plants before capitalisation to provide a measure of
their performance for the period.
For the six months to June 2015, Gross Revenues and Gross EBITDA include Bozymchak's pre-
commercial production activities. Bozymchak achieved commercial production on 1 July 2015

Gross Revenues for the first half of 2016 were $363 million compared to $353 million in the prior
year period, an increase of 3%, reflecting the impact of higher copper and gold sales volumes at
Bozymchak and the commencement of sales from Bozshakol and the Aktogay oxide plant, partly
offset by lower copper and zinc prices and reduced silver and zinc sales volumes from the East
Region operations.
Gross Revenues for the first half of 2016 include sales from Bozshakol of $45 million and
Aktogay of $16 million from pre-commercial production. For the first half of 2015, pre-commercial
production revenues of $12 million arose solely from Bozymchak.
Revenues recognised in the income statement decreased by 11% from $341 million to $302
million due to lower copper and zinc prices and lower zinc volumes from the East Region
operations, partly offset by $41 million revenues from Bozymchak, which achieved commercial
production on 1 July 2015.
Further information and analysis on Gross Revenues and revenues by operating segment is
found in the Operating Review.
Operating Profit
Operating profit for the first half of 2016 was $68 million compared to $15 million in 2015, an
increase of $43 million reflecting a contribution from Bozymchak of $21 million and the impact of
lower depreciation, MET charges and impairments from the East Region operations. Further
details are described below.
EBITDA (excluding special items) by
operating segment
EBITDA (excluding special items) has been chosen as the key measure in assessing the
underlying trading performance of the Group. This performance measure removes the non-cash
component of the disability benefits obligation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, MET,
royalties and those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact
the underlying trading performance. The Directors believe that the exclusion of MET and
royalties provides a more informed measure of the operational profitability given the nature of the
taxes as further explained in the 'Taxation' section.
Gross EBITDA (excluding special items) includes the EBITDA earned by the Group's
development assets during their pre-commercial production stage, which is capitalised to
property, plant and equipment.

Gross EBITDA for the Group rose by 56% from $94 million to $147 million following the increase
in sales volumes from Bozymchak and the commencement of sales from Bozshakol and the
Aktogay oxide plant. The Gross EBITDA margin for the Group improved from 27% in the first half
of 2015 to 40% in the first half of 2016 primarily due to the impact of the tenge devaluation,
reducing costs in US dollar terms at the Kazakhstan operations.
On 20 August 2015, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced that the tenge would trade
freely. Following that announcement, the tenge devalued and ended 2015 at 339.47 to the US
dollar. In the six months to 30 June 2016, the tenge averaged 346.11 per US dollar compared to
185.25 for the six months to 30 June 2015.
The East Region's EBITDA of $108 million was in line with the $109 million in the first half of
2015 as lower revenues were offset by reduced cash operating costs. Cash operating costs in
the first half of 2016 of $153 million were $57 million lower than the first half of 2015 (excluding
the cost of purchased cathode sold to fulfil customer obligations), reflecting the significant impact
of the tenge devaluation on its cost base which is predominantly in local currency and the
continued cost control measures.
Bozymchak's Gross EBITDA of $26 million is higher than the $5 million reported in the first half of
2015 reflecting increased production and sales volumes as the plant achieved its design
capacity in December 2015. During the pre-commercial production phase and in the first half of
2015, EBITDA of $6 million was capitalised to property, plant and equipment resulting in a
negative EBITDA of $1 million, being the administration and operational readiness costs incurred
ahead of commercial production.
At Bozshakol, Gross EBITDA improved from a loss of $6 million to a contribution of $23 million
due to the ramp up of production and sales activities.
Aktogay's Gross EBITDA improved to $2 million following the commencement of sales of
cathode material from the oxide plant partly offset by higher levels of administration and
operational readiness activities which largely relate to the sulphide plant. The Aktogay oxide
plant achieved commercial levels of production from 1 July 2016 from when revenues and
operating costs will be recognised in the income statement.
Corporate costs of $12 million were consistent with the first half of 2015 as cost saving measures
continued.
The increase in Group EBITDA from $88 million to $115 million in the first half of 2016 is
attributed to the contribution from the Bozymchak operation.
Please refer to the Operating Review for a detailed analysis of the Group's EBITDA by operating
segment.
Special items
Special items within operating profit:
Write-offs and impairment charges
During the first half of 2016, an impairment of $3 million at the East Region operations has been
recognised against property, plant and equipment which is not expected to be utilised.
During the first half of 2015, the following impairment charges were recognised:
·     Property, plant and equipment - a charge of $8 million which primarily related to the
impairment of administrative land and buildings in Kazakhstan, retained in the Restructuring,
which were not in use.
·      Mining assets - a charge of $4 million against mine development works which were not
expected to be utilised.
Loss on disposal of assets
During the first half of 2015, a $2 million loss was recognised on assets that the Group no longer
intended to develop and were disposed of.
Other items outside of EBITDA
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation for the first half of 2016 of $19 million is $9 million lower
than the $28 million charge in the first half of 2015 as a result of the August 2015 tenge
devaluation. This was partially offset by a higher charge at Bozymchak which commenced
depreciation of its asset base on achieving commercial production from 1 July 2015.
Excess component of the disability benefits obligation
The non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation was a $2 million credit for the first
half of 2015. This arose as the payments made in that period exceeded the income statement
cost, excluding interest.
MET and royalties
The MET charge for the East Region of $22 million for the first half of 2016 was below the $33
million charge in 2015, reflecting the impact of lower commodity prices and metal in ore mined
across all products.
Bozshakol and Aktogay incurred MET from the second half of 2015 when mining operations
commenced. During the first half of 2016, MET incurred on metal in ore mined was $24 million
and $9 million at Bozshakol and Aktogay respectively and was capitalised as the operations
were in the pre-commercial production phase.
Bozymchak's royalties on invoiced sales in the first half of 2016 were $3 million compared to the
$1 million in 2015 which was capitalised to property, plant and equipment. The increase reflects
the higher sales volumes at Bozymchak in 2016 partly offset by lower commodity prices.
Net finance income/costs
Net finance income/costs include:
·      Net foreign exchange gains of $32 million compared to a $5 million loss in the first half of
2015.
·      Interest expense of $11 million, up from $9 million in the first half of 2015.
·      Interest on the employee benefits obligation and unwinding of discounts on other provisions
of $2 million, consistent with the first half of 2015.
·      Interest income on cash deposits and short-term investments of $4 million, marginally higher
than the first half of 2015.
The $32 million net foreign exchange gain in the first half of 2016 was principally driven by the
impact of the 11% appreciation of the Kyrgyz som from 31 December 2015 and the 9%
depreciation in the UK pound sterling in June 2016. The appreciation of the som on Bozymchak's
US dollar denominated intercompany net debt resulted in a gain of $23 million. The depreciation
of the UK pound sterling in June 2016 against the US dollar gave rise to a $9 million gain on
intercompany liabilities. Exchange gains of $3 million were recognised on the CDB Aktogay
CNY debt following the appreciation of the US dollar. These gains were partially offset by $3
million of exchange losses arising from the marginal appreciation of the tenge on net US dollar
financial assets in the Kazakhstan operations. The net exchange loss of $5 million in the first half
of 2015 was mainly attributed to exchange losses arising on Bozymchak's US dollar
intercompany net debt following the weakening of the Kyrgyz som over that period.
The interest expense in the income statement of $11 million (2015: $9 million) is after the
capitalisation of interest to the cost of the mining projects of Bozshakol and Aktogay. The total
cost of debt for the period was $95 million compared to $77 million in the first half of 2015. The
increase is attributed to a higher average cost of borrowing due to higher LIBOR rates and on an
increased level of borrowings as the draw down of the remaining CDB Aktogay USD facility
exceeded repayments on the PXF and CDB Bozshakol and Bozymchak debt. Of the total interest
expense, $84 million (2015: $68 million) was capitalised to the cost of the projects.
Taxation
The table below shows the Group's effective tax rate and the all-in effective tax rate which takes

1    The all-in effective tax rate is calculated as the income tax expense plus MET and royalties,
less the tax effect of special items and other non-recurring items, divided by profit before taxation
which is adjusted for MET and royalties, special items and other non-recurring items. The all-in
effective tax rate is considered to be a more representative tax rate on the recurring profits of the
Group.
Effective tax rate
In the first half of 2016, the effective tax rate was 20% as the utilisation of prior period
unrecognised tax losses at Bozymchak fully offset a current period tax charge arising on its pre-
tax profits of $38 million. The effective tax rate also reflects the impact of non-deductible costs,
principally social spending commitments incurred in the Kazakhstan operations.
The effective tax rate in the first half of 2015 of 750% arose as a tax charge of $15 million was
realised on a profit before taxation of $2 million. The tax charge reflects non-deductible expenses
incurred principally at the East Region and unrecognised tax losses from the Bozymchak
operations and the Group's UK financing entity.
All-in effective tax rate
The all-in effective tax rate decreased to 36% from 96% in the first half of 2015 as the adjusted
profit before taxation increased by $70 million following the tenge devaluation and the positive
contribution from Bozymchak. MET and royalties decreased by $8 million due to lower metal in
ore mined and lower commodity prices. The higher rate in the first half of 2015 was negatively
impacted by unrecognised tax losses at Bozymchak and by MET representing a greater
proportion of the adjusted profit before taxation. As MET is determined independently of the
profitability of operations, in periods of lower profitability the all-in effective tax rate increases, as
the impact of MET and royalties is elevated due to their revenue based nature. Conversely,
during periods of higher profitability, the MET and royalties' impact on the all-in effective tax rate
decreases.
Taxation effect of special items
In the first half of 2016, the taxation impact on special items was insignificant.
For the first half of 2015, the taxation charge of $1 million relates to the reversal of deferred tax
assets arising from the sale of mining assets.

Dividends
The Company did not pay any dividends in the first half of 2016 and taking into consideration the
increase in the Group's net debt during the construction and ramp up phase of the two major
growth projects, the Directors will not declare an interim dividend for 2016. The Board will
continue to assess the Group's financial position, its cash flows and growth requirements in
determining when to resume dividend payments in the future.

1    EBITDA (excluding special items) is defined as profit before interest, taxation, depreciation,
depletion, amortisation, the non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation, MET and
royalties. Please refer to note 4(a)(i) of the consolidated financial statements.
2    Excludes working capital and MET movements arising from pre-commercial production
activities at the Bozshakol and Aktogay operations.
3    Capital expenditure includes the capitalisation of $12 million and $41 million of net operating
cash outflows from the Aktogay and Bozshakol projects (30 June 2015: $2 million from the
Bozymchak project) in the period ahead of commercial production. Of the $41 million, $21 million
relates to stockpiled clay ore at Bozshakol.
Summary
The lower Free Cash Flow in the first half of 2016 reflects the working capital requirements in the
East Region partly offset by higher EBITDA and lower sustaining capital expenditure as interest,
MET, royalties and income tax payments remained at a similar level to the first half of 2015. Cash
flows used in operating activities of $63 million shown in the consolidated statement of cash
flows reconciles to Free Cash Flow by excluding payments made on VAT associated with the
major projects of $20 million and by including sustaining capital expenditure of $22 million.
Working capital
Working capital requirements in the table above of $34 million exclude Bozshakol and Aktogay
pre-commercial production amounts which are included within expansionary and new project
capital expenditure. The Group's operating assets' working capital outflow during the first half of
2016 arose mainly due to the following factors:
·      Inventory levels have risen by $7 million following an increase in copper and gold work in
progress at the East Region and Bozymchak. There was also a build-up of silver and zinc
finished goods and raw material spares at the East Region.
·      Trade and other receivables increased by $4 million due to the timing of cash receipts and
lower revenues.
·      Prepayments and other current assets increased by $11 million primarily from a build-up of
VAT receivable and advances paid for processing services in the East Region. The East Region
received a $15 million VAT refund in July 2016.
·      A $12 million reduction in trade and other payables mainly relates to the release of payments
received in advance for inventory delivered to customers.
Working capital movements at Bozshakol and Aktogay incurred during pre-commercial
production (financed in part by the project budget) are reflected within expansionary capital
expenditure in the cash flow above and are not included within Free Cash Flow. The pre-
commercial movements include a $32 million outflow for consumables and raw materials, a $20
million increase in trade and other receivables and a $6 million increase in prepayments, partly
offset by a $24 million increase in trade and other payables and a $17 million increase in fixed
asset payables.
In the first half of 2015, inventory levels increased by $20 million following a build-up of work in
progress at the Balkhash smelter due to maintenance works in the second quarter of 2015 and
an increase in goods in transit. Trade and other receivables reduced by $76 million mainly due to
the winding down of trading relationships with the Disposal Assets and a beneficial change in
the mix of sales terms. Prepayments increased by $16 million from a build-up of VAT receivable
in the East Region. Trade and other payables were $44 million lower following the settlement of
payables to the Disposal Assets in respect of sales arrangements which ended in late 2014.
Interest cash flows
Interest paid during the first half of 2016 of $85 million was in line with the first half of 2015. The
similar level of payments between the periods reflects timing of settlements with interest payable
$24 million higher at 30 June 2016 compared to 30 June 2015.
Income tax, MET and royalties
Income tax payments for the first half of 2016 of $15 million were broadly in line with the income
statement charge. At 30 June 2016, the Group was in a net tax payable position of $13 million,
after foreign exchange movements, consistent with the balance at 31 December 2015.
MET and royalty payments of $26 million relating to the East Region and Bozymchak operations
are included in operating cash flow. The MET paid on ore mined at Bozshakol and Aktogay of
$23 million and $5 million respectively is reflected within expansionary capital expenditure. At 30
June 2016, the MET and royalties payable was $32 million compared to $17 million at 31
December 2015, attributed largely to increased mining activity at Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure of $22 million was slightly below the $25 million in the first half of
2015. The East Region's sustaining capital expenditure was $18 million with $4 million relating
to Bozymchak. Expansionary and new project expenditure of $197 million was below the $509
million invested in the first half of 2015 and includes $53 million of operating cash outflows at the
major projects. Total capital expenditure incurred in the first half of 2016 was $219 million, $315
million lower than the $534 million spent in the first half of 2015. Please refer to the Operating
Review for an analysis of the Group's capital expenditure by operating segment.
Free Cash Flow
The Group's Free Cash Flow before interest payments on borrowings was $20 million compared
to $30 million in the first half of 2015 with the decrease attributed to higher working capital
requirements in the East Region and Bozymchak operations partly offset by increased EBITDA
from Bozymchak. When interest payments are taken into account, Free Cash Flow was an
outflow of $65 million compared to $55 million in the corresponding prior period.
Other investing cash flows
In 2016, other investing cash flows relates to interest received on cash and cash equivalents and
deposits of $4 million (2015: $3 million) and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and
equipment of $1 million (2015: $3 million).
BALANCE SHEET
The Group's attributable profit for the period of $73 million and the non-cash effects of net foreign
currency translation losses of $12 million recognised within equity, led to a $61 million increase
in equity attributable to owners of the Company to $381 million at 30 June 2016. The non-cash
foreign currency gain arose from movements in the tenge and som against the US dollar on the
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz entities' foreign currency denominated net assets.
Net debt
Net debt consists of cash and cash equivalents, current investments (at 31 December 2015) and
borrowings as reflected in the table below:

Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2016 totalled $1,056 million and were lower than the
$1,251 million at 31 December 2015, as the draw downs of the Group's CDB Aktogay debt
facility were more than offset by the continued development of the major growth projects, interest
payments and debt repayments. Current investments at 31 December 2015 were bank term
deposits. At 30 June 2016, all of the Group's gross liquid funds were cash and cash equivalents.
To manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly
in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes.
The funds within the UK are held primarily with major European and US financial institutions and
triple- 'A' rated liquidity funds. At 30 June 2016, $1,017 million of cash and short-term deposits
were held in the UK and the Netherlands and $39 million in Kazakhstan.
As at 30 June 2016, gross debt was $3,587 million, an increase of $83 million from the position
as at 31 December 2015 reflecting the $166 million principal repayments under the Group's
borrowings being offset by the $250 million drawn down under the CDB Aktogay finance facility.
The principal repayments during the period consisted of $92 million under the CDB
Bozshakol/Bozymchak finance facility, $6 million under the CDB Aktogay CNY finance facility,
$58 million under the PXF and $10 million under the CAT facility, which is expected to be re-
drawn in the second half of 2016.
Gross borrowings at 30 June 2016 consisted of $1,791 million under the CDB
Bozshakol/Bozymchak facilities, $1,467 million under the CDB Aktogay finance facility, $289
million under the PXF and $40 million under the CAT facility.
Full details of the terms of the Group's borrowings are included in note 11 of the consolidated
financial statements.
Other significant matters
NFC contract agreement
In November 2015, the Group signed an agreement with its principal construction contractor,
NFC, to defer payment of $300 million relating to the Aktogay project such that the amounts will
be due for settlement in the first half of 2018. There was no change to the overall amount payable
to NFC. At 30 June 2016, the amount payable under this agreement was $179 million and is
included within other non-current payables.
Going concern
At current market commodity prices and on the basis that the debt facilities are maintained with
an unchanged repayment profile, the Board considers the Group has adequate liquidity over the
going concern period. However, in the event of a reasonably possible delay in the expected ramp
up at Bozshakol the Group would likely be required to take certain mitigating actions, including
raising additional liquidity, as described below.
The Group's PXF facility and CAT facility are subject to financial covenants, in particular the net
debt to EBITDA covenant which is next due to be tested as at 31 December 2016. It is expected
this covenant will be breached when tested at that time. At current copper prices it is expected
this ratio will improve as Bozshakol and Aktogay operations ramp up. Following an improvement
in the ramp up of Bozshakol in July and August 2016, the Group intends to make a formal
approach to the banks during the third quarter of 2016 with a view to agreeing a refinancing with
suitable amendments to the financial covenants that will allow the facilities to continue without
triggering a technical default. Based on discussions with its lenders during 2016, the Board is
confident that the banks will view favourably amendments to the financial covenants and a
refinancing of the facilities provided the Group's debt service obligations continue to be
maintained, which forecasts indicate is likely to be the case. This conclusion is supported by the
short term nature of the breach as well as the quality of the Group's assets, in particular the
Bozshakol and Aktogay mines which have long operational lives and provide large scale output
at first quartile cash costs. The Board's analysis therefore assumes that the debt facilities
continue throughout the going concern assessment period.
However, if a waiver or temporary suspension of the net debt to EBITDA covenant is not
accompanied with a refinancing, in the event of a sustained fall in commodity prices below
current levels, other mitigating actions would be required to secure liquidity over the going
concern period, which could include obtaining new facilities to provide additional financing
and/or the postponement of certain capital expenditure, both of which the Board believes could
be achieved. Accordingly, the Board is satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
The significant risks identified by KAZ Minerals are those that could materially affect the Group's
financial condition, performance, strategy and prospects together with their potential impact and
the mitigating actions being taken by management, are set out in the 2015 Annual Report and
Accounts, which is available at www.kazminerals.com.
In the view of the Board, the principal risks set out in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts
reflect the significant risks and uncertainties for the Group for the remaining six months of 2016,
with a summary and any key changes described below, including an update on liquidity risk.
There may be other risks unknown, or currently believed immaterial by the Group, which might
become material. The risks set out below are not in order of likelihood of occurrence or
materiality and should be viewed, as with any forward-looking statements in this document, with
regard to the cautionary statement on page 3.
Operational risks
Health and safety
Mining is a hazardous industry with inherent risks and the failure to adopt and embed health and
safety management systems could result in harm to the Group's employees, contractors or local
communities as well as fines and penalties and damage to its reputation.
Business interruption
The Group's mining and processing operations are resource intensive, and could be subject to a
number of risks, including, but not limited to: geological and technological challenges; weather
and other natural phenomena such as floods and earthquakes; fires and explosions; failures to
critical machinery with long lead times for replacement; delays in supplies or services; and loss
or interruption to key inputs such as electricity and water. Any of these factors could result in
prolonged shutdowns or periods of reduced production from the Group's mines and
concentrators.
Political risk
The Group's mining operations and development projects are all based in Kazakhstan, except
the Bozymchak mine, which is located in Kyrgyzstan. The Group's operational and financial
performance is impacted by the social, political, economic, legal and fiscal conditions prevailing
in both countries.
New projects
The development of new projects involves many risks including geological, engineering,
procurement, staffing, financing and regulatory risks. If the Group fails to adopt an appropriate
procurement and project management strategy it may experience delays to project schedules
and an increase in development costs. Regulatory risks include failures to obtain and maintain
applicable permits, licences or approvals from the relevant authorities to perform certain
development work. These risks increase during the ramp up of the Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide
projects as equipment is commissioned and operating practices established. The speed of ramp
up is dependent on the successful start-up and operation of equipment and the performance of
suppliers and the workforce.
Employees
The Group's future development will be partly dependent on its ability to attract and retain highly
skilled and qualified personnel. KAZ Minerals competes against local and international mining
and industrial companies to attract skilled personnel into the business. The remote location of
some of the Group's operations also makes the attraction and retention of skilled staff at these
sites more challenging. The hiring and training of skilled personnel is important for the successful
operation of the Bozshakol and Aktogay projects.
Suppliers and contractors
The Group relies on services and materials provided by external suppliers and contractors.
Smelting, electricity supply, shaft sinking and auxiliary construction may be provided by the
Disposal Assets, owned by Cuprum Holding, a related party. As these suppliers are not owned
by KAZ Minerals, there can be no guarantee that these services or other services sourced
externally will be provided to the standards required by the Group and will not be subject to
delay, interruption or periods of non-availability.
In periods of increased demand, supplies may not always be readily available which can result in
an increase in lead times and cost inflation for raw materials and items such as mining and
processing equipment. The Group is reliant on the services of specialist contractors for the
development and commissioning of the major growth projects. KAZ Minerals also requires
transportation and logistics providers to move production materials and finished goods.
Labour and community relations
Many of the Group's employees are represented by labour unions under various collective labour
agreements. Negotiation of wages may become more difficult in times of higher commodity prices
or higher domestic inflation as labour unions may seek wage increases and additional forms of
compensation. The devaluation in the tenge has increased the uncertainty over future wage
negotiation. The Group's employees may seek wage increases outside the collective labour
agreements and labour agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage. Labour unions
may resist measures to raise labour efficiency.
The Group currently operates in areas of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan where it is a major
employer and may also provide targeted support to the local community. Community
expectations are typically complex with the potential for different and varying views by
stakeholders that may be difficult to resolve. Industrial accidents, health and safety and
environmental incidents may negatively affect the Group's community relationships.
Reserves and resources
KAZ Minerals' ore reserves for operating mines and development projects are largely based on
the estimation method for reserves and resources established by the former Soviet Union. There
are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and geological, technical and
economic assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when
new information becomes available.
Compliance risks
Subsoil use rights
In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan all subsoil reserves belong to the State. Subsoil use rights are not
granted in perpetuity and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant
contract or licence. Rights may be terminated if the Group does not satisfy its licensing or
contractual obligations, which may include financial commitments to State authorities and the
satisfaction of mining, development, environmental, social, and health and safety requirements.
In recent years, legislation relating to subsoil use rights has increased licence obligations,
technical documentation, work programmes and the level of goods and services sourced from
Kazakhstan. The authorities have also increased their monitoring of compliance with legislation
and subsoil use contract requirements.
Environmental compliance
The Group operates in an industry that is subject to numerous environmental laws and
regulations. As regulatory standards and requirements continually develop, the Group may be
exposed to increased compliance costs and environmental emissions charges. Policies and
measures at a national and international level to tackle climate change will increasingly affect the
business, thereby presenting greater environmental and regulatory risks.
Financial risks
Commodity prices
The Group's policy is to sell its products under contract at prices determined by reference to
prevailing market prices on international global metal exchanges. The Group's financial results
are strongly influenced by commodity prices, in particular copper and the major by-products,
gold, silver and zinc. The prices for these metals are dependent on a number of factors, including
world supply and demand and investor sentiment. In particular, KAZ Minerals is exposed to
demand from China, a major consumer of the metals which the Group produces. Due to these
factors, commodity prices may be subject to significant fluctuations, which could have a positive
or negative impact on the Group's financial results.
Foreign exchange and inflation risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk when transactions are not conducted in US dollars. The
Group's operations are primarily located in Kazakhstan, with the Bozymchak operations located
in Kyrgyzstan. Prior to August 2015, the Kazakhstan tenge was a managed currency with
relatively low volatility. In August 2015 the tenge was floated, triggering a significant devaluation
and significantly increased volatility. The Kazakhstan tenge depreciated from a rate of 182 KZT/$
at the start of 2015 to an average rate of 346 KZT/$ during the first half of 2016. The lower tenge
reduces the Group's operating cost in US dollar terms but also increases the risk of higher
inflation rates in the future.
Exposure to China
In addition to the impact of Chinese demand on the pricing of KAZ Minerals' major products, as
noted under the 'Commodity prices' risk above, the Group makes significant physical sales to a
limited number of customers in China. Sales to China will increase further with the ramp up in
output of copper concentrate from Bozshakol in 2016 and from Aktogay from 2017. In addition,
the Group uses contractors, services and materials from China. China is also an important source
of financing to the Group with long-term debt facilities secured of $3.3 billion at 30 June 2016,
primarily for the development of Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Acquisitions and divestments
In the course of delivering its strategy, the Group may acquire or dispose of assets or businesses.
Corporate transactions may, however, fail to achieve the expected benefit or value to the Group.
All business combinations or acquisitions entail a number of risks including, the cost of
effectively integrating acquisitions to realise synergies, significant write-offs or restructuring
charges, unanticipated costs and liabilities and loss of key personnel. The Restructuring was
effected under the laws and regulations of Kazakhstan which are subject to change and open to
interpretation, including the legal and tax aspects of the Restructuring in 2014, which could give
rise to liabilities for KAZ Minerals.
Liquidity risk
The Group's cash flows are subject to various risks, including commodity prices and operational
risks as set out above. Over the next 12 months a sustained fall in commodity prices below
current levels combined with delays in the ramp up of the major growth projects would require
mitigating actions to increase liquidity which could include obtaining additional external financing
and the postponement of certain capital expenditure, both of which the Board believe could be
achieved.
At 30 June 2016 the Group had net debt of $2,531 million, available cash of $1,056 million and
undrawn uncommitted facilities of $10 million. The debt financing of the Bozshakol and Aktogay
projects and lower commodity prices has resulted in an elevated net debt level, which is
expected to increase further in the second half of 2016.
The Group's PXF facility is subject to financial covenants. It is forecast the facilities' net debt to
EBITDA covenant will be breached when tested for the period ended 31 December 2016. Based
on discussions with members of the banking group to date, the Board believes that it will reach
agreement on amending its facilities such that no covenant breach occurs for the period ended
31 December 2016.
Taxation
As the tax legislation in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan has been in force for a relatively short period
of time, the tax risks in these countries are substantially greater than typically found in countries
with more established tax systems. The reduction in commodity prices has adversely impacted
government finances in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Kazakhstan government is in the
process of conducting a review of the existing tax code and tax administration. Tax regimes may
therefore be subject to change and are also subject to different and changing interpretations, as
well as inconsistent enforcement. The timing and mechanism by which tax payments are made to
and balances are recovered from the tax authorities may be subject to change. Tax regulation
and compliance is subject to review and investigation by the authorities who may impose severe
fines, penalties and interest charges.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE
17 August 2016
INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO KAZ MINERALS PLC
Introduction
We have been engaged by KAZ Minerals PLC (the 'Company') to review the condensed set of
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016
which comprises consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of cash flows,
consolidated statement of changes in equity and notes 1 to 15. We have read the other
information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of
financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to
assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (the
'DTR') of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (the 'UK FCA'). Our review has been undertaken
so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the
conclusions we have reached.
Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the
DTR of the UK FCA.
As disclosed in note 3, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as adopted by the European Union
('EU') and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). The condensed
set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 ('IAS 34'), Interim Financial Reporting as
adopted by the EU.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial
statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the UK. A review of interim
financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial
and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended
30 June 2016 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by
the EU and the DTR of the UK FCA.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Six months ended 30 June 2016
1.    Corporate information
KAZ Minerals PLC (the 'Company') is a public limited company incorporated in England and
Wales. The Company's registered office is 6th Floor, Cardinal Place, 100 Victoria Street, London
SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom. The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated divisions
as set out below.
The Group operates in the natural resources industry through four divisions, the principal
activities of which during the first half of 2016 were:

These condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016
were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board on 17 August 2016. The
information for the year ended 31 December 2015 does not constitute statutory accounts as
defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year,
which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs')
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and interpretations issued by
the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') of the IASB, as adopted
by the European Union up to 31 December 2015, has been delivered to the Registrar of
Companies. The auditor's opinion in relation to those accounts was unqualified, did not draw
attention to any matters by way of emphasis and also did not contain a statement under Section
498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.
2.    Basis of preparation
(a)   Condensed consolidated financial statements
The condensed consolidated financial statements for the six month period ended 30 June 2016
have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard ('IAS') 34 'Interim
Financial Reporting' and the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the
Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom as applicable to interim financial reporting.
These condensed consolidated financial statements represent a 'condensed set of financial
statements' as referred to in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial
Conduct Authority. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required
for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report
and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015.
(b)   Comparative figures
Where a change in the presentational format of these condensed consolidated financial
statements has been made during the period, comparative figures have been restated
accordingly. Figures may have been restated to conform with the current basis of understanding.
(c)   Significant accounting judgements and key sources of
estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group's accounting policies, the Directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgements are based on the Directors' best
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual
results may differ from the amounts included in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and
underlying assumptions applied are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current
and future periods.
In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, significant judgements made by
the Directors in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation
uncertainty used were consistent, in all material respects, as those applied to the Group's
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Consistent with the 2015 year end, the Directors reviewed the carrying value of the Group's cash
generating units ('CGU's') to determine whether an indicator of impairment existed at 30 June
2016. A reduction in the short and medium term consensus market estimate of copper prices was
identified as an impairment indicator at the Bozymchak CGU due to its shorter life of mine
compared to the Group's other operations and an impairment assessment was undertaken. This
assessment required an estimation of the projected cash flows using forecast commodity prices,
production profile and operating costs and sustaining capital requirements, among other factors.
The projected cash flows were discounted using an appropriate rate to determine the CGU's
recoverable amount and was compared to its carrying value. After considering the improved
operational performance of Bozymchak in the first half of 2016, its lower cash operating costs and
the impact of the lower short and medium term copper prices, no impairment was considered
necessary.
(d)   Going concern
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to impact its future growth and
operating performance, are set out in the Operating Review. The financial performance and
position of the Group, its cash flows and available debt facilities are described in the Financial
Review.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities and
working capital funds. The Board monitors the net debt level of the Group taking into
consideration the expected outlook of the Group's financial position, cash flows and future capital
commitments.
At 30 June 2016, the Group's net debt was $2,531 million with total debt of $3,587 million and
gross liquid funds of $1,056 million and total undrawn committed facilities of $10 million.
At 30 June 2016, the gross debt of $3,587 million consisted of:
·       $1,791 million of the CDB-Bozshakol and Bozymchak facilities which amortises over the
period to 2025;
·       $1,467 million of the $1.5 billion loan facility with CDB, which amortises over the period to
2029;
·       $289 million for the amended PXF facility, whose principal repayments amortise over a
three-year period until final maturity in December 2018; and
·       $40 million under the revolving credit facility provided by Caterpillar Financial Services (UK)
Limited ('CAT').
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In
making the assessment that the Group is a going concern the Board has considered the Group's
cash flow forecasts for the period to 30 September 2017, the outlook for commodity prices and
the current status of production ramp up at Bozshakol and construction at Aktogay.
At current market commodity prices and on the basis that the debt facilities are maintained with
an unchanged repayment profile, the Board considers the Group has adequate liquidity over the
going concern period. However, in the event of a reasonably possible delay in the expected ramp
up at Bozshakol the Group would likely be required to take certain mitigating actions, including
raising additional liquidity, as described below.
The Group's PXF facility and CAT facility are subject to financial covenants, in particular the net
debt to EBITDA covenant which is next due to be tested as at 31 December 2016. It is expected
this covenant will be breached when tested at that time. At current copper prices it is expected
this ratio will improve as Bozshakol and Aktogay operations ramp up. Following an improvement
in the ramp up of Bozshakol in July and August 2016, the Group intends to make a formal
approach to the banks during the third quarter of 2016 with a view to agreeing a refinancing with
suitable amendments to the financial covenants that will allow the facilities to continue without
triggering a technical default. Based on discussions with its lenders during 2016, the Board is
confident that the banks will view favourably amendments to the financial covenants and a
refinancing of the facilities provided the Group's debt service obligations continue to be
maintained, which forecasts indicate is likely to be the case. This conclusion is supported by the
short term nature of the breach as well as the quality of the Group's assets, in particular the
Bozshakol and Aktogay mines which have long operational lives and provide large scale output
at first quartile cash costs. The Board's analysis therefore assumes that the debt facilities
continue throughout the going concern assessment period.
However, if a waiver or temporary suspension of the net debt to EBITDA covenant is not
accompanied with a refinancing, in the event of a sustained fall in commodity prices below
current levels, other mitigating actions would be required to secure liquidity over the going
concern period, which could include obtaining new facilities to provide additional financing
and/or the postponement of certain capital expenditure, both of which the Board believes could
be achieved. Accordingly, the Board is satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
3.    Summary of significant accounting
policies
(a)   Basis of accounting
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis,
except for derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. The
condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars ('$') and all financial
information has been rounded to the nearest million dollars ('$ million') except where otherwise
indicated.
None of the amendments to standards and interpretations applicable during the period have had
an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted
any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
All accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial
statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements the Group has adopted all the
applicable extant accounting standards issued by the IASB and all the applicable extant
interpretations issued by the IFRIC as at 30 June 2016, as adopted by the European Union up to
30 June 2016.
(b)   Exchange rates
The following foreign exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the preparation of
the condensed consolidated financial statements:
Kazakhstan tenge 338.87346.11 339.47 221.73
Kyrgyzstan som 67.49 71.29

Spot AverageSpot
Average Spot Average
186.20185.25
62.08 60.63
0.66
0.64
(c)   Free float of the tenge
On 20 August 2015, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced that the tenge would trade
freely. Following this announcement, the tenge devalued and ended 2015 at 339.47 to the US
dollar. In the six months to 30 June 2016, the tenge averaged 346.11 per US dollar compared to
185.25 for the six months to 30 June 2015. The currency's free float has resulted in increased
exposure to exchange gains and losses arising mostly on US dollar denominated monetary
assets and liabilities held by the Group's Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan based subsidiaries whose
functional currencies are the tenge and som respectively.
4.    Segment information
Information provided to the Group's Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and
the assessment of segmental performance is prepared in accordance with the management and
operational structure of the Group. For management and operational purposes, the Group is
organised into four separate businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their
operations, end-products and services rendered. Each of these business units represents an
operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating segments'.
The Group's operating segments are:
East Region
The East Region is managed as one operating segment and includes the entity Vostoktsvetmet
LLC ('VCM'), based in Kazakhstan and the associated international sales and marketing
activities managed out of the UK. VCM's principal activity is the mining and processing of copper
and other metals which are produced as by-products.
Bozymchak
The Bozymchak gold-copper mine and concentrator located in Kyrgyzstan and the associated
international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK. The Bozymchak operation
achieved commercial production on 1 July 2015 with its revenues and costs being recorded in
the income statement from that date.
Bozshakol
The Bozshakol open pit and concentrator located in the Ekibastuz region of Kazakhstan and the
associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK. This operation,
which sells copper concentrate with gold content as a by-product, was commissioned in
February 2016 and is now managed separately from the Mining Projects. The operation is
expected to achieve commercial levels of production in the second half of 2016. Until then,
revenues and production costs will be recognised against property, plant and equipment. For the
period ended 30 June 2015, Bozshakol was included in the Mining Projects segment.
Mining Projects
The Group's project companies, whose responsibility is the development of the Group's major
growth projects includes Aktogay and Koksay. Once the respective concentrators are
commissioned, the projects will be separated into individual operating segments.
The Aktogay project oxide plant achieved commercial production from 1 July 2016 having
achieved consistent production of at least 60% above its design capacity for a period of more
than 90 days. Revenues and production costs were recognised in the income statement with the
commencement of depreciation of its assets from that date. Given the relative size and
contribution of the Aktogay oxide operations, it will continue to be reflected within Mining Projects
until the main sulphide plant is commissioned.
The Mining Projects segment for the period ended 30 June 2015 also included Bozshakol prior
to its commissioning in the first half 30 June 2016.
Managing and measuring operating segments
The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA (excluding special items),
which is defined as profit before interest, taxation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, the non-
cash component of the disability benefits obligation, mineral extraction tax and royalties, as
adjusted for special items. Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in
nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business (see note 6).
The Group's Treasury department monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level
on a net basis rather than on a gross basis at an operating segment level.
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by product and by destination in
note 4(b).

1    During the pre-commercial production stage of the mining projects, revenues and operating
costs are capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
2   MET and royalties have been excluded from the key financial indicator of EBITDA. The
Directors believe that MET and royalties are a substitute for a tax on profits, hence their exclusion
provides a more informed measure of the operational performance of the Group. The MET
incurred at Bozshakol and Aktogay (oxide) during the pre-commercial production stage of $9
million and $9 million respectively has been capitalised to property, plant and equipment. MET
incurred on stockpiled clay ore at Bozshakol and reflected as other non-current assets was $15
million.
3     Depreciation, depletion and amortisation and mineral extraction tax and royalties excludes
the costs associated with inventories on the balance sheet.
4   The non-cash component of the Group's disability benefits obligation was excluded from
EBITDA, a key financial indicator, as EBITDA is a proxy for cash earnings from current trading
performance. The non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation is determined as the
actuarial remeasurement charge recognised in the income statement less the actual cash
payments disbursed during the period in respect of the disability benefits obligation.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding
during the period. Purchases of the Company's shares by the Employee Benefit Trust and by the
Company under any share buy-back programmes are both held in treasury and treated as own
shares.
(b)   EPS based on Underlying Profit
The Group's Underlying Profit is the net profit for the six months excluding special items and their
resultant tax and non-controlling interest effects, as shown in the table above. EPS based on
Underlying Profit is calculated by dividing Underlying Profit attributable to equity holders of the
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding
during the period. The Directors believe EPS based on Underlying Profit provides a more
consistent measure for comparing the underlying trading performance of the Group.
10.  Share capital and reserves
(a)   Allotted share capital
At 30 June 2015, 31 December 2015 and 30 June 2016 allotted and called up share capital
(ordinary shares of 20 pence each) amounted to 458,379,033 or $171 million (£92 million).
(b)   Own shares purchased under the Group's share-based payment plans
The provision of shares to the Group's share-based payment plans is facilitated by an Employee
Benefit Trust ('EBT'). The cost of shares purchased by the EBT is charged against retained
earnings. The EBT has waived the right to receive dividends on these shares. In the six months
ended 30 June 2016, 160,807 shares (30 June 2015: 172,983) were transferred out of the EBT in
settlement of share awards granted to employees that were exercised during the period.
At 30 June 2016, the Group, through the EBT, owned 50,598 KAZ Minerals PLC shares (30 June
2015: 369,252, 31 December 2015: 211,405) with a market value of $0.1 million (30 June 2015:
$1.1 million, 31 December 2015: $0.3 million) and a cost of $1.0 million (30 June 2015: $7.0
million, 31 December 2015: $4.0 million).

CDB-Bozshakol and Bozymchak facilities
On 29 December 2014, the Group signed an amendment to the $2.7 billion China Development
Bank (CDB)/Samruk-Kazyna finance facilities, which resulted in the facilities becoming bilateral
with the CDB and a lowering of the interest rate from US$ LIBOR plus 4.80% to US$ LIBOR plus
4.50%. An arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and
40% was paid in January 2016. The amount outstanding on the previous facility at the time of the
amendment was $2.1 billion. The restructuring of the facilities with Samruk-Kazyna and the CDB
completed in March 2015. All other material terms of the facilities were unchanged.
As at 30 June 2016, $1.8 billion (31 December 2015: $1.9 billion; 30 June 2015: $2.0 billion) was
drawn under the facility agreements. Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as at 30 June
2016 of $22 million (31 December 2015: $24 million; 30 June 2015: $27 million), have been
netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
CDB-Aktogay finance facility
The CDB-Aktogay finance facility consists of a CNY 1.0 billion facility and a $1.3 billion US
dollar facility. The funds mature 15 years from the date of the first draw down. KAZ Minerals PLC
acts as guarantor of the loans.
The CNY 1.0 billion facility was fully drawn at 30 June 2015. At 30 June 2016, the drawn down
US dollar equivalent amounts were $143 million (31 December 2015: $153 million; 30 June
2015: $160 million). The facility accrues interest at the applicable benchmark lending rate
published by the People's Bank of China. During 2016, the Group made the first principal
payment of $6 million. In order to protect the Group from currency risks arising on the CNY
denominated debt, the Group has entered into CNY/US$ cross currency swaps. This derivative
instrument provides a hedge against any movement in the CNY exchange rate against the US
dollar and also swaps the interest basis from a CNY interest rate into a US$ LIBOR interest
basis. The fair value of the swap at 30 June 2016, included within payables, is $10 million (31
December 2015: $10 million; 30 June 2015: $2 million).
The US dollar facility accrues interest at US$ LIBOR plus 4.20%. At 30 June 2016, the $1.3
billion facility was fully drawn (31 December 2015: $1.1 billion; 30 June 2015: $579 million).
Arrangement fees with an amortised cost of $16 million (31 December 2015: $15 million; 30 June
2015: $11 million), have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
Pre-export finance facility ('PXF')
The $349 million facility is repayable in equal monthly instalments over a three year period
commencing from January 2016 until final maturity on 31 December 2018. The margin payable
on the facility is variable, ranging from 3.00% to 4.50% above US$ LIBOR, dependent on the
ratio of net debt to EBITDA which will be tested semi-annually. KAZ Minerals PLC,
Vostoktsvetmet LLC and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited act as guarantors of the loan. The facility's
net debt to EBITDA ratio covenant becomes effective from 1 July 2016.
At 30 June 2016, $289 million (31 December 2015: $345 million; 30 June 2015: $345 million)
was drawn under the facility. Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as at 30 June 2016 of $2
million (31 December 2015: $4 million; 30 June 2015: $4 million), have been netted off against
these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
Revolving credit facility
On 14 August 2015, the Group entered into a $50 million revolving credit facility provided by
Caterpillar Financial Services (UK) Limited, a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. The CAT Facility is
available for three years from the date of signing, following which the facility is repayable in four
equal quarterly instalments. An interest rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.25% is payable on amounts
outstanding under the CAT Facility. The financial covenants on the CAT Facility are identical to
those applicable to the Group's existing PXF. At 30 June 2016, $40 million (31 December 2015:
$50 million) was drawn with the $10 million available to be drawn.
12.  Other non-current liabilities
Other non-current liabilities include future licence payments for mining assets of $9 million (31
December 2015: $10 million; 30 June 2015: $12 million) reflected at amortised cost and the
discounted cost of works and services of $179 million incurred to 30 June 2016 on the
construction of the Aktogay concentrator under the amended agreement signed with NFC to
extend the payment terms of $300 million to 2018. In terms of the agreement $250 million falls
due on 31 December 2017 and $50 million falls due on 30 June 2018. The extended credit terms
have been discounted, where considered material, using a rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.20% on the
estimated cost of services performed. The unwinding of the interest will be charged to property,
plant and equipment as a borrowing cost until the date that the project has reached commercial
production, after which any interest will be charged to the income statement within finance costs.
To 30 June 2016, $2 million of interest was charged to property, plant and equipment.
