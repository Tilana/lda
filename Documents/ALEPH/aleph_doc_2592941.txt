Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of
Canadian securities legislation and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S.
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, “forward-looking statements”).  Any
statements that express or involve discussions with respect to business prospects, predictions,
expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  intentions,  projections,  objectives,  strategies,  assumptions,  future
events, performance or exploration and development efforts using words or phrases (including
negative and grammatical variations) such as, but not limited to, “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,”
“estimates,”  “intends,”  “forecasts,”  “likely,”  “projects,”  “believes,”  “seeks,”  or  stating  that  certain
actions, events or results “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be
achieved are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.  Although
we  believe  that  our  plans,  intentions  and  expectations  reflected  in  these  forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot be certain that these plans, intentions or expectations will
be  achieved.    Actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  could  differ  materially  from  those
contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report.    Forward-looking  statements  in  this  Quarterly  Report  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,
statements regarding the following:
·
the insufficiency of our existing cash resources and working capital to enable us to continue our
operations for the next 12 months as a going concern;
·
the potential liquidation or sale of part or all of the Company’s assets and the possible loss by
investors of part or all of their investment;
·
anticipated losses or gains in the operation of our business going forward;
·
the  narrowed  focus  or  suspension  of  the  Company’s  near-term  operational  and  permitting
activities;

the pursuit of potential financing and strategic alternatives;
·
expectations  regarding  the  ability  to  raise  capital  or  secure  strategic  partners  and  to  continue

·
future expenditures to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations.
Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and  other  factors  that  could  cause  actual  events  or  results  to  differ  materially  from  our
expectations and include, among others, the factors referenced in the “Risk Factors” section of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015, including, without
limitation, risks associated with:
·
our ability to obtain additional financial resources on acceptable terms to (i) continue operating
the  Company,  (ii)  maintain  our  assets,  (iii)  conduct  our  Project  activities  and  (iv)  maintain  our
general and administrative expenditures at sustainable levels;
·
depressed and volatile rare earth markets, including fluctuations in demand for, and prices of,
rare earth products;
·

·
our history of losses and numerous uncertainties that could affect the profitability or feasibility of
the Bear Lodge REE Project;
·
the  potential  outcome  of  a  future  feasibility  study  that  may  indicate  Bear  Lodge  REE  Project
economics are less favorable;
·
our ability to resume our currently suspended federal and state permitting efforts in a timely and
cost effective manner;
·
the exploration, development and operation of our Bear Lodge REE Project;
1

establishing adequate distribution channels to place our future suite of products;
·
competition in the mining and rare earth industries, including an increase in global supplies or
predatory pricing and dumping by our competitors;
·
technological  advancements,  substitutes,  and  the  establishment  of  new  uses  and  markets  for
rare earth products;
·
the specific product(s) from the Bear Lodge REE Project potentially having a limited number of
potential customers, which could limit our bargaining power, product pricing, and profitability;
·
our  proprietary,  patent-pending,  processing  technology  encountering  unforeseen  problems,
unexpected costs or both in scaling up to commercial application;
·
mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation;
·
the permitting, licensing and regulatory approval processes for our planned operations;
·
continued  compliance  with  current  environmental  regulations  and  the  possibility  of  new
legislation,  environmental  regulations  or  permit  requirements  adverse  to  the  Project  including
measures regarding the mining industry and climate change;
·
our  dependence  on  and  the  potential  difficulty  of  attracting  and  retaining  key  personnel,
consultants and qualified management;
·
a shortage of equipment and supplies;
·
mining and resource exploration and development being a potentially hazardous activity;
·
operating in the resource industry, which can be highly speculative and subject to market forces
outside of our control;
·
title to our properties or mining claims;
·
insurance  for  our  operations  that  could  become  unavailable,  unaffordable  or  commercially
unreasonable or exclude from coverage certain exposures of our business;
·
negative impacts to our business or operations from market factors;
·
our land reclamation and remediation requirements;
·
information technology system disruptions, damage or failures;
·
effects of proposed legislation on the mining industry and our business;
·

·
our common shares continuing not to pay cash dividends;
·
our securities, including in relation to both company performance and general security market
conditions;
·

due to our listing on the OTCQB marketplace;
·
tax  consequences  to  U.S.  shareholders  related  to  our  potential  status  as  a  “passive  foreign
investment company”; and
·
other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
This list is not exhaustive of the factors that might affect our forward-looking statements. Although
we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results
not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary, possibly
materially,  from  those  anticipated,  believed,  estimated  or  expected.  We  caution  readers  not  to
place
2
undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.
Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the
occurrence  of  anticipated  or  unanticipated  events. We  qualify  all  of  the  forward-looking
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by the foregoing cautionary
statements. We advise you to carefully review the reports and documents we file from time to
time  with  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  “SEC”),  particularly  our  Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K.  The  reports  and  documents  filed  by  us  with  the  SEC  are  available  at

1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Rare  Element  Resources  Ltd.  (collectively,  “we,”  “us,”  “Rare  Element”  or  the  “Company”)  was
incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, on June 3, 1999.
Rare Element has historically been focused on advancing the Bear Lodge Rare Earth Element
(“REE”) Project located near the town of Sundance in northeast Wyoming.  The Bear Lodge REE
Project consists of several large disseminated REE deposits and a proposed hydrometallurgical
plant to be located near Upton, Wyoming.  The Company previously announced extensive cost
cutting measures and the placement of the Project on care-and-maintenance to position us to be
able  to  move  the  Project  forward  when  market  conditions  improve,  while  allowing  us  in  the
interim to pursue potential financings and strategic alternatives such as off-take agreements, joint
ventures and the potential sale of various assets and/or the Bear Lodge REE Project.
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  assumes  the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business  for  the  foreseeable  future.    The  Company  has  incurred  losses  since  inception  and
further losses are anticipated in the development of its business, raising substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon the Company obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and
pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Management
intends  to  finance  operating  costs  with  existing  cash  on  hand,  asset  sales  and  potential
issuances  of  common  stock.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  raise  the
necessary financing or complete a strategic transaction on acceptable terms or at all.  If we are
unable to continue as a going concern or in order to preserve shareholder value, we may have to
liquidate our assets. If the Company decides to sell part or all of its assets, the sale proceeds may
be less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements.
 As a result, investors may lose part or all of their investment.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
In  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  for  interim  financial  statements,  these  consolidated  financial
statements do not include certain information and note disclosures that are normally included in
annual  financial  statements  prepared  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP.    Accordingly,  these
unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  audited
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015, which were included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management,
the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (which
are of a normal, recurring nature) necessary to present fairly in all material respects our financial
position as of June 30, 2016, and the results of our operations and cash flows for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  Interim results of operations for
the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  may  not  be  indicative  of  results  that  will  be
realized for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In  August  2014,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management’s responsibility to
evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going
concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  Although
we  have  not  yet  adopted  ASU  2014-15,  we  plan  to  do  so  timely  and  will  then  determine  if
additional disclosures are required. We do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on
our financial statements.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Warrants
Each  outstanding  warrant  is  exercisable  for  one  of  the  Company’s  common  shares  and  was
issued to investors in connection with registered direct offerings of the Company that closed on
September  27,  2013  and  April  29,  2015.  In  addition,  the  Company  issued  warrants  to  a
placement  agent  in  connection  with  each  offering,  under  the  same  terms  as  those  issued  to
investors. The exercise price and exercise period are outlined below:

The  value  of  the  warrants  issued  to  the  placement  agent  (non-employee)  for  its  services  in
connection with the April 29, 2015 offering was offset against the proceeds of the financing.  The
Company used a Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs including a market price of the
Company’s stock of $0.72, an exercise price of $0.85, a three-year term, volatility of 81.0%, a risk-
free rate of 0.91% and no assumed dividends.  The value of the warrants issued to the placement
agent for its services in connection with the April 29, 2015 offering was estimated at $91.
5.
ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL
Stock-based compensation
We have options outstanding and exercisable that were issued under two plans, the Fixed Stock
Option Plan (“FSOP”) and the 10% Rolling Stock Option Plan (“RSOP”).
The FSOP was originally approved by shareholders on December 11, 2002, and subsequently
approved  by  shareholders  on  December  7,  2009  following  certain  amendments  to  the  FSOP.
The  FSOP  expired  upon  the  adoption  of  the  RSOP  that  was  approved  by  shareholders  on
December 2, 2011, and as such, we may no longer grant options under the FSOP. However, the
terms of the FSOP continue to govern all prior awards granted under such plan until such awards
have been cancelled, forfeited or exercised in accordance with the terms thereof.  As of June 30,
2016, we had 160,000 options outstanding under our FSOP, as amended, and 3,127,400 options
outstanding under our RSOP.
The fair value of each employee stock option award is estimated at the grant date using a Black-
Scholes  option  pricing  model  and  the  price  of  our  common  shares  on  the  date  of  grant.  The
Company did not issue any stock option awards during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The
significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options awarded during the six
months ended June 30, 2015, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

rate
interest
Expected volatility
Expected  dividend

The  compensation  expense  recognized  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 for stock option awards was $23 and $48, respectively,
and $56 and $130 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As of June
30, 2016, there was $17 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 264,200 unvested
stock  options  that  is  expected  to  be  recognized  over  a  weighted-average  remaining  vesting
period of 0.4 years.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Our commitments and contingencies include the following item:
Potential environmental contingency
Our  mining  and  exploration  activities  are  subject  to  various  federal  and  state  laws  and
regulations  governing  the  protection  of  the  environment.    These  laws  and  regulations  are
continually changing and generally becoming more restrictive over time.  The Company conducts
its operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are
materially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  We have made, and expect to
make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.  The ultimate amount
of reclamation and other future site-restoration costs to be incurred for existing mining interests is
uncertain.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following management’s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial results and
condition of Rare Element Resources Ltd. (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Rare Element” or the
“Company”) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, has been prepared based on
information available to us as of August 2, 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction
with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included herewith and
the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Rare Element for the period ended December
31, 2015, and the related notes thereto filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion and analysis contains forward-
looking  statements  that  involve  risks,  uncertainties  and  assumptions.    Our  actual  results  may
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many
factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth elsewhere in this report. See “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
All currency amounts are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Introduction
Although the Company is currently in care-and-maintenance pending further financing, we have
historically been focused on advancing to production the Bear Lodge REE Project in Wyoming.
Outlook
We have limited cash resources on hand and have reduced staff to one executive employee and
implemented measures to conserve our remaining cash.  The Company has narrowed the focus
of its activities to only the very highest priority items that we believe have the greatest potential to
preserve the value of the Project and shareholder value, including seeking capital and actively
pursuing  potential  strategic  alternatives,  including  off-take  agreements,  joint  ventures,  and  the
potential sale of various assets and/or the Project. The Company will additionally continue with
certain limited reclamation activities in 2016 as required and appropriate.
Results of Operations
Summary
Our  consolidated  net  loss  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016  was  $434,  or  $0.01  per
share, compared with our consolidated net loss of $2,097, or $0.04 per share, for the same period
in 2015. Our consolidated net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2,270, or $0.04
per share, compared with our consolidated net loss of $4,572, or $0.09 per share, for the same
period in 2015.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the decrease in consolidated net loss of $1,663 from
the prior period was primarily the result of a decrease in exploration and evaluation expenses of
$1,164 and corporate administration expenses of $556.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the decrease in consolidated net loss of $2,302 from
the prior period was primarily the result of a decrease in exploration and evaluation expenses of
$2,155,  an  increase  in  corporate  administration  expenses  of  $181  and  a  positive  variance  of
$286 related to currency translation
Exploration and evaluation
Exploration and evaluation costs were $35 and $162 for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016, respectively, as compared with $1,199 and $2,317 for the three and six months ended
June  30,  2015,  respectively.  The  decrease  from  the  prior  period  was  the  result  of  decreased
activities on the Bear Lodge REE Project as we suspended the majority of permitting activities
while continuing the work necessary to maintain our permits.
Corporate administration
Corporate administration costs were $363 and $2,110 for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016, as compared with $919 and $1,929 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  corporate  administration  includes  one-time
severance expenses incurred in placing the Project on care-and-maintenance and severing all
but  one  of  our  full-time  employees.  Absent  this  non-recurring  cost  of  approximately  $950,
corporate administration
10
costs would have been lower by approximately $769 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Corporate and administrative costs in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 related to a
voluntary delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and listing on the OTCQB, outside legal
expenses  relating  to  our  regulatory  and  proprietary  patent-pending  filings,  and  completing  the
remaining office lease obligations at our Lakewood, Colorado location.
Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $2,941 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared  with  $4,819  for  the  same  period  in  2015.  The  decrease  of  $1,878  in  cash  used  is
primarily  the  result  of  decreased  spending  on  exploration  and  evaluation  activities  of
approximately $2,155, partially offset by timing in vendor payments affecting accounts payable
which increased use of cash by $253 and increased corporate administration expenses of $246
(excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expenses).
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $89 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared with net cash used of nil for the same period in 2015. The cash received in the 2016
period was related to the sale of small equipment and office furniture.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was nil and $3,076 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  The cash received in 2015 was the result of the Company’s April
29, 2015 registered direct offering.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At June 30, 2016, our total current assets were $1,091, as compared with $4,053 as of December
31, 2015, which is a decrease of $2,962. The decrease in total current assets is primarily due to a
decrease in the combination of cash and cash equivalents of $2,852 as well as reduced prepaid
expenses of $102.
Our working capital as at June 30, 2016 was $883, as compared with $2,992 at December 31,
2015.
We have placed the Bear Lodge REE Project under care-and-maintenance, and all permitting
activities have been suspended.  Additionally, corporate cost containment measures have been
implemented  to  preserve  remaining  cash  balances  as  we  pursue  additional  financing  and/or
strategic alternatives, including the sale of various assets and/or the Project.
We  do  not  have  sufficient  funds  to  complete  feasibility  studies,  permitting,  development  and
construction of the Bear Lodge REE Project.  Therefore, our continuation as a going concern is
dependent upon our completion of a future financing, off-take agreement, joint venture, sale of
various assets and/or the Bear Lodge REE Project or other strategic transaction.  However, there
is no assurance that we will be successful in completing such a financing or strategic transaction.
 As a result, there is substantial doubt as to whether our existing cash resources and working
capital are sufficient to enable us to continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going
concern.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a
going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.  We do not have sufficient cash to fund planned operations and meet
obligations for the next 12 months without raising additional funds.
If we are unable to continue as a going concern or in order to preserve shareholder value, we
may have to liquidate our assets, the proceeds from which may be less than the value at which
those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements.  As a result, investors may
lose part or all of their investment.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations
There were no material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in Item 7 of Part II in our
Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.
ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.  Our market risk is comprised of various types
of risk: interest rate risk, commodity price risk and other price risk.
Interest rate risk. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in bank accounts and, at
times, guaranteed investment certificates that earn interest at variable interest rates.  Due to the
short-term  nature  of  these  financial  instruments,  fluctuations  in  market  rates  did  not  have  a
significant impact on estimated fair values as of June 30, 2016.  Future cash flows from interest
income on cash and cash equivalents will be affected by interest rate fluctuations.  We manage
interest rate risk by maintaining an investment policy that focuses primarily on preservation of
capital and liquidity.
Commodity price risk. We are indirectly exposed to commodity price risk of rare earth products,
which are, in turn, influenced by the price of and demand for the end products produced with rare
earth  mineral  resources.  A  significant  decrease  in  the  global  demand  for  these  products  may
have a material adverse effect on our business. None of our mineral properties are in production,
and we do not currently hold any commodity derivative positions.
Other price risk. Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial
instrument  will  fluctuate  because  of  changes  in  market  prices,  other  than  those  arising  from
interest rate risk, or commodity price risk.
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was
carried  out  under  the  supervision  of,  and  with  the  participation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer
(“CEO”) and Principal Financial Officer (“PFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operations
of  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as  defined  in  Rule  13a-15(e)  under  the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, the CEO
and the PFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that (i) information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  CEO  and  PFO,  as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Controls
During the second quarter of 2016, in response to the reduction in staff, we modified our internal
control over financial reporting in order to maintain the integrity of those controls impacted by the
reduction of staff. Management believes that the controls have been successfully implemented
and are functioning as required to provide timely and accurate financial reporting.  There has
been no other change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation or of any proceedings known to
be  contemplated  by  governmental  authorities  that  are,  or  would  be,  likely  to  have  a  material
adverse effect upon us or our operations, taken as a whole.
ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
There were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.
ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
None.
ITEM 3.  DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
None.
ITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
We consider health, safety and environmental stewardship to be a core value for Rare Element.
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(the “Dodd-Frank Act”), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of
a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed
with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations,
related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities under the regulation of the
Federal  Mine  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (“MSHA”)  under  the  Federal  Mine  Safety  and
Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Bear Lodge REE
Project was not yet in production and as such, was not subject to regulation by MSHA under the
Mine Act.
