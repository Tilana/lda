not been an expert from the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) since the 
resignation, in 2006, of the former member of the group Mr. Martti Oiva Kalevi Ahtisaari, 
former President of Finland. They emphasized that he should be replaced urgently. To this 
end, the experts invited the United Nations Secretary-General to nominate the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to arrange for the replacement of the 
resigned WEOG&#8217;s representative, as a matter of priority. Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim regretted 
the inability of the experts to meet since 2005, urged a renewal of membership and 
emphasized the need for more targeted and time-linked meeting schedule. He also alluded 
to his withdrawal from the group to allow for the appointment of someone able to devote 
the time required for the work. </footnote>4-05585

<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since the last meeting of the independent eminent experts in 2005, the follow-up and 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action has evolved. In 2009, 
the Durban Review Conference was held in Geneva, and in 2011 the General Assembly 
held a high-level meeting to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>2. Throughout the years, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council adopted 
several resolutions that include references to the work of the independent eminent experts. 
In its latest resolution 68/151, entitled &#8220;Global efforts for the total elimination of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the comprehensive 
implementation of and follow-up to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action&#8221;,1 
the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, in the context of the resolution, to 
revitalize and reactivate the operational activities of the group of independent eminent 
experts. It also invited the Human Rights Council to ensure the visibility, effective 
participation and optimal utilization of the vast knowledge and experience of the group of 
independent eminent experts within its subsidiary structures charged with the mandate and 
responsibility for the comprehensive follow-up to the World Conference against Racism, 
Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance and the effective 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>3. Furthermore, during its twenty-fourth session, from 9 to 27 September 2013, the 
Human Rights Council adopted resolution 24/26, entitled &#8220;From rhetoric to reality: a global 
call for concrete action against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance&#8221;. Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the resolution refer to the work of the independent 
eminent experts. In particular, paragraph 10 requests the independent eminent experts to 
convene a special meeting to conduct an appraisal of the work undertaken hitherto and the 
recommendations made in that regard in order to present an update report to this end to the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Secretary-General and the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>4. In view of the aforementioned resolutions, at their third meeting, held privately on 4 
February 2014 in Geneva, the experts discussed their previous work and related challenges, 
mandate and working methods, including suggestions for follow-up actions. Her 
Excellency Hanna Suchocka and Dr. Edna Maria Santos Roland travelled to Geneva for the 
meeting; His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan and Dr. Salim Ahmed 
Salim were connected through teleconference. However, due to technical problems from 
the office of His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, the participation of 
His Royal Highness was partly interrupted. The meeting was opened by Mr. Bacre Ndiaye, 
Director Human Rights Council and Special Procedures Division, and Officer-in-Charge, 
Research and Right to Development Division.  
</p>
<p><b>II. Discussion on the mandate and the working methods 
</b></p>
<p>5. The independent eminent experts pointed out that the group is one of the component 
mechanisms established for the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action and the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference. Its 
work should be also closely linked to the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>Council, as well as to other human rights mechanisms, in particular the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The experts noted that they are well placed to 
provide valuable advice to other stakeholders, including United Nations entities and 
mechanisms, on various issues related to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>6. It was noted that there is no sufficient clarity with regard to the role and functions of 
the experts, both individually and as a group, with regard to activities, inputs and advice to 
other mechanisms and stakeholders, considering that the mandate was included in the  
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It was pointed out that more support and 
resources are needed to assist the experts to conduct their work in a more efficient manner. 
Given the opportunity, the group could have contributed to the various reports on racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance submitted to the General 
Assembly and the Human Rights Council. The group could also have contributed to 
ongoing discussions on the decade for people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>7. The experts pointed out that their work was affected by insufficient financial 
resources and administrative support. They emphasized that a team of professionals from 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) should 
be assigned to work with the experts on various assignments, throughout the whole year. 
Such staff will assist the experts to review and verify sources of information, collect 
updated data, provide in-depth analysis, determine trends and emerging issues.  
</p>
<p>8. The experts emphasized the persistent lack of States&#8217; political will to implement the  
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, which has affected negatively the follow-up 
process, including the work of the established mechanisms. In this regard, it was suggested 
to develop a communication strategy that would feature the importance and relevance of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It was highlighted that the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action is a complex and lengthy document, taking into 
consideration various dimensions and groups of victims, which effective implementation 
requires a thorough, methodical and systematic approach. The experts said that a proper and 
efficient monitoring system for assessing the implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action has not been put in place. Such monitoring will require a lot of 
substantive and technical work that should include the tailoring of goals for the different 
regions, based on available data and knowledge on racial and ethnic disparities. They also 
emphasized that States should commit to implementing the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action and support effectively the work of the follow-up mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>9. The experts stated that the concepts of the International Decade for People of 
African Descent should be &#8220;unfolded&#8221; in a clear, easy and de-codified plan that can be 
understood by all stakeholders, including governments, human rights mechanisms, civil 
society organizations, academia etc. In this context, the Millennium Development Goals 
were given as a good example, in terms of clarity and States&#8217; obligations. 
</p>

<p>11. With regard to topics, on which the experts should focus in their future work, taking 
into consideration their knowledge of the respective regions, the experts agreed to review 
their previous report, issued in 2005,2 in order to update the list of topics. It was stated that 
the role of education is still a very important one. The experts suggested also taking into 
consideration issues related to nationalism, xenophobia, incarcerated people, trafficking in 
persons and racial equality index.  
</p>
<p>12. The experts agreed to submit information on individually undertaken activities and 
new developments in their regions that had taken place since their last report in 2005, 
which will be compiled and circulated by OHCHR. Such inputs will also include proposals 
for topics, on which the experts will agree to work, individually and as a group, over a 
certain period of time.  
</p>
<p>13. Regarding the mandate of the group, the experts emphasized that it should be 
reviewed comprehensively and amended, in light of what could be realistically achieved 
over a certain period of time, taking also into consideration available financial resources 
and secretariat support from OHCHR. The review will be undertaken without prejudice to 
the roles of the group in mobilizing political support for issues pertaining to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in their respective regions; alerting other 
stakeholders, at the highest level, of new threats and challenges; establishing and promoting 
new partnerships; working more closely with the General Assembly, Human Rights 
Council and other human rights mechanisms; and issuing joint statements with other high 
level dignitaries and experts.  
</p>
<p>14. The experts agreed to elaborate and adopt clear and concise working methods to 
facilitate their work and increase efficiency. The experts requested OHCHR to assist with 
the drafting of these working methods based on the broad outlines provided by them. The 
experts proposed a December 2014 deadline for adoption of the said working methods.  
</p>
<p>15. The experts emphasized that the aforementioned working methods should include, 
inter alia, the following issues:  
</p>
<p> (a) Appointment of experts and their prompt replacement in case of any vacancy, 
including the creation of a roster with prospective candidates; 
</p>
<p> (b) Duration of mandate and extension: appointment to be limited to three years 
with the possibility of extension for another term in line with the duration of other human 
rights mandate holders; 
</p>
<p> (c) Annual meetings: experts to meet annually for two days in Geneva during the 
session of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It is important to agree on the dates for this 
annual meeting well in advance; 
</p>
<p> (d) Formal declaration by each independent eminent expert, stating commitment 
to attend all annual meetings or resign after the second missed one;  
</p>
<p> (e) Planning of activities: annual programme of work to be adopted a year in 
advance upon conclusion of annual meeting in immediately preceding year to include 
detailed information on envisaged activities, expected outcomes, deadlines and experts 
responsible for deliverables; 
</p>

<p><b>Annex III  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations of the Independent Eminent Experts 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Report of the independent eminent experts on the implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action on  
their second meeting (E/CN.<footnote name="4">7. The experts appeal to the Commission on Human Rights and to the General 
Assembly to adopt a plan for the five-year review of the implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</footnote>/2005/125, 17 March 2005)  
</b></p>
<p><b>  VII. Recommendations of the experts 
</b></p>
<p>42. The experts urge all stakeholders to ensure follow-up to the recommendations 
made by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and of the Working Group of 
Experts on People of African Descent. 
</p>
<p>43. The experts call on all stakeholders to make further efforts in awareness-
raising and access to education, which are central to the struggle against 
discrimination, and take into account recommendations concerning education 
adopted by the two working groups. 
</p>
<p>44. Education not only constitutes an essential tool to promote mutual respect 
and tolerance between individuals and communities, but also offers an important 
opportunity for victims of discrimination to overcome their disempowerment. 
Therefore, the experts call on the Office of the High Commissioner and UNESCO to 
continue their cooperation and develop practical approaches to raising public 
awareness and using education to empower victims of racial discrimination and 
xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>45. In the context of their consultations with the Chairperson of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the role of education, the experts recommend 
the joint organization at the earliest possible date of a round table focusing on 
practical applications of education in countering racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>46. The experts recommend that the relationship between racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the new information 
technologies be given due attention at the upcoming second phase of the World 
Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 2005. 
</p>

<p>50. The experts welcome and support the Integrated Strategy to Combat Racism, 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance adopted at the thirty-second 
session of the UNESCO General Conference, which has generated the establishment 
of the International Coalition of Cities against Racism. 
</p>
<p>51. The experts urge States that have not yet done so to ratify the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination before the end 
of 2005. 
</p>
<p>52. Recalling the recommendation adopted at their last meeting, the experts 
reiterate the need for a racial equality index aimed at measuring existing racial 
inequalities. In this regard, they call on all parties concerned to cooperate towards 
the realization of this objective and encourage the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to pursue her efforts in addressing this issue.
