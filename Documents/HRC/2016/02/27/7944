<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/14, 
in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council at its twenty-
third session on the activities of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in accrediting national 
institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>2.  The report includes activities and achievements since the report issued in 2012 on 
the accreditation of national human rights institutions (A/HRC/20/10), and should be read 
together with the report of the Secretary-General on national institutions for the promotion 
and protection of human rights (A/HRC/23/27), which includes, inter alia, information on 
activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to establish and strengthen these institutions; measures taken by Governments 
regarding these institutions; as well as information on the cooperation of national human 
rights institutions with the international human rights system. 
</p>
<p>3. The Statute of the International Coordinating Committee mandates the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation to review and analyse the applications for accreditation 
submitted by national human rights institutions and to make recommendations to the 
Bureau of the International Coordinating Committee on the compliance of applicants with 
the Paris Principles. The Subcommittee comprises one representative of an &#8220;A&#8221; status 
national human rights institution from each of the four regional groupings of the 
International Coordinating Committee: Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe. The 
members of the Subcommittee are appointed by each regional grouping for a renewable 
term of three years. The members designate, by consensus, for a renewable term of one 
year, the Chairperson from among themselves. OHCHR is a permanent observer of the 
Subcommittee and serves as its secretariat.  
</p>
<p>4.  In 2012, the Subcommittee members were from Canada, France, Qatar and Togo. 
The Chairperson of the Subcommittee was the representative of the national human rights 
institution of Qatar.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Improvement of the International Coordinating Committee 
accreditation process 
</b></p>
<p>5. According to article 7 of the statute of the International Coordinating Committee, 
one of the functions of the Committee is to promote the establishment and strengthening of 
national human rights institutions in conformity with the Paris Principles. Moreover, 
according to the Strategic Plan of the International Coordinating Committee for the period 
2010&#8211;2013, its first objective is to maintain and strengthen the accreditation process by 
tailoring and contextualizing the recommendations made by the Subcommittee for the 
specific needs of national human rights institutions and by improving their access, and that 
of regional networks and civil society, to the Subcommittee.  
</p>
<p>6. The International Coordinating Committee has introduced a number of measures to 
improve its accreditation procedures: 
</p>
<p>(a)  Aimed at assessing the effectiveness and the performance of national human 
rights institutions, the review has become more rigorous, as it is based on documented 
evidence provided by the institution under review, as well as on information received from 
civil society organizations and other stakeholders. The review has also become fairer, since </p>


<p>an appeals procedure has been included to give an opportunity to institutions to challenge 
the recommendations made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation; 
</p>
<p>(b)  The Subcommittee on Accreditation issues a number of focused and tailored 
recommendations to the national human rights institution under review, even when it 
recommends an &#8220;A&#8221; status; 
</p>
<p>(c)  The review has also become more transparent: recommendations formulated 
by the Subcommittee on Accreditation, once adopted by the Bureau of the International 
Coordinating Committee, are made public and distributed among national human rights 
institutions and other stakeholders. In addition, the reports of the Subcommittee are posted 
on the Internet (nhri.ohchr.org).  
</p>
<p>7.  According to article 16.2 of the statute of the International Coordinating Committee 
Statute, where it appears that the circumstances of any national human rights institution 
accredited with an &#8220;A&#8221; status change in any way that may affect its compliance with the 
Paris Principles, the Chairperson of the Committee or the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
may initiate a special review of the accreditation of that institution. With regard to flagrant 
cases and pending the conclusion of the special review process, article 18.2 of the statute 
stipulates that where, in the opinion of the Chairperson of the International Coordinating 
Committee, an exceptional circumstance exists necessitating the urgent consideration of 
immediate suspension of an accredited &#8220;A&#8221; status institution, the Committee Bureau may 
decide to immediately suspend accreditation classification of that institution and initiate a 
special review, pursuant to article 16.2. A special review may result in either a re-
accreditation of the institution with an &#8220;A&#8221; status or a recommendation that the institution 
be downgraded. 
</p>
<p>8.  Article 18.3 of the statute describes the procedure to be followed for the immediate 
suspension of accreditation in exceptional circumstances. At the twenty-fifth annual 
meeting of the International Coordinating Committee, held in March 2012, the definition of 
&#8220;exceptional circumstance&#8221; was adopted as stipulated in the new article 18.4:  
</p>
<p>For the purposes of article 18.2 and 18.3, an &#8220;exceptional circumstance&#8221; refers to a 
</p>
<p>sudden and drastic change in the internal political order of a State, such as a break in 
the constitutional or democratic order or a declared state of emergency or gross 
violations of human rights and this accompanied by any of the following: there is a 
change in the national human rights institution enabling legislation or other 
applicable law that is contrary to the Paris Principles; there is change in the 
composition of the institution that is not undertaken in accordance with the 
established selection and/or appointment process; or the institution acts in a way that 
seriously compromises its compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>9. According to the accreditation procedure, as stipulated in article 12 of the statute of 
the International Coordinating Committee, the recommendations of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation are submitted to the Committee Bureau to make the final decision on the 
accreditation status of the national human rights institutions reviewed, subsequent to the 
following steps:  
</p>
<p>(a) The recommendation made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation is 
forwarded to the applicant;  
</p>
<p>(b) Within 28 days of receipt of the recommendation, the applicant may 
challenge it by submitting, through OHCHR, a written communication to the Chairperson 
of the International Coordinating Committee; 
</p>
<p>(c) The report of the Subcommittee, including the recommendation, is 
subsequently forwarded for a decision to the Committee Bureau, together with any 
challenges received;  </p>


<p>(d) Within 20 days, any member of the Bureau who disagrees with the 
recommendation may notify the Chairperson of the Subcommittee and the secretariat of the 
International Coordinating Committee. The secretariat promptly notifies all members of the 
Bureau about the objection raised and provides all information necessary to clarify the 
objection. If within 20 days of receipt of that information at least four members of the 
Committee Bureau from no fewer than two regional groups notify the secretariat that they 
support the objection, the recommendation is referred to the Bureau at its next meeting for a 
decision;  
</p>
<p>(e) If at least four members from two or more regional groups do not raise any 
objection to the recommendation within 20 days of its receipt, the latter will be deemed 
approved by the Committee Bureau;  
</p>
<p>(f) The accreditation decision of the Bureau of the International Coordinating 
Committee is final. 
</p>
<p>10. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the Subcommittee on Accreditation, the 
classifications for accreditation are:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;A&#8221; status: Compliant with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;B&#8221; status: Not fully compliant with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;C&#8221; status:  Non-compliant with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>11. The Subcommittee on Accreditation may also invite civil society organizations to 
submit reports on the functioning and efficiency of national human rights institutions under 
review. Such reports are shared with the institutions concerned for their comments or 
clarification. Summaries of all documentation received from institutions for their review are 
prepared by the secretariat and shared with the relevant institutions prior to the session of 
the Subcommittee on Accreditation. National human rights institutions are given one week 
to highlight any factual errors contained in the summaries. The summaries and comments 
are subsequently brought to the attention of the members of the Subcommittee. 
</p>
<p>12.  The Subcommittee on Accreditation welcomed the attendance by representatives of 
the secretariat of the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, the secretariat 
of the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, and the representative of 
the International Coordinating Committee in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Accreditation process in 2012 
</b></p>
<p>13. The General Assembly, in its resolution 64/161, recognized the importance of 
establishing and strengthening national human rights institutions in compliance with the 
Paris Principles by encouraging national institutions, including ombudsman institutions, to 
seek accreditation through the International Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p>14. As at the end of the most recent session of the Subcommittee on Accreditation, in 
November 2012, 104 national human rights institutions had been accredited, of which 69 
with &#8220;A&#8221; status. 
</p>
<p><b> A. New applications 
</b></p>
<p>15.  In 2012, the Subcommittee on Accreditation considered eight new applications for 
accreditation. The Independent National Human Rights Commission of Burundi and the 
Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos of Chile were accredited &#8220;A&#8221; status. The 
Commissioner for Human Rights of Kazakhstan, the Ombudsman of Kyrgyzstan, the </p>


<p>Commission nationale des droits de l&#8217;homme of Mali and the Human Rights Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>of Tajikistan were accredited &#8220;B&#8221; status. The accreditation decision for the Ethiopian 
Human Rights Commission was deferred to the second session of 2013, while the 
application for accreditation of the Ombudsman of Bermuda was referred to the Bureau of 
the International Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Applications for re-accreditation 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Subcommittee on Accreditation reviewed for re-accreditation 22 national 
institutions, from Armenia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Georgia, Indonesia, Malawi, Norway, Panama, 
Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Senegal, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa 
and Togo. The national institutions of Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Colombia, Denmark, 
Indonesia, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Spain and South Africa were 
re-accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status. The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights and the Comit&#233; 
s&#233;n&#233;galais des droits de l&#8217;homme were accredited with &#8220;B&#8221; status. The National 
Commission for Human Rights of Rwanda was recommended for &#8220;B&#8221; status accreditation 
unless it provided, within one year, documentary evidence deemed necessary to establish its 
ongoing conformity with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Deferrals 
</b></p>
<p>17.  The accreditation decisions on the national human rights institutions of Armenia, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Georgia, Malawi and Togo were deferred to future 
sessions of the Subcommittee on Accreditation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Lapsed status 
</b></p>
<p>18.  The accreditation status of the Commission nationale des droits de l&#8217;homme of 
Burkina Faso and the National Centre for Human Rights of Slovakia lapsed. 
</p>
<p>19. The table reflecting the accreditation status of national human rights institutions as 
of February 2013 is contained in the annex to the present report. 
</p>
<p>20. In accordance with articles 16.2, 17 and 18 of the statute of the International 
Coordinating Committee, the Subcommittee on Accreditation conducted a special review of 
the national human rights institution of Azerbaijan, and recommended a special review of 
that of Nepal. As a result, the institution of Azerbaijan was re-accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status, 
while the special review of the institution of Nepal was scheduled for May 2013. 
</p>
<p>21. At its two sessions, the Subcommittee on Accreditation issued a number of 
recommendations for the national human rights institutions under review. In most of the 
decisions, the Subcommittee emphasized the need for a clear, transparent and participatory 
selection process of institution members as required by the Paris Principles and the 
Subcommittee in its general observations. It also stressed the importance of adequate core 
funding provided by the State to ensure the independence and financial autonomy of such 
institutions. The Subcommittee also recognized the importance of granting members of 
national institutions with immunity against legal liability for actions taken in their official 
capacity. It furthermore stressed the need for greater cooperation by and engagement of 
national human rights institutions with regional and international human rights systems. </p>


<p><b> IV. General observations 
</b></p>
<p>22.  Since October 2006, the Subcommittee on Accreditation has developed general 
observations based on the Paris Principles. These interpretative tools are addressed to:  
</p>
<p>(a)  National human rights institutions, when developing their own processes and 
mechanisms;  
</p>
<p>(b)  Governments, to address or remedy issues relating to an institution&#8217;s 
compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p>(c)  The Subcommittee itself, when it reviews applications for new accreditation, 
re-accreditation or when it conducts special reviews.  
</p>
<p>23.  The decision paper that the International Coordinating Committee adopted in May 
2011 includes a number of recommendations to standardize the process of developing and 
revising general observations, and to increase the role of stakeholders in the accreditation 
process. Accordingly, the Subcommittee on Accreditation was requested by the 
International Coordinating Committee:  
</p>
<p>(a) To establish formal communication channels with regional chairpersons and 
regional coordinating committees to request input at the initial drafting of general 
observations;  
</p>
<p>(b) To elaborate further on the justification and application of a general 
observation, taking into account the existence of various institutional models and political 
systems;  
</p>
<p>(c) To adopt procedures that facilitate the timely development of general 
observations and undertake a review of existing ones, with due regard to enhancing their 
comprehensibility, relevance and clarity;  
</p>
<p>(d) To develop its outreach and education strategies to enhance the 
understanding of how to make use of the accreditation process and the recommendations 
made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation, including the general observations. 
</p>
<p>24. Three new general observations are to be considered by the International 
Coordinating Committee at its twenty-sixth annual meeting, in May 2013, relating to: 
</p>
<p>(a) National human rights institutions appointed as national preventive 
mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment or national monitoring mechanism 
under article 33 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</p>
<p>(b) The quasi-judicial competence of national human rights institutions to handle 
complaints; 
</p>
<p>(c) The performance of national human rights institutions in both law and in 
practice. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>25.<b> With the support of OHCHR, the accreditation process carried out by the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation has become more rigorous, fair and transparent.  
</b></p>
<p>26.<b> The increasing number of national human rights institutions</b> <b>seeking 
accreditation confirms the important role of the Subcommittee of Accreditation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessing their conformity with the Paris Principles. </b></p>


<p>27.<b> The recommendations of the Subcommittee on Accreditation help to enhance 
the independence and effectiveness of the national human rights institutions</b> <b>under 
review, which in turn strengthen national human rights protection systems. States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, are encouraged to assist 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights institutions</b> <b>in implementing these recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>28.<b> With the enhanced role </b>of &#8220;A&#8221; status <b>national human rights institutions</b> <b>in the 
proceedings of the Human Rights Council,</b>1<b> the Subcommittee on Accreditation is 
</b></p>
<p><b>more </b>vigilant and rigorous in granting &#8220;A&#8221; status to ensure that only <b>those 
institutions fully compliant with the Paris Principles may make use of the benefits 
</b></p>
<p><b>currently accorded </b>to &#8220;A&#8221; <b>institutions in their interaction with Council mechanisms, 
namely, the universal periodic review process and the special procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>29.<b> To assess efficiency and compliance with the Paris Principles in both legislation 
and practice, the Subcommittee on Accreditation invites informed stakeholders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including civil society organizations, to participate actively by providing their views 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the functioning of the national human rights institutions</b> <b>under review. 
</b></p>
<p>30.<b> The steps taken by the International Coordinating Committee to expedite the 
revision of the accreditation status of national human rights institutions</b> <b>in cases 
where exceptional circumstances arise and affect the independence and performance 
</b></p>
<p><b>of institutions are welcomed</b>. <b>This improvement in the accreditation process will 
encourage national institutions to continue to fulfil their mandate effectively</b>, <b>for 
instance in the event </b>of coup d&#8217;&#233;tat or state of emergency.  
</p>
<p>31.<b> The Subcommittee on Accreditation emphasizes the need for national human 
rights institutions</b> <b>to have a broad mandate to promote and protect all human rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights. States are required to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions with a mandate, including the promotion and protection of all rights as set 
</b></p>
<p><b>out in international and regional instruments.  
</b></p>
<p>32.<b> The Subcommittee on Accreditation attaches key importance to the 
transparent and open appointment of members of national human rights institutions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the broad participation of relevant stakeholders, including civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. States are required to ensure the openness and transparency of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>appointment process.  
</b></p>
<p>33.<b> The Subcommittee on Accreditation encourages national human rights 
institutions</b> <b>to report regularly on their activities, as well as on the human rights 
situation in their respective country, and to ensure that such reports are broadly 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminated among the public.  
</b></p>
<p>34.<b>  The review of the general observations made by the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation is welcomed, since these observations are in fact a tool for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>progressive interpretation of the Paris Principles. The development of additional 
</b></p>
<p><b>general observations, namely, on national human rights institutions serving as 
</b></p>
<p><b>national monitoring and preventive mechanisms, on the quasi-judicial competency of 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, and on assessing their performance, is welcomed. 
</b></p>
<p>35.<b> In view of the compulsory budget cuts caused by reductions in funding, the 
capacity of OHCHR to contribute to the establishment of national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions or assessing their compliance with the Paris Principles is affected, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including specifically the support given by OHCHR to the International Coordinating 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee and its Subcommittee on Accreditation. Member States are therefore</b> 
<b>urged to ensure by their financial contribution the continuation of efficient and high-
</b></p>
<p><b>quality servicing of the Subcommittee.  </b></p>
