The Company produced 108,578 ounces of gold for the year, compared to 98,3597 ounces 
from the previous corresponding period, at an average recovered grade of 6.40 g/t gold 
(June 2015: 5.61 g/t gold).  
The average cash costs of US$466 per ounce, inclusive of royalties and local business 
taxes  was  higher  than  the  previous  year’s  average  cash  costs  of  US$385  per  ounce, 
primarily due to a change in methodology on the allocation of total mining costs introduced 
in July 2016. 
All in Sustaining Costs (“AISC”) for the year was US$999 per ounce of gold and includes 
discretionary exploration expenditure of US$9.3 million.
Production Guidance (2016/17)
between 105,000 to 115,000 ounces; 
at an AISC of between US$1,000 to US$1,100 per ounce.
The production guidance for 2016/17 at the Co-O mine is expected to be: 
• 
• 
The  production  guidance  profile,  quarter  by  quarter  will  be  slightly  back-end  loaded  for  the 
forthcoming financial year, driven by the higher level of development ore and infrastructure project 
waste rock required in the first 2 quarters. 
An Independent Operations Review was completed in the June quarter, laying the foundation for 
the  life  of  mine  Planning  process  (“LOMP”);  consolidating  the  mines  long-range  planning, 
scheduling with the Co-O mines long-range capital development infrastructure planning, to support 
the LOMP.  This study supports the FY16-17 guidance numbers.  
The Co-O mine remains hoist capacity constrained until the E15 Service Shaft is completed by 
June 2017.  Once completed the Service Shaft will take over 100% of manpower and materials 
movement, freeing up the L8 Production Shaft to be a 100% dedicated skipping shaft.  For the 
next quarter the mine ventilation upgrade and mine dewatering project will be close to completion.  
Once completed we will start seeing a reduction in the sustaining capital project cost component 
of the AISC’s, mostly driven by the Service Shaft completion in June 2017.
Reserves and Resources
New Resource and Reserve estimates for 2016 are currently being compiled and will be reported 
in accordance with JORC 2012 in the September 2016 quarter.
Corporate
Dividend: 
No dividends were declared nor paid during the year.

(“CEO”) on an interim basis following the retirement of Mr Geoff Davis on 12 November 2015.
•  Mr Boyd Timler was appointed CEO on 21 March 2016.

•  Mr Roy Daniel joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 25 November 2015.
