<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, including resolution 19/17 of 
22 March 2012, in which the Council decided to establish an independent international fact-
finding mission to investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the human rights 
of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human 
Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly reaffirming, inter alia, the 
illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> the relevant rules and principles of international law, including 
international humanitarian law and international human rights law, in particular the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 
1949, which is applicable de jure to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, and to which Israel is a party, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international 
human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations and as elaborated 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human 
Rights and other applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, were established in breach of international 
law, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in East Jerusalem, are illegal under international law and constitute very serious 
violations of international humanitarian law and of the human rights of the Palestinian 
people therein, and undermine international efforts aimed at invigorating the peace process 
and realizing the two-State solution, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Endorses </i>the report of the independent international fact-finding mission to 
investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights of the Palestinian People throughout the occupied Palestinian Territories, 
including East Jerusalem,1 and demands that all parties concerned, including United 
Nations bodies, implement and ensure the implementation of the recommendations 
contained therein in accordance with their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>2.<i> Calls upon </i>the relevant United Nations bodies to take all necessary measures 
and actions within their mandates to ensure the full respect for and compliance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 17/4 on the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
the Global Compact and other relevant international laws and standards, and to ensure the 
implementation of the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework, which 
provides a global standard for upholding human rights in relation to business activities that 
are connected with Israel, the occupying Power, its illegal settlements and its illegal wall of 
separation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Requests </i>the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, including in consultation with relevant special 
procedures mandate holders, to fulfil its mandate and, accordingly, to take the necessary 
measures and actions relating to business activities connected to the illegal Israeli 
settlements and the illegal wall of separation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and, to that end, include a relevant item in its programme of work 
and to report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-sixth session;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>4.<i> Requests </i>the Secretary-General to present a report detailing the 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the independent 
international fact-finding mission on the implications of Israeli settlements on the civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian People throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in East Jerusalem, to the Human Rights Council 
at its twenty-fifth session; 
</p>
