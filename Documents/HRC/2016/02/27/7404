<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues,

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report provides an update of the activities of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>minority issues during 2014. It includes a thematic discussion on &#8220;Hate speech and 
</p>
<p>incitement to hatred against minorities in the media&#8221;. Media, in its diverse forms, is an 
</p>
<p>essential component of today&#8217;s societies, providing huge benefits and possibilities, 
</p>
<p>including in the field of minority issues. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur highlights 
</p>
<p>that media can also be misused as a platform for discrimination, exclusion and the 
</p>
<p>incitement of hostility and violence against particular individuals and groups, through hate 
</p>
<p>speech as well as xenophobic discourse. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur identifies and analyses factors that influence and perpetuate 
</p>
<p>hate speech in the media. She urges States to adopt legislation prohibiting national, racial or 
</p>
<p>religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, in line 
</p>
<p>with article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to put in 
</p>
<p>place practical policy and programme measures to prevent hate speech from leading to hate 
</p>
<p>crimes.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues was established by the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights in resolution 2005/79, as an Independent Expert, and 
</p>
<p>renewed by the Human Rights Council in resolutions 7/6 of 27 March 2008 and 16/6 of 24 
</p>
<p>March 2011. On 28 March 2014, the Council renewed the mandate of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, in resolution 25/5. The current mandate holder assumed her functions on  
</p>
<p>1 August 2011. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur is, inter alia, to promote the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
</p>
<p>Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, including through consultation with 
</p>
<p>Governments. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report covers the period from January to December 2014. Chapter II 
</p>
<p>contains an overview of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities during the reporting period. In 
</p>
<p>chapters III and IV, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the thematic issue of hate speech and 
</p>
<p>incitement to hatred against minorities in the media, and provides her conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations in chapter V. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Nigeria from 17 to 28 February 2014. With over 350 
</p>
<p>ethnic groups and even more languages, harmonious and peaceful inter-ethnic relations 
</p>
<p>prevail in most of the country. However, violent intercommunal clashes have affected the 
</p>
<p>North and Middle Belt regions, with the underlying causes of the violence including 
</p>
<p>poverty, good governance deficits, impunity and polarization of ethnic and religious 
</p>
<p>characteristics. Minority communities in the Niger Delta suffer from dire environmental 
</p>
<p>degradation owing to frequent oil spills. They have been deprived of their traditional 
</p>
<p>livelihoods and face difficulties accessing basic services. Language issues include the 
</p>
<p>decline of numerous mother-tongue languages. The report on the visit is contained in 
</p>
<p>document A/HRC/28/64/Add.2.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited Ukraine from 7 to 14 April 2014. Representatives of 
</p>
<p>communities described a history of harmonious inter-ethnic and interfaith relations and a 
</p>
<p>legislative, policy and social environment generally conducive to the protection of their 
</p>
<p>rights, including cultural and linguistic rights. Nevertheless, minority issues became highly 
</p>
<p>politicized as the situation of political and social unrest increased in 2014, particularly in 
</p>
<p>the East, creating and widening fractures along national, ethnic and linguistic lines, and 
</p>
<p>resulting in conflict. While challenges relating to minority issues include a lack of 
</p>
<p>institutional attention to minority rights, she notes that minority rights have been 
</p>
<p>inappropriately used to justify or support violent actions. The report on the visit is 
</p>
<p>contained in document A/HRC/28/64/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Governments of Nigeria and Ukraine for their 
</p>
<p>cooperation during her visits to the respective countries, and the Governments of Botswana, 
</p>
<p>Brazil and the Russian Federation, respectively, for agreeing to visits in 2015. She also 
</p>
<p>thanks the Government of Belarus for extending an invitation to conduct an official visit. 
</p>
<p>She urges other States to which she has requested invitations to respond positively to her 
</p>
<p>requests.  </p>


<p><b> B. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur received information from diverse sources about human 
</p>
<p>rights violations perpetrated against national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. 
</p>
<p>Based on that information, she sent communications in the form of letters of allegation and 
</p>
<p>urgent action letters relating to minority issues to the Member States concerned &#8211; most 
</p>
<p>jointly with other relevant mandates. Those communications and the responses from the 
</p>
<p>Governments concerned are available to the public in the joint communications reports of 
</p>
<p>the special procedures submitted to the Human Rights Council.1 
</p>
<p><b> C. Additional activities

</p>
<p>10. From 4 to 6 March 2014, she participated in the first international meeting of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes&#8221; (GAAMAC), in San Jos&#233;, where she 
</p>
<p>addressed the role of prevention through urgent and coordinated actions in the light of 
</p>
<p>early-warning signs. 
</p>
<p>11. On 26 March 2014, she gave a lecture at the Hungarian National Public Service

</p>
<p>Ostaig lecture on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in which she focused on the general United 
</p>
<p>Nations framework for minority rights protection, with specific attention to the trends and 
</p>
<p>concerns regarding linguistic minorities. 
</p>
<p>13. On 17 June 2014, she participated in the side event on &#8220;Caste-based violence against 
</p>
<p>women and girls&#8221;, organized by the International Dalit Solidarity Network, in Geneva. She 
</p>
<p>discussed the role of special procedures in combating caste-based discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violence. 
</p>
<p>14. On 18 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Preventative tools of human rights mechanisms in Geneva &#8211; Part I: Special Procedures 
</p>
<p>Mandate Holders&#8221;, organized by the Responsibility to Protect Core Group, in which she 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was requested, in resolution 25/5, to guide the work of the 
</p>
<p>Forum on Minority Issues, prepare its annual meetings and report on its recommendations 
</p>
<p>to the Human Rights Council. The seventh annual session of the Forum was held in 
</p>
<p>Geneva, on 25 and 26 November 2014, with a thematic focus on preventing and addressing 
</p>
<p>violence and atrocity crimes against minorities. 
</p>
<p>24. Over 500 delegates participated, representing Member States from all regions, 
</p>
<p>United Nations mechanisms, treaty bodies and specialized agencies, intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and NGOs and 
</p>
<p>including academics and experts on minority issues. Issues addressed included 
</p>
<p>understanding the root causes of violence; improving prevention of violence and atrocity 
</p>
<p>crimes; essential measures for resolution, protection and security once violence has broken 
</p>
<p>out; and avoiding renewed violence through peace-building and managing diversity. 
</p>
<p>Interventions identified challenges involving minorities as well as solutions and effective 
</p>
<p>practices for preventing and addressing violence. Three side events were organized in the 
</p>
<p>margins of the Forum on related themes. Recommendations from the Forum will be 
</p>
<p>presented to the Council at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Hate speech and incitement to hatred against minorities 
in the media  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by the high number of complaints reaching her 
</p>
<p>about hateful messages and incitement to hatred that have fuelled tensions and often led to 
</p>
<p>hate crimes. In her 2014 report to the General Assembly (A/69/266), she focused on 
</p>
<p>violence and atrocity crimes against minorities and listed cases of attacks against minority 
</p>
<p>groups that she had brought to the attention of Member States concerned, either through 
</p>
<p>communications (letters of allegation or urgent action letters) or public press releases. She 
</p>
<p>believes that more should be done to monitor and react, in a timely manner, to hate speech 
</p>
<p>and incitement to hatred and violence to prevent tensions and violence which damage the 
</p>
<p>entire social fabric, unity and stability of societies. Tolerance and inaction reinforce the 
</p>
<p>subordination of targeted minorities, making them more vulnerable to attacks, but also 
</p>
<p>influencing majority populations and potentially making them more indifferent to the 
</p>
<p>various manifestations of such hatred.  
</p>
<p>26. Although not all hateful messages result in actual hate crimes, hate crimes rarely 
</p>
<p>occur without prior stigmatization and dehumanization of targeted groups and incitement to 
</p>
<p>hate incidents fuelled by religious or racial bias. Few countries collect data on hate crimes, 
</p>
<p>their causes and victims that would enable policy-makers to better protect population 
</p>
<p>groups at risk.  
</p>
<p>27. In the United States, in 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Uniform 
</p>
<p>Crime Reporting Program, recorded almost 6,000 hate crimes incidents: 48.5 per cent were 
</p>
<p>racially motivated (66 per cent anti-Black, 21 per cent anti-White, 5 per cent anti-Asian, </p>


<p>4 per cent anti-American Indian or Alaska Native); 17.4 per cent were motivated by 
</p>
<p>religious bias (59 per cent anti-Semitic, 14 per cent anti-Islamic, 6 per cent anti-Catholic); 
</p>
<p>and 11.1 per cent stemmed from ethnicity bias (53 per cent anti-Hispanic or Latino biased).3 
</p>
<p>28. In Europe, in 2008, the Fundamental Rights Agency conducted a survey of 23,500 
</p>
<p>respondents from ethnic minority and immigrant groups to assess how many had been 
</p>
<p>victims of assault, threat or serious harassment with a perceived racist motive. The survey 
</p>
<p>found that between 16 per cent and 32 per cent of Roma, and between 19 per cent and 
</p>
<p>32 per cent of persons of African origin reported being victims of racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Another survey of 5,900 respondents in nine European Union Member States found that up 
</p>
<p>to one third of Jewish people had experienced verbal abuse or physical anti-semitic 
</p>
<p>violence.4 The Special Rapporteur considers that many incidents could be prevented with 
</p>
<p>timely and appropriate responses to hateful messages, including through better 
</p>
<p>representation and inclusion of minorities in mainstream communication platforms.  
</p>
<p>29. No country or society is free from hatred and it is most often those belonging to 
</p>
<p>national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities who are the targets of hate. But what are 
</p>
<p>the causes of such hatred and how does it evolve from a thought or a viewpoint to infect a 
</p>
<p>whole society or result in acts of violence? This is an essential question that we must 
</p>
<p>become better at answering if we are to effectively confront hatred in all its forms. 
</p>
<p>30. Hatred is often constructed, fuelled, maintained and directed by certain individuals 
</p>
<p>or groups against other individuals and communities who are different, in ethnicity, 
</p>
<p>language or religion from the dominant majority, often for political reasons or due to long-
</p>
<p>standing and entrenched discrimination. Hateful messages may fall on particularly fertile 
</p>
<p>ground where there are wider social, economic or political problems or divisions in society. 
</p>
<p>The root causes of hatred often lie beyond purely ethnic or religious difference.  
</p>
<p>31. Hatred very often stems from wider societal shortcomings, including the lack of or 
</p>
<p>unequal access to resources; partisan politics; corruption; deficits in good and inclusive 
</p>
<p>governance; and the reality or perception of bias and favouritism along ethnic or religious 
</p>
<p>lines, which can fuel distrust, suspicion and anger. It was found that where inclusive 
</p>
<p>governance, equality and human rights prevail and communities have placed trust in their 
</p>
<p>leadership, there were fewer communal fractures and concerns about minority rights. 
</p>
<p>32. Governments, civil society and the international community must be alert to the 
</p>
<p>warning signs of hatred and violence much earlier: when the first words of hate speech are 
</p>
<p>uttered; when media start to promote negative stereotypes; or once there is an atmosphere 
</p>
<p>of discomfort and animosity when minorities exercise their right to freely and openly 
</p>
<p>practise their religion, use their language, or assert their right to have a voice in political life 
</p>
<p>and the decisions that affect them.  
</p>
<p>33. Many States continue to lack domestic anti-discrimination and anti-hate speech laws 
</p>
<p>and, even where they exist, implementation of the law is often poor and court cases are rare. 
</p>
<p>States must not make quick or easy assumptions that minorities feel secure because of 
</p>
<p>constitutions and laws that codify minority rights on paper. It is essential that States find 
</p>
<p>ways to understand the feelings and concerns of minorities and that the required 
</p>
<p>institutional attention to minority issues and consultative bodies and processes is in place.  
</p>
<p>34. The present thematic study provides an overview of the role of media in relation to 
</p>
<p>hate speech and incitement to hatred and violence. It refers to the role of international 
</p>
<p>standards and processes with regard to the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, and will 
</p>
<p>address the major challenges to combating hate speech in the media. Different measures 
</p>
<p>and good practices that can be implemented by States and civil society actors will be 
</p>
<p>analysed.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Examples 
</b></p>
<p>35. There are numerous examples, both historical and present-day, of how media is used 
</p>
<p>as a means of portraying minority groups in an offensive and stereotyped way and, in the 
</p>
<p>most extreme cases, to directly incite violence. The Nazi regime used media for a massive 
</p>
<p>propaganda campaign against Jews, Roma, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, homosexuals and others. 
</p>
<p>A propaganda ministry controlled the media, exerting censorship on books and authors to 
</p>
<p>suppress opposing viewpoints and to reinforce Nazi ideology of racial superiority and anti-
</p>
<p>Semitism. Jews were repeatedly portrayed as the cause of societal problems and 
</p>
<p>dehumanized in the public discourse. Around six million Jews, as well as Roma and others 
</p>
<p>were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust. 
</p>
<p>36. During the Rwandan genocide in 1994, media played a major role in supporting and 
</p>
<p>inciting ethnic hatred and violence against Tutsi and moderate Hutu populations. The 
</p>
<p>newspaper <i>Kangura</i> spread hatred against Tutsis, publishing articles and graphic cartoons 
</p>
<p>in which Tutsis were attacked. A wider audience was reached by radio stations, which were 
</p>
<p>key in transmitting hate propaganda and incitement to violence. Radio Rwanda and Radio 
</p>
<p>T&#233;l&#233;vision des Milles Collines (RTML) instigated, encouraged and directed massacres. 
</p>
<p>Hate messages broadcast during the genocide referred to Tutsis as &#8220;cockroaches&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>issued instructions to kill them. Nearly one million people were killed. 
</p>
<p>37. In the post-9/11 era, Islam and Muslims have been subject to stigmatization and 
</p>
<p>hostility in Western media. Certain media outlets have identified Islam with terrorism, 
</p>
<p>which, according to the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, is a major driver of resurgent 
</p>
<p>Islamophobia around the world (E/CN.4/2006/17). Despite many civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>delivering pro-Muslim discourses after the September 11 attacks, anti-Islamic fringe 
</p>
<p>organizations have exploited mass media to spread messages of fear and anger. The former 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert on minority issues noted in a report (A/HRC/13/23/Add.2) that 
</p>
<p>members of Muslim and Arab communities in Canada stated that negative stereotypes had 
</p>
<p>been reinforced since September 2001, including in the mass media, resulting in their 
</p>
<p>reluctance to engage in public debate or raise their concerns. 
</p>
<p>38. Prejudices and entrenched stereotypes against Roma are common and Roma 
</p>
<p>communities are frequently the target of degrading and inflammatory language. In 2013, 
the case of a young blonde girl who was found living in a Roma settlement in Greece, 
</p>
<p>prompted a wave of anti-Roma reports and accusations that Roma had abducted her. Such 
</p>
<p>allegations prompted additional allegations from other countries. The accusations were 
</p>
<p>subsequently found to be unfounded. Indeed, they were made prior to a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>investigation and were based on sensationalist media coverage. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>called5 on media and commentators to refrain from generalizations on the supposed 
</p>
<p>criminality of Roma and warned that hateful rhetoric would trigger further stigmatization 
</p>
<p>and even violence against Roma. 
</p>
<p>39. In the Central African Republic, hate speech has been recognized as having played a 
</p>
<p>role in inflaming and fuelling violence and has been described by United Nations officials 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13915&amp;. </p>


<p>as a possible precursor to serious human rights violations, including potential genocide.6 In 
</p>
<p>March 2014, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide alerted the 
</p>
<p>media that Muslims were being &#8220;deliberately and systematically targeted by the anti-
</p>
<p>Balaka&#8221; in attacks referred to as &#8220;cleansing operations&#8221;. He referred to reports of hate 
</p>
<p>speech by anti-Balaka (Christian armed groups) on public media referring to Muslims as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;rotten potatoes&#8221; and public justification of their actions. 
</p>
<p>40. On 2 July 2014, the Special Rapporteur called on Sri Lanka to stop racial and faith-
</p>
<p>based hatred and violence directed at Muslim and Christian communities by Buddhist 
</p>
<p>groups with extremist views, and to bring perpetrators to justice.7 Various statements have 
</p>
<p>promoted extremist views, proclaiming the racial superiority of Sinhala Buddhists and 
</p>
<p>alleging that statues of Buddha are being bulldozed by religious minorities or that 
</p>
<p>evangelical Christians are forcibly converting vulnerable people. Those statements 
</p>
<p>reportedly contributed to over 350 violent attacks against Muslims and over 150 attacks 
</p>
<p>against Christians in the past two years.  
</p>
<p>41. Social media is a fertile ground for radical and terrorist groups to spread hateful 
</p>
<p>messages. ISIL uses online platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and 
</p>
<p>Youtube, to deliver updates on their actions as well as to reach out to potential donors and 
</p>
<p>recruits, including posting videos and graphic material. The misuse of social media by ISIL 
</p>
<p>has been described by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>42. Social media platforms have also been used to disseminate hate speech content 
</p>
<p>against groups, which has fuelled intercommunal tensions and led, in some cases, to violent 
</p>
<p>clashes among communities. Following a country visit in July 2014, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the situation of human rights in Myanmar expressed her concern over the spread of 
</p>
<p>misinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, discrimination and hostility in the 
</p>
<p>media and Internet, particularly targeted against Muslim communities.9 
</p>
<p><b> C. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
</p>
<p>and Linguistic Minorities establishes that &#8220;States shall protect the existence and the national 
</p>
<p>or ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity of minorities within their respective 
</p>
<p>territories and shall encourage conditions for the promotion of that identity&#8221; and requires 
</p>
<p>that States adopt appropriate legislative and other measures to achieve those ends (art. 1). 
</p>
<p>The Declaration also emphasizes that persons belonging to minorities &#8220;have the right to 
</p>
<p>enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, and to use their 
</p>
<p>language, in private and in public, freely and without interference or any form of 
</p>
<p>discrimination&#8221; (art. 2.1). The commentary on the Declaration10 encourages States to adopt 
</p>
<p>laws protecting against acts or incitement to acts which physically threaten the existence of 
</p>
<p>groups or threaten their identity.  
</p>
<p>44. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
</p>
<p>recognizes that genocide is an international crime, which entails the national and 
</p>
<p>international responsibility of individual persons and States. According to article 3 of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>Convention, the following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide; (b) conspiracy to commit 
</p>
<p>genocide; (c) direct and public incitement to commit genocide; (d) attempt to commit 
</p>
<p>genocide; and (e) complicity in genocide. 
</p>
<p>45. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits &#8220;any propaganda 
</p>
<p>for war&#8221; as well as &#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
</p>
<p>incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221; (art. 20). 
</p>
<p>46. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>obligates States to condemn &#8220;all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas 
</p>
<p>or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or 
</p>
<p>which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and 
</p>
<p>undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, 
</p>
<p>or acts of, such discrimination&#8221; (art. 4). Furthermore, three situations constitute offences 
</p>
<p>punishable by law: (a) all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, 
</p>
<p>incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts 
</p>
<p>against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the 
</p>
<p>provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; 
</p>
<p>(b) organizations, organized and all other propaganda activities which promote and incite 
</p>
<p>discrimination&#8212;which must be declared illegal and prohibited&#8212;, and participation in such 
</p>
<p>organizations or activities; (c) promotion or incitement of racial discrimination by public 
</p>
<p>authorities or public institutions, national or local. 
</p>
<p>47. In its general recommendation No. 35 (2013) on combating racist hate speech, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination stresses, inter alia, the role of racist 
</p>
<p>hate speech in processes leading to mass violations of human rights and genocide and in 
</p>
<p>conflict situations and points out that racist hate speech can emanate from individuals or 
</p>
<p>groups, can be disseminated orally, in print, through electronic media (Internet, social 
</p>
<p>networking sites), as well as by non-verbal expression (racist symbols, images, behaviour at 
</p>
<p>public gatherings). It emphasizes that media representations of ethnic, indigenous and other 
</p>
<p>groups should be based on principles of respect, fairness and the avoidance of stereotyping. 
</p>
<p>It formulates specific recommendations, including the adoption of appropriate legislation in 
</p>
<p>line with international standards, the establishment of codes of professional ethics and press 
</p>
<p>codes, the promotion of media pluralism and the facilitation of access to and ownership of 
</p>
<p>media by minorities.  
</p>
<p>48. The Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or 
</p>
<p>religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence11 
</p>
<p>constitutes a comprehensive framework to assist States in implementing their obligations to 
</p>
<p>combat incitement to hatred. It contains specific recommendations and guidance on 
</p>
<p>balancing freedom of expression enshrined in article 19 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, with the prohibitions in article 20, through a six-part threshold 
</p>
<p>test for forms of speech that are prohibited under criminal law. Among the key factors put 
</p>
<p>forward in the Plan to prevent incitement to hatred are the collective responsibility of 
</p>
<p>States, media and society, and the need to foster social consciousness, tolerance, mutual 
</p>
<p>respect, and intercultural dialogue. 
</p>
<p>49. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights does not contain provisions 
</p>
<p>referring specifically to the prohibition of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>However the Charter states that: &#8220;all peoples shall be equal; they shall enjoy the same 
</p>
<p>respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by 
</p>
<p>another&#8221; (art. 19) and that &#8220;every individual shall have the duty to respect and consider his 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 See www.ohchr.org/documents/issues/opinion/seminarrabat/rabat_draft_outcome.pdf. </p>


<p>fellow beings without discrimination, and to maintain relations aimed at promoting, 
</p>
<p>safeguarding and reinforcing mutual respect and tolerance&#8221; (art. 28). The American 
</p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights states that: &#8220;any propaganda for war and any advocacy of 
</p>
<p>national, racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitements to lawless violence or to any 
</p>
<p>other similar action against any person or group of persons on any grounds including those 
</p>
<p>of race, color, religion, language, or national origin shall be considered as offenses 
</p>
<p>punishable by law&#8221; (art. 13.5).  
</p>
<p>50. The European Court of Human Rights, in its recommendations and jurisprudence on 
</p>
<p>the European Convention on Human Rights, has identified a number of forms of expression 
</p>
<p>which are considered offensive and contrary to the Convention, including racism, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia, anti-Semitism, aggressive nationalism and discrimination against minorities 
</p>
<p>and immigrants.12 The Court makes a distinction between genuine and serious incitement to 
</p>
<p>extremism and, on the other hand the right of individuals (including journalists and 
</p>
<p>politicians) to express their views freely and to &#8220;offend, shock or disturb&#8221; others. Other 
relevant standards include the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocol and the Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating 
</p>
<p>certain forms and expression of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Factors that lead to hate speech and incitement to hatred 
in the media  
</b></p>
<p>51. Hate speech has been described as &#8220;the special scourge of minorities and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8221;.13 Unfortunately, hate speech and incitement to hatred are on the rise in many 
</p>
<p>countries across all continents and these hateful messages are frequently transmitted 
</p>
<p>through traditional media and the Internet. A number of factors are involved in making 
</p>
<p>minority groups the targets of hate speech in the media. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Absence of or unclear legislation on incitement to hatred 
</b></p>
<p>52. There is no universally accepted definition of &#8220;hate speech&#8221;. The term encompasses 
</p>
<p>a wide array of hateful messages, ranging from offensive, derogatory, abusive and negative 
</p>
<p>stereotyping remarks and comments, to intimidating, inflammatory speech inciting violence 
</p>
<p>against specific individuals and groups. Only the most egregious forms of hate speech, 
</p>
<p>namely those constituting incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, are generally 
</p>
<p>considered unlawful. Cultural paradigms must be understood and taken into account when 
</p>
<p>considering whether certain comments or images constitute hate speech, incitement or 
</p>
<p>defamation, and States have a margin of appreciation in establishing such thresholds. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a balance must be struck that does not unduly restrict the rights of individuals 
</p>
<p>or place individuals under the threat of violence.  
</p>
<p>53. Discussion over what constitutes hate speech poses a recurring dilemma vis-&#224;-vis the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of expression and its limits. It remains necessary to protect freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression while at the same time guaranteeing the rights of others, public order and, in 
</p>
<p>some cases, national security. Nevertheless, as stressed by the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, far from being 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 Council of Europe, Recommendation No. R 97 (20) of the Committee of Ministers to Member States 
</p>
<p>on &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, adopted on 30 October 1997, at the 607th meeting of the Minister&#8217;s Deputies. 
</p>
<p> 13 Susan Benesch, &#8220;Defining and diminishing hate speech&#8221;, in <i>Freedom from hate,</i> State of the World&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><i>Minorities and Indigenous Peoples 2014</i>, Peter Grant, ed. (London, Minority Rights Group 
</p>
<p>International, July 2014).  </p>


<p>incompatible, the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the prohibition of 
</p>
<p>incitement to hatred are &#8220;mutually supportive&#8221;, as the public debate of ideas as well as 
</p>
<p>interfaith and intercultural dialogue can prevent hate and intolerance.14  
</p>
<p>54. In order to develop consistent and effective legislation and measures to prohibit and 
</p>
<p>penalize incitement to hatred, hate speech should not be confused with other types of 
</p>
<p>inflammatory, hateful or offensive speech. As experts have stated,15 the intended or actual 
</p>
<p>effects of speech can be a useful indicator to distinguish incitement to hatred from other 
</p>
<p>categories of hate speech: in the case of incitement to hatred, the speaker seeks to provoke 
</p>
<p>reactions on the part of the audience, specifically to influence the audience to share the 
</p>
<p>views expressed or implied in the speech and to respond against the victim groups with 
</p>
<p>hostility, discrimination or violence. 
</p>
<p>55. The Council of Europe Committee of Ministers uses a broader approach: &#8220;the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;hate speech&#8221; shall be understood as covering all forms of expression which spread, incite, 
</p>
<p>promote or justify racial hatred, xenophobia, anti&#8208;Semitism or other forms of hatred based 
on intolerance, including: intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and 
</p>
<p>ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility against minorities, migrants and people of 
</p>
<p>immigrant origin.&#8221;16 
</p>
<p>56. Lack of clear definitions of the content and elements of the prohibition of advocacy 
</p>
<p>of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to hatred, in legal systems, 
</p>
<p>may lead to misapplication of the law, including the use of anti-hate speech legislation to 
</p>
<p>persecute and suppress critical or dissenting voices.17 For example, so-called &#8220;blasphemy 
</p>
<p>laws&#8221; may result in the censure of inter- and intra-religious dialogue, debate and criticism; 
</p>
<p>many of those laws are also applied in a discriminatory manner, as they offer different 
</p>
<p>levels of protection to different religious beliefs.18 As highlighted by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on freedom of religion or belief, &#8220;the risk that legal provisions prohibiting hate speech are 
</p>
<p>interpreted loosely and applied selectively by the authorities underlines the importance of 
</p>
<p>having unambiguous language and of devising effective safeguards against abuses of the 
</p>
<p>law&#8221;.19 
</p>
<p>57. A series of consultations involving OHCHR, civil society and academics were held 
</p>
<p>to provide a clearer definition of the key terms contained in article 20, paragraph 2, of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one of which resulted in &#8220;The Camden 
</p>
<p>Principles on Freedom of Expression and Equality&#8221;.20 Principle 12 states as follows: (a) the 
</p>
<p>terms &#8220;hatred&#8221; and &#8220;hostility&#8221; refer to intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, 
</p>
<p>enmity and detestation towards the target group; (b) &#8220;advocacy&#8221; must be understood as 
</p>
<p>requiring an intention to promote hatred publicly towards the target group; (c) &#8220;incitement&#8221;

<p>refers to statements about national, racial or religious groups which create an imminent risk 
</p>
<p>of discrimination, hostility or violence against persons belonging to those groups; (d) the 
</p>
<p>promotion, by different communities, of a positive sense of group identity does not 
</p>
<p>constitute hate speech.  
</p>
<p>58. A six-part test has been developed by the NGO Article 19 to determine the 
</p>
<p>appropriate threshold for assessing the types of expressions constituting &#8220;incitement to 
</p>
<p>hatred&#8221;:21 (1) context of the expression, including consideration of existing conflicts within 
</p>
<p>society, existence and history of institutionalized discrimination, history of clashes and 
</p>
<p>conflicts over resources, the legal framework and the media landscape. In relation to media, 
</p>
<p>issues to be examined include censorship, existence of barriers to establishing media 
</p>
<p>outlets, limits to the independence of the media or journalists, broad and unclear restrictions 
</p>
<p>on the content to publish or broadcast and evidence of bias in the application of the 
</p>
<p>restrictions, absence of criticism of government or wide-ranging policy debate in the media 
</p>
<p>and access by the audience to a range of alternative and easily accessible views and 
</p>
<p>speeches; (2) speaker, including consideration of his/her official position, level of authority 
</p>
<p>or influence over the audience and whether the statement was made by a person in his/her 
</p>
<p>official capacity. Politicians and public officials or persons of similar status should be given 
</p>
<p>special consideration; (3) intent of the speaker to incite hatred, not mere recklessness or 
</p>
<p>negligence; (4) content of the expression, including what was said, the targeted audience 
</p>
<p>and the targeted potential victims, tone and form of the speech; (5) extent and magnitude of 
</p>
<p>the expression, including the means of dissemination (press, audiovisual media, work of art, 
</p>
<p>etc.); (6) likelihood of harm occurring, including its imminence. 
</p>
<p>59. As underscored by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of opinion and expression (A/66/290), it is necessary to differentiate 
</p>
<p>between illegal expression, which States are required to prohibit under international law, 
</p>
<p>and expression considered harmful, offensive, objectionable or undesirable, but which 
</p>
<p>States are neither required to prohibit or criminalize. It is important to differentiate between 
</p>
<p>three types of expression: (a) expression constituting an offence under international law that 
</p>
<p>can be prosecuted criminally; (b) expression not criminally punishable but that may justify 
</p>
<p>a restriction and a civil suit; (c) expression that does not give rise to criminal or civil 
</p>
<p>sanctions but still raise concerns in terms of tolerance, civility and respect for others. 
</p>
<p>Negative or stereotyped characterizations of minority groups may fall under any of those 
</p>
<p>three categories. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur considers that, while much attention is rightly paid to legal 
</p>
<p>responses to hate speech, equal attention and discussion should be dedicated to non-legal 
</p>
<p>and social responses. She was impressed by community initiatives, in which hate groups 
</p>
<p>have been confronted and halted by ordinary citizens,22 and alternative and creative ways 
</p>
<p>that have been initiated to tackle hate speech.  
</p>
<p>61. Although several constitutions and legislative acts regulate incitement to hatred, 
</p>
<p>practice in respect of national case law differs greatly. In African societies, the importance 
</p>
<p>of traditional conflict resolution methods, the limited number of applicable modern judicial 
</p>
<p>remedies, the lack of public awareness of such remedies, and the weakness of national 
</p>
<p>policies to prevent incitement to hatred were identified as contributing factors to low levels 
</p>

<p>of prosecution.23 In the Americas, judicial decisions have been made in Argentina, Brazil, 
</p>
<p>Canada, Colombia, Peru and the United States of America, but none has been made in 
</p>
<p>Central America or in the Caribbean.24 
</p>
<p><b> B. Negative/stereotyped portrayal and lack of representation of minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups in the media  
</b></p>
<p>62. Minorities are often portrayed in a stereotyped manner in the media, through broad 
</p>
<p>generalizations of perceived characteristics of the group as a whole, which, in many cases, 
</p>
<p>are negative or derogatory. The repeated presentation of broad negative stereotypes of 
</p>
<p>minority groups, as, for example, criminals, violent, untrustworthy, disloyal, alien or dirty, 
</p>
<p>nurtures inaccurate and false assumptions and opinions that may eventually develop into 
</p>
<p>discriminatory attitudes and entrenched prejudices. Stereotypes may have the objective of 
</p>
<p>or result in stigmatizing and dehumanizing whole communities.  
</p>
<p>63. There is a broad spectrum of either deliberate or unintentional negative stereotyping 
</p>
<p>of minority groups in the media, ranging from emphasis on the ethnic or religious 
</p>
<p>background of a person responsible for an offence or repeated association of derogatory and 
</p>
<p>dangerous characteristics with specific groups, to the most virulent attacks against minority 
</p>
<p>members, which commonly highlight alleged differences between &#8220;us&#8221; versus &#8220;them&#8221;. In 
</p>
<p>some cases, there is direct incitement to violence. Such negative portrayals may reinforce 
</p>
<p>entrenched views of ethnic or religious minorities as &#8220;others&#8221; and perpetuate ideas of 
</p>
<p>structural disadvantage and inequality, as they fail to present a broader and more accurate 
</p>
<p>representation of the situation and challenges faced by minority groups.25 
</p>
<p>64. Studies26 reveal that poor reporting by the media on features such as ethnicity and 
</p>
<p>religion involves, inter alia, labelling, selected use of data, generalizing incidents, negative 
</p>
<p>stereotyping, giving one side of a story, use of derogatory words, mixing facts and views, 
</p>
<p>absence of fact checking, and mismatching of the content of the text and headlines, images 
</p>
<p>and sound. Lack of knowledge about ethnic and religious issues by media reporters, 
</p>
<p>absence of in-house training, poor financial situation of media outlets, heavy workload and 
</p>
<p>scarce time to prepare reports were highlighted as obstacles to good, unprejudiced 
</p>
<p>reporting.  
</p>
<p>65. Pluralistic media is key to providing independent and objective information as it 
</p>
<p>incorporates diverse viewpoints. Media diversity not only refers to the existence of varied 
</p>
<p>media outlets but to the access to mass media by minority groups, as well as to the 
</p>
<p>existence of a plurality of viewpoints within media outlets. Underrepresentation of 
</p>
<p>minorities in the media means that their voices and influence are absent to counter negative 
</p>
<p>expressions. Minorities face numerous challenges both in their access to and representation 
</p>
<p>in the media.

<p>66. There are few statistics available about representation of minorities in media organs 
</p>
<p>due to the lack of disaggregated data. One study in the United Kingdom confirmed a gross 
</p>
<p>imbalance between white and ethnic minority journalists in relation to training and 
</p>
<p>employment patterns and opportunities within the news media. Only 0.5 per cent of 
</p>
<p>national newspaper journalists and only 0.2 per cent of provincial press journalists were 
</p>
<p>Black or Asian. In the broadcasting industry, an estimated 2.7 per cent of editorial staff 
</p>
<p>were Black or Asian. While equal opportunities policies, ethnic minority monitoring and 
</p>
<p>training schemes of the BBC have helped, half of all Black staff work on black-only radio 
</p>
<p>and television programmes.27 
</p>
<p>67. Access by minority groups to the media in many countries is limited or completely 
</p>
<p>restricted. Persons belonging to linguistic minorities are typically disadvantaged in the 
</p>
<p>media marketplace, and the resulting lack of linguistic plurality within the media has been 
</p>
<p>referred to as &#8220;soft assimilation&#8221;, in that the only available media is in the language of the 
</p>
<p>majority, which fails to reflect minority needs, preferences and issues. 
</p>
<p>68. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its general 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 35 (2013) on combating racist hate speech, stressed the importance of 
</p>
<p>media pluralism to counter racist hate speech and highlighted that it entails &#8220;facilitation of 
</p>
<p>access to and ownership of media by minority, indigenous and other groups &#8230;, including 
</p>
<p>media in their own languages&#8221; (para. 41). Representation of minority groups in the media is 
</p>
<p>a crucial means to promote the participation of minorities in society and to incorporate 
</p>
<p>pluralistic approaches. The Council of Europe has stressed the fundamental role of minority 
</p>
<p>media in both playing a mediating role between communities and providing access to 
</p>
<p>minority networks and to alternative sources of information. 
</p>
<p>69. While minority media can fulfil an important role in preserving language, culture 
</p>
<p>and minority identity, it has very limited potential to balance negative stereotyping, 
</p>
<p>stigmatization, homogenization or fight back against hate speech emanating from 
</p>
<p>mainstream media. This is partly due to the fact that minority media tends to be accessed by 
</p>
<p>minority audiences and messages broadcast by them are often regarded as inferior by the 
</p>
<p>society at large, compared to differing majority media viewpoints. 
</p>
<p>70. Representation of minority groups in mainstream media is essential to ensure 
</p>
<p>diversity in content and in the make-up and structures of media bodies themselves. 
</p>
<p>However, this is hindered by the constant struggle of media organs to survive in 
</p>
<p>competitive marketplaces where priorities are to reach maximum audiences and advertisers. 
</p>
<p>The perception is that those goals can be best achieved by catering to the needs and 
</p>
<p>interests of majority populations, so minority interests, voices and opinions tend be 
</p>
<p>marginalized.28 The recruitment of journalists and media workers with diverse ethnic, 
</p>
<p>religious and linguistic backgrounds in today&#8217;s multicultural societies is a pressing need to 
</p>
<p>achieve a more objective and &#8220;stereotype-free&#8221; media. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Structural inequalities 
</b></p>
<p>71. Some scholars consider the right to freedom of expression as absolute, suggesting 
</p>
<p>that democratic societies should not permit the exclusion of any views, even if they are 
</p>
<p>offensive or inflammatory. Such theories often fail to recognize the fundamental existence 
</p>

</p>

<p>of structural inequalities in society, which make some more vulnerable, including to attack, 
</p>
<p>whether verbal or physical. Many examples from different regions demonstrate the 
</p>
<p>connection between hate speech and violence and that there are legitimate grounds to limit 
</p>
<p>freedom of speech when it is motivated by or seeks to incite racial, religious or other forms 
</p>
<p>of hatred.  
</p>
<p>72. It is difficult to talk about upholding the values of democracy and equality if certain 
</p>
<p>groups are completely excluded from participating in or shaping that democracy in practice. 
</p>
<p>If marginalized communities lack access to public platforms and communication channels, 
</p>
<p>they have no possibilities to influence public opinion or to seek and obtain justice. Roma 
</p>
<p>communities struggle to respond to hate speech in mass media from far-right groups and 
</p>
<p>political parties, since Roma are almost completely excluded from mainstream media 
</p>
<p>platforms. Where communities are regarded as inferior in any society, their voices will also 
</p>
<p>be treated as inferior, regardless of how loudly they shout and how valid their concerns. 
</p>
<p>73. Action to address hate speech and hate crime must engage majority communities, 
</p>
<p>including politicians, intellectuals, celebrities and ordinary people concerned about hatred 
</p>
<p>in their societies, to join marginalized and disadvantaged minorities in demanding human 
</p>
<p>rights, equality and human dignity for all. Such coordinated struggle must include 
</p>
<p>legislative steps, but also requires swift and efficient social responses. If hate incidents are 
</p>
<p>not tackled early, targeted groups may experience permanent damage to their self-esteem 
</p>
<p>and sense of belonging within their societies, thereby increasing their marginalization. 
</p>
<p>Majority communities may also gradually become desensitized to hate speech, to the point 
</p>
<p>where they begin to accept the hostility and stigmatization against certain groups in their 
</p>
<p>societies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Changing media landscape 
</b></p>
<p>74. Media, in all its diverse forms, is an essential component of today&#8217;s societies, 
</p>
<p>providing huge benefits and possibilities, including in the field of minority issues and inter-
</p>
<p>faith or intercommunity cohesion. Media offers immediacy in communication and 
</p>
<p>exchange of information, often in different languages and representing different ethnic, 
</p>
<p>religious and cultural viewpoints, which can reach all audiences.  
</p>
<p>75. The format of the media environment has undergone a dramatic transformation to 
</p>
<p>host Internet and online media platforms, allowing live interaction and more rapid outreach 
</p>
<p>worldwide. In the digital age, media has also widened its scope to include social media, 
</p>
<p>where people share and/or exchange information, ideas and initiatives across vast national 
</p>
<p>and international networks and virtual communities. New forms of online media which 
</p>
<p>allow those who advocate hate speech or cyberhate to easily access large audiences are 
</p>
<p>subject to less regulation than traditional media and provide anonymity to those who wish 
</p>
<p>to exploit it.  
</p>
<p>76. While digital media has provided new spaces for minority groups to participate in 
</p>
<p>the public debate, the accessibility, rapidness and relative anonymity provided by the 
</p>
<p>Internet also provide fertile ground for spreading hateful content. Hate speech on the 
</p>
<p>Internet adopts many forms and is disseminated through different digital platforms29 &#8212; 
</p>
<p>from highly organized hate groups which recruit, radicalize and instruct followers to attack 
</p>
<p>targeted groups; the issuing of &#8220;hit lists&#8221; containing calls for violence against individuals; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;cyberbullying&#8221;, which targets primarily youth and often originates from racial, ethnic or 
</p>
<p>religious bias; dissemination of propaganda, misinformation and hate spam; exchange of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 29 Ibid. </p>


<p>information and ideas via social media networks, discussion groups, listservs and 
</p>
<p>communities of interest.30 
</p>
<p>77. The anonymity of the Internet poses particular challenges when it comes to tracking 
</p>
<p>and prosecuting the authors of content that might incite hatred and violence. Material can 
</p>
<p>be shared worldwide and hosted by Internet service providers (ISPs) subject to various 
</p>
<p>legislations with diverse degrees of protection against hate speech. Racist hate websites are 
</p>
<p>commonly hosted in jurisdictions considered favourable to or tolerant of hate speech and 
</p>
<p>can easily relocate to another permissive jurisdiction if blocked or banned.  
</p>
<p>78. Given that social media platforms are mostly self-regulating and therefore dependent 
</p>
<p>on reporting by users of material perceived as hateful or harmful, their content can be 
</p>
<p>accessible until it is ultimately flagged by community members as material contravening 
</p>
<p>the site&#8217;s guidelines. In addition to legislative and jurisdictional challenges, there are 
</p>
<p>technical difficulties involved in removing hate-inciting material from the Internet. 
</p>
<p>79. Online media and communication platforms make it easier for extremist groups to 
</p>
<p>organize themselves, even transnationally. In Europe, anti-immigrant populist radical-right 
</p>
<p>political parties increased their representation in the European Parliament from only 8 per 
</p>
<p>cent in 2009 to close to 15 per cent in the 2014 election. This rise of ethno-nationalist right-
</p>
<p>wing parties is also a consequence of the trend towards less extreme &#8220;hate&#8221; language and 
</p>
<p>more sophisticated and &#8220;moderate&#8221; manifestations of far-right messages which appeal to a 
</p>
<p>wider group of voters, resulting in their having a bigger impact on mainstream society.31  
</p>
<p><b> V. Good practices for addressing and responding to hate speech 
and incitement to hatred in the media 
</b></p>
<p>80. Despite the countless examples of hate speech and incitement to hatred against 
</p>
<p>minorities in the media today, there are also many measures and initiatives involving and 
</p>
<p>implemented by the media to contest hateful speech and incitement to hatred, and counter 
</p>
<p>its pernicious effects.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Education and media literacy 
</b></p>
<p>81. Human rights education as well as education for respect of diversity is of paramount 
</p>
<p>importance to fostering a tolerant society, but is not sufficient: it must be complemented by 
</p>
<p>education on the responsible use of the Internet and social media by citizens, particularly 
</p>
<p>children and young people, so as to counter hate speech exposure and minimize other risks, 
</p>
<p>such as cyberbullying. Several relevant initiatives to promote media literacy are led by 
</p>
<p>States, international organizations and civil society, such as those presented below. 
</p>
<p>82. In 2012, the Council of Europe launched the &#8220;No hate speech movement&#8221;,32 a 
</p>
<p>campaign directed towards youth with the objective of combating online hate speech in all 
</p>
<p>its forms. The campaign is part of the project &#8220;Young People Combating Hate Speech

<p>83. The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, established in 2005, is a United 
</p>
<p>Nations entity tasked to assist in diminishing hostility and promoting harmony among 
</p>
<p>nations in order to prevent conflict and promote social cohesion. The Alliance has engaged 
</p>
<p>in media and information literacy initiatives to teach media consumers how to critically 
</p>
<p>interpret information received. Those initiatives include a media and information literacy 
</p>
<p>clearing house (milunesco.unaoc.org), the creation of a global network of universities, and 
</p>
<p>the coordination of workshops for educators and publications. 
</p>
<p>84. In April 2014, Rwanda Media High Council, in partnership with the African Media 
</p>
<p>Initiative and the Ethical Journalism Network, launched the campaign &#8220;Turning the Page of 
</p>
<p>Hate Media in Africa&#8221;, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the genocide. The campaign 
</p>
<p>aims to promote ethical, tolerant and inclusive journalism, good media governance and 
</p>
<p>responsible communications through the open information landscape, and includes a 
</p>
<p>guideline document to test for hate speech in journalism practices. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Establishment of specialized institutions 
</b></p>
<p>85. Dedicated institutional attention to minority issues, including monitoring and 
</p>
<p>responding to hatred targeted against minorities, is essential to prevent atrocities and 
</p>
<p>reinforce unity and stability. This is even more important following violence or conflict, as 
</p>
<p>part of transitional justice and reconciliation processes.  
</p>
<p>86. During the disputed presidential elections in Kenya in 2007, violence, triggered by 
</p>
<p>hate speech and incitement to hatred by political and religious leaders in the media, left 
</p>
<p>more than 1,000 people dead and half a million displaced. As a result, Kenya established 
</p>
<p>the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, tasked to promote ethnic harmony and 
</p>
<p>investigate complaints of ethnic or racial discrimination or any issue affecting ethnic and 
</p>
<p>racial relations. The Commission has been tackling hate speech through action, including 
</p>
<p>the development of guidelines for media outlets, training manuals for law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers, workshops and conferences.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Promotion of ethical standards, regulatory bodies and participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of minorities in media outlets 
</b></p>
<p>87. Media outlets can actively engage in fighting incitement to hatred and violence in 
</p>
<p>the media by adopting principles and guidelines of ethical and responsible journalism to 
</p>
<p>improve the quality of information and reporting to avoid bias, prejudice and manipulation, 
</p>
<p>as well as by promoting diversity among media workers and investing in adequate training 
</p>
<p>for media professionals. 
</p>
<p>88. In April 2014, the International Federation of Journalists adopted the &#8220;Brussels 
</p>
<p>Declaration&#8221;33 to combat incitement to hate and violence through media. The Declaration 
</p>
<p>made recommendations to journalists and their unions aimed at upholding the principles 
</p>
<p>and ethics of responsible journalism, including denouncing incitement to hatred whenever 
</p>
<p>identified, ensuring knowledge of codes and guidelines by media workers, promoting 
</p>
<p>education and training of journalists as well as encouraging diversity in media outlets. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 33 See www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/backpid/191/article/ifj-conference-agrees-declaration-to-stand-
</p>
<p>up-against-hate-speech/. </p>


<p>89. Ethics codes play an important role in guiding press workers on how to report 
</p>
<p>objectively and responsibly. The Press Ethics Code of Benin emphasizes that &#8220;Journalists 
</p>
<p>must refuse to publish any incitement to tribal, racial and religious hatred. They must make 
</p>
<p>a stand against all forms of discrimination&#8221; (art. 10). Singapore&#8217;s Internet Code of Practice 
</p>
<p>considers as prohibited material that &#8220;glorifies, incites or endorses ethnic, racial or religious 
</p>
<p>hatred, strife or intolerance&#8221; (art. 4 (2)(g)). 
</p>
<p>90. Independent regulatory bodies, such as media watchdogs, councils and ombudsmen, 
</p>
<p>monitor media reporting, identify and report on hateful content and reinforce ethical 
</p>
<p>standards. However, regulatory media bodies must not unduly censor media sources and 
</p>
<p>must comply with international standards. The Press Council in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
</p>
<p>monitors the application of the Press Code and the investigation of complaints. In 2014, in 
</p>
<p>the context of the general elections campaign, it launched the campaign &#8220;STOP! Hate 
</p>
<p>Speech!&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>91. Several self-regulatory media bodies have started to operate in Africa, some of them 
</p>
<p>in countries with a history of hate speech and incitement to violence against minority 
</p>
<p>groups. The Rwanda Media Commission was established in 2013 with the mandate to 
</p>
<p>promote ethical journalism, defend media freedom and adjudicate complaints against the 
</p>
<p>media; some commentators have alleged censorship and serious restrictions on media 
</p>
<p>freedoms.  
</p>
<p>92. Media self-regulatory bodies in the Americas include the Ethics Committee of the 
</p>
<p>Journalism National Council in Panama.34 The Committee brings together journalists, 
</p>
<p>media owners, civil society, academics and the Office of the Ombudsman and receives and 
</p>
<p>responds to complaints about journalism practices. 
</p>
<p>93. Participation of minorities in the media landscape encompasses the possibility for 
</p>
<p>minority professionals to work in media outlets. Some media outlets have developed 
</p>
<p>specific programmes and internships to recruit and train minority media workers in order to 
</p>
<p>promote ethnic diversity in the newsrooms and press offices. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Civil society initiatives to address hate speech 
</b></p>
<p>94. Civil society organizations have developed innovative approaches and actions to 
</p>
<p>combat hate in the media, including the Internet. Those actions include identifying hate 
</p>
<p>trends, tracking and monitoring hate speech websites, notifying potentially affected or 
</p>
<p>targeted communities about hate activities, working closely with Internet providers and 
</p>
<p>governmental agencies to report hateful content and providing online educational materials 
</p>
<p>and training programmes. 
</p>
<p>95. Studio Ijambo was launched in 1995 by the organization Search for Common 
</p>
<p>Ground to address inter-ethnic violence in Burundi. The programme aimed to establish a 
</p>
<p>platform to promote dialogue and tolerance through radio, in contrast to hate speech and 
</p>
<p>incitement in radio programmes in neighbouring Rwanda. The station uses different 
</p>
<p>formats, including debates and discussion programmes, soap operas, sketches and 
</p>
<p>interactions between political leaders and youth, for example. Twenty years on, the model 
</p>
<p>is considered a success and has been replicated in other African countries, including the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, where radio has been used to promote constructive 
</p>
<p>messages about conflict resolution.

<p>96. The Umati project in Kenya emerged out of concern that mobile and digital 
</p>
<p>technologies had played a catalyzing role in the 2007&#8211;2008 post-election violence in the 
</p>
<p>country. The project seeks to better understand the use of dangerous speech in Kenyan 
</p>
<p>online space, by monitoring blogs, forums, online newspapers, Facebook and Twitter. From 
</p>
<p>October 2012 to November 2013, over 7,000 incidents of hate speech in English and local 
</p>
<p>languages were identified. They were shared with other Kenyan organizations responsible 
</p>
<p>for countering hate speech. 
</p>
<p>97. The Panzagar Movement (&#8220;flower speech campaign&#8221;) in Myanmar was initiated in 
</p>
<p>April 2014 by a Burmese blogger and human rights activist concerned by hate speech 
</p>
<p>against Muslim citizens in social media. The Movement was launched under the slogan 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s moderate our speech to prevent hatred among human beings&#8221; and is actively 
</p>
<p>engaged in social networks. 
</p>
<p>98. Norikoe Net is a Japan-based group working to overcome hate speech and racism, 
</p>
<p>often targeted against Koreans, in Japan. The group joined forces with others to collectively 
</p>
<p>counter racism and hate speech by organizing anti-hate speech events and protests and 
</p>
<p>pushing for the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation in Japan.  
</p>
<p>99. Some initiatives seek to involve ISPs in combating online hate speech, by 
</p>
<p>advocating the implementation of reporting mechanisms for illegal material posted on their 
</p>
<p>services, identifying hateful content that violates the terms of service or code of conduct of 
</p>
<p>the ISPs and requesting the ISPs concerned to remove it. The Anti-Defamation League 
</p>
<p>(ADL) has been actively involved in combating online hate speech through close 
</p>
<p>collaboration with ISPs as well as law enforcement agencies, and providing training 
</p>
<p>resources and educational materials on hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>100. Civil society organizations have formed networks to combat cyberhate, lobby for 
</p>
<p>international legislation against discrimination on the Internet and exchange information 
</p>
<p>and best practices. The International Network Against CyberHate (INACH) comprises 15 
</p>
<p>organizations from different countries with the purpose of uniting and empowering 
</p>
<p>organizations to promote respect, responsibility and citizenship on the Internet through 
</p>
<p>countering cyberhate and raising awareness about online discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Hatred is often constructed, fuelled, maintained and directed by certain 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals or groups against other individuals and communities who are different in 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnicity, language or religion from the dominant majority, often for political reasons 
</b></p>
<p><b>or owing to long-standing and entrenched discrimination. Hateful messages may fall 
</b></p>
<p><b>on particularly fertile ground where there are wider social, economic or political 
</b></p>
<p><b>problems or divisions in society. The root causes of hatred often lie beyond purely 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic or religious difference and must be better understood.</b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>It is essential to recognize how, in the longer term, hate speech and incitement 
</b></p>
<p><b>can endanger social cohesion and create or deepen intercommunal divides and 
</b></p>
<p><b>tensions. Action to address hate speech and hate crime must engage majority 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, including politicians, intellectuals, celebrities and ordinary people 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned about discrimination and hatred in their societies, to join marginalized and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged minorities in demanding human rights, equality and human dignity for 
</b></p>
<p><b>all. Such coordinated action must include legislative steps and swift and efficient social 
</b></p>
<p><b>responses. If hate incidents are not tackled quickly and effectively, targeted groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>may experience permanent damage to their self-esteem and sense of belonging within 
</b></p>
<p><b>their societies, increasing their marginalization. Majority communities may gradually 
</b></p>
<p><b>become desensitized to the hostility in their societies targeted against minority groups. </b> </p>


<p>103. <b>Traditional and contemporary media have enormous potential to foster 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge, understanding and acceptance of diversity. Media can also be misused as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>forum for stigmatization, discrimination, exclusion and, in the worst cases, incitement 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violence. Contemporary media, particularly new digital media, due to its 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediacy, universal scope, accessibility, interactive nature and the difficulty of 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulating it, have become accessible platforms for spreading hate speech. </b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>Several factors influence the extent and prevalence of hate speech in the media, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the absence of or unclear legislation on incitement to hatred, negative and 
</b></p>
<p><b>stereotyped portrayal of minorities, limited access and representation of minorities in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the media, structural inequalities, the changing media landscape and the emerging 
</b></p>
<p><b>and more organized forms of extremist and populists movements. </b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to adopt domestic legislation, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conformity with article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</b></p>
<p>prohibiting any &#8220;advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
</p>
<p>incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>106. <b>Legislation must fully respect the right to freedom of speech and expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>and avoid any arbitrary or abusive interpretation of anti-hate speech laws. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should establish proportionate thresholds for the assessment of forms of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>which may amount to incitement to hatred, including careful consideration, on a case-
</b></p>
<p><b>by-case basis, of the context, speaker, intent, content, extent or magnitude and 
</b></p>
<p><b>likelihood or probability of harm occurring. Legislation prohibiting incitement to 
</b></p>
<p><b>hatred should provide effective and adequate remedies to victims, including civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies for damages, and guarantee the right of correction and reply.</b> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to adopt the Rabat Plan of Action 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
</b></p>
<p><b>incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence when implementing or revising their 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic legal framework on hate speech.</b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that there are several non-legal ways and 
</b></p>
<p><b>means to tackle hate speech. Public condemnation of hate speech by political leaders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>parliamentarians, party members, other public figures and community leaders can 
</b></p>
<p><b>shape public perceptions and contribute to unity and social cohesion. Democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties need to find effective tools and outreach strategies to counterbalance 
</b></p>
<p><b>hate messages spread by extremist forces and parties. </b> 
</p>
<p>109. <b>The establishment of institutions dedicated to minority issues, with mandates to 
</b></p>
<p><b>train, monitor and act on issues relevant to intercommunal relations and harmony, 
</b></p>
<p><b>objective portrayal of and peace between diverse population groups, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding relevant threats, such as incitement to religious or racial hatred, is 
</b></p>
<p><b>desirable. </b> 
</p>
<p>110. <b>Media outlets should maintain the highest standards of ethical journalism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>avoid stereotyping of individuals and groups and report in a factual and impartial 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner. Media outlets should adopt codes of ethics and conduct for the exercise and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of ethical standards. The participation of minority professionals in media 
</b></p>
<p><b>outlets in all roles and levels is essential to ensuring objective and non-stereotypical 
</b></p>
<p><b>portrayal of minorities. Media outlets should implement programmes to train, recruit 
</b></p>
<p><b>and support media workers belonging to minority groups. </b> 
</p>
<p>111. <b>Specific training in minority issues should be provided to media professionals 
</b></p>
<p><b>by media outlets to help journalists improve coverage and produce accurate, in-depth 
</b></p>
<p><b>and informed reporting on minority-related issues.</b> </p>


<p>112. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the establishment of national, independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulatory bodies, including representatives of minorities, with powers to monitor 
</b></p>
<p><b>hate speech in the media, receive reports from the public in relation to hate speech, 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive and support complaints, and make recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p>113. <b>While recognizing the technical and operational difficulties in combating online 
</b></p>
<p><b>hate speech, the Special Rapporteur encourages States to take specific measures, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including specialized training of law enforcement bodies and prosecutors, to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>hate crimes and incitement to hatred on the Internet, and to exchange information 
</b></p>
<p><b>and best practices at the international level. </b> 
</p>
<p>114. <b>Internet service providers (ISPs) should establish detailed terms of service, 
</b></p>
<p><b>guidelines and notice-and-takedown procedures regarding hate speech and 
</b></p>
<p><b>incitement, in line with national legislation and international standards, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent implementation of those polices. The Special Rapporteur encourages ISPs 
</b></p>
<p><b>to collaborate with government and civil society organizations to combat hate speech, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including providing adequate channels for the reporting of illegal hateful content 
</b></p>
<p><b>posted on their services.</b> 
</p>
<p>115. <b>Education to promote intercultural understanding, mutual respect and 
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerance among population groups is essential to eliminating stereotypes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prejudices against minority communities. Human rights education should be an 
</b></p>
<p><b>important part of school curricula, which should also include the history, culture and 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditions of minority groups as well as their important contribution to enriching our 
</b></p>
<p><b>societies.</b> 
</p>
<p>116. <b>Media literacy is essential to providing youth and adults with adequate tools 
</b></p>
<p><b>and resources to develop critical thinking in order to question the accuracy, bias and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact of the information provided by the media. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that States include key functions of media literacy in school curricula at 
</b></p>
<p><b>all stages with special focus on the online environment.</b> 
</p>
<p>117. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commendable work of civil society in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducting public-awareness campaigns to combat hate speech, including on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Internet. She encourages States to work collaboratively with and support those 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations and projects, including providing financial support.</b>
