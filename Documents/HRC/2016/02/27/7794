<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 
22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Tuvalu was held at the 6th meeting on 24 April 
</p><p>2013. The delegation of Tuvalu was headed by Eselealofa Apinelu, Attorney General. At its 
10th meeting held on 26 April 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Tuvalu. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Tuvalu: Estonia, Mauritania and the Republic 
of Korea. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Tuvalu: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/TUV/1 and Corr.1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/TUV/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/TUV/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Liechtenstein, Mexico, Montenegro, the 
Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland was transmitted to Tuvalu through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 6th meeting, on 24 April 2013, Ms. Apinelu, Attorney General, presented the 
national report and made an opening statement. She affirmed the commitment of Tuvalu to 
UPR and expressed appreciation to those who had provided support in the preparation of 
the State report. 
</p>
<p>6. The Head of the Delegation started her intervention by referring to the specific 
vulnerabilities that Tuvalu, as a small island State, had to face, namely the threat of the 
adverse impacts of climate change and sea-level rise, as well as the lack of capacity. The 
impact of globalization was overwhelming and the global financial crisis, together with the 
physical and social character of the country, had seriously undermined the country&#8217;s ability 
to provide essential services to its people. The continuing loss of vital land, destruction of 
food crops and contamination of the ground-water supply by seawater intrusion were 
everyday challenges that affected the competing interests and priority needs of the 
Government and that seriously undermined the capacity of Tuvalu to protect fundamental 
human rights and to particularly fully implement economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The cultural traditions of Tuvalu and its community interests preserved harmony and 
peace in the country and influenced the behaviour of society and the management of the 
island community. To that extent, governance was assured through the <i>falekaupule</i>, the 
traditional house of the island chiefs and elders. </p>


<p>8. Despite the above-mentioned situations, Tuvalu expressed its commitment to protect 
human rights and to meet its obligations on human rights, while noting that many 
commitments were dependent on the availability of financial and technical resources. In 
that regard, the advantages of the UPR process were welcomed, particularly the fact that it 
allowed Tuvalu to take stock of the human rights protection and permitted the Government 
to inform the international community of its human rights situation and to engage with 
other countries regarding the improvement of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. With the aim of answering the advance questions received, the Head of the 
Delegation explained that, despite the fact that Tuvalu had not fully implemented all the 
supported recommendations of the last review, it had addressed human rights matters of 
significant relevance for the country, by mainly using the Te Kakeega II (National Strategic 
Development Plan). Some of the key national priorities identified in the National Strategic 
Development Plan were: education, health, establishment of the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Commission, gender-equality promotion, expansion of women&#8217;s role in development, 
youths&#8217; participation in sports, promotion of traditional knowledge and culture, local 
governance and community development, revision of labour-related legislation, access to 
safe drinking water, housing availability and mitigation of the impacts on agriculture of 
climate change. 
</p>
<p>10. She also highlighted some progresses made related to Tuvalu&#8217;s human rights 
commitments, such as the reporting to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; the support of the visit of 
the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; the support 
of the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the 
accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; the inclusion of gender 
in government planning; and the visibility given to climate change issues. 
</p>
<p>11. Tuvalu noted, however, several challenges and constraints in the implementation of 
recommendations and the overall human rights commitments, mainly the funding 
constraints, resource availability and opportunity, which denied the outer islands the 
opportunity to participate actively. The impacts of climate change and sea-level rise; the 
lack of internal capacity, financial support, human resources and understanding of the 
United Nations human rights conventions, were likewise recognized as constraints on 
implementing the UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>12. Tuvalu mentioned that its plans for implementing the recommendations of the 
Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation would be 
finalized upon receiving the final report from the Special Rapporteur. However, the 
Government was working to ensure a priority to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation facilities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. Tuvalu reported that the Government was considering supporting the ratification of 
core human rights treaties but discussions were ongoing given the country&#8217;s capacity 
</p>
<p>constraints and the responsibility attached to the implementation of such treaties. 
</p>
<p>14. Likewise, regarding the questions received on legislative compliance, the 
Government was seeking financial and technical assistance from the international 
community. In that regard, with the assistance of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, 
Tuvalu was considering facilitating a legislative compliance review of national laws and a 
cost benefit analysis before ratifying specific treaties. The Government had already 
endorsed accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, however.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. On women&#8217;s rights and traditional practices, domestic violence was the main form 
of violence against women in Tuvalu. The CEDAW National Taskforce was giving more 
attention to this issue and the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill was awaiting 
community consultations in all islands before resubmission to Cabinet for consulting in </p>


<p>Parliament. Furthermore, in 2009 the Parliament passed the Police Powers and Duties Act, 
which made domestic violence a criminal offence, recognized that domestic violence was 
not a private issue and specifically mandated the Police to respond to domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>16. While acknowledging the inconsistency of the country&#8217;s domestic laws and cultural 
and traditional practices on the treatment of women&#8217;s rights, the Department of Women 
</p>
<p>Affairs aimed to use cultural realities to challenge harmful cultural practices. Furthermore, 
the Department of Women had increased the advocacy and lobbying on temporary special 
measures, especially in decision-making at the local and national level, and was also 
lobbying to support the amendment of the Constitution to prohibit sex and gender 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>17. The Head of the Delegation expressed that people with different sexual orientation 
did not suffer social discrimination but the question of legal protection in the law was 
controversial and would need to be carefully considered. Tuvalu was open to discussion. 
</p>
<p>18. Tuvalu noted that consultations were ongoing with a view to amending the 
Constitution once there was wider understanding and acceptance of gender equality. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government was progressively realizing the recommendation to amend the 
legislation to include a safeguard against statelessness. 
</p>
<p>20. Tuvalu reiterated its commitment to protect the human rights of its people, for which 
purpose it requested relevant assistance in its effort to fulfil its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 38 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in chapter II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>22. Maldives acknowledged significant developments since 2008 and appreciated efforts 
to address violence against women and the formulation of the Family Protection and 
Domestic Violence Bill. It recognized the need for international technical assistance and 
financial support to fully realize its first-cycle recommendations, as well as capacity-
building and awareness-raising. It acknowledged water scarcity and urged the consideration 
of the report from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation as the basis for advancement. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Mexico acknowledged the strengthening of human rights despite the challenges 
faced by Tuvalu. It welcomed cooperation with special procedures and the visit from 
Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It expressed a 
hope to see a law on water adopted as soon as possible. It welcomed the report submitted 
on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It encouraged the ongoing work to include 
prohibition of discrimination based on sex and gender in the Constitution. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Montenegro acknowledged the limited capacities of Tuvalu and encouraged the 
United Nations to provide specific assistance for the ratification of more human rights 
treaties. It recognized the importance of a plan of action as recommended by the Special 
Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It expressed concern 
over disadvantaged position of women in some fields. It requested information on steps to 
amend the Constitution and to incorporate principles of equality and prohibition of sex- and 
gender-based discrimination into legislation. Montenegro made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Morocco recognized the challenges to the full realization of social, economic and 
cultural rights faced by Tuvalu, and commended its efforts to harmonize domestic </p>


<p>legislation with international human rights instruments and implement institutional 
mechanisms to guarantee human rights. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Canada indicated that, in 2008, in response to interventions on freedom of religion 
or belief and freedom of expression relating to discrimination against individuals of certain 
beliefs that stemmed from traditional and customary practices, Tuvalu had recognized that 
there existed a discrepancy between the law and certain traditional practices and expressed 
its commitment to address that matter. Canada requested information on the status of 
current laws and concrete steps taken thereon. It welcomed the formulation of a Family 
Protection Bill and the announcement of the launching of community consultations. Canada 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. New Zealand commended the commitment of Tuvalu to improve the human rights 
protection, including addressing domestic violence, although more remained to be done. 
New Zealand requested information on the steps taken to ensure a mechanism, such as an 
Ombudsman, to investigate allegations of human rights violations. Noting resource 
constraints and geographic challenges, it commended the country&#8217;s efforts in financial 
governance. It noted that health and education services should be prioritized. New Zealand 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>28. Nicaragua recognized that Tuvalu had limited national resources and underscored 
the cooperation shown in hosting the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation. It also expressed hope for the creation of a framework for 
cooperation, bearing in mind the harmful consequences of climate change. It recognized 
efforts to achieve participation by and empowerment of women. It encouraged continued 
efforts to improve equality between men and women. Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>29. Nigeria commended progress in promoting and protecting human rights and in 
ensuring that human rights standards were included in the domestic legislation. It noted the 
efforts of Tuvalu to empower women through its National Women&#8217;s Policy and youth 
through its National Youth Policy. Nigeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Philippines noted the progress of Tuvalu in building the normative framework and 
institutions on human rights and commended the enactment of laws and the establishment 
of government offices such as the People&#8217;s Lawyers Office and the Department of 
Women&#8217;s Affairs. It welcomed the ratification of core human rights instruments. It 
</p>
<p>commended the work on the National Strategic Plan key priorities. It recognized the 
country&#8217;s constraints and supported the appeal to the international community for technical 
assistance. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>31. Senegal noted the integration of international human rights standards into domestic 
legislation. It welcomed the establishment of a special task force to eliminate violence 
against women. Senegal recognized the challenges faced and endorsed the country&#8217;s call for 
technical assistance. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>32. Singapore noted that, despite challenges, Tuvalu had made progress in promoting 
and protecting human rights. It commended steps taken to promote women&#8217;s rights and 
acknowledged the National Women&#8217;s Policy and the Family Protection and Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence Bill. Singapore noted the impact of the climate change on people&#8217;s access to food, 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water, adequate housing and arable land. It recognized the preparation of a 
comprehensive National Adaptation Programme of Action and noted the active engagement 
of international organizations to support its implementation. Singapore made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. The Head of Delegation thanked the distinguished delegates for all the comments 
and welcomed the recommendations provided as a way to improve human rights in Tuvalu. </p>


<p>She stated that Tuvalu would require assistance in order to implement or carry forward 
these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. She referred that the report from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation was most helpful to the country and stated her belief that it 
would form a very good basis for the Government to use and try to fulfil its obligations 
with regard to the matter. 
</p>
<p>35. Concerning protection of women and children and the Family Protection and 
Domestic Violence Bill, the Head of the Delegation reported that consultations with outer 
islands to fully explain the content of the bill to the people and receive their comments were 
hindered by transportation problems. However, she assured that the matter remained a 
priority for the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Prime Minister. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Commission to specifically address human rights 
issues, the Government had implemented the establishment of the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Commission under the Leadership Code to look into breaches of that code with leaders&#8217; 
role in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>37. In relation to other human rights instruments to which Tuvalu was required to sign 
up, all human rights issues were beneficial to the country but it was just a matter of how 
Tuvalu could actively engage and fulfil those commitments given its financial constraints 
and human resources limitations, which obliged Tuvalu to set priorities as to what could 
actually be done in any given year and within current capabilities. 
</p>
<p>38. Women&#8217;s protection was a priority and, in almost every official or non-official 
meeting or gathering, there was an opportunity for women&#8217;s organizations to highlight their 
aims and visions and to seek support from the community in furthering the equality issue. 
However, the process of getting the proposed amendments to the Constitution aimed at 
ensuring a provision on equal treatment on the basis of sex was still under consultation as 
there was not yet clear support from all the islands. Nevertheless, the Department of 
Women&#8217;s Affairs was actively engaged in consulting and trying to ensure that support was 
received for those matters. 
</p>
<p>39. Slovakia recognized the vulnerability of Tuvalu to the impacts of climate change. It 
commended the Education for Life programme providing free and universal primary 
education and the achievement of high literacy rates. It acknowledged the development of 
the Draft Water Act, the Sustainable and Integrated Water and Sanitation policy, the 
establishment of the Department of Women&#8217;s Affairs and the inclusion of women and 
</p>
<p>gender development in the 2005-2015 National Strategic Development Plan. Slovakia made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia noted progress in the human rights commitments and obligations of Tuvalu 
and in the inclusion of human rights standards in domestic legislation. It noted concern at 
violence against women, including domestic violence, from the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It acknowledged the ratification of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 
and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It welcomed the country&#8217;s agreement 
to the 2012 visit from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Spain welcomed the efforts of Tuvalu to fulfil its international obligations and 
underscored the visit from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation. It mentioned the Government&#8217;s decision to reflect on the ratification of core 
human rights instruments and expressed hope that such reflection would be positive. It 
noted the priorities identified in the Second National Strategic Development Plan, including 
gender equality. Spain made recommendations. </p>


<p>42. Thailand welcomed legislation adopted to promote and protect human rights. It 
acknowledged progress in ensuring gender equality and women&#8217;s basic rights but remained 
concerned about reports of domestic violence and stereotyping regarding women&#8217;s role in 
society. It appreciated the submission of the report to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the establishment of a school for children with special needs. It supported child 
rights as a top national agenda. Thailand recognized the constraints and challenges faced by 
Tuvalu and encouraged the international community and OHCHR to provide assistance and 
capacity-building. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Trinidad and Tobago noted the key national human rights priorities of Tuvalu that 
included the promotion of gender equality and the provision of safe drinking water.  It 
commended the work of the Department of Women in collaboration with the United 
Nations Development Programme. It acknowledged the climate-change challenges faced 
and commended the National Adaptation Programme of Action to address such issues. It 
welcomed the visit by the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation to examine the water and sanitation situation in Tuvalu. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Turkey acknowledged positive steps taken to implement the country&#8217;s commitment 
to human rights. It recognized constraints and invited regional and international 
development partners to provide technical and financial assistance. Turkey expressed 
confidence in the successful implementation of the National Strategic Development Plan 
and its prioritization of issues such as the Ombudsman&#8217;s Commission, the promotion of 
gender equality and the role of women in development. It underscored the importance of 
having a national human rights institution. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognized the 
challenges faced by Tuvalu, particularly climate change, and acknowledged the level of 
consultation with civil society. It noted the ratification of just two international human 
rights treaties and encouraged the signature and ratification of other human rights treaties. It 
urged steps to address water and sanitation problems. It emphasized the importance of the 
right to social security and an adequate standard of living. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. The United States of America commended Tuvalu for its 2010 elections. It noted 
and encouraged the participation in the subregional audit support programme. It welcomed 
the increased school attendance by girls and the increased women&#8217;s participation in several 
areas. It expressed condolences at the loss of the Finance Minister and noted the need for a 
by-election. It raised concern over the application of and limitations in the Religious 
Organizations Restriction Act as well as over the illegality of sexual relations between 
males. It strongly supported decriminalizing consensual sexual relations between adults. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Uruguay expressed appreciation for the country&#8217;s efforts and commitment to the 
UPR process. It highlighted the legislative advances and institutional reforms made, which 
had helped towards fulfilling some of the previous UPR recommendations, despite the 
constraints and challenges facing Tuvalu. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Concerning the efforts of Tuvalu to ratify core human rights treaties, the Head of the 
Delegation reiterated that assistance had been requested from the Pacific Islands Forum 
Secretariat to carry out a legislative review of the laws. From having ratified two human 
rights treaties, Tuvalu had realized of the obligations that came with signing up to 
international conventions. Tuvalu supported the idea of ratifying all core human rights 
treaties but it must make sure that it was in a position to fulfil what it was bound to do once 
an international convention was ratified. </p>


<p>49. Tuvalu reiterated its commitment with the special procedures and specifically 
acknowledged the assistance that Tuvalu could get from the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>50. With reference to the country laws and traditional practices, which seemed to be in 
conflict with international law, that was a matter which continued consultations between the 
relevant authorities and the traditional assemblies on each island. 
</p>
<p>51. The Religious Organizations Restrictions Act was the Government&#8217;s first attempt to 
facilitate dialogue between people who wanted to exercise freedom of religion and the 
country&#8217;s traditional practices. It was the first law forbidding island communities from 
stopping anyone from sharing religious beliefs. The starting point of the law was to allow 
people to come in and explain and share their religious beliefs. Consultations were 
continuing, not just on religion but also on women&#8217;s issues, between traditional leaders, 
</p>
<p>decision makers, relevant government authorities, non-governmental organizations and 
civil society. 
</p>
<p>52. Viet Nam noted the remarkable progress made by Tuvalu since its first UPR in 
ensuring that human rights were included in national legislation. It highlighted the drafting 
and implementation of several important acts, such as on Constitutional amendment, the 
Leadership Code, police powers and duties, public enterprises and environmental 
protection. As a developing country, Viet Nam shared the constraints and challenges faced 
by Tuvalu in implementing its human rights obligations. It called upon the international 
community to support Tuvalu. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Algeria, while acknowledging the challenges facing Tuvalu, noted the positive 
developments since its previous review, particularly the inclusion of international human 
rights standards into national legislation; measures in favour of persons with disabilities; 
and the adoption of the National Women&#8217;s Policy, the draft National Youth Policy and the 
</p>
<p>Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill. It echoed the request for technical and 
financial assistance to implement the country&#8217;s national priorities. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Australia commended the Police Service Act and the Police Powers and Duties Act 
and noted that changes to police legislation aligned with the International Covenants on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights 
(ICESCR). It was concerned about the delay in setting a date for a by-election in the 
electorate of Nukufetau and urged elections to be held to ensure representation of all 
Tuvaluans in Parliament. Australia acknowledged progress on gender equality and 
welcomed the engagement with the International Criminal Court. Australia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Azerbaijan congratulated the cooperation of Tuvalu with United Nations 
mechanisms and welcomed its readiness to accede to the core international human rights 
treaties. It noted efforts to ensure gender mainstreaming and women&#8217;s empowerment and to 
</p>
<p>combat domestic violence, as well as the adoption of the Police Powers and Duties Act. It 
was aware of the constraints faced by Tuvalu in the promotion and protection of human 
rights and the negative impact of climate change, and highlighted the need for support on 
the implementation of its human rights obligations. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Brazil expressed appreciation for Tuvalu&#8217;s commitment to the establishment of a 
national human rights institution; its openness to cooperation with its international partners 
in the sphere of human rights; its achievements in awareness-raising; and the impressive 
work carried out by the People&#8217;s Lawyers Office in the field of access to justice. All such 
</p>
<p>advances were a token of the unswerving commitment of Tuvalu to human rights, despite 
the social, economic and environmental challenges faced. Brazil made recommendations. </p>


<p>57. The Netherlands welcomed the National Women&#8217;s Policy, which was a positive step 
towards promoting gender equality and women&#8217;s participation in the public sector. The 
Netherlands would continue to monitor its implementation, as the position of women was 
still vulnerable. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Chile recognized the country&#8217;s difficulties in implementing the recommendations of 
2008 and the financial and human resource constraints. It acknowledged the commitment of 
Tuvalu to UPR and the special procedures; the measures adopted to ensure free and 
universal primary education for children and youth; the strengthening of the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office, the People&#8217;s Lawyers Office and the police; and the implementation of 
</p>
<p>national youth and women&#8217;s policies. It encouraged Tuvalu to intensify efforts to ratify the 
</p>
<p>various outstanding international human rights instruments. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Costa Rica echoed the appeal of Tuvalu for technical and economic assistance. It 
acknowledged efforts to incorporate human rights standards into domestic legislation; the 
significant progress in the field of women&#8217;s rights and empowerment at all levels of 
</p>
<p>society; the legislative measures to combat human trafficking, especially of children; and 
the drafting of national youth policies. It urged Tuvalu to design a national plan or policy 
for children, recognizing the benefits of social investment in childhood. It highlighted the 
serious impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Cuba praised the steps taken by Tuvalu to promote and protect the rights of persons 
with disabilities and persons living with HIV/AIDS; the improvement of people&#8217;s access to 
health services; and the increased awareness of human rights in the context of domestic 
violence. It welcomed several initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS and the discrimination of 
people living with HIV/AIDS. It asked Tuvalu about possible forms of international 
cooperation which could be entered into to ensure that its people fully enjoyed their human 
rights, particularly the rights to education and health. 
</p>
<p>61. Estonia noted with appreciation the inclusion of human rights standards in domestic 
legislation and progress in the implementation of several recommendations. It commended 
Tuvalu on prioritizing gender equality and promoting the role of women in its National 
Strategic Development Plan. Estonia urged Tuvalu to amend legislation to bring it into line 
with CEDAW and to raise awareness about women&#8217;s rights and gender equality in society. 
</p>
<p>It encouraged Tuvalu to show a strong commitment to the rule of law by ratifying and 
aligning its legislation with the Rome Statute and acceding to the Agreement on the 
Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court. Estonia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. With reference to the by-election question, the Head of the Delegation reported that 
it was a matter before the High Court, which would probably instruct as to when the by-
election will be carried out. 
</p>
<p>63. The Attorney General reiterated that women took priority in Tuvalu and that there 
were ongoing consultations on that matter. However, several cultural practices stopped 
women from doing certain things and it would probably take time for women to break away 
from the bonds of cultural practices. She stated that there were no laws which prevented 
women from having equal access to employment. 
</p>
<p>64. On the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, it was 
reiterated that the Cabinet had already endorsed accession thereto and that the Optional 
Protocol was under consideration. 
</p>
<p>65. The Director of Education stated that the system was trying to promote education, 
particularly early childhood education, which was one of the priorities of the National 
Strategic Development Plan. </p>


<p>66. On the area of corporal punishment, she noted the recent review of the Education 
Act with the aim of integrating human rights concerns. She explained that corporal 
punishment was legal and allowed, but only by the head teachers. Tuvalu was working to 
combat that and discussions had been conducted on the issue. Tuvalu requested support 
from the international community to improve that area. 
</p>
<p>67. Concerning corporal punishment of children in a domestic context, the delegate 
from the Crown Counsel reported about a workshop conducted by the Red Cross society to 
formulate a policy for the child protection, which covered protection of children, inter alia, 
from physical, emotional, sexual and financial abuse. He expressed hope that with 
additional assistance the policy would come into effect soon. He also called for 
amendments to the Education Act to prohibit corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>68. France welcomed the willingness of Tuvalu to defend human rights, despite the 
economic and financial constraints and environmental challenges it faced. It particularly 
welcomed the action taken by Tuvalu to combat poverty and to promote quasi-universal 
access to health services and education. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Germany welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation. Referring to the Constitution Amendment Act, Germany 
asked Tuvalu how the Government intended to guarantee the right of every person to 
freedom of religion or belief in the application of the act. It welcomed recent steps to 
strengthen the legal and social status of women, but was concerned that neither the 
Constitution nor other legislation embodied the principle of gender equality, nor contained 
a definition of discrimination against women. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Guatemala welcomed the development of policies to promote human rights, 
particularly the National Women&#8217;s Policy, the National Youth Policy, the Inclusive 
Education Policy and the National Strategic Development Plan. It shared the concerns of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women at the lack of public 
awareness of women&#8217;s rights and gender equality; at women&#8217;s lack of awareness of their 
rights; and at the paternal transmission of land ownership. While welcoming improvements 
on the matter, it urged Tuvalu to continue efforts to promote gender equality throughout the 
country. Guatemala made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Hungary took note of the cooperation with OHCHR and the expertise extended by 
CEDAW and the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation. It recognized efforts to eliminate gender inequalities but encouraged the country 
to include gender as a prohibited ground for discrimination in the Constitution. Hungary 
believed that free and universal primary education should be accessible to both urban and 
rural areas and gender equality should be incorporated into the higher education levels. It 
was concerned that corporal punishment of children was still lawful in schools. It noted the 
Inclusive Education Policy and encouraged increased participation of persons with 
disabilities in formal decision levels. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Indonesia welcomed the Second National Strategic Development Plan and its mid-
term review, whose key national priorities demonstrated the commitment of Tuvalu to 
human rights. It agreed with the importance of technical and financial assistance from 
regional and international development partners in implementing those priorities. It 
commended measures adopted to raise public awareness of the rights of vulnerable groups, 
including women and persons with disabilities. It welcomed the adoption of the Police 
Powers and Duties Act, which would help to eradicate domestic violence. Indonesia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Ireland, noting the adverse impact of sea-level rise on food security, water and 
health on the people of Tuvalu, welcomed the Government&#8217;s position on the need for the 
international community to address the human rights dimensions of climate change. Ireland </p>


<p>urged Tuvalu to ensure that the provisions of international human rights treaties were fully 
implemented in policy and practice. On access to justice issues, it urged Tuvalu to ensure 
that the People&#8217;s Lawyers Office was given the necessary human and financial resources to 
operate effectively in all the islands. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Italy welcomed efforts deployed by Tuvalu to comply with international human 
rights standards and to implement CRC and CEDAW. Italy noted the internal debate on 
possible accession to other core international human rights instruments. It noted reports 
indicating that action deployed to protect women&#8217;s rights still had limited impact. Italy 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Malaysia noted the progress made since the first UPR of Tuvalu, particularly on the 
inclusion of human rights standards in domestic legislation. It acknowledged that remaining 
challenges were hindering the full enjoyment of human rights and hoped that the 
international community would heed the country&#8217;s call for technical and financial 
assistance in fulfilling its human rights obligations. It welcomed ongoing efforts in gender 
mainstreaming and observed that progress had been made in youth development, inclusive 
education and persons with disabilities. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. The Head of the Delegation, in response to the question on repealing the new laws 
adopted to address the issues in relation to freedom of religion and its cultural practices, 
said that there were ongoing consultations between the islands. The approach of Tuvalu 
was to facilitate dialogue between religious organizations and the different islands. 
</p>
<p>77. With regard to the People&#8217;s Lawyers Office, it was noted that Tuvalu needed 
assistance in that area. Meetings had taken place to discuss having a pool of available 
lawyers but the People&#8217;s Lawyers Office currently had only one lawyer. 
</p>
<p>78. Lastly, concerning the call for Tuvalu to ratify the core human rights treaties, as had 
been stated previously, a legislative review was currently being carried out in order to give 
the Government and people of Tuvalu an understanding of the obligations before ratifying 
international conventions. 
</p>
<p>79. The Head of the Delegation took the opportunity to thank the Tuvaluan delegation 
for assisting in this presentation as well as all the countries for their comments and 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>80. The recommendations received were most useful for Tuvalu and it was noted that 
some recommendations might be within the country&#8217;s capabilities, as it was already 
working on those with the assistance of foreigners&#8217; donors, whereas others required more 
</p>
<p>assistance from the international community. Tuvalu reiterated that it would continue to 
request assistance from the international community in its efforts to fulfil its international 
human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>81. Tuvalu engaged to come back to the working group with a more formal commitment 
as to which recommendations and what plan would be the way forward for the country to 
continue in its efforts to address human rights. </p>
