PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activity of the Group during the period was the continued evaluation of mineral resources and advancement
of development of the Colluli Potash Project in Eritrea, East Africa. There was no significant change in the nature of the
Group’s activities during the six months to 30 June 2016.
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Colluli  Potash Project (Colluli or the Project), is located in the Danakil region of Eritrea, East Africa. By road it is
approximately 350km south-east of the capital, Asmara and 230km by road from the port of Massawa, which is Eritrea’s
key import / export facility.
Colluli is 100% owned by the Colluli Mining Share Company (CMSC), a 50:50 joint venture between Danakali and the
Eritrean National Mining Corporation (ENAMCO), and is one of the most advanced greenfield potash developments in the
world.  The current concession covers over 200km2.  A positive definitive feasibility study for the project was completed in
November 2015 (See ASX release dated 30 November 2015)A .
Demand for potash is expected to increase substantially over the coming decades, with United Nations estimates of annual
global population growth of approximately 80 million people.  Eritrea is geographically favourable relative to the key markets
of the future, and is a stable jurisdiction with a maturing mining industry.
The proven large resource, with low development capital intensity, project scalability, estimated bottom quartile operating
costs, product diversification potential and ease of access to global markets, supports a Tier 1 asset definition for Colluli.
An estimated mine life of over 200 yearsA, at a production rate increasing to 850ktpaA demonstrates project growth potential
over decades.
A  two  phase  modular  development  approach,  over  an  economic  modelling  period  of  60  years,  underpins  a  highly
favourable  Definitive  Feasibility  Study  (DFS) for  the  production  of  potassium  sulphate  (SOP)  fertiliser.  DFS  project
economics of the two phase development resulted in a highly attractive estimated internal rate of return (IRR) of 29%A.
The first phase of the development requires initial development capital of US$298m and as a standalone project has an
IRR of over 25% A.
In addition to the resource capability of producing sulphate of potash (SOP), and sulphate of potash magnesia (SOPM),
the resource also has the capability to produce potassium chloride (MOP), Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Sulphate,
Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate) and Rock Salt. This unrivalled diversification potential, allows Colluli to produce three of the
four key potash types traded within the global market and a range of other agricultural and commercial commodities.
REVIEW AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Group recorded a net loss after tax of $3,066,451 for the six months to 30 June 2016 compared to a net loss of
$4,120,908 in the six months to 30 June 2015.
Total consolidated cash on hand at the end of the period was $5,175,197 (31 December 2015: $2,756,341).
During the half year, Danakali maintained its operational focus on its Colluli Potash Project.  Following the completion and
submission of the DFS, the completion of the social and environmental impact assessment (SEIA) and the completion of
local and regional stakeholder engagements, an application for the project Mining License was submitted to the Ministry
of Energy and Mines.
The adequacy assessment and the submission of the SEIA were significant milestones which, in addition to the submission
of  the definitive  feasibility  study  finalised  the pre-requisites for  the Colluli  Mining  License application.    The social  and
environmental managements plans (SEMP) were included within the SEIA submission.
An evaluation of the feasibility study and associated impact assessments and management plans is underway and will
support the process of granting the Mining License for the project.

Project Finance Update
Off-take
During the first half of 2016 Danakali actively pursued the multi-national parties who signed non-binding off-take MoU’s for
SOP in April 2016. Parties include traders, end-users and producersB.  Discussions are continuing with an objective of
securing binding off-take agreements.
Funding
Danakali and CMSC are working with Endeavour Financial on the funding solution for the project development. Discussions
will commence during the third quarter with institutions who have expressed interest in participating in the funding solution.
The  company  also progressed  its mining,  engineering  and procurement  strategies  to  support  the formulisation  of  the
funding solution.
CORPORATE
Corporate Appointment
Ms Zhang Jing was appointed as a non-executive director to the board of Danakali Ltd on 17th June 2016. Ms Zhang has
held  investment  and  project  managerial  roles  in  public  listed  companies  in  China,  and  holds  a  Master’s  degree  in
International  Consultancy  and  Accounting  from  the  University  of  Reading  in  the  UK. Relevant  experience  includes
international trading and business development.

to secure funding and off-take agreements for the Colluli project.
Fundraising Activity
On 21 March 2016 Danakali announced a placement of up to approximately 25 million shares (Placement Shares), with
one free attaching unlisted option (Option) to subscribe for one fully paid ordinary share for every two Placement Shares
issued to sophisticated and professional investors to raise approximately AU$5.5million at $0.22 per share (Placement).
Danakali issued the first tranche of the Placement, consisting of 23,270,464 Placement Shares and 11,635,232 Options at
$0.35 per option on 31 March 2016 and issued the second tranche of the share placement to Directors, consisting of
1,600,000 Placement Shares and 800,000 Options at $0.35 per option pursuant to shareholder approval obtained at the
Company’s AGM held on 13 May 2016.
Funds  raised  from  the  Placement  will  be  used  for  the  completion  of  mining  approvals  process,  securing  off-take
agreements, to further strategic relationships, securing project funding (debt/equity), transaction costs and working capital.
On 12 August 2016, the Company announced that it had received commitments from a UK based institutional investor to

Quality Control and Quality Assurance
Danakali Exploration programs follow standard operating and quality assurance procedures to ensure that all sampling
techniques and sample results meet international reporting standards. Drill holes are located using GPS coordinates using
WGS84 Datum, all mineralisation intervals are downhole and are true width intervals.
The samples are derived from HQ diamond drill core, which in the case of carnallite ores, are sealed in heat sealed plastic
tubing immediately as it is drilled to preserve the sample. Significant sample intervals are dry quarter cut using a diamond
saw and then resealed and double bagged for transport to the laboratory.
Halite  blanks  and  duplicate  samples  are  submitted  with  each  hole.  Chemical  analyses  were  conducted  by  Kali-
UmwelttechnikGmBHSondershausen, Germany  utilising flame emission spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy
and ionchromatography.  Kali- Umwelttechnik (KUTEC) Sondershausen1 have extensive experience in analysis of salt
rock  and  brine  samples  and 
the  Deutsche
AkkreditierungssystemPrüfwesen GmbH (DAR). The laboratory follows standard procedures for the analysis of potash salt
rocks chemical analysis (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, H2O) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the same samples
as for chemical analysis to determine a qualitative mineral composition, which combined with the chemical analysis gives
a quantitative mineral composition.

REPORTING ENTITY
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Danakali Ltd (‘Danakali’ or the ‘Company’) is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia, and
whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The consolidated half year financial report
of the Group as at, and for the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprises the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the ‘Group’).
The financial report of Danakali for the half year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 31
August 2016.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the consolidated entity are described in the Directors’ Report.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.
(a) Basis of preparation
This condensed general purpose financial report for the half year ended 30 June 2016 has been prepared in accordance
with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001.
The half year financial report does not include all notes of the type normally included within the annual financial report and
therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  provide  as full  an  understanding  of  the financial  performance,  financial  position  and
financing and investing activities of the consolidated entity as the full financial report. It is recommended that the half year
financial report be read in conjunction with the annual financial report for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 and
considered together with any public announcements made by the Company during the half year ended 30 June 2016 in
accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the ASX Listing Rules.
The half year financial report has been prepared on a historical cost basis and is presented in Australian dollars.
(b) Accounting policies
The Group has reviewed and adopted all new and revised Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB
that are relevant to its operations and effective from 1 January 2016. As a result of this review the directors have determined
that no change to the Group’s accounting policies is necessary.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
3.
The Group operates in the mining industry in Eritrea. For management purposes, the Group is organised into one main
operating segment which involves the exploration of minerals in Eritrea. All of the Group’s activities are interrelated and
discrete financial information is reported to the Board (Chief Operating Decision Maker) as a single segment.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Group as one segment. The financial results
from this segment are equivalent to the financial statements of the Group as a whole.
The Group’s non-current assets are geographically located in Eritrea.

Danakali’s wholly owned subsidiary, STB Eritrea Pty Ltd, is presently funding the Colluli Mining Share Company (‘CMSC’)
for the development of the Colluli Potash Project and 50% of the funding is represented in the form of a shareholder loan.
Repayment of this loan, as defined in the CMSC Shareholders Agreement, will be made preferentially from future operating
cash flows. The shareholder loan is denominated in USD, non-interest bearing, unsecured and subordinate to any loans
from third party secured lenders, under which CMSC may enter into in order to fund the Project Development Capital. For
accounting purposes, the value of the loan has been discounted by applying an effective interest rate of 25% over an
estimated repayment period of approximately 5 years.
The undiscounted underlying loan balance at 30 June 2016 is $23,439,561 (31 December 2015: $23,266,475).

Colluli Potash  Mineral Exploration
The group acquired an interest in Colluli  Mining Share Company at the date of its incorporation on 5 March 2014. This
acquisition was in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement entered into with the Eritrean National Mining Corporation
(‘ENAMCO’) and executed in November 2013. CMSC was incorporated in Eritrea, in accordance with the Shareholders
Agreement, to hold the Colluli project with Danakali and ENAMCO holding 50% of the equity each.
Under the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, at the date of incorporation of CMSC, consideration for the acquisition of
shares in CMSC equates to half of the allowable historical exploration costs transferred to CMSC by STB Eritrea Pty Ltd,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Danakali Limited. The balance of the allowable historic exploration costs transferred to CMSC
are recoverable via a shareholder loan account (see note 4).
The Group’s 50% interest in CMSC is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method. The following tables
summarise the financial information of the Group’s investment in CMSC at 30 June 2016.

To the members of Danakali Limited
Report on the 30 June 2016 half-year financial report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Danakali Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes comprising a summary
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the half-year end or from
time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ responsibility for the half-year financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on
the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that
the financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair
view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-
year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting
and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Danakali Limited and the entities it controlled
during the half-year, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the
audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.
