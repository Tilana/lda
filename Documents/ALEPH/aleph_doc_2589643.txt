GASTAR EXPLORATION ANNOUNCES
SECOND QUARTER 2016 RESULTS
HOUSTON, August 4, 2016 - Gastar Exploration Inc. (NYSE MKT: GST) (“Gastar” or the
“Company”) today reported financial and operating results for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016.
Net loss attributable to Gastar’s common stockholders for the second quarter of 2016 was
$18.1 million, or a loss of $0.17 per share.  This compares to a second quarter 2015 net loss of
$118.0 million, or a loss of $1.52 per share.  Adjusted net loss attributable to common
stockholders for the second quarter of 2016 was $12.5 million, or a loss of $0.12 per share,
excluding the impact of a $3.3 million loss resulting from the mark-to-market of outstanding hedge
positions, a $2.0 million allowance for bad debt related to a third-party production purchaser’s
bankruptcy and other special items as compared to a second quarter 2015 adjusted net loss of
$10.1 million, or a loss of $0.13 per share, excluding the impact of a $100.2 million non-cash,
pre-tax ceiling test impairment charge and a $7.8 million loss resulting from the mark-to-market of
outstanding hedge positions. (See the accompanying reconciliation of net loss to net loss
excluding special items at the end of this news release.)
Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization
(“adjusted EBITDA”) for the second quarter of 2016 was $6.8 million compared to adjusted
EBITDA of $17.9 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $10.7 million for the first quarter of
2016.  (See the accompanying reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP
number, at the end of this news release.)
Total revenues were $12.2 million in the second quarter of 2016, a 45% decline from $21.9
million in the second quarter of 2015 and an 18% decline from $14.8 million in the first quarter of
2016.  Revenues from the sale of oil, condensate, natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”),
before the effects of commodity derivatives contracts, were $14.9 million in the second quarter of
2016, a 37% decline from $23.7 million in the second quarter of 2015 and a 3% increase from
$14.5 million in the
first quarter of 2016.  The reduction from second quarter of 2015 in oil, condensate, natural gas
and NGLs revenues (excluding the impact of hedging activities) primarily resulted from a 54%
decrease in equivalent production volumes offset by a 36% increase in weighted average
realized equivalent prices. The increase from first quarter 2016 revenues was due to a 112%
increase in equivalent product pricing offset by a 52% decrease in equivalent production
volumes. On April 8, 2016, Gastar sold substantially all of its producing assets and proved
reserves and a significant portion of its undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin for an
adjusted sales price of $76.6 million (the “Appalachian Basin Sale”). As a result of the sale, net
production from the Appalachian Basin area averaged 200 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(“Boe/d”) in the second quarter of 2016, compared to 7,700 Boe/d for the second quarter of 2015
and 7,100 Boe/d in the first quarter of 2016.  Excluding the impact of Appalachian Basin
production and the effects of commodity derivatives contracts, revenues from liquids (oil,
condensate and NGLs) represented approximately 88% of total production revenues in the
second quarter of 2016, compared to 89% in the second quarter of 2015 and 85% in the first
quarter of 2016.
Commodity derivative benefits derived from hedge contracts monetized during the second
quarter of 2016 resulted in a $565,000 increase in revenues compared to a $6.0 million increase
in revenue for the second quarter of 2015.  During the first quarter of 2016, Gastar monetized all
of its put spread and other hedge positions covering the production months April through July
2016 for net proceeds of $3.1 million.
During the second quarter of 2016, the impact of hedging on oil and condensates sales was an
increase in the total price realized from $41.82 per Bbl to $43.59 per Bbl.  In the second quarter of
2015, the impact of hedging on oil and condensate sales was an increase in total price realized
from $47.68 per Bbl to $52.20 per Bbl.
During the second quarter of 2016, Gastar allocated 15% of its oil hedges that were monetized to
NGLs which resulted in an increase in the total price realized from $12.02 per Bbl to $12.62 per
Bbl.  In the second quarter of 2015, the impact of hedging on NGLs sales resulted in an increase
in total price realized from $7.34 per Bbl to $14.97 per Bbl.
During the second quarter of 2016, Gastar did not have any natural gas volumes hedged as a
result of hedge monetizations in the first quarter of 2016 and the average realized price for
natural gas production was $1.84 per Mcf.  During the second quarter of 2015, the impact of
hedging on natural gas sales was an increase in total price realized from $1.10 per Mcf to $1.68
per Mcf.
We continue to maintain an active hedging program covering a portion of estimated future
production for July 2016 to December 2018, which is reported in our periodic filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Average daily production for the second quarter of 2016 was 6,400 Boe/d as compared to 13,900
Boe/d in the second quarter of 2015 and 13,200 Boe/d in the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter
2015 and first quarter 2016 includes average daily production of 7,700 Boe/d and 7,100 Boe/d,
respectively, attributable to our properties in the Appalachian Basin, substantially all of which
were sold April 8, 2016 in the Appalachian Basin Sale with an effective date of January 1,
2016.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, oil, condensate and NGLs as a percentage of
production volumes were 71% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 74% in the second
quarter of 2015 and 71% for the first quarter of 2016.

(1)The three and six months ended June 30, 2016 reflect the impact of the Appalachian Basin
Sale completed on April 8, 2016.
(2)The impact of hedging includes only the gain (loss) on commodity derivative contracts settled
during the periods presented.
Lease operating expenses (“LOE”) were $4.6 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to
$7.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2016.  Excluding
the Appalachian Basin, LOE decreased $1.2 million, or 20%, to $4.5 million for the second
quarter of 2016 from the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to a $1.6 million decrease in
workover expense resulting from a decrease in workover activity and receipt of a $588,000
insurance reimbursement related to 2015 activity offset by a $538,000 increase in controllable
LOE primarily due to new West
Edmond Hunton Lime Unit, or WEHLU, wells drilled in the second half of 2015 and production
enhancing operations.  LOE per barrel of oil equivalent (“Boe”) of production as reported was
$7.86 in the second quarter of 2016 versus $5.74 in the second quarter of 2015 and $5.05 in the
first quarter of 2016, including workover costs.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin and workover
expense, LOE per Boe for the second quarter of 2016 was $8.36 compared to $7.59 for the
second quarter of 2015 and $7.93 per Boe for the first quarter of 2016.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was $5.6 million in the second
quarter of 2016, down from $16.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $13.7 million in the
first quarter of 2016.  The DD&A rate for the second quarter of 2016 was $9.59 per Boe compared
to $12.74 per Boe for the second quarter of 2015 and $11.41 per Boe in the first quarter of
2016.  The decrease in DD&A expense and the DD&A rate was the result of a decrease in
production resulting from the completion of the Appalachian Basin Sale coupled with a lower
DD&A rate due to impairment charges incurred in 2015 and the first quarter 2016 and lower full
cost property costs resulting from the Appalachian Basin Sale.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2016
compared to $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $5.7 million in the first quarter of
2016. G&A expense for the second quarter of 2016 included $702,000 of non-cash stock-based
compensation expense, versus $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.6 million in the
first quarter of 2016.  Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the higher G&A expense in
the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to an allowance for
a bad debt expense charge of $2.0 million related to a third-party production purchaser’s
bankruptcy.
J. Russell Porter, Gastar's President and CEO, commented, “Our secondary equity offering in
May 2016 yielded net proceeds of approximately $44.8 million, improving our liquidity position
and allowing us to resume operated drilling on our extensive STACK acreage position.  We have
developed a drilling program of up to nine wells that will test the STACK potential across our
northern acreage in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma as well as allow us to pursue a drilling
program to de-risk our southern acreage in Canadian County, Oklahoma.  We believe that drilling
a select number of additional operated wells, coupled with the continuing success of offset
operators developing the STACK Play near our acreage, should allow us to delineate and
demonstrate the prospectivity of our acreage in multiple formations and confirm its value.  Well
data from our own operated wells, combined with data from the numerous non-operated STACK
wells that we are participating in, should provide additional options for funding further exploration
and development of the STACK Play.  During the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, we will
continue to evaluate potential opportunities to partner with other operators or investors in a
drilling program to develop our undeveloped acreage, evaluate possible acreage divestments, or
possibly raise funds in the capital markets to further
enhance our liquidly and further fund the development of our acreage position in the STACK
Play, which we believe is one of the most economic plays in North America.”

Net production from the Mid-Continent area averaged 6,200 Boe/d in the second quarter of 2016,
which was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015 and up slightly from 6,100 Boe/d in the
first quarter of 2016. Second quarter 2016 Mid-Continent production consisted of approximately
48% oil, 29% natural gas and 23% NGLs.
In October 2015, Gastar commenced flowback of its first operated Meramec well, the Deep River
30-1H, which in December 2015, produced at a peak 24-hour rate of 1,094 Boe/d (71% oil) and
has produced at a post-peak 230-day gross average daily rate of 513 Boe/d (53% oil).  Gastar’s
working interest in the Deep River 30-1H is 100% (NRI 80.2%).
In April 2016, Gastar’s second operated well testing the Meramec formation, the Holiday Road 2-
1H, commenced flow-back.  In June 2016, the well was equipped with a larger gas lift system
and oil and natural gas production from the well continues to gradually increase.  During the most
recent 30-day period, the well averaged 267 gross Boe/d (81% oil) and 2,063 barrels of
completion fluid.  During the most recent five-day period the well produced at a gross average
rate of 343 Boe/d (82% oil) and
2,199 barrels of completion fluids.  Gastar has a 78.3% working (approximate 63.0% NRI) interest
in the Holiday Road 2-1H well.
On June 20, 2016, Gastar spudded its first operated Osage test well, the McGee 29-1H, with a
projected vertical depth of approximately 7,600 feet and a 4,200 foot horizontal lateral in Garfield
County, Oklahoma.  Gastar’s current estimated working interest in the McGee 29-1H is 66.3%
(NRI 53%).  The estimated gross cost to drill and complete the McGee 29-1H is $4.5 million,
excluding costs associated with coring operations to evaluate the Osage and Woodford Shale
formations.
To gather additional data on drilling and completing each of the prospective targets, year to date
in 2016, Gastar has participated in four gross (0.5 net) completed non-operated Meramec Shale
wells, one gross (0.2 net) completed non-operated well targeting the Osage, three gross (0.4 net)
completed non-operated wells targeting the Oswego and one gross (0.1 net) completed non-
operated Woodford Shale well.
In the Mid-Continent, Gastar’s net capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2016 totaled $8.1
million, comprised of $4.3 million for drilling, completions and infrastructure costs, $2.8 million for
unproved acreage extensions and renewals and $1.0 million for other capitalized costs.  Year to
date 2016 net capital expenditures in the Mid-Continent totaled $23.1 million, comprised of $10.0
million for drilling, completions and infrastructure costs, $11.1 million for unproved acreage
extensions and renewals and $2.0 million for other capitalized costs.
For the remainder of 2016, Gastar’s capital expenditure budget is $38.1 million, comprised of
$25.9 million for drilling, completion and infrastructure costs, $9.2 million for lease renewal and
extension costs and $3.0 million for other capitalized costs, resulting in a total 2016 capital
expenditures budget of $61.2 million.  Gastar’s capital expenditure budget remains subject to
change based upon the commodity price environment and our liquidity position.
Appalachian Basin
On April 8, 2016, Gastar sold substantially all of its producing assets and proved reserves and a
significant portion of its undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin.  The following table

Liquidity
On April 8, 2016, we sold substantially all of our producing assets and proved reserves and a
significant portion of our undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin for an adjusted sales
price of $76.6 million.  On May 12, 2016, we sold 50,000,000 shares of our common stock in an
underwritten public offering for approximately $44.8 million of net proceeds.  At June 30, 2016,
Gastar had approximately $50.8 million in available cash and cash equivalents, $99.6 million in
borrowings outstanding and $370,000 in letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the revolving
credit facility.  We may, however, need to request a waiver of compliance with, or amendment to,
certain of our financial covenants by year-end 2016, which may not be received.  The absence of
such relief could result in significant adverse consequences and require us to pursue various
alternatives.
Guidance for Third Quarter and Full-Year 2016
Our guidance for the third quarter of and full-year 2016 is provided in the table below and
represents the Company's best estimate of the range of likely future results.   Guidance could be

Mid-Year 2016 Reserve Update
SEC proved reserve estimates as of June 30, 2016 totaled 32.8 MMBoe, of which 42% is proved
developed, and were comprised of 19.7 million barrels of crude oil and condensate, 6.0 million
barrels of NGLs and 42.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  The pre-tax SEC-priced present value
of future cash flows of these reserves, discounted at 10% ("PV-10") (a non-GAAP financial
measure defined below in “Information on Reserves and PV-10 Value”), was $205.7 million, a
10% decline as compared to year-end 2015 as a result of lower proved reserve volumes and
lower SEC prices.  The proved reserves volume decline of 23.1 MMBoe, or 41%, is primarily
attributable to the sale of approximately 14.1 MMBoe of proved reserves in the Appalachian
Basin and a declining commodity price environment that has rendered some proved
undeveloped well locations uneconomic.  In accordance with SEC regulations, estimates of
proved reserves as of June 30, 2016 were calculated using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period July 1, 2015 through June
30, 2016.  For oil volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate price utilized was $43.12 per
barrel, compared to $50.28 per barrel for year-end 2015, and for natural gas volumes, the
average Henry Hub price utilized was $2.24 per million Btu (MMBtu), compared to $2.59 per
MMBtu for year-end 2015.  These benchmark oil and natural gas prices were adjusted for energy
content or quality, transportation and regional price differentials by area.
For a discussion of PV-10 and the standardized measure of future net cash flows, see
"Information on Reserves and PV-10 Value."

About Gastar Exploration
Gastar Exploration Inc. is a pure play Mid-Continent independent energy company engaged in
the exploration, development and production of oil, condensate, natural gas and natural gas
liquids. Gastar’s principal business activities include the identification, acquisition, and
subsequent exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties with an emphasis on
unconventional reserves, such as shale resource plays. Gastar holds a concentrated acreage
position in what is believed to be the core of the STACK Play, an area of central Oklahoma which
is home to multiple oil and natural gas-rich reservoirs including the Meramec, Oswego, Osage,
Woodford and Hunton formations. For more information, visit Gastar's website at
www.gastar.com.
Information on Reserves and PV-10 Value
At June 30, 2016, future cash inflows were computed using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for natural gas and oil (the “benchmark base prices”)
adjusted by lease in accordance with sales contracts and for energy content, quality,
transportation, compression and gathering fees and regional price differentials, relating to the
Company’s proved reserves.  Benchmark base prices are held constant in accordance with SEC
guidelines for the life of the wells but are adjusted by lease in accordance with sales contracts
and for energy content, quality, transportation, compression, and gathering fees and regional
price differentials. The average
benchmark base prices used in our June 30, 2016 SEC compliant reserves report are
significantly above current market commodity prices.
PV-10 represents the present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of estimated future net
revenue before income tax of our estimated proved reserves.  PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial
measure as defined by the SEC.  We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and
useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our
reserves prior to taking into account corporate future income taxes and our current tax
structure.  We further believe investors and creditors use PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the
relative size of our reserves as compared with other companies.
The financial measure most directly comparable to PV-10 is the standardized measure of future
net cash flows (“Standardized Measure”) which takes into account future income taxes and our
current tax structure.  As a result of our current net operating tax loss position, no future income
taxes are anticipated and the PV-10 value shown should be reflective of our Standardized
Measure.
The Company’s June 30, 2016 total proved reserves estimates were prepared by Wright &
Company, Inc.
Forward Looking Statements
This news release includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.  Forward looking statements give our current expectations, opinion, belief or
forecasts of future events and performance.  A statement identified by the use of forward looking
words including “may,” “expects,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimate,” “will,”
“should,” and certain of the other foregoing statements may be deemed forward-looking
statements.  Although Gastar believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual future activities and results to be materially different from those suggested or described in
this news release.  These include risks inherent in natural gas and oil drilling and production
activities, including risks with respect to continued low or further declining prices for natural gas
and oil  that could result in further downward revisions to the value of proved reserves or
otherwise cause Gastar to further delay or suspend planned drilling and completion operations or
reduce production levels which would adversely impact cash flow; risks relating to the availability
of capital to fund drilling operations that can be adversely affected by adverse drilling results,
production declines and continued low or further declining prices for natural gas and oil; risks
regarding Gastar’s ability to meet financial covenants under its indenture or credit agreements or
the ability to obtain amendments or waivers to effect such compliance; risks
of fire, explosion, blowouts, pipe failure, casing collapse, unusual or unexpected formation
pressures, environmental hazards, and other operating and production risks, which may
temporarily or permanently reduce production or cause initial production or test results to not be
indicative of future well performance or delay the timing of sales or completion of drilling
operations; delays in receipt of drilling permits; risks relating to unexpected adverse
developments in the status of properties; borrowing base redeterminations by our banks; risks
relating to the absence or delay in receipt of government approvals or third-party consents; risks
relating to our ability to integrate acquired assets with ours and to realize the anticipated benefits
from such acquisitions; and other risks described in Gastar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, available at the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov.  Our actual sales production rates can vary considerably from tested initial
production rates depending upon completion and production techniques and our primary areas of
operations are subject to natural steep decline rates. By issuing forward looking statements
based on current expectations, opinions, views or beliefs, Gastar has no obligation and, except
as required by law, is not undertaking any obligation, to update or revise these statements or
provide any other information relating to such statements.
Targeted expectations and guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2016 are based upon
the current 2016 planned capital expenditures budget, which may be subject to revision and
reevaluation dependent upon future developments, including drilling results, our liquidity
position, a further decline in commodity prices, availability of crews, supplies and production
capacity, weather delays and significant changes in drilling costs.
Unless otherwise stated herein, equivalent volumes of production and reserves are based upon
an energy equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to each barrel of liquids (oil, condensate and
NGLs), which ratio is not reflective of relative value.  Our NGLs are sold as part of our wet gas
subject to an incremental NGLs pricing formula based upon a percentage of NGLs extracted from
our wet gas production.  Our reported production volumes reflect incremental post-processing
NGLs volumes and residual gas volumes with which we are credited under our sales contracts.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RECONCILIATION
We use both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess
performance.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s
performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are
not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and
presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our management believes that these non-GAAP measures
provide useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate our financial
performance using the same measures as management.  These non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance
prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In evaluating these measures, investors should consider
that the methodology applied in calculating such measures may differ among companies and
analysts.  A reconciliation is provided below outlining the differences between these non-GAAP
measures and their most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with
GAAP.
