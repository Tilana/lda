REGISTRATION RIGHTS
SECTION 2.1. Request for Registration.
(a) At any time following the six (6) month anniversary of the Effective Date, if the Company shall
receive a written request from one or more Eligible Holders (in such capacity, the “Requesting
Holders”) that the Company effect the registration (including an Initial Public Offering) under the
Securities Act of all or any portion of such Requesting Holders’ Registrable Securities, and
specifying the intended method of disposition thereof (whether underwritten or not), then the
Company shall give notice of such requested registration (each such request shall be referred to
herein as a “Demand Registration”) to the other Eligible Holders (if any) as promptly as
reasonably practicable and in any event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated
filing date of the Registration Statement relating to such Demand Registration and thereupon
(subject to the limitations in SECTION 2.1(g)) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (or such other form promulgated under the
Securities Act which the Company is then eligible to use with respect to the registration under the
Securities Act) and use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the
registration under the Securities Act of the offer and sale of:
(i)
all Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holders have requested
registration under this SECTION 2.1; and
(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in SECTION 2.1(d), all other Registrable
Securities that any other Holders (all such Holders, together with the Requesting
Holders, the “Registering Holders”) have requested the Company to include in such
registration by request received by the Company within ten (10) Business Days after
any non-initiating Eligible Holders received the Company’s notice of the Demand
Registration, or any other Holder pursuant to and in accordance with SECTION 2.4,
all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods
thereof as requested by the Requesting Holders) of the Registrable Securities so to be
registered; provided, that no Person may participate in any Registration Statement pursuant to
this SECTION 2.1 unless such Person agrees to sell their Registrable Securities to the
Underwriters (if any) selected as provided in SECTION 2.6(f) on the same terms and conditions
as apply to the Requesting Holders; provided, further, that no such Registering Holders shall be
required to make any representations or warranties, or provide any indemnity, in connection with
any such registration other than representations and warranties (or indemnities with respect
thereto) as to (i) such Person’s ownership of his, her or its Registrable Securities to be transferred
free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances, (ii) such Person’s power and authority to
effect such transfer, (iii) the completeness and accuracy of any information provided by such
Registering Holders for the purpose of inclusion in the registration statement, or (iv) such matters
pertaining to compliance with securities laws by such Registering Holders as may be reasonably
requested; provided, further, that the obligation of such Person to indemnify pursuant to any such
underwriting arrangements shall be several, not joint and several, among such Persons selling
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Person will be in proportion thereto;
provided, further, that such liability will be limited to the net proceeds received by such Person
from the sale of his, her or its Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.
(b) At any time prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement relating to such
registration, a majority of the Requesting Holders (measured by the number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold by all Requesting Holders and not by the number of Requesting
Holders) may revoke
5
such request without liability to the Company or any of the other Registering Holders, by
providing a written notice to the Company revoking such request; provided, that if so revoked,
such Demand Registration shall not count as a Demand Registration under this Agreement. The
decision as to whether to consummate and as to the terms of any Demand Registration shall be
made by a majority of the Requesting Holders (measured by the number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold by all Requesting Holders and not by the number of Requesting
Holders) in their sole and absolute discretion.
(c) The Company shall be liable for and pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each
Demand Registration, regardless of whether such Registration is effected; provided, that holders
of Registrable Securities shall each pay their pro rata portion of all underwriting discounts, selling
commissions and stock transfer taxes applicable to the sale of Registrable Securities.
(d) If a Demand Registration involves a public offering and the managing Underwriter advises the
Company and the Requesting Holders that, in its view, the number of Registrable Securities that
the Registering Holders and the Company propose to include in such registration exceeds the
largest number of Registrable Securities that can be sold without having an adverse effect on
such offering, including the price at which such Registrable Securities can be sold (the “Demand
Maximum Offering Size”), the Company shall include in such registration, in the priority listed
below, up to the Demand Maximum Offering Size:
(i)
all Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the Requesting Holders and
the other Eligible Holders requesting Registrable Securities be included in such
registration and offering, allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the
Demand Offering Maximum size, pro rata among such Requesting Holders and
other Eligible Holders on the basis of the total number of Registrable Securities held
by such Requesting Holders and other Eligible Holders immediately prior to such
Demand Registration (and if the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by
a Requesting Holder are reduced pursuant to this clause (i), such Requesting
Holder’s Demand Registration shall not be counted for purposes of the number of
Demand Registrations to which such Requesting Holder and its Holder Group are
entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement if such Demand Registration would
otherwise constitute the final Demand Registration such Requesting Holder and its
Holder Group are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement);
(ii) second, all Registrable Securities requested to be registered by all other Holders,
allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the Demand Maximum Offering
Size, pro rata among such other Holders on the basis of the relative number of
Registrable Securities so requested to be included in such registration and offering
by each such Holder;
(iii)
third, all shares of Common Stock requested to be included in such registration and
offering by Persons other than Eligible Holders, allocated, if necessary for the
offering not to exceed the Demand Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among such
other Persons on the basis of the relative number of shares of Common Stock so
requested to be included in such registration and offering by each such Person; and
(iv)
fourth, all securities proposed to be included in such registration and offering by the
Company.
6
(e) No securities other than Common Stock may be included in any Demand Registration by any
Person unless consented to in writing by the Requesting Holders.
(f) The Company may defer the filing of a Registration Statement required by this SECTION 2.1
for a period of up to one hundred twenty (120) days after the request to file a Registration
Statement if at the time the Company receives the request to register Registrable Securities: (i)
the Board, through a vote of at least a majority of the Board members other than the Board
members designated by the Requesting Holders pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement,
determines in good faith that (A) the offer or sale of any Registrable Securities would materially
impede, delay or interfere with any proposed material financing, material acquisition, corporate
reorganization or other similar material transaction involving the Company or (B) the Demand
Registration would require the disclosure of non-public information relating to a material
transaction that would be required to be made in any Registration Statement filed with the
Commission by the Company so that such Registration Statement would not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and the disclosure of such information
would have a material adverse effect on the Company or the Company’s ability to consummate
the transaction; or (ii) the Company is subject to any of its customary suspension or blackout
periods, for all or part of such period. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company may suspend
the continued use of a Registration Statement required by this SECTION 2.1 for a period of up to
sixty (60) days if the Board determines in good faith that it is required by law, rule or regulation to
supplement such Registration Statement or file a post-effective amendment to such Registration
Statement in order to ensure that the prospectus included in the Registration Statement (1)
contains the information required by the form on which such Registration Statement was filed and
to cause the information contained in such prospectus to be true and correct in all material
respects and not to have any omission of any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (2) discloses any facts or events
arising after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or of the most recent post-effective
amendment) that, individually or in the aggregate, represents a fundamental change in the
information set forth therein. A deferral of the filing of a Registration Statement, or the suspension
of the continued use of a Registration Statement, pursuant to this SECTION 2.1(f), shall be
promptly lifted, and the requested Registration Statement shall be filed as promptly as
practicable, in the case of a deferral, if at any time there shall no longer exist the grounds for such
deferral or suspension pursuant to the terms of this SECTION 2.1(f). In order to defer the filing of
a Registration Statement, or suspend the continued use of a Registration Statement, pursuant to
this SECTION 2.1(f), the Company shall promptly (but in any event within ten (10) days), upon
determining to seek such deferral or suspension, deliver to each Requesting Holder a certificate
signed by the entirety of the Board stating that the Company is deferring such filing, or
suspending the continued use of a Registration Statement, pursuant to this SECTION 2.1(f) and
a general statement of the reason for such deferral or suspension, as the case may be, and an
approximation of the anticipated delay. The Company may defer the filing, or suspend the
continued use of, a particular Registration Statement pursuant to this SECTION 2.1(f) no more
than twice in any twelve (12) month period; provided, that there must be an interim period of at
least sixty (60) days between the end of one deferral or suspension period and the beginning of a
subsequent deferral or suspension period; provided, however, that a valid deferral of the filing of
the Registration Statement, or suspension thereof, shall not diminish the obligation of the
Company to continue preparations for the filing of such Registration Statement during such
period of deferral or suspension.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to effect more
than (i) four (4) Demand Registrations delivered by each Holder Group pursuant to SECTION
2.1(a) or (ii) one (1) Demand Registration delivered by any Holder Group in any one hundred
eighty (180) day period (it being understood that a registration pursuant to the rights granted
under SECTION 2.4 by such Holder Group shall not constitute a Demand Registration for the
purposes of this SECTION 2.1(g)).
(h) So long as any Eligible Holder holds any Registrable Securities in respect of which
registration rights provided for in this SECTION 2.1 remain in effect, the Company will not,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of each of the Eligible Holders, grant to any
Person or agree to otherwise become obligated in respect of (i) the rights of registration in the
nature or substantially in the nature of those set forth in this SECTION 2.1 that would have priority
over or parity with the Registrable Securities with respect to the inclusion of such securities in
any registration, or (ii) demand registration rights exercisable prior to such time as the Eligible
Holders can first exercise their rights under this SECTION 2.1.
7
SECTION 2.2. Shelf Registrations.
(a) If, at any time following the six (6) month anniversary of the Effective Date, the Company
qualifies for the use of Form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor form
thereto to file a “shelf” Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act on
Form S-3 (or any successor form to Form S-3, or any similar short-form Registration Statement) (a
“Shelf Registration”), upon receipt of a written request (the “Shelf Request”) from any Eligible
Holder that the Company file a Shelf Registration covering the resale of such Eligible Holder’s
Registrable Securities, the Company shall (i) within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Company
of such Shelf Request, give written notice of such proposed registration to any non-requesting
Eligible Holder(s), (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, to cause the Shelf Registration to be filed with the Commission as soon as
reasonably practicable and to include all Registrable Securities held by such requesting Eligible
Holder to be registered on such form for the offering together with all or such portion of the
Registrable Securities of any non-requesting Eligible Holder joining in such request as are
specified in a written request received by the Company within ten (10) days after receipt of such
written notice from the Company, and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with
the terms of this Agreement, to cause such Shelf Registration to be declared effective by the
Commission as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to prepare
applicable financial statements for certain periods prior to its emergence from bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and certain periods following its emergence
from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for the time periods
required for the Company to qualify for the use of Form S-3. The provisions of this SECTION 2.2
shall be applicable to each take-down from a Shelf Registration initiated under this SECTION 2.2
and any subsequent resale of Registrable Securities pursuant thereto.
(b) In connection with any proposed firmly underwritten resale of Registrable Securities which is
not pursuant to a Demand Registration under SECTION 2.1 and with respect to which such Shelf
Registration is expressly being utilized to effect such resale (an “Underwritten Shelf Take-down”)
pursuant to a Shelf Registration, each Eligible Holder agrees, in an effort to conduct any such
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down in the most efficient and organized manner, to coordinate with
any other Eligible Holders prior to initiating any sales efforts and cooperate with the other Eligible
Holder(s) as to the terms of such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, including the aggregate amount
of securities to be sold and the number of Registrable Securities to be sold by each Eligible
Holder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall give prompt notice to any non-
initiating Eligible Holder (if such Eligible Holder’s Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf
Registration) of the receipt of a request from the initiating Eligible Holder (whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Shelf Registration) of a proposed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down
under and pursuant to the Shelf Registration and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, will provide such non-initiating Eligible Holders a period of five (5) Business
Days to participate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, subject to the terms negotiated by
and applicable to the initiating Eligible Holder and subject to “cutback” limitations set forth in
SECTION 2.1(d) as if the subject Underwritten Shelf Take-Down was being effected pursuant to
a Demand Registration (mutatis mutandis). All such Eligible Holders electing to be
8
included in an Underwritten Shelf Take-down must sell their Registrable Securities to the
Underwriters selected as provided in SECTION 2.6(f) on the same terms and conditions as apply
to any other selling equityholders; provided, however, that no such Person shall be required to
make any representations or warranties, or provide any indemnity, in connection with any such
registration other than representations and warranties (or indemnities with respect thereto) as to
(i) such Person’s ownership of his, her or its Registrable Securities to be transferred free and
clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances, (ii) such Person’s power and authority to effect such
transfer, and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws by such Person as
may be reasonably requested; provided, further, however, that the obligation of such Person to
indemnify pursuant to any such underwriting arrangements shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Persons selling Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such
Person will be in proportion thereto, and provided, further, that such liability will be limited to the
net proceeds received by such Person from the sale of his, her or its Registrable Securities
pursuant to such registration.
(c) The Company shall be liable for and pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each
Shelf Registration, regardless of whether such Shelf Registration is effected, and any
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down; provided, that holders of Registrable Securities shall each pay
their pro rata portion of all underwriting discounts, selling commissions, and stock transfer taxes
applicable to the sale of Registrable Securities.
(d) The Company may voluntarily suspend the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration or may
otherwise require the discontinuance of offers under a Registration Statement related thereto for
a period of up to 90 days if it determines that the offering of any Registrable Securities pursuant
thereto would require the disclosure of non-public information relating to a material transaction
that would be required to be made in any Registration Statement filed with the Commission by
the Company so that such Registration Statement would not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading and the disclosure of such information would have a
material adverse effect on the Company or the Company’s ability to consummate the transaction
(a “Suspension”). The Company shall notify each Holder eligible to sell Registrable Securities
under such Registration Statement promptly of any Suspension and, upon receipt, each such
Holder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under such
Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemental prospectus
or amended Registration Statement or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of
the applicable prospectus may be resumed. In addition, the Company shall promptly notify each
Holder of the termination or lifting of any such Suspension.
SECTION 2.3. Limitation on Demand Registrations and Underwritten Shelf Take-
down. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall have no
obligation to effect (i) a Demand Registration (and such request therefor shall not constitute a
Demand Registration for any purpose under this Agreement) if the proposed Demand
Registration would not reasonably be expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the
participating Holder Groups in excess of $20 million (before deducting expenses and
Underwriters’ discounts and commissions), or (ii) an Underwritten Shelf Take-down (and such
request therefor shall not constitute an Underwritten Shelf Take-down Registration for any
purpose under this Agreement), if the proposed Underwritten Shelf Take-down would not
reasonably be expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the participating Holder
Groups and any other holders of any other securities of entitled to inclusion in such registration,
in excess of $20 million (before deducting expenses and Underwriters’ discounts and
commissions).
9
SECTION 2.4. Piggyback Registrations.
(a) If the Company proposes to register any shares of Common Stock under the Securities Act
(whether for itself or otherwise in connection with a sale of securities by another Person
(including a Demand Registration by an Eligible Holder), but other than (i) in connection with a
Shelf Registration and any resale of Registrable Securities by an Eligible Holder pursuant to a
Shelf Registration, which shall be governed by the terms of SECTION 2.2, or (ii) a registration on
a Form S-4 or Form S-8, the Company shall at each such time give prompt written notice at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement relating to
such registration to each Holder Group holding Registrable Securities hereunder, which notice
shall set forth such Holder Group’s rights under this SECTION 2.4 and shall offer such Holder
Group the opportunity to include in such Registration Statement all or any portion of the
Registrable Securities held by such Holder Group (a “Piggyback Registration”), subject to the
restrictions set forth herein. Upon the request of any such Holder Group made within five (5)
Business Days after the receipt of notice from the Company (which request shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities intended to be registered by such Holder Group), the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of
all Registrable Securities that the Company has been so requested to register by all such Holder
Groups with rights to require registration of Registrable Securities hereunder, to the extent
required to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities so to be registered; provided, that
if such registration involves an underwritten public offering, all such Holder Groups requesting to
be included in the Company’s registration must sell their Registrable Securities to the
Underwriters selected as provided in SECTION 2.6(f) on the same terms and conditions as apply
to the Company or any other selling equityholders; provided, however, that no such Person shall
be required to make any representations or warranties, or provide any indemnity, in connection
with any such registration other than representations and warranties (or indemnities with respect
thereto) as to (i) such Person’s ownership of his, her or its Registrable Securities to be transferred
free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances, (ii) such Person’s power and authority to
effect such transfer, (iii) the completeness and accuracy of any information provided by such
Registering Holders for the purpose of inclusion in the registration statement and (iv) such
matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws by such Person as may be reasonably
requested; provided, further, that the obligation of such Person to indemnify pursuant to any such
underwriting arrangements shall be several, not joint and several, among such Persons selling
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Person will be in proportion thereto; and
provided, further, that such liability will be limited to the net proceeds received by such Person
from the sale of his, her or its Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration. If, at any time
after giving notice of its intention to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to this SECTION
2.4(a) and prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such
registration, the Company or the initiating holders, as applicable, shall decide for any reason and
in its sole and absolute discretion not to register such securities, the Company shall give notice
to all such Holder Groups and, thereupon, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any
Registrable Securities in connection with such registration. No registration effected under this
SECTION 2.4(a) shall relieve the Company of its obligations to effect a Demand Registration to
the extent required by SECTION 2.1 except to the extent such registration results in the initiating
Holder Groups of such Demand Registration no longer holding any Registrable Securities as a
result of registration pursuant to this SECTION 2.4. The Company shall be liable for and pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with each Piggyback Registration, regardless of whether
such registration is effected.
(b) If a Piggyback Registration involves a public offering (other than any Demand Registration, in
which case the provisions with respect to priority of inclusion in such offering set forth in
SECTION 2.1(d) shall apply) and the managing Underwriter advises the Company that, in its
view, the number of Registrable Securities that the Company and all selling equityholders
propose to include in such registration exceeds the largest number of Registrable Securities that
can be sold without having an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such
Registrable Securities can be sold (the “Piggyback Maximum Offering Size”), the Company shall
include in such registration, in the following priority, up to the Piggyback Maximum Offering Size:
(i)
first, such number of Registrable Securities proposed to be registered for the account
of the Company, if any, as would not cause the offering to exceed the Piggyback
Maximum Offering Size;
10
(ii) second, such number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by Eligible Holders pursuant to SECTION 2.4(a) (the Registrable
Securities in this clause (ii) allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the
Piggyback Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among such Eligible Holders on the
basis of the total number of Registrable Securities held by such Eligible Holders
immediately prior to such Piggyback Registration); and
(iii)
third, such number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by any other Holder Groups pursuant to SECTION 2.4(a) (the
Registrable Securities in this clause (iii) allocated, if necessary for the offering not to
exceed the Piggyback Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among such other Holder
Groups based on their relative number of Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the Piggyback Registration).
SECTION 2.5. Lock-Up Agreements.
(a) In connection with each underwritten public offering and if requested by the managing
Underwriter, the Holder Groups agree not to effect any public sale or private offer or distribution
(other than, if permitted by the managing Underwriter, a distribution-in-kind pro rata to all
stockholders, limited partners or members, as the case may be, of such Holder Group) of any
Registrable Securities during the ten (10) days immediately prior to the consummation of such
public offering and during such time period after the consummation of such public offering, not to
exceed ninety (90) days (one-hundred and eighty (180) days in the case of the Initial Public
Offering) (in each case subject to any extension reasonably requested by the managing
Underwriter as required to comply with any applicable FINRA regulation) as may be requested
by the managing Underwriter; provided, that such lock-up agreements are also required from all
directors, managers and executive officers, and from all Holder Groups who hold at least five
percent (5%) of the Registrable Securities; provided, further, that each such director, manager,
executive officer or Holder Group referenced in the foregoing proviso shall enter into such lock-
up agreements if so required. Any discretionary waiver or reduction of the requirements under the
foregoing provisions made by the Company or the applicable lead managing Underwriters shall
apply to each Holder Group on a pro rata basis on the basis of the total number of Registrable
Securities held by such Holder Group and other Holder Groups as of the time of any such waiver
or reduction.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company shall, at any time, register
under the Securities Act an offering and sale of Registrable Securities held by the Holder Groups
for sale to the public pursuant to an underwritten public offering, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of the lead Underwriters for such offering, effect any public sale or
distribution of securities similar to those being registered, or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for such securities, for such period as shall be determined by the
lead Underwriters and that is for the same period and on substantially similar terms as agreed to
by the Eligible Holders.
(c) At any time following the Initial Public Offering, any Holder Group holds less than five percent
(5%) of the then-outstanding Common Stock of the Company may elect (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (collectively, the “Withdrawing Holders”)), by written notice to the Company, to withdraw
11
from the provisions of ARTICLE II and as a result of such withdrawal, such Withdrawing Holders
shall no longer be entitled to the rights, nor be subject to the obligations, of ARTICLE II and the
Common Stock of the Company held by the Withdrawing Holders shall conclusively be deemed
thereafter not to be “Registrable Securities” under this Agreement. No withdrawal pursuant to this
SECTION 2.5(c) shall release any Withdrawing Holder from its indemnification and contribution
rights and obligations, if any, pursuant to SECTION 2.7(b) and SECTION 2.9.
SECTION 2.6. Registration Procedures. Whenever any Holder Groups request that any
Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to SECTION 2.1 or SECTION 2.4, subject to the
provisions of such Sections, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect
the registration and the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method of disposition thereof as quickly as practicable, and, in connection with any such request:
(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable from the date of receipt by the
Company of the written request, prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement
on any form for which the Company then qualifies and the managing Underwriter, if any, and the
Eligible Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities held by Eligible Holders to be
registered thereunder shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of
the Registrable Securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of
distribution thereof, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such filed Registration
Statement to become and remain effective for a period of not less than one-hundred and eighty
(180) days or in the case of a Shelf Registration, not less than two (2) years (or such shorter
period in which all of the Registrable Securities of the Registering Holders included in such
Registration Statement shall have actually been sold thereunder); provided, however, that such
one-hundred and eighty (180) day period or two (2) year period, as applicable, shall be extended
for a period of time equal to the period any Holder Group refrains from selling any securities
included in such registration at the request of an underwriter and in the case of any Shelf
Registration, subject to compliance with applicable Commission rules, such two (2) year period
shall be extended, if necessary, to keep the Registration Statement effective until all such
Registrable Securities are sold.
(b) Prior to filing a Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, the Company shall furnish to each participating Holder Group and each underwriter, if
any, of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement copies of such
Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter the Company shall furnish to such
Holder Group and underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such Registration Statement,
each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other
prospectus filed under Rule 424 or Rule 430A under the Securities Act and such other
documents as such Holder Group or underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder.
(c) After the filing of the Registration Statement, the Company shall (i) promptly notify each
Holder Group holding Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement of the time
when such Registration Statement has been declared effective or a supplement or amendment to
any prospectus forming a part of such Registration Statement has been filed, (ii) cause the
related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and, as so
supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act and incorporate such
information as the managing Underwriter or Underwriters and each of the Eligible Holders agree
should be included therein relating to the plan of distribution; provided, that in the event the
Registrable Securities being sold for an Eligible Holder is less than 33% of the Registrable
Securities of the other Eligible Holders (in the aggregate), then the agreement of the Eligible
Holders who hold such lesser amount of Registrable Securities being sold, shall not be
12
required under this SECTION 2.6(c), (iii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
Registering Holder thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to such
prospectus, and (iv) promptly notify each Registering Holders holding Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement of any stop order issued or threatened by the
Commission or any state securities commission and take all reasonable actions required to
prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.
(d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities or
“blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as any Registering Holder holding such
Registrable Securities reasonably (in light of such Registering Holder’s intended plan of
distribution) requests, and (ii) cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or
approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of
the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may
be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Registering Holder to consummate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Registering Holder; provided, that the
Company shall not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it
would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this SECTION 2.6(d), (B) subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction.
(e) The Company promptly shall notify each Registering Holder holding such Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement, at any time when a prospectus relating
thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event
requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and promptly prepare and make
available to each such Registering Holder and file with the Commission any such supplement or
amendment as promptly as practicable.
(f) Except for a Demand Registration and Underwritten Shelf Take-down, the Board shall have
the right to select the Underwriter or Underwriters in connection with any public offering. In
connection with the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration or
Underwritten Shelf Take-down, (i) in the case of a Demand Registration, the Requesting Holder,
and (ii) in the case of an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities to be registered in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, shall select the
Underwriter or Underwriters, which must be reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided
that, in connection with a Demand Registration, the Requesting Holder may delegate its rights
under clause (i) of this SECTION 2.6(f) to the Board. In connection with any public offering, the
Company shall enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in
customary form, provided that the scope of the indemnity contained in such underwriting
agreement on the part of the selling Holder Groups is not more extensive than the indemnity
described in SECTION 2.7(b)), provided that such agreements are consistent with this
Agreement, and take all such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in any such public offering, including the
engagement of a “qualified independent underwriter” in connection with the qualification of the
underwriting arrangements with FINRA. The Company shall make such representations and
warranties to the holders of Registrable Securities being registered, and the underwriters or
agents, if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers in secondary
underwritten public offerings and take any other actions as the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the registration and
disposition of such Registrable Securities. Each Holder Group participating in such underwriting
shall also enter into such agreement, provided that the terms of any such agreement are
consistent with this Agreement.
13
(g) In connection with the filing of any registration statement pursuant to which the Company is
liable for fees and expenses of counsel to the applicable Eligible Holders as Registration
Expenses pursuant to clause (vii) of the definition thereof, the Company shall only be liable for
the fees and expenses of one such counsel (and local counsel, as applicable) as selected by (i)
in the case of a Demand Registration, the Requesting Holder, and (ii) in the case of any other
registration statement, by the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities to be
registered by all such Eligible Holders pursuant to such registration statement.
(h) Upon execution of confidentiality agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company, the Company shall make available for inspection by any Registering Holder and
any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration Statement being filed
by the Company pursuant to this SECTION 2.6 and any attorney, accountant or other
professional retained by any such Registering Holder or underwriter (collectively, the
“Inspectors”), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the
Company (collectively, the “Records”) as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable
them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company’s officers, directors
and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any Inspectors in connection
with such Registration Statement. Records that the Company determines, in good faith, to be
confidential and that it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the
Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a material
misstatement or omission in such Registration Statement or (ii) the release of such Records is
ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction or is
otherwise required by law. Each Holder agrees that at the time that such Holder is a Registering
Holder, information obtained by it as a result of such inspections shall be deemed confidential
and shall not be used by it or its Affiliates as the basis for any market transactions in Equity
Securities unless and until such information is made generally available to the public, and further
agrees that, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, it shall give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to
undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential.
(i) The Company shall cause to be furnished to each Registering Holder and each such
underwriter, if any, a signed counterpart, addressed to such Registering Holder or underwriter, of
(i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to the Company and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters
from the Company’s independent public accountants, each in customary form and covering such
matters of the kind customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters, as the case may be, as
Eligible Holders holding a majority of such Registrable Securities in the applicable Registration
or the managing underwriter therefor reasonably requests.
(j) The Company shall otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its security holders,
as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement or such other document that shall
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder. The
Company shall cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter, if any,
participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in
connection with any filings to be made with FINRA.
(k) The Company may require each such Registering Holder, by written notice given to each
such Registering Holder not less than ten (10) days prior to the filing date of such Registration
Statement, to promptly, and in any event within seven (7) days after receipt of such notice, furnish
in writing to the Company such information regarding the distribution of the Registrable
Securities as the Company may
14
from time to time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally required in
connection with such registration. Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees to furnish such
information to the Company and cooperate with the Company as reasonably necessary to enable
the Company to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.
(l) Each Holder agrees that at the time that such Holder is a Registering Holder, upon receipt of
any written notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event requiring the preparation of a
supplement or amendment of a prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities covered by a
Registration Statement that is required to be delivered under the Securities Act so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or to make the statements therein not misleading, such Holder shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering
such Registrable Securities until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of a supplemented or
amended prospectus, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to the
Company all copies, other than any permanent file copies then in such Holder’s possession, of
the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such
notice. If the Company shall give such notice, the Company shall extend the period during which
such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective (including the period referred to in
SECTION 2.6(a)) by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the
giving of notice pursuant to SECTION 2.6(e) to the date when the Company shall make available
to such Holder a prospectus supplemented or amended to conform with the requirements of
SECTION 2.6(e).
(m) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to list all Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement on any securities exchange or quotation system on
which any of the Registrable Securities are then listed or traded and if none of the Registrable
Securities are so listed, on any securities exchange or quotation system on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed, and if no such similar securities are listed, on
any national securities exchange.
(n) The Company shall have appropriate officers of the Company (i) prepare and make
presentations at any “road shows” and before analysts and rating agencies, as the case may be,
(ii) take other reasonable actions to obtain ratings for any Registrable Securities and (iii)
otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate as requested by the
underwriters in the offering, marketing or selling of the Registrable Securities.
SECTION 2.7. Indemnification.
(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Holder Group and its Indemnified Parties from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses) (“Damages”) caused by or relating to any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus
relating to the Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary or free-writing prospectus,
or caused by or relating to any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
caused by or related to any violation or alleged violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act,
except insofar as such Damages are caused by or related to any such untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission so made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder Group or on such Holder
Group’s behalf expressly for use therein, provided that, with respect to any untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary or free-writing
prospectus, or in any prospectus, as the case may be, the indemnity agreement contained in this
paragraph shall not apply to the extent that any
15
Damages result from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or
supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) was not sent or given to the Person asserting any
such Damages at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities
concerned to such Person if it is determined that the Company has provided such prospectus to
such Holder Group and it was the responsibility of such Holder Group to provide such Person
with a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case
may be) and such current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus,
as the case may be) would have cured the defect giving rise to such Damages.
(b) Indemnification by the Participating Holders. Each Holder, at the time that such Holder is a
Registering Holder holding Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement,
agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless from and against all Damages
the Company and its Indemnified Parties (i) with respect to information furnished in writing to the
Company by such Holder or on such Holder’s behalf expressly for use in any Registration
Statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any preliminary or free-writing prospectus or (ii) to the extent that any Damages result
from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented
prospectus, as the case may be) was not sent or given to the Person asserting any such
Damages at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities
concerned to such Person if it is determined that it was the responsibility of such Holder to
provide such Person with a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented
prospectus, as the case may be) and such current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or
supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) was available to such Holder and would have
cured the defect giving rise to such Damages. As a condition to including Registrable Securities
in any Registration Statement filed in accordance with ARTICLE II, the Company may require
that it shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any underwriter to
indemnify and hold it harmless to the extent customarily provided by underwriters with respect to
similar securities. No Holder shall be liable under this SECTION 2.7(b) for any Damages in
excess of the net proceeds realized by such Holder in the sale of Registrable Securities of such
Holder to which such Damages relate.
SECTION 2.8. Indemnification Procedures. If any proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be instituted involving any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity
may be sought pursuant to ARTICLE II, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Person
against whom such indemnity may be sought (the “Indemnifying Party”) in writing and the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and
expenses, provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. In any such proceeding, any
Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) in the
reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party, representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is
understood that, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such
Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are
incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be
designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the
plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Parties from
and against any Damages (to the extent stated above) by reason of such
16
settlement or judgment. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no
Indemnifying Party shall effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such proceeding.
SECTION 2.9. Contribution.
(a) If the indemnification provided for in SECTION 2.7 and SECTION 2.8 is unavailable to the
Indemnified Parties or insufficient in respect of any Damages (other than by reason of the
exceptions provided herein), then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a
result of such Damages, as between the Company on the one hand and each such Holder Group
on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and
of each such Holder Group in connection with such statements or omissions, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of each
such Holder Group on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.
(b) The Company and the Holder Groups agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this SECTION 2.9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
SECTION 2.9(a). The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the
Damages referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this SECTION 2.9, no Holder shall be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds realized by such Holder Group in
the sale of Registrable Securities of such Holder Group to which such Damages relate exceeds
the amount of any Damages that such Holder Group has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. Subject to the foregoing and as among the Holder Group, each Holder
Group’s obligation to contribute pursuant to this SECTION 2.9 is several in the proportion that the
proceeds of the offering received by such Holder Group bears to the total proceeds of the offering
received by all such Registering Holders and not joint.
SECTION 2.10. Cooperation by the Company. With a view to making available to the Holder
Groups the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may at any time
permit the sale of securities to the public without registration, the Board agrees to use, and to
cause the Company to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to:
(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are defined in Rule 144, at all
times after the Effective Date that the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act;
(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the
Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject
to such reporting requirements);
17
(c) furnish to any Holder Group, so long as such Holder Group owns any Registrable Securities,
upon request by such Holder Group, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the
Company and such other reports and documents of the Company and other information in the
possession of or reasonably obtainable by the Company as a Holder Group may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing a Holder to sell any
such securities without registration; and
(d) upon the request of any Holder Group, instruct the transfer agent in writing that it shall rely on
the written legal opinion of such Holder Group’s counsel and shall act in accordance with the
written instructions of such Holder Group’s counsel, with respect to any transfer of Equity
Securities of the Company.
SECTION 2.11. Public Offering Outside of the United States. Each of the Company and the
Holder Groups agrees that if the Initial Public Offering occurs outside of the United States (such
that the Registrable Securities have their primary listing by way of an admission to trading on a
regulated market in the European Union or on another internationally recognized stock
exchange) the provisions of this ARTICLE II shall be amended mutatis mutandis to give effect to
the structural and organizational requirements of any such public offering and listing of securities,
including as required:
(a) making an application for admission of all the securities comprised with the Equity Securities
of the Company (including the Registrable Securities) to the official list of securities on the
regulated market;
(b) making an application for admission of all of the securities comprised within the Equity
Securities of the Company (including the Registrable Securities) to trading on the regulated
market;
(c) preparing a prospectus in accordance with applicable law and the applicable regulations of
the relevant stock exchange;
(d) complying with all filing and other notification obligations in respect of such prospectus under
applicable law and the applicable regulations of the relevant stock exchange; and
(e) undertaking such other matters as shall be advised by appropriate counsel to the underwriters
of the Company to give effect to such public offering.
ARTICLE III
MISCELLANEOUS
SECTION 3.1. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in
addition to any other applicable remedies at law or equity, the parties and the third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without proof of
damages, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (i) the other party has
an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in
any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
18
SECTION 3.2. Amendments and Waivers.
(a) No failure or delay on the part of the Company or any Holder in exercising any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies that may be available to the Company or any Holder at law or in equity
or otherwise.
(b) The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be
amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions
hereof may not be given, in each case without the written consent of the Company and each
Eligible Holder; provided, that any amendment that has the effect of adversely affecting any
Holder shall only be effective against such Holder with the written consent of such Holder.
SECTION 3.3. Notices. Any notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder
shall be in writing, and shall be sufficiently given if made by hand delivery, by facsimile,
electronic mail or registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
addressed as follows (or at such other address as may be substituted by notice given as herein
provided):

Any notice or communication hereunder shall be deemed to have been given or made as of the
date so delivered if personally delivered; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is
acknowledged, if telecopied or sent by electronic mail; and on receipt if sent by registered or
certified mail.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders.
SECTION 3.4. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the Holders under this
Agreement shall not be assignable by any Holder to any Person that is not a Holder; provided,
that in the event of a valid transfer of Registrable Securities by a Holder, the rights and
obligations of the transferor under this Agreement (solely with respect to the Registrable
Securities so transferred) shall be transferred to the transferee, subject to such transferee
executing a joinder to this Agreement, to the extent expressly
19
assigned by such transferor to such transferee; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the
transferor in such transaction shall retain its rights and obligations under this Agreement (except
with respect to any rights to effect a Demand Registration assigned to the transferee) with respect
to any Registrable Securities not so transferred. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns and transferees.
SECTION 3.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when
taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement and
any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by facsimile, by electronic mail
in “portable document format” (“.pdf”) form, or any other electronic transmission, shall be treated
in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
SECTION 3.6. Governing Law: Venue: Jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL CLAIMS OR
CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON,
ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION
OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT) SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party
hereby agrees that any action based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including
any action concerning the violation or threatened violation of this Agreement) shall be heard and
determined in any state or federal court sitting in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware), and the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of appeals,
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. In
addition, each party consents to process being served in any such lawsuit, action or proceeding
by mailing, certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy thereof to such party at the address in
effect for notices hereunder, and agrees that such services shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process and notice thereof. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this SECTION 3.6 and shall not be deemed to confer
rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. Nothing in this SECTION 3.6 shall affect or
limit any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
SECTION 3.7. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS
RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT WHETHER BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS,
TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW OR
STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE
FOREGOING WAIVER CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR IT TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS
REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH
LEGAL COUNSEL.
20
SECTION 3.8. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited, unenforceable
or not authorized in any jurisdiction is, as to such jurisdiction, ineffective to the extent of any such
prohibition, unenforceability or nonauthorization without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof, or affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction,
unless the ineffectiveness of such provision would result in such a material change as to cause
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby to be unreasonable. Upon a determination
that any provision of this Agreement is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized, the parties
hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the parties hereto as closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.
SECTION 3.9. Non-Recourse. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of,
arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made
only against (and are expressly limited to) the entities that are expressly identified as parties in
the preamble to this Agreement (“Contracting Parties”). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including without limitation any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any Contracting Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing (“Non-party Affiliates”), shall have any liability (whether in contract
or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance,
or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, each Contracting Party hereby waives
and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Non-
party Affiliates.
SECTION 3.10. Recapitalization, Exchanges Etc., Affecting Securities. The provisions of this
Agreement shall apply, to the full extent set forth herein with respect to the Registrable Securities
and to any and all Equity Securities of the Company or any successor or assign of the Company
(whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise, including shares issued by a
parent company in connection with a triangular merger) which may be issued in respect of, in
exchange for, or in substitution of Registrable Securities, appropriately adjusted for any stock
dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations, reclassifications and the like occurring after the
date hereof.
SECTION 3.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits hereto)
contains the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such
matters.
SECTION 3.12. Aggregation of Equity Securities. All Registrable Securities held by a Holder and
its Affiliates shall be aggregated together for purposes of determining the availability of any rights
under this Agreement.
SECTION 3.13. Headings. The section headings of this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed to be part of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
SECTION 3.14. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in SECTION 3.4, nothing
express or implied herein is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any person or entity,
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and all Indemnified
Parties, any rights, remedies or other benefits under or by reason of this Agreement.
