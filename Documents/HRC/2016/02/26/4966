<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixth session from 30 
November to 11 December 2009. The review of Dominica was held at the 11th meeting, on 
7 December 2009. The delegation of Dominica was headed by H.E. Mr. Crispin S. 
Gregoire, Permanent Representative of Dominica to the United Nations. At its 14th 
meeting, held on 9 December 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on 
Dominica.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Dominica: Djibouti, Brazil and China. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Dominica: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">1. Trinidad and Tobago thanked Dominica for its sustained efforts in strengthening the 
provision of human rights for its citizens. It noted that Dominica boasts a multiparty, 
parliamentary democracy with a strong tradition for the rule of law, which is reflected in 
the country&#8217;s respect for all facets of human rights and, more importantly, is exemplified in 
the adherence of Dominica to the principles that define modern democratic statehood. 
Trinidad and Tobago acknowledged that challenges still exist with respect to a variety of 
issues such as ensuring fair and equitable treatment for the indigenous Kalinago peoples, 
ensuring gender equity and reducing corruption. It noted, nonetheless, that despite resource 
constraints, efforts are being continually made at the level of policy and practice, to redress 
any existing inequities with the establishment of a Ministry of Caribbean Affairs headed by 
a Kalinago, the existence of a Gender Bureau and the establishment of a commission to 
implement the Integrity in Public Service Act of 2004.

</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">0. Jamaica appreciated he efforts of the Dominica to promote and protect the human 
rights of all its citizens, especially those persons who constitute vulnerable groups such as 
women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. Jamaica indicated that the 
indigenous Kalinago people, although comprising a small segment of the population, are of 
great historical and cultural importance. Jamaica commended Dominica for having 
introduced universal secondary education and hoped that the plans for universal tertiary 
education will soon be realised. It noted that several reports to treaty bodies are overdue 
and that this was a reflection of the constraints faced by many developing countries and 
underscores the need for technical and capacity-building assistance if they are to adequately 
meet their commitments.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Crispin S. Gregoire, Permanent Representative of Dominica to the United Nations, 
introduced the national report.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation indicated that the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Dominica is 
the Supreme Law of Dominica and its First Chapter guarantees the protection of 
fundamental rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation indicated that the Constitution further provides in Section 16 (10), 
that any person alleging violation of any fundamental rights may apply to the High Court 
for redress. Appeal of any decision of the High Court may also be sought from the Eastern 
Caribbean Court of Appeal, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, if necessary. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation further highlighted that Dominica&#8217;s human rights infrastructure is 
comprised of both legal and institutional aspects. The legal aspects include the guarantees 
enshrined in the Constitution, the provisions of the Laws of the Commonwealth of 
Dominica, and Dominica&#8217;s international obligations. In terms of the institutional aspect, 
responsibilities are accorded to both governmental and non-governmental entities. The 
Ministry of Community Development, Information, Gender Affairs and Culture is the most 
active at the Cabinet level and employs a rights-based approach in the delivery of social 
services and the protection of vulnerable groups. While the Ministry of Community 
Development, Information, Gender Affairs and Culture bears responsibility for the </p>


<p>promotion and protection for human rights, many other ministries have portfolios that 
impact on the enjoyment of those fundamental rights and freedoms including ministries 
with responsibilities for education, health, housing, urban development, youth, sports, 
economic development, labour and national security. 
</p>
<p>9. The work of non-governmental organizations has contributed in a significant way to 
civil society&#8217;s appreciation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country. 
The National Association of Non-Governmental Organizations, established in September 
1996, has actively promoted the rights of free association and the role of civil society in 
national governance. The Dominica National Council for Women is the leading non-
governmental advocate for the rights of women, and monitors compliance with obligations.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that it has made commendable progress in the advancement 
and promotion of women&#8217;s rights, gender mainstreaming, and the overall empowerment of 
women. In adherence to its commitments under the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Inter-American Convention on the 
Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (Convention of 
Belem do Para) and other international conventions ratified by Dominica, successive 
Governments have been proactive in guaranteeing equality and non-discrimination in the 
treatment of women. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation highlighted the ratification of the following treaties: Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (CRC) 1990; Optional Protocol to CRC on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict; Optional Protocol to CRC on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(1993); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1993); Inter-
American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against 
Women (Convention of Belem do Para, 1995); Supplementary Convention on the Abolition 
of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. 
</p>
<p>12. In addition, Dominica has taken legislative action and passed the following laws: the 
Protection against Domestic Violence Act 2001, the Labour Contract Act which embodies 
the principle of equality between men and women and prohibits differences in rates of pay 
for the same work based on the gender of the employee and the Social Security Act which 
provides for 12 weeks maternity leave. Also, male public sector workers are now entitled to 
paternity leave pursuant to an agreement between the main trade union and the government 
signed in December 2008. The amendment to the Title by Registration Act to accommodate 
low cost transfer of property between spouses. This has given a tremendous boost to 
married women&#8217;s property ownership.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation indicated that a National Gender Policy was completed in 2006 and 
ratified by the Cabinet in September 2007. This policy aims to achieve gender equality by 
eliminating discrimination against women in the policy arenas of health, economic 
development, violence-producing conditions, education and skills training, and power and 
decision-making. 
</p>
<p>14. A number of programmes and activities have been undertaken to give effect to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. In terms of policy, a protocol on Joint Police and 
Social Services investigation into child abuse cases is to be established. A review process 
for the Status of Children Bill, and the Child Adoption Bill is underway while a new piece 
of legislation, The Children and Young Persons Act, seeks to incorporate specific 
provisions of CRC into domestic legislation. The Education Act No. 11 of 1997 has been  </p>
<p>amended to provide early childhood education for children from 0 to 5 years instead of  </p>
<p>from 3 to 5 years as was previously the case. The Protection Against Domestic Violence,  </p>
<p>Act No. 22 of 2001, contains specific provisions covering various forms of violence against </p>


<p>children. In view of growing transnational crime in the Caribbean region, the Government 
of Dominica has been proactive in enacting legislation to make human trafficking a crime. 
</p>
<p>15. Dominica explained that the right to participation in cultural life is guaranteed in the 
Constitution and enshrined in the Culture Act of 1981. A National Cultural Policy was 
adopted by the Cabinet in May, 2001, which recognizes the richness and uniqueness of 
Dominica&#8217;s cultural heritage. Dominica has ratified a number of conventions related to 
culture and preservation of culture. A National Cultural Council exercises oversight over 
the protection and promotion of Dominican culture.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation highlighted that the nation&#8217;s prime recognition of the elderly is 
asserted in the fundamental rights and freedoms that are to be enjoyed by all citizens under 
the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Dominica. According to the 2001 National 
Census, older persons constituted 13.<footnote name="4">8. Slovenia noted that, according to the summary of stakeholders&#8217; submissions, 
corporal punishment of children is still lawful in the home as well as public and private 
schools. It inquired whether Dominica planned to prohibit corporal punishment of children 
in all settings. It noted that Dominica has not ratified some of the core human rights 
instruments, such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (ICERD) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and asked whether Dominica planned to ratify 
these two instruments. Slovenia also noted that Dominica does not report regularly to treaty 
bodies (five reports being overdue to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women since 1982) and asked how the international community could help 
Dominica to fulfil its reporting obligations. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</footnote> per cent of the registered population of 69,625. In 
1999, the Cabinet adopted a National Policy on Ageing, and The Dominica Council on 
Ageing, established in 1993, exercises oversight over the implementation of the national 
policy on aging, and provides advice and input into Government policy making.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government&#8217;s strong advocacy in maintaining the fundamentals of total care for 
the elderly fostered the launching of a pioneering programme called the &#8220;Yes We Care 
Programme&#8221;. This programme is a system of home and community-based care. It seeks to 
blend with the lives and requirements of the elderly in a harmonious way, heralding further 
for better synergy and cooperation among the many service providers. In 2007, the 
Government announced the policy of free health care for persons 65 years and older and for 
youth 18 and under. After review, the Government in 2008 decided to lower the age of 
persons who could benefit from free health care services from 65 to 60 years. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation stressed that the Government continued to improve the facilities at 
the Stockfarm Prison. A new cell block was completed in 2008 which has helped to reduce 
the serious problem of overcrowding. Separate facilities for juvenile offenders have been 
established, and a skills training programme has been established for them. The inmate 
population at Stockfarm Prison includes both remanded and convicted prisoners, and the 
staff of the facility has received training in rehabilitation, and exposure to counselling, 
which are available for the benefit of the inmates.  
</p>
<p>19. The first reported case of HIV/AIDS was diagnosed in 1987. Over the last 2 
decades, Dominica has maintained a prevalence rate of 0.75%. From 1987 to 2008, the 
cumulative number of HIV infections stood at 342 cases, with males in the 25&#8211;<footnote name="4">7. China appreciated the efforts of Dominica in recent years and the achievements in 
safeguarding the rights of women and children and improving their status, in combating 
human trafficking, and in other areas. China recalled that the government provides free 
medical care for persons over 60 and below 18, and has taken positive measures to protect 
the right of detainees and to facilitate their reintegration, especially juvenile offenders into 
society. China noted that in areas such as combating HIV/AIDS, protecting the rights of 
indigenous and disabled people, and improving the scope and equality of education, some 
difficulties and challenges still exist. China appreciated efforts to address the above 
mentioned problems. China noted that Dominica faces difficulties and requires technical 
assistance with regard to the submission of reports to human rights treaty bodies and 
requested information on the specific challenges and the nature of the assistance required 
from the international community.  
</footnote>4 age 
group representing 71.<footnote name="2">2. The delegation pointed out that a vibrant system of local government has existed for 
more than one hundred years. The 41 local government authorities serve as conduits </footnote>% of the infected population. 
</p>
<p>20. In 2003, Government launched the five year National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS 
which is guided by the principle that the life of every individual is precious and valuable 
and therefore all attempts will be made to preserve the well being of the individual 
regardless of his/her health status, sexual persuasion or other personal characteristics. On 
the basis of this principle the response focused on the provision of treatment and care for 
persons living with HIV and AIDS and the prevention of transmission of the virus (among 
the general population, vulnerable populations, and from mother to child). 
</p>
<p>21. With 45.<footnote name="4">6. Mexico recognized the efforts made by Dominica to ratify international conventions 
on the trafficking of persons, migrants and refugees and conventions of the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) as well as regional instruments of return and child adoption. 
Mexico indentified as a challenges facing Dominica the complete harmonisation of 
domestic legislation with international instruments to which it is a party, including the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Eliminations of all 
Discriminations against Women, with their respective Optional Protocols. Mexico asked 
about progress in this area. Mexico made recommendations. 
</footnote> per cent of Dominica&#8217;s population under the age of 25 years, Government 
recognizes that youth development is critical to overall national development. The process 
of youth work in Dominica is based on achieving the Millennium Development Goals and 
adopting the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment. The youth 
development programmes of Dominica seek to achieve &#8220;Youth Mainstreaming&#8221;, a 
systematic approach to integrating youth affairs with all relevant stakeholders. 
</p>

<p>through which central government policy outputs, programmes, projects, and information 
impact on local communities.  
</p>
<p>23. The rights of Dominica&#8217;s indigenous people, the Kalinago, are enshrined in the 
Constitution, and the Carib Reserve Act of 1978. The Kalinago people live in the Carib 
Territory under a communal land tenure system which is governed by the Carib Chief and 
the Carib Council. 
</p>
<p>24. Central to Dominica&#8217;s development thrust is particular focus on the advancement of 
the indigenous peoples. At the United Nations, Dominica has been steadfast in its support 
of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and has been unwavering in its 
support for the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII).  
</p>
<p>25. The Government of Dominica has undertaken important initiatives to improve social 
development for the indigenous Kalinago people. The Ministry of Carib Affairs was 
formally established in 2005. Its creation, and the policy direction of its Minister, the 
Honourable Kelly Graneau, the elected Member of Parliament for the Carib Territory, has 
contributed to the heightened attention which Government accorded to comprehensive 
development of the Kalinago people. Much emphasis has been placed on improving 
housing conditions, and providing greater opportunities for training at the secondary and 
tertiary levels. 
</p>
<p>26. Government signed the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities on 
March 30, 2007. An initial consultation with the primary advocate for rights of the disabled, 
the Dominica Association of Disabled People and other key stakeholders was held in 2008 
to familiarize implementing organizations with the obligations under the Convention and to 
assess the country&#8217;s readiness for its implementation. Further discussions are planned with 
a view towards ratification of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>27. The Government of Dominica is committed to ensuring the right of every 
Dominican to quality education. The education system is governed by the 1997 Education 
Act, which makes education compulsory for any person between the five years and fifteen 
years of age. Dominica has attained Universal Secondary Education. 
</p>
<p>28. Dominica noted that it received a number of advance questions from Argentina, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and the 
Netherlands.  
</p>
<p>29. The delegation referred to several questions raised by Argentina. It highlighted that 
corporal punishment in schools is hardly used, even though it is still in the law. 
Furthermore, the delegation noted that attempts are being made to have separate courts for 
juveniles. Concerning the minimum age for employment, the delegation noted that it is 
actually 16 years. The delegation addressed concerns regarding its indigenous people, the 
Kalinago, and noted that they are accorded the same rights as others. In terms of access to 
Government services, there is no discrimination based on ethnic origin. Furthermore, the 
delegation added that many laws have been enacted to towards elimination of violence 
against women. Dominica highlighted that the Ministry of Gender Affairs is working with 
the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) to satisfy the outstanding 
reporting obligations to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women in 2010.  
</p>
<p>30. The delegation referred to several questions raised by the Czech Republic. The 
delegation highlighted that a standing invitation for the special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council was under consideration. Concerning the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocols, 
the delegation noted that the cabinet in Dominica had to address the ratification of the 
Convention. The delegation highlighted that the Government had passed legislation to </p>


<p>implement measures to strengthen its human rights obligations. The delegation referred to 
the fight against discrimination against children with disabilities and Carib-Indian children 
and noted that Dominica was facing significant challenges in that regard. While there were 
two schools located in the capital that provided education to children with disabilities, 
children with disabilities in rural areas still had limited access to education. The delegation 
pointed out that Carib-Indian children did not face discrimination in Dominica<i>.  
</i></p>
<p>31. The delegation referred to several questions raised by Denmark, concerning the 
improvement of the Rights of the Child, in relation to issues such as sexual abuse and 
corporal punishment. The delegation pointed out that there is a specific law in Dominica&#8217;s 
Sexual Offences Act, which addresses sexual abuse. Dominica had a number of cases 
before the court and several perpetrators have been sent to prison. Concerning corporal 
punishment, the delegation noted that it is hardly used in the school system. Although the 
delegation noted that it is a problem in families. It pointed out that this is an arena 
Dominica still needs to work at, and that the Government will have to look towards 
possible amendments in this regard.  
</p>
<p>32. The delegation referred a question raised by Latvia concerning standing invitation 
for the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. The delegation noted that this is 
an issue for the cabinet of Dominica to decide on. It highlighted that Dominica is open for 
the Special Procedures and that Dominica has no problems with Special Rapporteurs to 
their country.  
</p>
<p>33. The delegation referred to two questions raised by Sweden. The delegation pointed 
out that Dominica has not executed the death penalty since 1986. It furthermore noted that 
Dominica has a very low murder rate and that all death penalties have been commuted to 
life sentences. The delegation highlighted however that an abolishment of the death penalty 
remains problematic, and that it would require a referendum. Sweden asked Dominica 
about the Sexual Offences Act, which criminalizing consensual sexual activity of person 
with the same sex. The delegation noted that this is a challenging area and that the 
delegation recognized that it is discriminatory. However, the delegation noted that this is an 
issue that the cabinet has to deliberate on. The delegation admitted that there is a certain 
element of discrimination in the society towards same sex relationships.  
</p>
<p>34. The delegation referred to questions raised by the United Kingdom about the role of 
civil society in the preparation of the national report. The delegation noted that the 
preparation process had been a little hasty and that consultation with civil society had been 
limited. Dominica had only been able to have consultations with a few non-governmental 
organizations s and community-based organizations. The delegation noted that it would 
have preferred to have broader consultations with non-governmental organizations s. 
Furthermore, it pointed out that Dominica aims towards creation of a national human rights 
institution in the next five years.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>35. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 28 delegations. The text of 
the recommendations made during the interactive dialogue appear in section II of the 
present report. 
</p>

<p>37. The United States of America welcomed Dominica&#8217;s actions outlined in their 
national report and presentation, to confront the problem of discrimination against people 
infected with HIV. The United States inquired as to the results, thus far, of efforts to reduce 
the level of discrimination against persons with HIV and how Dominica will sustain or 
expand these efforts. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Algeria welcomed Dominica&#8217;s efforts to promote the right to education, particularly 
for poor children. Algeria noted the establishment of specific programs, the allocation of 
funds and the free distribution of textbooks to help poor children, which shows a 
determination to give full effect to the right to education. Algeria was aware of the climatic 
and economic difficulties which affect efforts to ensure the full and effective 
implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. Algeria finally recalled that 
environmental, social and economic vulnerability have made Dominica among the poorest 
countries within the Eastern Caribbean. Algeria made several recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Venezuela noted the efforts underway to promote and protect human rights, 
particularly the indigenous populations, which is the largest in the Eastern Caribbean. 
Venezuela referred to the ratifications by Dominica of Conventions 169 on Indigenous and 
Tribal People and its support of Declarations about Indigenous People rights, enshrined in 
its Constitution.  
</p>
<p>40. Belarus welcomed the efforts of Dominica as a State party to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and requested information as to the steps taken to protect children as 
envisaged by Dominica and seen as priorities for the near future. Belarus asked how severe 
the problem of trafficking in persons was in Dominica. It expressed the view that Dominica 
could make more progress in combating contemporary forms of slavery by acceding to the 
major international instruments on trafficking. Belarus made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Turkey welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Dominican authorities to address 
human rights issues. It praised the national policy and action plan for gender equality 
adopted in June 2006 as well as the law of 2001 on protection against domestic violence, 
which contains specific provisions covering various forms of violence against children. 
Turkey was aware that challenges and problems in Dominica remain. It requested more 
information on the national action plan designed to coordinate public and private sector 
activity in highlighting the needs of children. Turkey indicated that it was convinced that 
Dominica will continue to address its commitments to promote and protect human rights.  
</p>
<p>42. Maldives stated that it understood the severe technical and financial capacity 
constraints faced by Dominica and the knock-on effects this has on the promotion and 
protection of human rights. It also stated that improved reporting under those conventions 
for which Dominica is a party, the ratification of core treaties, selective engagement with 
Special Procedures, and the establishment of national human rights institutions, are 
essential building blocks for progress in human rights. Maldives made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>43. France expressed concern that the incidence of domestic violence in Dominica 
remains worrying, with over 20 per cent of women having allegedly been victims of ill-
treatment by their spouses. France recalled that perpetrators of marital rape cannot be 
prosecuted until the spouses have been legally separated and that police response in such 
cases is not fully satisfactory either. France asked what measures were being envisaged by 
the authorities to remedy to this situation. It also recalled that Dominica has not submitted 
any periodic reports to the Human Rights Committee, to the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women. France noted that only one report, to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, has been submitted in 2001. It wanted to know the difficulties which have prevented 
Dominica from reporting to the treaty bodies in keeping with its obligations. Finally, France 
raised concerns about discrimination against the indigenous Caribbean minority and asked </p>


<p>what measures have been envisaged to remedy the situation. In addition, France made 
several recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Nicaragua noted that Dominica has a regulatory and administrative framework able 
to guarantee the defence and promotion of citizen&#8217;s human rights. Nicaragua recognized the 
achievements made in the social and economic spheres and congratulated Dominica for its 
efforts to build a society free of violence giving special value to respect and equality for 
women and children. Nicaragua made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. The United Kingdom noted that, as with all countries, there are areas where more 
work would further aid implementation. It noted that Dominica has recognised a need to 
further update and strengthen legislative, institutional and procedural frameworks in order 
to reflect current international human rights norms. It welcomed Dominica&#8217;s commitment 
to making the necessary reform in the shortest possible time and acknowledged that 
limitations on progress may be imposed by capacity constraints, particularly human 
resources. The United Kingdom acknowledged Dominica&#8217;s vulnerability to natural 
disasters and the devastating effects on infrastructure and livelihoods. The United Kingdom 
made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>50. Canada welcomed Dominica&#8217;s continued press freedom, and its protection of the 
right to organize and bargain collectively. Canada noted recent reports alleging excessive 
force and punishment while making arrests, as well as poor conditions of prisons and 
detention centers. Canada raised concerns about the lengthy pre-trial and judicial 
inefficiency. Canada was also concerned with the continued problems of domestic violence 
against women, and child abuse, especially of girls. Canada noted the challenges regarding 
the situation of persons with disabilities as well as the lack of opportunities available to 
them, especially children. Canada was finally concerned about violence and discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, Canada made several 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Netherlands noted that, in spite of the number of programmes that are offered 
by several organisations, the widespread occurrence of domestic violence against women 
remains an area of concern. The Netherlands was also concerned about reports of child 
abuse in the home and school environment. It noted, among others, that the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child remained concerned about child abuse and the widespread use of 
corporal punishment in Dominica and made several recommendations in this regard. The 
Netherlands was also concerned about reports of the high incidence of teenage pregnancies. 
The Netherlands made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. Chile took note of the commitment of Dominica to the protection and promotion of 
human rights and encouraged their continuing efforts in that respect. 
</p>
<p>53. Sweden commended the efforts that Dominica has undertaken to harmonize its 
legislation with regard to children, and congratulated Dominica for the National Policy and 
Action Plan for gender equality and equity from 2006. Sweden was grateful that Dominica 
addressed its question about the Dominican Sexual Offences Act. Sweden was however 
concerned about this act that criminalizes consensual sexual activity between persons of the 
same sex. Sweden recalled that these sexual acts are punishable by between 5 and 25 years 
of imprisonment, and for some of them, psychiatric hospital treatment is prescribed. 
Sweden was also concerned about reports indicating that social discrimination against 
homosexuals is a common occurrence. Sweden thanked Dominica for the clarifications on 
the issue of death penalty. Lastly, Sweden expressed its concern about the situation in 
Dominica when it comes to discriminatory laws and practices against women in the areas of 
marriage, choice of partner, divorce, child custody, and transmission of nationality and 
inheritance. Sweden remained also concerned about the existence of child labor in rural 
areas, and about limitations in the freedom of expression. In addition, Sweden made several 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Italy acknowledged with appreciation that, since 1986, there has been a <i>de facto</i> 
moratorium on executions of people sentenced to death. It invited Dominica to consider the 
adoption of legislation on the abolition of the death penalty. Italy expressed deep concern at 
the widespread use of corporal punishment and noted that corporal punishment is 
mentioned in the Education Act of 1997 and that the Magistrates&#8217; Code of Procedure allows 
the whipping of a male child or young person. It noted that, in 2009, the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) referred to surveys according to which more than 90% of 
children experienced corporal punishment at home and school. Italy made 
recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. Spain recognized the advances in human rights maters, especially with the 
approbation of National Policies and Action Plans for gender equality and encouraged 
Dominica to continue its efforts within its national institutions<b>. </b>Spain asked if Dominica 
could explain if specific legislation exists that recognizes the particularities of the Kalingo 
indigenous population and what measures Dominica has taken to improve the access of 
indigenous children to education or health. Spain highlighted that Dominica is a country 
affected by a mixed migratory flow and questioned about the actual situation of Haitian </p>


<p>illegal immigration? Spain noted the signature of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and asked what measures are taken in order to prevent and eliminate 
discriminations against children with disabilities and in order to increase their assistance at 
school. Spain made recommendations  
</p>
<p>56. Bolivia welcomed the presentation of the national report, which showed Dominica&#8217;s 
commitments to human rights and expressed the need for technical cooperation from the 
international community. Bolivia recognized the important work done in close 
collaboration with civil society organizations and the plans to provide protection for women 
against discrimination and domestic violence and to protect children from abuse. It 
highlighted the national health plans, free education at primary and secondary levels, as 
well the recognition of indigenous population rights. Bolivia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. Azerbaijan made several recommendations on the ratification of core human rights 
instruments, on the establishment of a national human rights institution, on the abolition of 
death penalty and on legislation for refugees. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Argentina noted the respect for human rights by the Dominican Government, the 
improved mother-child health illustrated by the rate provided by the Statistic Division of 
the United Nations. Argentina noted as positive the conception and approval of the national 
action plan for gender equality. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Latvia noted with appreciation Dominica&#8217;s good human rights record, its 
commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and the openness with which 
it approached the UPR dialogue. In particular, Latvia appreciated the response given by 
Dominica in its introductory statement regarding the issue of sanding invitations to the 
Special Procedures. Latvia made a recommendation.  
</p>

<p>against Domestic Violence Act. Djibouti stated that it is fully aware that Dominica is facing 
many challenges in promoting and protecting human rights and called upon the 
international community to provide technical assistance to Dominica in order to achieve the 
millennium development goals. Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Bangladesh stated that it fully understood the formidable challenges Dominica faced 
due to it being a small island developing country which is exposed to serious 
environmental, social and economic vulnerabilities. These factors impede the efforts of the 
country in realising the human rights of its people. Concerns expressed by the treaty bodies 
especially in the areas of health, education, safe drinking water and other concerns, can 
only be effectively addressed if root causes, as identified are taken care-off. Without 
resources, Dominica will not be able to provide health care, education, access to safe 
drinking water, adequate housing and employment. It will not be able to make progress in 
the areas of political rights highlighted by many states. Dominica is doing its part and the 
international community must extend a helping hand in complimenting Dominica&#8217;s efforts. 
</p>
<p>64. Dominica thanked the President and was grateful to all the speakers that have 
spoken and stated that they were well aware of all the human rights reality and welcomed 
all the questions and recommendations put forward. 
</p>
<p>65. The delegation referred to a few broad categories of questions and recommendations 
in its response. On the question of ratification of human rights conventions that have not yet 
been ratified, the delegation mentioned the Convention on Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and stressed that Dominica will be looking at this convention very seriously. 
The Convention on Torture was also an important one and Dominica will look at the other 
human rights conventions that have not yet been ratified.  
</p>
<p>66. The delegation indicated that Dominica will be making every effort to produce the 
report for the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2010. The 
delegation agreed that that was an arena that needed to be addressed. 
</p>
<p>67. As far as amendment of legislations, the issue of the death penalty was not the 
easiest issue to deal with because there was a societal value attached to that and given the 
increasing crime in the country, even though Dominica has the lowest crime in the 
Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the issue of the death penalty was one that the 
delegation could agree, at the minimum, to a moratorium. As stated before, there was a <i>de 
facto</i> moratorium on the death penalty and no one was executed since 1986. The delegation 
believed this will continue. As to whether the death penalty can be abolished, was an issue 
for the Government to decide and the delegation could not make any comment in this 
regard. 
</p>

<p>committed to continuing engagement with the Human Rights Council and will work 
effectively to change or improve the human rights situation in the country.
