</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission made significant and far-
reaching recommendations towards reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law in Sri 
Lanka, despite its limitations. In order to define areas of possible advice and assistance by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special 
procedures pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/2, the present report examines 
the recommendations of the Commission and the plans of the Government of Sri Lanka to 
implement them, and to address alleged violations of international law. To date, the 
Government has made commitments on only selected recommendations of the 
Commission, and has not adequately engaged civil society in support of a more 
consultative and inclusive reconciliation process. The Government has made significant 
progress in rebuilding infrastructure; and while the majority of internally displaced persons 
have been resettled, considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, reconciliation and 
resumption of livelihoods. The steps taken to investigate further allegations of serious 
violations of human rights have also been inconclusive, and lack the independence and 
impartiality required to inspire confidence. Meanwhile, continuing reports of extrajudicial 
killings, abductions and enforced disappearance in the past year highlight the urgency of 
action to combat impunity. It is against this background that possible areas of technical 
assistance are identified, and recommendations are made.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/2, 
in which the Council called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the 
constructive recommendations made in the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission1 and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant legal obligations 
and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, 
accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. The Council requested the 
Government to present a comprehensive action plan detailing the steps that the Government 
had taken and would take to implement the recommendations made in the Commission&#8217;s 
report, and also to address alleged violations of international law. It encouraged the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and relevant 
special procedures mandate holders to provide, in consultation with and with the 
concurrence of the Government of Sri Lanka, advice and technical assistance on 
implementing the above-mentioned steps, and requested OHCHR to present a report on the 
provision of such assistance to the Council at its twenty-second session. 
</p>
<p>2. In June 2010, the Secretary-General appointed the Panel of Experts on 
Accountability in Sri Lanka to advise him on accountability issues in Sri Lanka and offered 
it as a resource to the Government, and particularly to the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission.2 The Panel, which submitted its report to the Secretary-
General in April 2011, found credible allegations of potential serious violations of 
international law committed by the Government of Sri Lanka and by the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).3 The Government of Sri Lanka has never afforded any credence or 
legitimacy to the report of the Panel. 
</p>
<p>3. In July 2012, the Government issued a national plan of action for the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission. According to the delegation of Sri Lanka participating in the fourteenth 
session of the universal periodic review, in November 2012, the Sri Lankan army had also 
appointed a board of inquiry to study the Commission&#8217;s recommendations and to formulate 
a viable action plan to implement the recommendations that are relevant to the army. The 
relationship of this mechanism to the national plan of action is, however, unclear. 
</p>
<p>4. In order to define areas of possible advice and assistance that could be offered to the 
Government by OHCHR and the special procedures pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/2, the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission and the steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka or plans to implement

 2 See the report of the Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka, 31 March 2011 (available 
</p>
<p>from www.un.org/en/rights/srilanka.shtml), annex 2.  
 3 According to the Panel of Experts, in the case of the Government, these were (a) the killing of 
</p>
<p>civilians through widespread shelling; (b) the shelling of hospitals and humanitarian objects; (c) the 
denial of humanitarian assistance; (d) human rights violations suffered by victims and survivors of the 
conflict; and (e) human rights violations outside the conflict zone, including against the media and 
other critics of the Government. In the case of the LTTE, these were (a) using civilians as a human 
buffer; (b) killing civilians attempting to flee LTTE control; (c) using military equipment in the 
proximity of civilians; (d) forced recruitment of children; (e) forced labour; and (f) the killing of 
civilians through suicide attacks (paras. 176-177). The panel concluded that &#8220;the credible allegations 
trigger a legal duty of the Government to conduct immediate and genuine investigations and, if the 
evidence warrants, to prosecute those most responsible&#8221; (para. 425) </p>


<p>them, and also to address alleged violations of international law, are examined in the 
present report. The report also draws on observations by an OHCHR technical mission to 
the country in September 2012.4 
</p>
<p><b> II. Engagement by the Office of the High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p>5. On 24 February 2012, the High Commissioner met with the Minister for External 
Affairs of Sri Lanka, and offered the assistance of her Office in follow-up to and the 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission. In her statement of 2 March 2012 made to the Human Rights Council at its 
nineteenth session, the High Commissioner encouraged the Government to engage with the 
special procedures and with her Office on the follow-up to the reports submitted by the 
Commission and the Panel of Experts. 
</p>
<p>6. Following the adoption by the Human Rights Council of resolution 19/2, the High 
Commissioner wrote to the Minister for External Affairs of Sri Lanka on 14 May 2012 to 
propose a visit by a delegation of OHCHR officials to Sri Lanka to explore possible areas 
of cooperation and assistance, and to help prepare the ground for an eventual country visit 
by the High Commissioner herself. 
</p>
<p>7. The OHCHR technical mission visited Sri Lanka from 13 to 21 September 2012, 
meeting with a wide range of Government counterparts, including ministers responsible for 
external affairs, economic development, defence, justice and plantation industries (the 
Minister for which portfolio is also the Special Envoy of the President on Human Rights). It 
also met with the official heading the committee tasked with overseeing the implementation 
of the national plan of action, the Attorney General, various political leaders within the 
Government and the opposition, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, civil society 
representatives, the diplomatic corps and the United Nations country team. The mission 
also visited field locations in Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya, meeting with 
the heads of the civil administration, local military commanders, regional coordinators of 
the Human Rights Commission and United Nations colleagues. On 26 November 2012, the 
High Commissioner wrote to the Minister for External Affairs to express her appreciation 
for the Government&#8217;s efforts in facilitating the visit and to propose possible areas of 
technical cooperation between OHCHR and the Government in follow-up to Human Rights 
Council resolution 19/2. The Minister replied to the High Commissioner on 17 December 
2012 (see paragraphs 57-60 below).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Engagement by human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>8. There are currently eight outstanding requests to visit Sri Lanka by special 
procedures mandate holders: on minority issues; freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association; freedom of opinion and expression; extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions; enforced or involuntary disappearances; human rights defenders; independence 
of judges and lawyers; and discrimination against women in law and practice. At the time 
of writing, none of these visits had been agreed to by the Government. The Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, on 26 July 2012, the 
Independent Expert on minority issues, on 7 January 2013, and the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>  
 4 In accordance with established practice, the Government of Sri Lanka provided its comments and 
</p>
<p>observations on the draft report, which were taken into account, as appropriate. At the request of the 
Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka, the observations of the Government on the draft report are 
circulated as an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/22/38/Add.1). </p>


<p>the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, on 30 
January 2013, wrote to the Government to offer services and support pursuant to Council 
resolution 19/2. 
</p>
<p>9. Human rights treaty bodies have also made concluding observations pertinent to the 
report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and matters of accountability 
in Sri Lanka: the Committee against Torture (in December 2011),5 the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women (in February 2011),6 and the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child (in October 2010).7  
</p>
<p><b> IV. National plan of action for the implementation of 
recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission  
</b></p>
<p>10. Although there are concerns regarding the mandate, composition and methodology 
of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission,8 including its interpretation of 
applicable principles of international humanitarian law, it made many important 
observations and far-reaching recommendations that, if implemented, could help advance 
reconciliation and respect for human rights in Sri Lanka. The Commission concluded that 
&#8220;the root cause of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka lies in the failure of successive 
Governments to address the genuine grievances of the Tamil people&#8221; and that the &#8220;process 
</p>
<p>of reconciliation requires a full acknowledgement of the tragedy of the conflict and a 
collective act of contrition by the political leaders and civil society of both Sinhala and 
Tamil communities.&#8221; The Commission also paid considerable attention to allegations 
concerning missing persons and enforced disappearances, and called for further 
investigations. Significantly, it expressed repeated concern at the lack of Government 
implementation of its own interim recommendations as well as of previous commissions of 
inquiry (paras. 8.305, 9.64, 9.74, 9.120, 9.211, 9.240 and 9.250). 
</p>
<p>11. The national plan of action issued by the Government in July 2012 deals with only 
selected recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, with no 
explanation of the process or rationale in making that selection. It is not clear whether the 
Government has completely rejected the Commission&#8217;s recommendations that have not 
been incorporated into the plan or if they will be considered at a later stage. At its universal 
periodic review in November 2012, the Government pointed out that there was some 
duplication of recommendations as well as those falling under the ambit of the National 
Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2011-2016. A number of 
significant recommendations made by the Commission and not in the Action Plan have, 
however, been excluded from the national plan of action.  
</p>
<p>12. In several instances, the implementing activity described by the Government for a 
particular recommendation does not correspond directly to the recommendation made or 
does not envisage a substantive change in current practices.9 Institutional responsibilities as 
well as the performance indicators provided in the national plan of action are not always

<p>clear or appropriate;10 and several recommendations are delegated to bodies yet to be 
established.11  
</p>
<p><b> V. Areas of concern identified in Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/2 
</b></p>
<p>13. In the section below, the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission and the steps proposed by the Government in the national plan 
of action are examined in greater detail as are more recent developments in the areas 
highlighted by the Human Rights Council in resolution 19/2 (in the fifth preambular 
paragraph), with a view to pinpointing possible areas of advice and assistance by OHCHR 
and relevant special procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Rule of law and the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>14. In its report, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission stressed that an 
independent judiciary, transparent legal process and strict adherence to the rule of law are 
essential for peace and stability. It identified a number of areas in which the integrity of key 
rule of law institutions had been compromised or where they could be further reformed and 
strengthened to promote reconciliation and generate confidence in the administration of 
justice (paras. 5.155-156, 5.163, 8.185-194 and 9.266-267).  
</p>
<p>15. The Commission welcomed the lifting of the Emergency Regulations in August 
2011, but expressed its hope that subsequent regulations would not impair any benefits 
therefrom (para. 9.56). Unfortunately, many provisions of the Emergency Regulations that 
curbed key rights, particularly related to due process, remain as provisions or regulations of 
the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Act was, for instance, recently used to arrest four 
students from Jaffna University for their reported involvement in an event held at the 
university to mark an LTTE commemorative day on 27 November; two were released on 
22 January 2013. The Committee against Torture also noted in its concluding observations 
on Sri Lanka that the President continued to invoke Section 12 of the Public Security 
Ordinance (Chapter 40) to allow the armed forces to retain policing powers in all 25 
districts (Presidential Order of 6 August 2011).12 
</p>
<p>16. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission called for the Police 
Department to be delinked from the Ministry of Defence (para. 9.214). The Commission 
also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and independent commissions, 
such as the public service commission and police commission, upholding the rule of law 
(paras. 9.202, 9.215 and 9.226). International human rights mechanisms13 previously 
expressed concern that the independence of these key institutions had been undermined by 
the 18th amendment to the Constitution adopted in 2010, which empowered the President 
to appoint members of these commissions directly, as well as senior judicial posts. This 
concern deepened recently when the Chief Justice was impeached following a series of 
attacks and acts of intimidation against judges and judicial officers, which the High

<p>Commissioner14 and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers15 
warned could undermine the independence of judiciary and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Credible investigations of widespread allegations of extrajudicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings and enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Extrajudicial killings 
</b></p>
<p>17. While the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, in its report, found it 
difficult to determine the precise circumstances under which incidents involving the loss of 
civilian lives had occurred, it recommended that the State investigate action by the security 
forces, which may have led to death or injury to civilians (paras. 9.9 and 9.37a). It also 
recommended an independent investigation into allegations of torture and extrajudicial 
killing arising from video footage broadcast by Channel 4 (para. 9.39). The Government 
assigned these recommendations to the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Department and the Presidential Secretariat for implementation. The 
Commission also recommended that an inquiry be conducted into the civilian injuries and 
deaths resulting from shelling, as well as an examination into the adequacy of medical 
supplies provided to civilians in conflict areas (paras. 9.14 and 9.22). These 
recommendations were not included in the national plan of action. 
</p>
<p>18. In its comments on the present report, the Government stated that the Sri Lanka 
army had appointed a court of inquiry to investigate the instances of civilian casualties 
mentioned in the Commission report and also to investigate the allegations broadcast on 
Channel 4, irrespective of whether the video footage was authentic. According to the 
Government, as at the time of writing, the court had examined 50 witnesses. It was 
reportedly investigating more than 50 alleged incidents of shelling mentioned in the 
Commission&#8217;s report, and would conclude its inquiry by mid-January 2013. It would 
subsequently investigate the Channel 4 allegations. No further details were provided 
regarding the composition and terms of reference of the court of inquiry. The High 
Commissioner is concerned about the transparency, independence and impartiality of this 
process, as well as for the protection of witnesses and victims. 
</p>
<p>19. In its report, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission also strongly 
recommended the implementation of recommendations from a previous, unpublished 
presidential commission of inquiry, which, in 2006, investigated alleged serious violations 
of human rights after August 2005, including the deaths of five students in Trincomalee in 
January 2006, and of 17 aid workers of the non-governmental organization Action contre la 
Faim in Muttur in August 2006 (para. 9.120). According to the national plan of action, the 
Ministry of Defence, the Police Department and the Attorney General&#8217;s Department are the 
entities responsible for implementing this recommendation. It is worth recalling that Sri 
Lanka, at the second session of the universal periodic review, accepted a recommendation 
to &#8220;ensure the adequate completion of investigations into the killings of aid workers&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>20. When the OHCHR technical mission raised concerns about the delay in these cases, 
the Attorney General responded that the quality of investigations and evidence collected 
had to date prevented him from proceeding with charges and prosecutions. In reply to the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in October 2012, the 
Government stated that the Attorney General had advised the Inspector General of Police to 
</p>
<p>  
  14  See OHCHR press briefing note dated 18 January 2013. 
 15 See press statements dated 14 November and 31 December 2012. 
 16 A/HRC/8/46, para. 82, recommendation 15. </p>


<p>conduct comprehensive investigations and had submitted to him the material collected by 
and the recommendations made by the previous commission of inquiry. The Government 
pointed out that, if adequate evidence was disclosed by the investigations, filing of 
indictment would be possible within a reasonable period thereafter. It should be highlighted 
that it is now more than five years since the presidential commission of inquiry completed 
its report, and more than six years since the incidents.  
</p>
<p>21. The importance of effective action against extrajudicial killings to prevent their 
recurrence was highlighted again by two serious incidents in which prisoners were killed 
while in custody. During a riot at Vavuniya prison, in June 2012, it is alleged that excessive 
force was used by State forces and prisoners were subjected to torture, resulting in the death 
of two remand prisoners. During another riot in Welikada prison, in November 2012, which 
resulted from a raid on the prison by special task force officers, 27 prisoners were 
reportedly killed and 43 wounded with allegations that a number were extrajudicially 
executed. The Government states that police investigations into the two cases are currently 
in progress, but no further information is available. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Missing persons and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>22. In its report, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission called for a 
comprehensive approach, as a matter of urgency, to address the issue of missing persons. It 
also called for recommendations of past commissions to be implemented given &#8220;past 
incidents of disappearances from different parts of the country&#8221; (para. 9.48). To date, the 
Government has not established a comprehensive mechanism to trace adults who went 
missing during the latter stages of the war, and investigations of disappearances have not 
yielded tangible results in the form of arrests or prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>23. A distinction should be made from the outset between missing persons and those 
forcibly disappeared. While the former are persons whose whereabouts are unknown as a 
result of, for example, armed conflict or internal violence, enforced disappearances is 
understood as the deprivation of liberty of a person by the State, direct or otherwise, and the 
refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or the concealment of the fate or 
whereabouts of the disappeared person.  
</p>
<p>24. On missing persons, the Commission recommended that every effort be made by 
law enforcement authorities in cooperation with relevant bodies, particularly the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to trace the whereabouts of missing 
persons, ensure reunification with their families, and for these families to be informed of 
such progress (para. 9.50). The Government has chosen not to include this recommendation 
in the national plan of action, although it has established a tracing programme for missing 
children. The Government reported that it had recorded 2,564 untraceable persons, of 
whom 676 were children and 1,888 adults, also noting that a large number of tracing 
requests related to children reportedly recruited by the LTTE. 
</p>
<p>25. The Commission&#8217;s recommendation on providing assistance to families of the 
missing in terms of legal aid and psychosocial support (para. 9.58) was also unfortunately 
excluded from the national plan of action. The Commission&#8217;s recommendation on the 
creation of a centralized system of data collection on missing persons maintained by 
different agencies (para. 9.51) was assigned in the plan of action to the Ministry of 
Defence, in partnership with the Department of Census and Statistics. While how this 
centralization of data collection will function still remains to be seen, it is important to 
highlight the fact that victims&#8217; relatives must have trust and confidence in it, including in 
the circumstances where Government forces are believed to be responsible for missing 
persons. </p>


<p>26. In its statement on its review during the fourteenth session of the universal periodic 
review, the Government stated that the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Act, 
No. 19 of 2010 envisages the issuance of death certificates to next of kin and the families of 
the missing to claim monies due to them. Noting this Act, the Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of 
Experts, in its report, stated, however, that:  
</p>
<p>Issuance of a death certificate following an administrative process is not a substitute 
for a bona fide investigation into the circumstances of an individual&#8217;s death, which 
</p>
<p>meets international standards. It is also crucial to ensure that a relative&#8217;s acceptance 
</p>
<p>of a death certificate does not lock the individual into a definitive legal position that 
precludes any further legal recourse in the future.17  
</p>
<p>27. Regarding enforced disappearances, the Commission recommended that a special 
commissioner of investigation be appointed and supported by experienced investigators to 
investigate alleged disappearances and to provide the Attorney General with material for 
further action (para. 9.51). Although the Government incorporated this recommendation 
into the national plan of action, it did not commit to the establishment of a new mechanism 
and has opted to rely primarily on the existing system as provided in the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, which to date has failed to resolve such cases. The Government also reported 
that a working committee had been appointed, led by a deputy inspector general, to respond 
to cases of disappearances and to conduct ground verifications of such cases to ascertain 
their current status. 
</p>
<p>28. The Commission strongly recommended that domestic legislation be framed to 
specifically criminalize enforced disappearances (para. 9.59), which the Government 
undertook in the national plan of action to examine. It should be noted that the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (in 1999), the Human Rights Committee 
(in 2003) and the Committee against Torture (in 2011) all recommended that Sri Lanka 
criminalize disappearances.18 At its review during the second session of the universal 
periodic review, the Government of Sri Lanka also accepted recommendations to &#8220;adopt 
measures to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for serious human rights 
crimes such as enforced disappearances, in accordance with international norms and in a 
transparent manner.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>29. Concerted action on this issue is particularly critical given the continuing recurrence 
of cases of enforced disappearance since the end of the armed conflict. As at November 
2012, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances had 5,676 cases of 
enforced or involuntary disappearance in Sri Lanka still outstanding. At the fourteenth 
session of the universal periodic review, the Government pointed out that more than 4,000 
of the said cases related to the pre-1990 period, while another 1,089 belonged to the period 
between 1991 and 2005. The Government added that an inter-agency mechanism was being 
established to clear the backlog of cases with the Working Group;19 however, the period 
from the last quarter of 2011 to mid-2012 witnessed new reports of abductions and 
disappearances, including of political activists,20 as well as politicians and their family 
members.21 During that period, there were also reported cases of abducted persons being

<p>minister and the son of a former provincial councillor. </p>


<p>found tortured and killed.22 The Government reports that these cases are under 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>30. In its report, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission recommended that 
a full investigation be launched and, where necessary, prosecutions be brought for cases of 
alleged disappearances of those who had surrendered to and/or been arrested by the security 
forces around the time of the end of the armed conflict (para. 9.23). In its national plan of 
action, the Government instructs the Ministry of Defence to complete an unspecified 
ongoing disciplinary process, and the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General&#8217;s 
Department to take follow-up action to prosecute, where relevant. These provisions fall 
short of an independent and impartial investigation, given that the Ministry of Defence is 
made responsible for investigating the armed forces. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Detention policies 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission recommended that law 
enforcement agencies strictly adhere to existing legal provisions with regard to powers of 
arrest and detention. It also called for all places of detention to be formally designated and 
adequately publicized, stressing the importance for detainees&#8217; access to next of kin (paras. 
9.53-55 and 9.67). The Government did not include these recommendations in its national 
plan of action. The Commission also recommended that an independent advisory 
committee be appointed to monitor and examine the arrest and detention of persons taken 
into custody pursuant to provisions of the Public Security Ordinance or the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (para. 9.57). The Government assigned this recommendation to the Ministry 
of Public Administration and Home Affairs, although the actions to be implemented lack 
clarity. 
</p>
<p>32. The Commission also recommended the establishment of a centralized 
comprehensive database of detainees to be made available to the next of kin (para. 9.63). In 
its national plan of action, the Government assigned the Ministry of Defence the task of 
enhancing the &#8220;present database&#8221; to ensure easy access to information for next of kin. In its 
comments on the present report, the Government stated that a centralized, comprehensive 
database of detainees had been established at the Terrorist Investigation Division of the 
Police, and that 3,073 next of kin had made inquiries. This does not, however, address the 
needs of those whose family members either went missing during the last stages of the war 
or surrendered to the army and disappeared thereafter. Furthermore, some of those who 
approached the designated Government entities were reportedly unable to obtain any 
information owing to the uncooperative and sometimes hostile behaviour of State officials. 
</p>
<p>33. Noting that some detainees at the Boossa Detention Centre had spent long periods of 
detention without any charges filed against them, the Commission, in its report, reiterated 
its interim recommendation that &#8220;a special mechanism be created to examine such cases on 
</p>
<p>a case-by-case basis and recommend a course of action in regard to disposal of each case, 
as appropriate&#8221; (para. 9.62). In the national plan of action, the Government called on the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Department to identify and establish procedures within the existing 
system to address this issue, and to complete decision-making regarding detainees through 
a dedicated unit in the Department. According to a progress (undated) report, a four-
member special committee was set up by the Department, which, in January 2011, began to 
study cases of LTTE suspects in detention and to expedite releases for rehabilitation or 
expedite investigations where adequate evidence of hard-core involvement in the LTTE 
</p>
<p>  
 22 For example, on 4 January 2012, a person who had been abducted the previous day was found dead 
</p>
<p>with a gunshot wound to the head. </p>


<p>was available.23 In its statement made at the fourteenth session of the universal periodic 
review, the Government declared, with regard to the treatment of ex-combatants, that, as at 
22 October 2012, 11,012 people, included 594 LTTE child soldiers, had been rehabilitated 
and reintegrated into society, and that of the approximately 12,000 identified as ex-
combatants and provided with rehabilitation, only 782 were actually undergoing 
rehabilitation, while 262 were under judicially mandated custody (remand).24 
</p>
<p>34. On 23 May 2012, the Leader of the House announced in Parliament that the 
Government had taken measures to establish four special courts to hear cases against LTTE 
suspects. Government representatives gave differing accounts to the OHCHR technical 
mission with regard to the quantity, functionality and location of the courts. The technical 
mission was also informed that the delay in the establishment of the courts had been due to 
the lack of judges and interpreters, and that the Judicature Act was being amended in order 
to expedite the appointment of judges. Although the Attorney General&#8217;s Department 
assured that the courts would be functional by the end of 2012, this was still not the case at 
the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>35. There are many concerns regarding those who have gone through the rehabilitation 
process,25 including the criteria used to subject an individual to rehabilitation; questions 
regarding the supposed voluntary nature of persons surrendering themselves for 
rehabilitation; the transfer of persons between rehabilitation and detention centres, which 
results in the deprivation of freedom of liberty of individual through the increase of the 
detention period; and the lack of such basic procedural safeguards as legal representation 
and judicial oversight for lengthy rehabilitation periods.  
</p>
<p>36. The OHCHR technical mission was further informed by the Secretary for Defence 
that those who had undergone rehabilitation were continually monitored after their release. 
It has been reported that those released have to register regularly with either the local Civil 
Affairs Office of the military, or the local army camp. In addition, multiple military and 
intelligence agencies visit the homes and even workplaces of those released for 
interrogation purposes. Such continued monitoring and harassment have an adverse impact 
on the ability of those released from rehabilitation to reintegrate successfully into the 
community, as they are perceived to be Government informants, and are therefore shunned 
by the community. Women are particularly affected by this problem and subject to stigma 
following contacts with the military.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Internal displacement and land issues 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission noted that, while the process of 
returning those displaced during the final stages of the armed conflict had largely been 
completed, concerns remained regarding the needs of those resettled (para. 9.102). In 
discussing the issue of displaced Muslims from as far back as October 1990, the 
Commission recommended the appointment of a special committee to examine durable 
</p>
<p>  
 23 Report of the Panel of Experts, p. 172, annex 2.15.3. 
 24 The Panel of Experts, quoting the figure of 11,696 persons provided by the Government, pointed out 
</p>
<p>in its report (para. 164) that the number could not be verified independently, given that the 
Government had refused independent oversight by the United Nations, ICRC or the Human Rights 
Commission of Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p> 25  Administrative detention of persons without charge or trial for purposes of rehabilitation was 
previously provided for under the Emergency Regulations, which have now lapsed. The Prevention of 
Terrorism (Detainees and Remandees) Regulations No. 4 of 2011, which were introduced whenthe 
Emergency Regulations expired, ensured the continued detention of those detained under the latter.  </p>


<p>solutions for internally displaced persons and to formulate a comprehensive State policy in 
consultation with internally displaced persons and host communities, which was included in 
the national plan of action (para. 9.113). During its universal periodic review of Sri Lanka 
in 2008, the Government also voluntarily pledged to develop a comprehensive and uniform 
compensation policy for the displaced, and to complete the process of drafting a bill on the 
rights of internally displaced persons in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. The 
Government also accepted recommendations to take the measures necessary to protect the 
rights of the displaced in accordance with international standards, including with regard to 
long-term housing and property restitution, facilitating the reintegration of displaced 
persons in areas of return, and the provision of assistance to them. The National Action 
Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2011-2016 launched in October 
2011 envisaged a national policy on displacement that would be formulated within six 
months. To date, however, no comprehensive national policy for displaced persons, no 
policy on compensation for the displaced and no legislation on the rights of the displaced 
has been drafted or adopted.  
</p>
<p>38. Another obstacle is the lack of official and comprehensive figures on internally 
displaced persons, given that no comprehensive profiling of displaced persons has been 
undertaken in Sri Lanka since 2007. At the end of 2012, a compilation of Government 
source data by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on internally displaced 
persons indicated that, of those displaced over the 26-year long conflict, approximately 
483,300<b> </b>individuals had returned to their area of origin, while about 94,000 remain 
displaced. Of those displaced after April 2008 and housed in Menik Farm following the end 
of the war, approximately 271,200 have returned to their area of origin, while an estimated 
18,000 continue to live with host families or in welfare camps, transit situations or on 
relocation sites.  
</p>
<p>39. The return of internally displaced persons to their area of origin alone does not 
imply a durable solution to their plight. The recommendation of the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission that assistance be provided to returnees to enable them to repair 
or build permanent houses, as well as for basic infrastructural needs to be met, including 
adequate roads, schools and hospitals where people have been resettled, was not 
incorporated into the national plan of action (para. 9.103). The Government has, however, 
embarked on a major reconstruction and resettlement programme for internally displaced 
persons. The OHCHR technical mission was able to visit several resettlement sites, which 
varied enormously in many respects, including the standard of housing and access to basic 
amenities.  
</p>
<p>40. In response to the Commission&#8217;s recommendation that the Government should be 
clear on its resettlement policies (para. 9.106), the Ministry of Lands is to conduct 
awareness-raising programmes on the implementation of circular No. 2011/4 of the 
Commissioner General of Lands. It should be noted, however, that the circular was 
withdrawn in January 2012 after its legality was challenged in court. The Government 
subsequently undertook to issue a new circular, which is, to date, still pending.  
</p>
<p>41. Many recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission related to land issues, including ensuring that State policy on land is not used 
as an instrument to effect unnatural changes in the demographic pattern of a given province, 
were assigned in the national plan of action to a body yet to be established, namely, a fourth 
land commission, to be appointed under the Ministry of Lands (paras. 9.124, 9.126, 9.128-
129 and 9.131-136).  
</p>
<p>42. The resolution of land-related issues is essential to attaining durable solutions for 
internally displaced persons. Some of the main land-related challenges include loss or 
damage to documentation, competing claims, landlessness, land grabs and secondary 
occupation by civilians. The lack of clarity on the Government&#8217;s approach and policy in </p>


<p>this regard not only hinders the resolution of associated issues for the displaced but also 
exacerbates feelings of mistrust and suspicion in minority populations, which account for 
the majority of all displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>43. In its report, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission strongly 
recommended that attacks on journalists and media institutions be properly and 
conclusively investigated, and urged the imposition of deterrent punishment for such 
offences (para. 9.115a-c). Under the national plan of action, investigations of current cases 
are to be completed by the police, while the Ministry of Mass Media and Information is to 
take appropriate action to ensure media freedom. Furthermore, the Ministry is to promote 
responsible journalism and consider a code of conduct for journalists, which, however, does 
not seem to be an adequate response to concerns about the security of media personnel, and 
which could instead lead to greater media control. 
</p>
<p>44. It is worth recalling that the Government accepted recommendations at its universal 
periodic review in 2008 to ensure a safe environment for human rights defenders, as well as 
to investigate allegations of attacks on journalists, media personnel and human rights 
defenders and to prosecute those responsible.  
</p>
<p>45. In 2012, journalists and media institutions continued to be harassed and attacked. In 
March, the Minister for Public Relations and the Minister for the Media made vicious 
public attacks on human rights defenders who had advocated at the nineteenth session of 
the Human Rights Council. The Minister for External Affairs publicly rejected these 
comments, but no action was taken against either minister.26 On 29 June, the Criminal 
Investigation Department raided the office of Sri Lanka X News and its sister website, Sri 
Lanka Mirror; nine staff members were arrested and later released on bail. On 5 July, there 
was a failed attempt by two men in a white van to abduct the lead investigative journalist (a 
vociferous critic of the current Government) for Sri Lanka X News. He had reportedly been 
receiving threats since 2008 for criticizing the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Demilitarization 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission made a clear recommendation 
in its report on the reduction of military involvement in civilian matters (paras. 9.171 and 
9.227), which was assigned in the national plan of action to the Ministry of Defence. The 
ubiquitous military presence in the north is not confined to the overt physical presence of 
military personnel, but extends to the deep involvement of the military in civilian matters 
through direct power transfers and exercise of power, and by indirectly preventing the 
capacity-building and effective development of civilian institutions. Several important 
civilian functions were brought under the purview of the Ministry of Defence, such as the 
Non-Governmental Organizations Secretariat and the Urban Development Authority in 
</p><p>2010.  
</p>
<p>47. Military officers informed the OHCHR technical mission that the military was able 
to deliver on different projects in areas where the civilian administration lacked capacity. In 
one particular presentation, the military was shown to be involved in a wide range of 
activities, from building and repairing homes to delivering livelihood projects to donating 
blood and transporting patients in a critical condition to medical facilities, through to 
</p>
<p>  
  26 See A/HRC/21/18, paras. 38-46. </p>


<p>organizing sporting and cultural events. The Government stressed that these are temporary 
measures until civilian institutions took over these functions. However, consideration must 
be given to whether adequate resources are being allocated for the capacity-building of 
civilian institutions in post-war Sri Lanka, as well as to the perception of such a continued 
visible military presence by the minority population in the north.  
</p>
<p>48. In addition to the remaining designated high-security zones, the military occupies 
land formerly occupied by civilians, such as Mullikulam in Mannar and Keppapulavu in 
Mullaitivu, who have since been displaced as a consequence. It is not clear whether the 
military presence in these areas is temporary or more permanent in nature; furthermore, 
those dispossessed have made claims that due process was not followed and they have yet 
to be properly compensated. In addition, and as noted by the Commission, the military is 
also involved in various economic activities with an adverse impact on the local 
population&#8217;s right to livelihood (paras. 9.171 and 9.227).  
</p>
<p>49. General members of the public are required to give notice to the local army post 
whenever they plan to hold a gathering, irrespective of size or the social or apolitical nature 
of the event. Where external actors are expected to be present at the gathering, army 
officers are known to attend and observe the proceedings. Non-governmental organizations, 
which are expected to be registered with the Non-Governmental Organizations Secretariat, 
must request authorization to undertake certain activities and keep the authorities informed 
about, inter alia, sources of funding. 
</p>
<p>50. The heavy military presence heightens the vulnerability of women and young girls 
to violence and harassment and thereby restricts their freedom of movement, which has an 
adverse impact on other aspects of their lives, including their livelihood opportunities and 
access to education.27 The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission noted 
particularly the impact of the armed conflict on certain groups, including women, and made 
several recommendations acknowledging the role of women heads of households and the 
hardships that they endure, including providing for such different needs as economic 
assistance, educational opportunities and a more secure environment (paras. 9.87-90). None 
of these recommendations were incorporated into the national plan of action. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Reconciliation and reparations 
</b></p>
<p>51. Among the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission to promote reconciliation included the establishment of a mechanism, in 
consultation with interfaith groups, to serve as an early warning system to prevent future 
conflict resulting from communal or religious tension (para. 9.270). In the national plan of 
action, the Government proposes the continuation of existing practices to implement this 
recommendation. The Government has assigned another relatively straightforward 
Commission recommendation for the national anthem to be continued to be sung in both 
Sinhala and Tamil (para. 9.277) for the consideration of a yet to be established 
parliamentary select committee. 
</p>
<p>52. The Commission made particular recommendations concerning the implementation 
of the 13th amendment to the Constitution which, among others, provides for devolution of 
powers to provincial councils. Calls have, however, increasingly been made from within the 
Government for the repeal of the amendment in the wake of Supreme Court decisions in 
favour of petitioners challenging the constitutionality of the Divineguma bill, presented in 
July 2012, which sought to assume functions currently exercised by the provincial councils 
</p>
<p>  
 27 See also CEDAW/C/LKA/CO/7, para. 41. </p>


<p>for the objective of poverty alleviation and economic development. While the Government 
is reportedly committed to the holding of (overdue) elections for the Northern Provincial 
Council, doing so without the full and proper implementation of the 13th amendment would 
leave the Council without substantive powers. 
</p>
<p>53. On reparations, the Commission considered the role of compensatory relief in 
facilitating reconciliation, and examined the structures in place, focusing its 
recommendations on ensuring that those who are eligible for payments have access to it 
within a reasonable time frame (para. 9.153). Its recommendations revolved around the 
effective working of the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority 
which is responsible for providing compensatory relief to those who suffered loss and 
damage due to terrorist violence and security forces operations. By focusing only on the 
Authority and its shortcomings, including the lack of funds, the Commission regrettably 
disregarded other forms of reparations, beyond compensation, that may be possible.  
</p>
<p>54. The Commission nonetheless acknowledged the importance of &#8220;commemorative 
gestures&#8221; in providing the necessary impetus to the reconciliation process, and strongly 
recommended the expression of solidarity and empathy with all victims of the armed 
conflict at a high political level and through a separate event on Sri Lanka&#8217;s National Day 
(para. 9.285). Although this recommendation was incorporated into the national plan of 
action, the activities proposed regrettably do not go beyond current practices. 
</p>
<p>55. Following the end of the armed conflict, memorialization, an integral component of 
reparations, has been non-inclusive, a fact that risks further disaffecting the minority 
population. While memorials to soldiers and war museums have been built by the 
Government, it has to date made no effort to commemorate civilians who lost their lives in 
the war. Furthermore, most of the memorials have been built in the Tamil-majority 
Northern Province and tend to use triumphalist images from which the local population 
feels a strong sense of alienation. LTTE cemeteries, which also utilized militarist images, 
have also been destroyed. Furthermore, since the end of the armed conflict in May 2009, 
the military has reportedly prevented civilians in the north from holding private and 
religious ceremonies to commemorate family members, both civilians and combatants, 
killed in the war. In another illustration of insensitivity, the military has constructed a 
holiday bungalow, called &#8220;Lagoon&#8217;s Edge&#8221;, on the site of the last battle during which 
thousands are believed to have been killed.  
</p>
<p>56. From the briefings that the OHCHR technical mission received on development and 
reconstruction initiatives in the north, it noted that several Government representatives 
viewed these efforts as benevolence on the part of the State, particularly towards the 
conflict-affected and minority populations, rather than the fulfilment of the State&#8217;s 
fundamental obligations towards its citizens. As a result, this may be a missed opportunity 
to couple the framework for development with a national reparations policy in which rights-
holders are entitled to redress. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Possible areas of technical assistance by the Office of the 
High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>57. Following the OHCHR technical mission, on 26 November 2012, the High 
Commissioner wrote to the Government of Sri Lanka to propose possible areas for 
technical cooperation pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/2. The proposed 
areas fall under four key components of a comprehensive and human rights-based approach 
to transitional justice, namely, the right to truth, criminal justice and accountability, legal 
and institutional reforms, and the right to a remedy and reparations. In particular, the High 
Commissioner offered advice on the establishment of a follow-up truth-seeking mechanism </p>


<p>that would examine the different accounts of past events and the history of the conflict, 
including its root causes, provide an inclusive narrative of why it happened, contribute to 
the creation of a historical record and bring clarity to the question of casualty figures. Last 
but not least, such a mechanism could also permit effective progress in resolving the cases 
of disappeared and missing persons pending proper criminal investigations. 
</p>
<p>58. Regarding past cases of serious violations of human rights identified by the Lessons 
Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, the High Commissioner urged for the publication 
of the presidential commission of inquiry report of 2006 and offered assistance in 
identifying international experts in criminal and forensic investigations to review relevant 
case files and advise on additional lines of inquiry that could help to resolve these cases in 
accordance with international standards. Advice was also offered for the drafting of laws 
dealing with witness and victim protection, the right to information, the criminalization of 
enforced disappearances and the revision of existing laws to bring them into line with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Best practices and 
comparative experiences were also offered to help strengthen and ensure the independence 
of national institutions. 
</p>
<p>59. The High Commissioner also offered technical advice in the development of a 
national reparations policy in accordance with international standards, and suggested that 
the Government consider engaging with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, 
justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, who could provide valuable advice in 
this field. The High Commissioner also recommended that the Government invite the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons to undertake a 
country visit to examine and advise on issues falling under his mandate, as well as respond 
positively to the eight outstanding requests for country visits by other special procedures. 
</p>
<p>60. The High Commissioner stressed the importance of a comprehensive approach 
addressing all the elements of transitional justice, including criminal justice and 
accountability, and of clear benchmarks with which to measure progress, based on Sri 
Lanka&#8217;s international human rights obligations. She expressed her hope of seeing 
meaningful progress in the areas described above before her country visit in the first half of 
</p><p>2013. In a letter of reply dated 17 December 2012, the Minister for External Affairs 
suggested that the High Commissioner visit Sri Lanka in early 2013 to assess first-hand the 
situation on the ground, which would then provide a meaningful basis on which to identify 
possible areas of technical assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> Achieving reconciliation following decades of violence and mistrust is 
challenging in any context, but is only possible through a genuine, consultative and 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive process that addresses the grievances of all those affected by the conflict, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>an environment where the rule of law and human rights for all are respected. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> While the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission had some limitations, 
it nonetheless made significant and far-reaching recommendations for reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and strengthening the rule of law. This was widely heralded by prominent community 
</b></p>
<p><b>figures, religious leaders and civil society in Sri Lanka eager to join hands in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>genuinely consultative and inclusive reconciliation process. The Government therefore 
</b></p>
<p><b>has a unique opportunity to build upon the </b>Commission&#8217;s <b>work and findings to move 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards a more all-encompassing and comprehensive policy on accountability and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation. Unfortunately, however, the Government has made commitments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>only some </b>of the Commission&#8217;s <b>recommendations, and has not adequately engaged </b></p>


<p><b>civil society to support this process. The steps taken by the Government to investigate 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegations of serious violations of human rights further have also been inconclusive, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and lack the independence and impartiality required to inspire confidence.  
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Give positive consideration to the offers of assistance made in her letter 
</b></p>
<p><b>dated</b> <b>26 November 2012, in particular expertise in:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The establishment of a truth-seeking mechanism as an integral part of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more comprehensive and inclusive approach to transitional justice;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Criminal and forensic investigations to review relevant case files and 
</b></p>
<p><b>advise on additional lines of inquiry to resolve outstanding cases in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Drafting laws dealing with witness and victim protection, the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>information, the criminalization of enforced disappearances and the revision of 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing laws to bring them into line with the International Covenant on Civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture</b> <b>and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Strengthening and ensuring the independence of national institutions;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) The development of a national reparations policy in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Invite special procedures mandate holders with outstanding requests to 
</b></p>
<p><b>make country visits, particularly those who have offered assistance pursuant to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council resolution 19/2; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Hold public and inclusive consultations on the national plan of action for 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission with a view to revising and expanding its scope and clarifying 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments and responsibilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Revisit and implement the </b>Commission&#8217;s <b>recommendation on appointing 
</b></p>
<p><b>a special commissioner of investigation into disappearances, and extend tracing 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes to include all missing persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Open proceedings of military courts of inquiry and future trials of LTTE 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees to independent observers to increase public confidence, and allow 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings to be evaluated in line with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Publish the final report of the presidential commission of inquiry 2006 to 
</b></p>
<p><b>allow the evidence gathered to be evaluated and accept international assistance to

<p><b>resolve outstanding cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Take further steps in demilitarization and devolution to involve minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities fully in decision-making processes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Engage civil society and minority community representatives in dialogue 
</b></p>
<p><b>on appropriate forms of commemoration and memorialization that will advance 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusion and reconciliation.</b> 
</p>
<p>64.<b> The High Commissioner noted the views expressed by many stakeholders in Sri 
Lanka, including prominent community leaders, that the attention paid by the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council to issues of accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka had helped 
</b></p>
<p><b>to create space for debate, and catalyzed positive steps forward, however limited at 
</b></p>
<p><b>this stage. The High Commissioner encourages the Council to continue its engagement 
</b></p>
<p><b>and build on this momentum. In this regard, she reaffirms her long-standing call for </b></p>


<p><b>an independent and credible international investigation into alleged violations of 
</b></p>
