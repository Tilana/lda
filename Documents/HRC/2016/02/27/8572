<p>GE.10-17828 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1.  In its resolution 7/13, the Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur 
to submit a report on the implementation of her mandate to the Council in accordance with 
its annual programme of work. In its resolution 13/20, it requested the Special Rapporteur 
to present her report at its sixteenth session. The present report comes in response to that 
request and describes the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur since her previous 
report to the Human Rights Council in September 2009 (A/HRC/12/23), which focused on 
child pornography on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>2.  Moreover, in its resolution 13/20, the Human Rights Council invited the Special 
Rapporteur to submit a joint report with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children on effective and child-sensitive counselling, 
complaint and reporting mechanisms to which children can safely report incidents of 
violence, including sexual violence and exploitation. The joint report is contained in 
document A/HRC/16/56. 
</p>
<p>3. As a result, the Special Rapporteur decided to concentrate her efforts on the 
preparation of the joint report, which involved broad consultations with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and with other 
stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>4.  This report complements the joint report and focuses mainly on activities carried out 
during the past year, in particular country visits, conferences, seminars and consultations. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since her previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/12/23), in 
September 2009, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken visits to the following countries: 
the United Arab Emirates (12&#8211;18 October 2009), Senegal (21&#8211;30 October 2009), El 
Salvador (23&#8211;31 August 2010) and the United States of America (12&#8211;27 October 2010). 
The reports on those visits are presented as addenda to this report (A/HRC/16/57/Add.2-5).  
</p><p>6. Since her previous report to the Council, the Special Rapporteur has received 
positive replies from Egypt and Mauritius to her requests to make official visits. She has 
also been invited to visit the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The Special Rapporteur is yet to 
receive replies to her requests for invitations from the following countries: Canada, the 
Gambia, India, Nepal, Nicaragua and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Conferences, seminars, consultations and the Coordination Committee 
of Special Procedures 
</b></p>
<p>7. Since September 2009, the Special Rapporteur has participated in several 
conferences, seminars and meetings, at which she frequently highlights the principles and 
provisions of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The Special Rapporteur describes the 
multiple and interdependent factors that lie behind these phenomena and urges the adoption 
of a multidimensional, comprehensive and coordinated approach in order to combat and 
prevent the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. She also insists on </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-17828 
</p>
<p>the importance of developing regional and international cooperation and sharing 
information on good practices.  
</p>
<p><b>  Conferences and seminars 
</b></p>
<p>8.  In September 2009, the Special Rapporteur attended an international conference on 
violence against women and girls, organized in Rome by the Italian Government in its 
capacity as president of the G-8, and a conference run by the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on the role of special procedures in the 
prevention of modern forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>9.  In November 2009, the Special Rapporteur attended a conference in Dresden, 
Germany, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. In December 2009, she was asked to address an open-ended 
working group on an optional protocol to the Convention to provide a communications 
procedure and called for the adoption of an optional protocol that would strengthen the 
protection of children.  
</p>
<p>10.  The Special Rapporteur also addressed a conference on street children organized by 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris in 
March 2010. In April 2010, she attended a conference entitled &#8220;The child as witness and 
subject: the cultural rights of the child&#8221; organized in Fribourg, Switzerland, by the 
Interdisciplinary Institute for Ethics and Human Rights of the University of Fribourg. She 
also addressed a consultation meeting held in late September in Geneva by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on Violence against Children on effective and child-sensitive 
counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms. In October 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
hosted a conference on child mobility organized by the Global Movement for Children, the 
Generalitat de Catalunya (autonomous regional government of Catalonia) and Save the 
Children UK. In November 2010, she attended a conference on the rights of the child in 
Paris organized by Voix de l&#8217;Enfant and entitled &#8220;Twenty years after France&#8217;s ratification 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: taking stock&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>  Campaign for the universal ratification of the optional protocols to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>11.  A campaign to promote the universal ratification of the optional protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child was launched in May 2010 in New York. The 
Special Rapporteur worked on the launch with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for Children and Armed Conflict, the Human Rights Committee, the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF). The Special Rapporteur seized the opportunity on that occasion to meet 
UNICEF and civil society representatives active in the area of child protection.  
</p>
<p>12.  In September 2010, the Special Rapporteur called for the universal ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography when she addressed the European Parliament in 
Brussels during a meeting on a draft directive of the European Parliament and the Council 
of Europe on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child 
pornography.  
</p>
<p><b>  Consultations  
</b></p>
<p>13.  Pursuing research on good practices in efforts to combat the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, the Special Rapporteur embarked on consultations in </p>


<p>GE.10-17828 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>London and Montreal, Canada, during the period under review. She intends to continue 
such consultations next year. 
</p>
<p><b>  London 
</b></p>
<p>14.  During the preparation of her previous report on child pornography on the Internet, 
the Special Rapporteur had taken note of good practices in the United Kingdom and 
therefore wanted to meet key players in London active in combating and preventing the 
exploitation of children on the Internet. Thus, in December 2009, the Special Rapporteur 
went to London to meet Government officials and representatives of public bodies 
specialized in combating the exploitation of children on the Internet. The meetings focused, 
among other things, on good practices and problems encountered in efforts to combat the 
exploitation of children on the Internet. 
</p>
<p><b>  Montreal 
</b></p>
<p>15.  In February 2010, the Special Rapporteur spoke with numerous people in Montreal 
who are actively involved in issues related to the sexual exploitation of children. In 
particular, she met police officers from the provincial youth protection department, as well 
as representatives of civil society and the heads of programmes for children vulnerable to 
sexual exploitation. The meetings focused, among other things, on good practices and 
problems encountered in efforts to combat the sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p><b>  Annual meeting on special procedures and the Coordination Committee of Special 
Procedures 
</b></p>
<p>16.  In June 2010, during the annual meeting on special procedures in Geneva, the 
Special Rapporteur was appointed chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special 
Procedures for a year. In that role, she embarked on numerous consultations and attended 
several conferences during the period under review. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Communications
