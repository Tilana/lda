<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers conducted an 
</p>
<p>official visit to Portugal from 27 January to 3 February 2015. The purpose of the visit was 
</p>
<p>to examine achievements and challenges regarding the independence and impartiality of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and the administration of justice in the country. In the present report, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur provides an overview of the legal and institutional framework and describes the 
</p>
<p>main challenges faced by the justice system. 
</p>
<p>While noting that Portugal has a solid legal framework guaranteeing the separation 
</p>
<p>of powers and the independence of judges and lawyers and recognizing society&#8217;s positive 
</p>
<p>perception of their independence, the Special Rapporteur pays attention in the present 
</p>
<p>report to various concerns reported to her during the visit, which followed a major reform 
</p>
<p>of the justice system started in 2014. The visit took place in the context of a serious 
</p>
<p>economic crisis. While recognizing that it is impossible to assess the full impact of the 
</p>
<p>various changes to the justice system, the Special Rapporteur takes note of areas where 
</p>
<p>improvements can be made. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4

<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>Concerns were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur on the pace of 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recent reforms, the security of the electronic system, the legal 
</p>
<p>instability generated by various changes and the protection of defendants&#8217; guarantees. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes that the reforms should be taken as an opportunity to promote 
</p>
<p>greater financial and administrative autonomy of the courts and the Prosecution Service and 
</p>
<p>to revisit education and training initiatives for judges, prosecutors and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also notes concerns about the effectiveness of the existing 
</p>
<p>channels for accessing justice. Various complaints were received on the delays in obtaining 
</p>
<p>legal aid and the quality of the support received, notwithstanding significant investment in 
</p>
<p>legal aid. Concerns were also raised about the lack of attention given to victims of violence 
</p>
<p>by the justice system, in particular, persons in detention and victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>Taking into consideration those observations, the Special Rapporteurs concludes her 
</p>
<p>report by calling on Portugal to: promote greater managerial and administrative autonomy 
</p>
<p>of justice institutions; ensure that the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme Council 
</p>
<p>for the Prosecution Service have adequate capacity; increase investment in promoting 
</p>
<p>access to justice; ensure specific attention is given to victims of violence; and invest in the 
</p>
<p>training of judges, prosecutors and lawyers.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers conducted an 
</p>
<p>official visit to Portugal from 27 January to 3 February 2015. The purpose of the visit was 
</p>
<p>to examine, in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue, achievements and challenges regarding 
</p>
<p>the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and the administration of justice in 
</p>
<p>Portugal. 
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur visited the cities of Lisbon, Porto and 
</p>
<p>Coimbra. Meetings were held with representatives of the main authorities in the area of 
</p>
<p>justice, including the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Internal Administration, the 
</p>
<p>Presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Justice (also President of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Judicial Council) and the Supreme Administrative Court (also President of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Council for the Administrative and Tax Courts, the Attorney General (also 
</p>
<p>President of the Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service) and the Commission for 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Affairs, Rights, Freedoms and Guarantees of the Portuguese National 
</p>
<p>Assembly. She also met judges and public prosecutors working in courts of appeal and first 
</p>
<p>instance courts, the Ombudsman and the Director of the Centre for Judicial Studies. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with numerous representatives of civil society, 
</p>
<p>including representatives of non-governmental organizations, the Portuguese Bar 
</p>
<p>Association and the unions representing magistrates and prosecutors, independent lawyers, 
</p>
<p>and academics researching the functioning of the justice system in Portugal. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to the Government of Portugal and, 
</p>
<p>in particular, officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for preparing an extensive 
</p>
<p>programme of meetings and visits with full respect for the independence of her mandate. 
</p>
<p>She also thanks all those who met with her, sharing their experiences, informed opinions 
</p>
<p>and concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>5. The independence of judges and lawyers is one of the bedrocks of the rule of law 
</p>
<p>and democratic rule. Portugal expresses its commitment to guaranteeing this independence 
</p>
<p>through its national legislation, including the Constitution, and through the ratification of 
</p>
<p>the main international and regional human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>6. Portugal is party to most international and European human rights treaties,1 
</p>
<p>including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Portugal is party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocol thereto, the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the International Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol thereto, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols 
</p>
<p>thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict, on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
</p>
<p>child pornography and on a communications procedure and the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The country&#8217;s adherence to 
</p>
<p>these treaties means that it must, inter alia, recognize the obligations to guarantee the rights 
</p>
<p>related to the proper administration of justice, including the principles of equality before the 
</p>
<p>law, the right to an effective remedy, the right to liberty and security of the person, the 
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence, the right to a fair and public hearing without undue delay by a 
</p>
<p>competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, the fundamental 
</p>
<p>procedural guarantees of persons charged with a criminal offence and the principle of 
</p>
<p>legality. 
</p>
<p>7. In the Portuguese Constitution, it is stipulated that the rules and principles of 
</p>
<p>international law shall form an integral part of Portuguese law, that provisions set out in 
</p>
<p>ratified international agreements shall come into force in Portuguese domestic law (art. 8), 
</p>
<p>and that the provisions of the Constitution and of laws concerning fundamental rights shall 
</p>
<p>be interpreted and construed in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(art. 16). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>8. In the Constitution of Portugal, adopted in 1976 following the country&#8217;s return to 
</p>
<p>democratic rule, the principle of separation of powers is expressly recognized in its 
</p>
<p>article 2. In addition, in part I of the Constitution, fundamental rights and freedoms are 
</p>
<p>listed, in accordance with the relevant international standards in this regard. These include 
</p>
<p>guarantees of access to the law and the courts, the right to legal counsel and to be 
</p>
<p>accompanied by a lawyer before any authority (art. 20), the right to life (art. 24), the right to 
</p>
<p>personal integrity (art. 25) and the right to freedom and security except as a consequence of 
</p>
<p>a judicial sentence (art. 27). 
</p>
<p>9. The judicial authority is regulated mainly by part III, headings V and VI of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. In part III, heading V, chapter I, general principles regarding the courts are 
</p>
<p>outlined, which include provisions for the independence of the courts (art. 203), the 
</p>
<p>supremacy of the Constitution (art. 204), public court hearings (art. 206) and the 
</p>
<p>immunities necessary for lawyers (art. 208). 
</p>
<p>10. Part III, heading V, chapter III concerns the status of judges. It contains guarantees 
</p>
<p>for judges, including the guarantee of security of tenure and that judges will not be held 
</p>
<p>personally liable for their rulings (art. 216), provides for the appointment, assignment, 
</p>
<p>transfer and promotion of judges (art. 217) and establishes the Supreme Judicial Council 
</p>
<p>(art. 218). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Court structure 
</b></p>
<p>11. As indicated, in the Constitution, the courts are recognized as supreme authoritative 
</p>
<p>bodies that administer justice in the name of the people (art. 202) and as independent and 
</p>
<p>subject only to the law (art. 203), and their rulings are established as binding on all persons 
</p>
<p>and bodies, public and private, prevailing over the decisions of all other authorities 
</p>
<p>(art. 205). All court rulings that are not merely administrative in nature must be duly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>with Disabilities. Portugal has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the 
</p>
<p>Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. At the European level, the country is 
</p>
<p>party to the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Social Charter (Revised). 
</p>
<p>Portugal has also accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>competence of the European Committee of Social Rights and the European Committee for the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>motivated (art. 205). Court hearings are public, subject to certain exceptions, including 
</p>
<p>public interest (art. 206). The Portuguese justice system has the following categories of 
</p>
<p>courts: the Constitutional Court; judicial courts; administrative and tax courts; the Court of 
</p>
<p>Auditors; maritime courts; arbitration tribunals; and magistrates&#8217; courts (art. 209). 
</p>
<p>12. Over the past three years, Portugal has been carrying out a major reform of its 
</p>
<p>judicial system structure (see details in the section below). Decree-Law 49/2014 was issued 
</p>
<p>in September 2014, to implement the Law on Judicial Organization (Law 62/2013 of 26 
</p>
<p>August 2013) establishing the rules applicable to the organization and functioning of the 
</p>
<p>judicial courts. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Courts of first instance 
</b></p>
<p>13. Portugal is now divided into 23 judicial districts, with the main judicial court of each 
</p>
<p>based in the capital of the respective administrative districts (with the exception of the 
</p>
<p>districts of Lisbon and Porto, which are divided into three and two court districts, 
</p>
<p>respectively). Each district court is split into central and local court departments. Central 
</p>
<p>court departments have jurisdiction over the court district and are divided into civil 
</p>
<p>sections, criminal sections and sections with specialized jurisdiction, including sections for 
</p>
<p>commercial, enforcement, family and minors, criminal and labour matters. Cases not 
</p>
<p>allocated to central court departments are processed by local court departments, which have 
</p>
<p>general jurisdiction sections divided into civil, criminal, petty crime and local sections. The 
</p>
<p>local court departments also include courts with specialized and broadened territorial 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, for example, the sentence enforcement courts, the maritime courts, the 
</p>
<p>intellectual property courts, the Competition, Regulation and Supervision Court and the 
</p>
<p>Central Criminal Inquiry Court. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Appeal courts 
</b></p>
<p>14. Second instance courts function mainly as appeal courts. There are five such courts 
</p>
<p>in the country, in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, &#201;vora and Guimar&#227;es. Second instance courts 
</p>
<p>may have civil, criminal and labour sections and, depending on the volume of cases, 
</p>
<p>sections specializing in family and minors, commerce, intellectual property and 
</p>
<p>competition. According to their respective competence, sections examine appeals, as well 
</p>
<p>as proceedings initiated against first instance judges and prosecutors, hear cases concerning 
</p>
<p>international judicial cooperation on criminal matters, and review and confirm foreign 
</p>
<p>judgements. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Supreme Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Supreme Court of Justice is the highest body in the hierarchy of courts of law, 
</p>
<p>but in principle it only examines matters of law, rather than specific facts. It comprises five 
</p>
<p>judges and hears cases appealed from the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Justice is 
</p>
<p>divided into civil, criminal, labour and dispute claims chambers; the latter tries appeals filed 
</p>
<p>against the decisions issued by the Supreme Judicial Council. The support staff of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Justice is currently composed of 65 judges. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Administrative and tax courts 
</b></p>
<p>16. Under the Portuguese Constitution, administrative and tax courts are also established 
</p>
<p>and are governed by the Supreme Administrative Court. The role of the administrative and 
</p>
<p>tax courts is to settle disputes arising from administrative and tax relations. These courts 
</p>
<p>include the central administrative courts, the circuit administrative courts and the tax courts. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Constitutional Court is also established under the Constitution and is 
</p>
<p>specifically responsible for administering justice in matters of a legal and constitutional 
</p>
<p>nature (art. 221). It is composed of 13 judges, 10 of whom are elected by the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly and 3 co-opted by those elected. They enjoy the same safeguards as all judges, 
</p>
<p>including independence, immovability, impartiality and immunity. 
</p>
<p>18. Besides ruling on conformity with the Constitution and the law, the Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Court has competence in electoral matters and passes judgement in last instance on the 
</p>
<p>regularity and validity of acts of the electoral procedure. It also verifies the legality of the 
</p>
<p>establishment of political parties and coalitions and verifies in advance the constitutionality 
</p>
<p>and legality of national, regional and local referendums. At the request of parliamentarians 
</p>
<p>and as laid down in law, it also rules on appeals concerning losses of seats and elections 
</p>
<p>held by the National Assembly and the regional legislative assemblies (art. 223 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution). 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Supreme Judicial Council 
</b></p>
<p>19. Under the Constitution, the Supreme Judicial Council (art. 218) is attributed with the 
</p>
<p>competences of appointing, assigning, transferring and promoting judges, as well as acting 
</p>
<p>as the disciplinary body for the judiciary. The Council is composed of seven members 
</p>
<p>appointed by the National Assembly, seven magistrates elected by their peers and two 
</p>
<p>members appointed by the President of Portugal. Members of the Supreme Judicial Council 
</p>
<p>have the same guarantees enjoyed by all judges. The President of the Supreme Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice is also the President of the Supreme Judicial Council. 
</p>
<p>20. The Statute of the Judiciary (Law 21/85 of 30 July 1985, currently under revision) is 
</p>
<p>the most important norm regulating the exercise of the judicial powers established under the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. The Statute also provides guarantees of independence, protection against 
</p>
<p>personal liability and security of tenure for judges (arts. 4&#8211;6, respectively). 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Prosecution Service 
</b></p>
<p>21.  In part III, heading V, chapter IV of the Constitution, the general role of the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General is defined as that of representing the State, participating in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of criminal policy, conducting penal action in accordance with the principle 
</p>
<p>of legality and defending the democratic rule of law (art. 219). Public prosecutors also 
</p>
<p>enjoy guarantees of independence. The Office of the Attorney General is presided over by 
</p>
<p>the Attorney General, who has a term of office of six years. 
</p>
<p>22. The Statute of the Prosecution Service (Law 47/86 of 15 October 1986, currently 
</p>
<p>under revision) regulates the work of prosecutors, reflecting the assurances of their 
</p>
<p>independence and autonomy proclaimed in the Constitution. The appointment, transfer and 
</p>
<p>promotion of prosecutors, as well as the application of disciplinary measures, is under the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service. The Council is chaired 
</p>
<p>by the Attorney General and is composed of all district prosecutors, seven prosecutors 
</p>
<p>elected by their peers, five members appointed by the National Assembly and two by the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Statute of the Bar Association 
</b></p>
<p>23. The rights and duties of lawyers are defined in the Statute of the Bar Association 
</p>
<p>(Law 15/2005 of 26 January 2005, also under review during the time of the visit &#8212; see 
</p>
<p>further comments below). The code of ethics of lawyers is part of the Statute of the Bar 
</p>
<p>Association. The Bar Association has also adopted the Code of Conduct for European 
</p>
<p>Lawyers, which is binding for Portuguese lawyers conducting cross-border activities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of the 
judiciary and the proper administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>24. The overall perception in Portugal that the judiciary is independent is possibly one 
</p>
<p>of the most important achievements of the transition to democratic rule in the country. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the visit, multiple interlocutors not only acknowledged the overall adequacy of 
</p>
<p>the legal framework protecting the independence of judges, prosecutors and lawyers, but 
</p>
<p>also underlined their shared perception that the various actors in the justice system were 
</p>
<p>independent. Indeed, recent studies, such as the 2015 European Union Justice Scoreboard, 
</p>
<p>have indicated that the perception of independence in the country slightly increased over 
</p>
<p>the past four years and placed Portugal close to the average within the European Union in 
</p>
<p>this regard.2 
</p>
<p>25. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that the independence of the judiciary is not 
</p>
<p>a fixed achievement secured by the adoption of adequate norms and practices. Ensuring the 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary requires permanent monitoring and identifying and tackling 
</p>
<p>the multiple problems faced daily by judges, prosecutors and lawyers, as well as those who 
</p>
<p>come into contact with the justice system. 
</p>
<p>26. Over the past decades, studies of the Portuguese justice system have highlighted 
</p>
<p>challenges with regard to such issues as the length of proceedings and difficulties in 
</p>
<p>accessing courts.3 For example, attention was called to the time needed to resolve litigious 
</p>
<p>cases before first instance civil courts: the Portuguese average was over one year according 
</p>
<p>to 2012 data.4 Statistics compiled by the European Court of Human Rights also show that 
</p>
<p>violations related to the length of civil, criminal, administrative and enforcement 
</p>
<p>proceedings (violations of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) 
</p>
<p>corresponded to over half of all violations identified in cases brought against the country in 
</p>
<p>the European Court between 1959 and 2014.5 The problem clearly mostly affects first 
</p>
<p>instance courts, while at the appeal and superior levels the length of proceedings is 
</p>
<p>considered to be adequate. These problems have triggered a number of reforms and 
</p>
<p>initiatives, some of which are described below. 
</p>
<p>27. During the visit, various authorities and civil society representatives remarked on 
</p>
<p>two recent situations demonstrating the most significant challenges currently faced by the 
</p>
<p>Portuguese justice system. Firstly, Portugal had to confront a major economic depression. 
</p>
<p>In May 2011, Portugal agreed a three-year economic adjustment programme with its 
</p>
<p>creditors. The country exited this programme in June 2014 and is now under post-
</p>

<p>poverty levels and it is noteworthy that recent data have indicated that, in 2013, 19.3 per

<p>public services, and in particular for those in the justice system as, for example, the salaries 
</p>
<p>of judges and prosecutors decreased between 2008 and 20127 and the overall budgets 
</p>
<p>allocated to courts decreased by 14.3 per cent between 2010 and 2012.8 In this difficult 
</p>
<p>context, tensions also reached courtrooms; the Constitutional Court, in particular, faced 
</p>
<p>strong pressure from society when it considered the constitutionality of some controversial 
</p>
<p>cost-reducing measures proposed by the Government. The fact that it declared the 
</p>
<p>unconstitutionality of some measures was presented by many interlocutors as an important 
</p>
<p>indicator of the independence of the Portuguese judiciary. 
</p>
<p>28. Secondly, in the context of the crisis and allegedly as part of the structural reforms 
</p>
<p>agreed as part of the economic adjustment programme, the Government is conducting a 
</p>
<p>major reform of the Portuguese justice system and, at the time of the visit, various 
</p>
<p>important measures had either been in place only for a few months or were not yet fully 
</p>
<p>achieved. The reported aims of these reforms included expediting court proceedings, 
</p>
<p>improving efficiency and accountability and speeding up debt enforcement cases. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Ongoing reforms to the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>29. Over the past years, Portugal has taken several initiatives to simplify and streamline 
</p>
<p>the functioning of its justice system and optimize the use of financial and human resources. 
</p>
<p>These include investments in alternative dispute resolution, the complete computerization 
</p>
<p>of the management and administration of the civil courts and successive legal reforms. 
</p>
<p>Among the most recent legal measures are amendments to the Criminal Code and the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Statute of Judicial Administrators, a new Code of Civil Procedure and a law 
</p>
<p>instituting the complete reorganization of the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Reform through the new </b>&#8220;<b>judicial map</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. As of September 2014, the geographical organization of the judicial system was 
</p>
<p>entirely reformed on the basis of Law 62/2013 of 26 August 2013. The new &#8220;judicial map&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>as it is known, is part of an extensive reform with three main objectives: (a) broadening the 
</p>
<p>territorial base of the court districts, which as a rule should coincide with the main towns 
</p>
<p>and cities of Portugal; (b) setting up specialized courts at the national level; and (c) 
</p>
<p>implementing a new management model for the court districts. 
</p>
<p>31. The previous division of the courts into 233 districts was based on a model 
</p>
<p>recognized as outdated and impractical, as it dated back to the nineteenth century and 
</p>
<p>neglected the significant political, social and economic transformations that had occurred 
</p>
<p>since. The new judicial map consolidated the courts into 23 new court districts, each with a 
</p>
<p>main judicial court based in the respective capital of the administrative district. Lisbon and 
</p>
<p>Porto are the exceptions in that the courts in those administrative districts have been 
</p>
<p>consolidated into three and two court districts, respectively. 
</p>
<p>32. Under the new structure, central court departments are divided into civil sections (as 
</p>
<p>a rule, processing and judging cases with a value exceeding &#8364;50,000), criminal sections (to 
</p>
<p>prepare and judge criminal cases to be heard by a collegiate court or before a jury) and 
</p>
<p>sections with specialized jurisdiction, including sections for commercial, enforcement, 
</p>
<p>family and minors, criminal and employment matters. The local court departments process 
</p>
<p>and adjudicate cases not allocated to the central court departments and have general 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction sections that may be divided into civil, criminal, petty crime and local sections. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4

</p>
<p>33. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the new judicial map had 
</p>
<p>been drawn up during an extensive consultative process involving all actors of the justice 
</p>
<p>system and took into account a pilot experiment implemented in 2008 in three districts. It 
</p>
<p>also underlined the goal of changing the management model of the courts, promoting 
</p>
<p>greater autonomy and establishing specific goals for and objective criteria to assess 
</p>
<p>efficiency in the administration of justice at various levels. In accordance with the law, 
</p>
<p>courts are managed by a management board headed by judges who administer the court 
</p>
<p>jointly with a representative of the Office of the Attorney General and a judicial 
</p>
<p>administrator. The Government further stressed the importance of the specialization process 
</p>
<p>and the expansion of the territorial scope of specialized courts, which increased to cover 88 
</p>
<p>per cent of the territory, from 22 per cent. 
</p>
<p>34. It is clearly too early to assess the impact of the reform after only six months of 
</p>
<p>implementation of the most important measures. Nevertheless, during the visit of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, concerns were expressed at the pace of implementation of the new 
</p>
<p>judicial map and the capacity of the new system to properly respond to the newly 
</p>
<p>established goals. It was reported that some courts had been installed in temporary and 
</p>
<p>unsound buildings, although the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, of the 
</p>
<p>three courts based in temporary buildings, one had already been transferred to a new 
</p>
<p>facility. Concerns were also raised with regard to the process of specialization and the pace 
</p>
<p>of the establishment of the various specialized courts, as it was alleged that some 
</p>
<p>specialized magistrates did not have the necessary experience of the fields that they were to 
</p>
<p>cover. Similarly, it was indicated that, despite the specialization of courts in the first 
</p>
<p>instance, the specialization could not be fully implemented at the higher levels. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes information received according to which the Centre for Judicial 
</p>
<p>Studies has improved specialized training for judges and magistrates. 
</p>
<p>35. Despite a reported two-year-long consultation process leading to the formulation and 
</p>
<p>adoption of the new judicial map, civil society groups and experts have questioned the 
</p>
<p>openness of the consultation. Some expressed concern that placing the courts in the capitals 
</p>
<p>of the administrative districts would result in parts of the population living in remote areas 
</p>
<p>being farther from the courts and about the lack of consideration given to alternatives to 
</p>
<p>facilitate access through, for example, mobile courts, convening on an ad hoc basis in 
</p>
<p>remote areas. 
</p>
<p>36. The most obvious problem faced in the transition to the new judicial map was the 
</p>
<p>collapse of CITIUS, the country&#8217;s electronic system for the civil courts. Although Portugal 
</p>
<p>is one of only 12 countries within the Council of Europe to have achieved complete 
</p>
<p>computerization of civil justice courts,9 progress which was certainly important in 
</p>
<p>promoting greater accessibility and possibly in reducing delays, the existing electronic 
</p>
<p>platform did not adequately support the redistribution of court proceedings during the 
</p>
<p>transition to the new judicial map. This resulted in the paralysis of the courts for up to a 
</p>
<p>month and a half when the judicial year started on 1 September 2014. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government clarified that the problems related to the electronic system had 
</p>
<p>been solved and that the system was fully in place again by 30 December 2014. It also 
</p>
<p>noted that it had launched a disciplinary inquiry to identify responsibilities and adopted a 
</p>
<p>specific law10 to allow for the extension of deadlines of ongoing proceedings affected by 
</p>
<p>the breakdown. Nevertheless, it is evident that the system&#8217;s collapse generated widespread 
</p>
<p>doubts about the preparatory process for the reforms and the overall sustainability of this 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>vital electronic system, which, despite having been praised as an important achievement in 
</p>
<p>the recent past, still requires systematic investment and adaptation. 
</p>
<p>38. Additional concerns were raised with regard to the adequate protection of the mass 
</p>
<p>of electronic data, in particular given its confidential nature. The Ministry of Justice, 
</p>
<p>through the Institute for Justice Financial Management and Infrastructures, is currently 
</p>
<p>responsible for the management and maintenance of the electronic system. Following the 
</p>
<p>crisis, some judges and legal experts publicly voiced their concern about the fact that an 
</p>
<p>institution within the executive branch continues to administer the entire electronic database 
</p>
<p>of the courts, creating avenues for inadequate service and improper interference. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>although officials of the Ministry of Justice have assured the public that they do not have 
</p>
<p>direct access to the data, they were directly involved in the recovery and re-establishment of 
</p>
<p>the data system.11 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur believes that the management and maintenance of the 
</p>
<p>electronic system of the database of the courts should be under the sole responsibility of the 
</p>
<p>judicial bodies. This independence from the executive will enhance the independence of the 
</p>
<p>entire judicial system and its accountability, in particular regarding the management of 
</p>
<p>confidential information. </p>
<p><b> 2. Other important legal reforms 
</b></p>
<p>40. In addition to promoting the complete reorganization of the justice system, the 
</p>
<p>Government also recently implemented various additional legal reforms. These include the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a new Code of Civil Procedure (Law 41/2013 of 26 June 2013) and changes in 
</p>
<p>norms for insolvency, both aiming at promoting greater efficiency in the justice system. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the new Code of Civil Procedure establishes that a court hearing cannot be 
</p>
<p>postponed without justification. It also simplifies the procedures for the enforcement of 
</p>
<p>judicial orders and establishes important punitive measures for unjustified acts aimed at 
</p>
<p>slowing down proceedings. 
</p>
<p>41. Another measure taken to speed up proceedings was the adoption of an extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>procedure prior to enforcement, through Law 32/2014 of 30 May 2014. The procedure 
</p>
<p>enables a creditor with a pending writ of execution to request that an enforcement agent 
</p>
<p>trace a debtor&#8217;s assets so as to verify whether he or she has assets that may be seized before 
</p>
<p>the creditor lodges the corresponding writ of execution. While recognizing the contribution 
</p>
<p>of this measure to alleviating the pressure on the courts, some lawyers indicated their 
</p>
<p>concern at the facilitated access to multiple databases by enforcement agents and the 
</p>
<p>possible exploitation of these mechanisms for financial gain. 
</p>
<p>42. Various amendments were adopted to reform both the Criminal Code and the Code 
</p>
<p>of Criminal Procedure.12 Some of these were also aimed at simplifying and expediting 
</p>
<p>proceedings; in particular Laws 19/2013, 20/2013 and 21/2013 allow for greater 
</p>
<p>possibilities for summary enforcement of measures in specific cases. One of the changes 
</p>
<p>introduced created the possibility of using testimonies collected in the preliminary stages of 
</p>
<p>investigation at the trial stage and eliminated the possibility of appealing against prison 
</p>

</p>
<p>sentences of less than five years handed down by appeal courts. Some legal experts 
</p>
<p>expressed concern with regard to both measures and their possible impact in weakening due 
</p>
<p>process guarantees for defendants. For example, it was noted that the fact that a prison 
</p>
<p>sentence of less than five years handed down by an appeal court, which followed an 
</p>
<p>acquittal from a first instance court, could no longer be appealed may in practice violate the 
</p>
<p>right to a review by a higher instance. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts of the Government to speed up and 
</p>
<p>simplify proceedings, given the notorious issues in the past regarding delays in the justice 
</p>
<p>system. Nevertheless, she takes note of the concerns brought to her attention by lawyers 
</p>
<p>and judges in relation to the risks of weakening defendants&#8217; due process rights and 
</p>
<p>guarantees. She also takes note of the concerns raised with regard to the instability 
</p>
<p>generated by the frequency of changes to some laws, such as the Criminal Code, which has 
</p>
<p>been changed on 35 occasions since 1982, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, which has 
</p>
<p>been amended 26 times since 1987. A 2011 study already noted that the excessive number 
</p>
<p>of legal reforms and the lack of the necessary attention given to the quality of the new 
</p>
<p>norms, and their potential impact, constituted a serious problem in the country.13 Even if 
</p>
<p>some legal changes are timely and aimed at bringing norms into accordance with 
</p>
<p>international and regional agreements, continued changes can be very problematic, not only 
</p>
<p>because they can complicate the work of judges, prosecutors and lawyers, but also because 
</p>
<p>they obviously make it more difficult for the public in general to understand norms and 
</p>
<p>proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Financial administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>44. One of the main goals of the new judicial map is the promotion of a new 
</p>
<p>management model for the court districts. This model ensures greater involvement of the 
</p>
<p>management boards in the administration of the courts. Judges and prosecutors are tasked 
</p>
<p>not only with the management of resources allocated to their areas of work, but are 
</p>
<p>encouraged to establish targets and can request and propose changes. The recent reform 
</p>
<p>also creates consultative councils composed of representatives not only from the local 
</p>
<p>justice community, but also local authorities and civil society. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>would like to highlight that financially empowering the courts and the Prosecution Service 
</p>
<p>will be crucial for the success of the judicial reform. The lack of an effective mechanism to 
</p>
<p>ensure accountability for the efficient administration of justice institutions is also an 
</p>
<p>important concern to be addressed; such a mechanism would promote a more efficient and 
</p>
<p>accessible justice system. 
</p>
<p>45. While welcoming the steps taken to increase the involvement of the courts and 
</p>
<p>Prosecution Service in the management of their daily activities, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes that the overall administration of budgets for the justice system continues to be done 
</p>
<p>mostly by entities within the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry is ultimately responsible for 
</p>
<p>the preparation of overall budgets for all justice institutions, the allocation of resources to 
</p>
<p>specific courts and the overall evaluation of the management of resources. Such a model is 
</p>
<p>not an exception in Europe.14 Nevertheless, during her visit, concerns were expressed to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur regarding the negative impact of the lack of proper facilities and 
</p>
<p>material conditions of work on the activities of courts, which allegedly results from the lack 
</p>
<p>of financial independence. The Special Rapporteur was also told that the productivity of 
</p>
<p>judges, especially in first instance courts, was affected when they lost their assistants or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 See Garoupa, <i>O Governo da Justi&#231;a</i>, p. 76. 
</p>
<p> 14 See CEPEJ, &#8220;Report on &#8216;European judicial systems&#8217;&#8221;, p. 39. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>when the latter were transferred or reallocated by the Ministry of Justice without prior 
</p>
<p>consultation. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to underline that the majority of the 
</p>
<p>complaints expressed were linked to the functioning of the first instance courts, which are 
</p>
<p>administered by the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>46. Recognizing that clear guarantees for judicial independence are established under 
</p>
<p>Portuguese legislation and acknowledging the Government&#8217;s expressed intentions of 
</p>
<p>promoting greater autonomy in the management of the courts, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>wishes to encourage the implementation of practical measures to promote the overall 
</p>
<p>budgetary, financial and administrative autonomy and independence of the courts and the 
</p>
<p>Prosecution Service, in line with the aims of the judicial reform. Centralizing the judiciary&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>financial and administrative functions within the Ministry of Justice seems to undermine 
</p>
<p>their independence and limit the possibility of holding judges and prosecutors accountable 
</p>
<p>for the efficient exercise of their functions. 
</p>
<p>47. According to some judges and prosecutors, the scarcity of financial and material 
</p>
<p>resources resulting from the economic crisis affecting the country has had an impact on the 
</p>
<p>management of their daily activities. For example, various prosecutors and judges noted 
</p>
<p>with concern the increasing difficulties in receiving the necessary technical and human 
</p>
<p>resources to support them in the performance of their work. The Ministry of Justice recently 
</p>
<p>announced the hiring of 600 additional support staff in response to these concerns. The lack 
</p>
<p>of expert technical assistance also very often creates difficulties for prosecutors, who 
</p>
<p>frequently need to request support from public officials working in other State institutions, 
</p>
<p>thereby leading to undue delays in the exercise of the prosecutors&#8217; functions. Some public 
</p>
<p>prosecutors further reported facing difficulties in planning and executing their work, as 
</p>
<p>sometimes annual budgets did not fully cover expenditure over the entire year, obliging 
</p>
<p>them to negotiate additional allocations during the course of investigations. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>difficulties in long-term planning can particularly impair the implementation of more 
</p>
<p>complex initiatives, such as those pertaining to collective rights. The specific interest of the 
</p>
<p>Government in initiatives which could generate resources, such as the creation of a specific 
</p>
<p>task force to expedite the processing of the potentially most valuable fiscal cases within the 
</p>
<p>fiscal and administrative justice system, can also generate distortions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme Council for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prosecution Service 
</b></p>
<p>48. During the period of the visit, as a consequence of the reorganization of the justice 
</p>
<p>system, reforms to the Statute of the Judiciary and the Statute of the Prosecution Service 
</p>
<p>were under discussion. These reforms offer an important opportunity to strengthen the roles 
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service, for 
</p>
<p>example, by establishing the greater involvement of these two entities in the formulation 
</p>
<p>and management of the overall budgets of courts and prosecution offices. Unfortunately, 
</p>
<p>the draft proposals for the new statutes were not publicly available at the time of the 
</p>
<p>writing. 
</p>
<p>49. Both the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme Council for the Prosecution 
</p>
<p>Service are mandated, inter alia, to conduct routine evaluations, implement disciplinary 
</p>
<p>procedures and manage the promotions of judges. Regardless of the results of the reform 
</p>
<p>and the possible involvement of these entities in the financial administration of the justice 
</p>
<p>system, ensuring adequate human and technical capacity to both councils is crucial for the 
</p>
<p>promotion of efficiency and accountability within justice institutions. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur noted with concern that some routine evaluations of judges were 
</p>
<p>reportedly conducted after significant delay owing to the limited capacity of the existing 
</p>
<p>evaluation mechanisms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>50. Some judges reported to the Special Rapporteur their concern about the potentially 
</p>
<p>negative impact of some inspection methods, which appeared to overemphasize specific 
</p>
<p>quantitative indicators, such as the precise fulfilment of procedural deadlines, while 
</p>
<p>overlooking information on success in the conclusion of cases, as well as ignoring some 
</p>
<p>differences in the personal situation of judges (including health-related situations or 
</p>
<p>pregnancy). While she recognizes the need to prevent judicial delays, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur understands that overemphasis of deadlines could, in some situations, affect the 
</p>
<p>delivery of justice, as judges could be compelled to ensure that the cases under their control 
</p>
<p>meet the time frames established, at the expense of other essential guarantees. 
</p>
<p>51. The Association of Judges also expressed concern with regard to the current 
</p>
<p>composition of the Supreme Judicial Council, which currently includes a majority of 
</p>
<p>appointees who are not selected by their peers. The Special Rapporteur endorses this 
</p>
<p>concern and calls for adjustment to the model for appointment, taking into account, for 
</p>
<p>example, the 2010 recommendation on judges of the Committee of Ministers of the Council 
</p>
<p>of Europe, which suggested that not less than half the members of such councils be judges 
</p>
<p>elected by their peers. 
</p>
<p>52. A recent conflict between the executive branch and the Supreme Council for the 
</p>
<p>Prosecution Service regarding the appointment of a Portuguese prosecutor to work in 
</p>
<p>Eurojust (the entity created to support and strengthen coordination and cooperation between 
</p>
<p>national investigating and prosecuting authorities within the European Union) was also 
</p>
<p>brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>53. The procedure for appointing a prosecutor to serve on Eurojust was, until 2014, 
</p>
<p>regulated by Law 36/2003 of 22 August 2013. Under the law (art. 3), the Minister of Justice 
</p>
<p>and the Minister of Foreign Affairs were to appoint the prosecutor, at the suggestion of the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General in consultation with the Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service. In 
</p>
<p>2013, this process reportedly reached a stalemate as the Minister of Justice questioned the 
</p>
<p>reappointment of the prosecutor already posted to Eurojust, required the consideration of 
</p>
<p>alternative candidates and suggested two other names to the Supreme Council. The Council 
</p>
<p>members refused to accept the suggestion of the Minister and maintained its decision to 
</p>
<p>renew the term of the incumbent representative. During some nine months, the tension 
</p>
<p>persisted and ultimately led to the departure of the incumbent prosecutor and the 
</p>
<p>appointment of one of the candidates originally suggested by the Ministry of Justice. In 
</p>
<p>2014, the Minister of Justice amended the article regulating the appointment process 
</p>
<p>through Decree-Law 20/2014 of 10 February 2014, eliminating the involvement of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service in proposing the candidates for membership 
</p>
<p>of Eurojust and instead assigning the nomination of three candidates to the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General. 
</p>
<p>54. Some prosecutors shared with the Special Rapporteur their deep frustration at the 
</p>
<p>exclusion of the Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service from the appointment 
</p>
<p>process, particularly considering the overall tensions between the Council and the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice in 2013. They underscored the risks of attributing to the executive branch the role 
</p>
<p>of ultimately deciding on the appointment of an official whose tasks very frequently may 
</p>
<p>involve investigating crimes of corruption, which can involve the national authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>55. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur looked into the proposal of reforming the 
</p>
<p>Statute of the Bar Association. She noted that the presentation in early 2015 of a proposal 
</p>
<p>for a new statute of the Bar Association gave rise to the tensions between the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice and the Bar Association, which she views as a matter of concern. While unable to 
</p>
<p>examine the content of the bill, which was still under discussion during the visit, the Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur underlines that it is essential that the design and adoption of a new statute of the 
</p>
<p>Bar Association be done with the meaningful participation of the legal profession. 
</p>
<p>Regardless of the nature of the revisions, it is fundamental that the absolute independence 
</p>
<p>of the bar be guaranteed. As stated by in the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the 
</p>
<p>State must abstain from any interference in the establishment and functioning of 
</p>
<p>professional associations of lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>56. Legal aid is both a right in itself and a precondition for the exercise and enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of a number of fundamental rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy. The European Convention on Human Rights, regional jurisprudence and 
</p>
<p>resolutions adopted in the European context15 clearly encourage States to develop legal aid 
</p>
<p>systems. Since Portugal has faced a clear increase in poverty levels over the past four years, 
</p>
<p>the impact of the costs related to access to the justice system need specific attention to 
</p>
<p>prevent them from becoming an obstacle to accessing justice, which  would affect precisely 
</p>
<p>the sectors of the population which may need legal aid the most. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes the Government&#8217;s new initiative to assess the legal aid system&#8217;s gaps and to 
</p>
<p>tackle the difficulties identified in order to improve its efficiency and equity. 
</p>
<p>57. Access to law and justice is enshrined in the Constitution (art. 20) and governed by 
</p>
<p>Law 34/2004 of 29 July 2004, amended by Law 47/2007 of 28 August 2007. In accordance 
</p>
<p>with the legal framework, no one should be prevented from exercising or defending their 
</p>
<p>rights because of their social or cultural status, or lack of financial means; legal protection 
</p>
<p>in the process for obtaining legal advice (prior to formal court proceedings) and legal aid 
</p>
<p>(including for alternative dispute resolutions) are also provided for. Such legal protection 
</p>
<p>may be granted to Portuguese citizens and citizens of other European Union member States, 
</p>
<p>as well as foreign nationals, including those without valid residential permits, when their 
</p>
<p>respective countries provide similar protection for foreign nationals.  
</p>
<p>58. In 2012, the Government reported spending an average of &#8364;5.26 per inhabitant on its 
</p>
<p>legal aid system, which is similar to some other countries in the region (despite a great 
</p>
<p>variation of expenditure levels between States, which makes this data difficult to 
</p>
<p>compare).16 Eligibility for legal aid is determined by the Institute for Social Security. Once 
</p>
<p>a request is accepted, the aid is provided by a lawyer affiliated to the Bar Association or a 
</p>
<p>court official who has volunteered for inclusion on a special register for that purpose. For 
</p>
<p>those obtaining aid, the costs of proceedings are exempted or reduced, depending on the 
</p>
<p>economic situation of the beneficiary. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports from civil society representatives 
</p>
<p>and lawyers indicating that the cost of legal proceedings had increased in recent years and 
</p>
<p>that the eligibility criteria for obtaining legal aid were too narrow. For example, persons 
</p>
<p>with very limited financial resources would not be eligible for legal aid once the value of 
</p>
<p>their home had been taken into account in the assessment of their financial situation. 
</p>
<p>Complaints about excessive delays in the designation of a lawyer and the quality of the 
</p>
<p>assistance provided were also reported. 
</p>
<p>60. Complaints were also made about the fact that the piecemeal division of 
</p>
<p>responsibilities for the provision of legal aid between the justice system, the Institute for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 See, for example, Council of Europe resolution (76) 6 on legal aid in civil, commercial and 
</p>
<p>administrative matters, resolution (78) 8 on legal aid and advice and recommendation No. R (93) 1 on 
</p>
<p>effective access to the law and to justice for the very poor. 
</p>
<p> 16 See CEPEJ, &#8220;Report on &#8216;European judicial systems&#8217;&#8221;, p. 76. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>Social Security, the Bar Association and the Prosecution Service seems to contribute to the 
</p>
<p>system&#8217;s inefficiency and unacceptable delays in the effective designation of a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, according to some lawyers and civil society representatives, owing to the 
</p>
<p>comparatively low remuneration, the legal aid system only attracts lawyers with less 
</p>
<p>experience and fewer qualifications. 
</p>
<p>61. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the system of legal aid has 
</p>
<p>received satisfactory evaluations and that, in 2013, the Institute for Social Security 
</p>
<p>calculated that 72.2 per cent of the legal aid requests received were accepted. It also 
</p>
<p>reported that the eligibility criteria in place had been revised in order to broaden eligibility, 
</p>
<p>clarifying that it factors in the combination of the household income, accumulated capital 
</p>
<p>and permanent expenditures, while noting that the possession of a home had a limited 
</p>
<p>impact only on this calculation. Furthermore, it noted that, to facilitate understanding, 
</p>
<p>applicants could use an online simulator to assess their eligibility for legal aid. 
</p>
<p>62. With regard to complaints about the delays in obtaining legal aid, the Government 
</p>
<p>reported that, in most cases, these delays resulted from applicants&#8217; failing to provide the 
</p>
<p>necessary documentation for obtaining it. It also noted that the Institute for Social Security 
</p>
<p>had been involved in determining eligibility since 2000 (previously the system had been 
</p>
<p>managed entirely by the courts) precisely in order to expedite and facilitate access to legal 
</p>
<p>aid services, as the Institute for Social Security has the necessary expertise and knowledge. 
</p>
<p>The Government further reported that the Bar Association, as an independent entity, was 
</p>
<p>responsible for ensuring and monitoring the quality of the legal support provided. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, a mechanism for evaluating the overall functioning of the legal aid system 
</p>
<p>composed of representatives from the Bar Association, the Institute for Social Security and 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice was established in 2008 and the first evaluation report was presented in 
</p>
<p>2009. 
</p>
<p>63. While she recognizes the importance of the various efforts taken to expand access 
</p>
<p>to, and ensure the quality of, the legal aid system, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
</p>
<p>importance of further and more systematic evaluation of how it can be improved. For 
</p>
<p>example, she observes that, even if delays may be related to applicants not providing 
</p>
<p>adequate documentation, it is still necessary to identify how the process can be simplified. 
</p>
<p>To address problems relating to the piecemeal division of responsibilities and variations in 
</p>
<p>the quality of legal aid, she suggests evaluating alternatives, such as establishing 
</p>
<p>institutional bodies for public defence. The Special Rapporteur was informed that this 
</p>
<p>alternative is under evaluation as part of the legal aid system assessment currently under 
</p>
<p>way. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur also received complaints concerning the difficulty of 
</p>
<p>understanding judicial decisions and proceedings. Legal experts and civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives noted that, sometimes, the use of excessively complex language could, for 
</p>
<p>instance, make judicial measures unintelligible to victims. In this regard, she was also 
</p>
<p>informed of efforts to promote more succinct decisions within the justice system. On 
</p>
<p>another issue, judges and prosecutors noted that they needed more professional support in 
</p>
<p>communicating with the media. As most judicial institutions do not receive such support, 
</p>
<p>members of the judiciary sometimes struggle to convey information on their work and to 
</p>
<p>cope with media demands. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p>65. Obstacles to accessing justice can have a particularly harmful impact on sectors of 
</p>
<p>the population particularly vulnerable to violence, such as persons in detention, women, 
</p>
<p>children and elderly people. When describing challenges posed in accessing lawyers and 
</p>
<p>legal aid, civil society representatives and legal experts expressed their concern about the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>situation of persons in detention. According to them, the guarantees of access to a lawyer 
</p>
<p>during the time of detention and throughout the serving of sentences were not adequately 
</p>
<p>ensured, often exposing persons in detention to poor conditions and sometimes even to 
</p>
<p>abuse. 
</p>
<p>66. Concerns regarding the conditions in Portuguese prisons have already been 
</p>
<p>expressed by international and European human rights protection mechanisms. In 2012 and 
</p>
<p>2013, respectively, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about, inter alia<i>, </i>the recurrent use of and excessive length of pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention, physical ill-treatment and other forms of abuse at the hands of prison guards, as 
</p>
<p>well as the poor conditions in certain prisons (see CCPR/C/PRT/CO/4 and 
</p>
<p>CAT/C/PRT/CO/5-6). The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman 
</p>
<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment visited the country in 2012 and expressed a similar 
</p>
<p>concern regarding increasing overcrowding in prisons and the lack of effective access to 
</p>
<p>legal assistance for persons detained by law enforcement officers.17 Recommendations from 
</p>
<p>these various bodies include a call for ensuring access to a lawyer from the moment police 
</p>
<p>custody starts. In order to tackle the problem of pretrial detention, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee also recommended reducing the length of investigations and legal procedures, 
</p>
<p>improving judicial efficiency and addressing staff shortages (see CCPR/C/PRT/CO/4, para. 
</p>
<p>9). 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns previously expressed by other human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms regarding the situation of prisons. To address situations relating to the 
</p>
<p>conditions of detention and the ill-treatment of persons deprived of their liberty, it is 
</p>
<p>essential that access to lawyers be ensured and that prosecutors pay specific and systematic 
</p>
<p>attention to the situation of such persons and the conditions in detention facilities. While 
</p>
<p>noting the recent efforts of the Government to expedite legal proceedings, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that more attention should be paid to cases where the use of pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention could be excessive. 
</p>
<p>68. Domestic violence was acknowledged by authorities and civil society as a great 
</p>
<p>concern in Portugal. Concerns were expressed about the response of the justice system to 
</p>
<p>violent incidents affecting children, women and the elderly.  The Committee on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child, the Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee have 
</p>
<p>recently recommended that the Government invest in the effective investigation and 
</p>
<p>prosecution of cases of domestic violence (see CRC/C/PRT/CO/3-4, CAT/C/PRT/CO/5-6 
</p>
<p>and CCPR/C/PRT/CO/4). 
</p>
<p>69. The Government reported to the Special Rapporteur that, in 2007, article 152 of the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code was amended and that measures to protect victims of domestic violence 
</p>
<p>were thus specified therein. Efforts to prevent and respond to domestic violence are also 
</p>
<p>detailed in the national plan against domestic and gender-based violence, which includes 
</p>
<p>measures for prevention, awareness-raising and education, as well as protection for victims 
</p>
<p>and promotion of their social integration. The fifth version of the plan (2014&#8211;2017) is 
</p>
<p>currently being implemented and, given the multidisciplinary nature of the issue, the 
</p>
<p>implementation is supported by a working group composed of representatives from various 
</p>
<p>government entities, including representatives from the Office of the Attorney General and 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Judicial Council, as well as civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>70. Despite these initiatives, various concerns about the impact of violence and the 
</p>
<p>alleged lack of adequate responses to victims in some cases were also reported to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 See Council of Europe, Report to the Portuguese Government on the visit to Portugal carried out by 
</p>
<p>the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment, CPT/Inf (2013) 4 (2012), p. 16. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. In 2013, 40 women were reportedly killed by their partners, ex-partners 
</p>
<p>and close family members, and 46 attempted murders against women were recorded by 
</p>
<p>civil society in Portugal.18 The Portuguese Association for the Protection of Victims, which 
</p>
<p>directly cooperates with the Government to promote assistance for victims, reported a 
</p>
<p>significant increase in the number of cases of violence against the elderly, pointing to the 
</p>
<p>lack of capacity of those professionals who should promptly intervene in these situations.19 
</p>
<p>The same association also noted that responses to violence against children are also 
</p>
<p>frequently inadequate. Accordingly, children&#8217;s involvement in judicial proceedings is often 
</p>
<p>a source of secondary victimization, mostly owing to repeated questioning. It further noted 
</p>
<p>the limited use of protection orders and foster-care alternatives. Lastly, it indicated that the 
</p>
<p>entities specialized in child welfare, the Child and Young Persons Protection Commissions, 
</p>
<p>were overloaded, as various institutions tended to systematically refer their cases to them. 
</p>
<p>71. In a recent and detailed study20 on court rulings regarding domestic violence, the 
</p>
<p>limited capacity of prosecutors and judges in processing and sharing data on situations of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence, the particular invisibility of violence against the elderly, children or 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, the lack of attention given to the victims&#8217; needs and the excessive 
</p>
<p>focus on their testimony in the processing of cases, which could lead to their frustration and 
</p>
<p>re-victimization, were underscored, among other issues. In the same report, the urgency of 
</p>
<p>investing in the capacity of judges and prosecutors was emphasized, in order to ensure not 
</p>
<p>only a good understanding of the relevant national and international norms but also the 
</p>
<p>social problems surrounding their implementation. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur notes that the proper education and awareness-raising of 
</p>
<p>judges and prosecutors are paramount for a better performance of judicial actors in the 
</p>
<p>treatment of all victims of crimes. This is especially needed as a means to avoid the 
</p>
<p>reproduction of prejudices in court rulings or the adoption of contradictory measures, for 
</p>
<p>instance in relation to custody, which could facilitate the access of known aggressors to 
</p>
<p>their victims. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts made by the Centre for 
</p>
<p>Judicial Studies in providing training that pays particular attention to human rights and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Education, training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>73. In addition to the promotion of law and policy reforms, the education, training and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building of judges, prosecutors and lawyers is essential for fully transforming the 
</p>
<p>practices of the judiciary. As noted above, some concerns exist with regard to the 
</p>
<p>preparation of judges and prosecutors assigned to specialized courts and on the capacity of 
</p>
<p>judicial actors to communicate and properly respond to the needs of victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>Addressing these challenges requires continued investment in capacity-building both for 
</p>
<p>those already active in the justice system and for those who are being recruited. 
</p>
<p>74. In Portugal, the Centre for Judicial Studies is the main institution responsible for the 
</p>
<p>initial and continuing training of judges and public prosecutors. Created in 1979, the Centre 
</p>
<p>operates under the aegis of the Ministry of Justice, but has administrative autonomy. The 
</p>
<p>Centre plans its activities in consultation with the Supreme Judicial Council, the 
</p>
<p>administrative tribunals and the Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service, providing 
</p>

<p>specialized training initiatives whenever requested by these various entities. Public 
</p>
<p>prosecutors and judges undertake their initial year of training together and are then 
</p>
<p>separated into different groups according to their preferences or marks. Every year, the 
</p>
<p>Centre also provides many specialized courses, seminars and one-day courses both in situ 
</p>
<p>and through videoconference. 
</p>
<p>75. While recognizing the importance and extent of the training activities offered by the 
</p>
<p>Centre for Judicial Studies and its significant contribution since the transition to democracy, 
</p>
<p>legal experts and civil society representatives indicated their concern about the reported 
</p>
<p>legal formalism privileged in the training activities offered by the Centre, and the lack of 
</p>
<p>attention given to ongoing social challenges and to disciplines that are not exclusively 
</p>
<p>legal.21 Concerns were also voiced about the reported limited attention given to human 
</p>
<p>rights law, not only in the Centre but also in some Portuguese law schools. 
</p>
<p>76. In a previous annual report (see A/HRC/14/26, para. 97), the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>noted that judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers must be adequately educated 
</p>
<p>and informed on a regular and continuing basis of new developments in international 
</p>
<p>human rights law, principles, standards and case law. In this regard, she wishes to recall the 
</p>
<p>importance of periodically revising existing training instruments and university courses and 
</p>
<p>curricula in order to better respond to social challenges and better integrate multiple sources 
</p>
<p>of knowledge into the education and training of judges and prosecutors. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Portugal has repeatedly expressed its commitment to guaranteeing the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence of the judiciary through its national legislation and the ratification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the main international and regional human rights treaties. The overall positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>perception of the independence of the judiciary in the country indicates that these 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments are mostly reflected in practice. Despite this favourable context, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of the independence of judges, prosecutors and lawyers and of the proper 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration of justice requires constant attention and further investment so that 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial actors and institutions can better respond to emerging and remaining 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The visit of the Special Rapporteur took place at a moment of intense debate on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the functioning of the Portuguese justice system, as the Government was 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing major reforms in the administration and distribution of courts. At the 
</b></p>
<p><b>same time, over the past four years, the entire country has been confronted with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>major economic crisis that also has affected justice actors and institutions, as public 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources became scarce. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the importance 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the role played by the Constitutional Court in preserving the integrity of the rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>established in the Constitution, in particular during the economic crisis. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>It is too early to fully assess the impact of the various recent reforms. However, 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns were expressed about the pace of implementation of these reforms, access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice, the security of the electronic system, the legal instability generated by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>many and frequent amendments to legislation and the possible weakening of 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees for defendants. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The reform process also opens up important opportunities for discussing again 
</b></p>
<p><b>the roles of judges and prosecutors in the administration of their own offices. 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 See, for example, Sousa Santos Boaventura, <i>Para uma Revolu&#231;&#227;o Democr&#225;tica da Justi&#231;a</i> (2014), 
</p>
<p>p. 117. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Reinforcing the autonomy and capacity of the Supreme Judicial Council and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Supreme Council for the Prosecution Service is vital for promoting greater efficiency 
</b></p>
<p><b>and accountability. Reforms also represent an opportunity to revisit education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>training initiatives for judges, prosecutors and lawyers, in order to update them and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that human rights are adequately represented. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>With the increase in poverty levels, it is essential that Portugal continue to pay 
</b></p>
<p><b>the utmost attention to the effectiveness of the existing channels for accessing justice, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in particular concerning vulnerable groups. Despite investments in legal aid, concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b>were expressed with regard to delays in obtaining legal aid and the quality of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>support received. In this regard, victims of violence deserve specific attention in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts aiming to improve access to justice, as the lack of particular attention can lead 
</b></p>
<p><b>to victims of domestic violence being re-victimized during legal proceedings, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>lack of the systematic support of lawyers can render persons in detention more 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable to abuse. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to hear that the legal aid 
</b></p>
<p><b>system is being assessed with the view to improving its efficiency. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Enhancing the managerial administrative independence  
</b></p>
<p><b>of justice institutions 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The ongoing reforms should be seized as an opportunity to evaluate ways in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which the overall budgetary, financial and administrative autonomy of the courts and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Prosecution Service can be enhanced. In addition to promoting operational 
</b></p>
<p><b>autonomy within courts, empowering actors within the justice system with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>management of the resources required in their daily activities is important to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>efficiency and accountability. The Supreme Judicial Council, the Supreme Council of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Administrative and Fiscal Magistracy and the Supreme Council for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prosecution Service could play a greater role in the preparation of overall budgets for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the justice system, the allocation of resources to specific courts and the overall 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluation of the management of resources. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring the adequate capacity of the oversight bodies  
</b></p>
<p><b>within the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The effective functioning of justice requires the State to continuously ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human and technical capacity of the Supreme Judicial Council, the administrative 
</b></p>
<p><b>and tax judiciary and the Prosecution Service. The reform of the statutes of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>entities must be thoroughly debated, given their central role in the promotion of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence, efficiency and accountability of the justice system. Attention must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>paid to eliminating delays and ensuring full transparency and fairness in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of all disciplinary and evaluative processes. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Increasing investment in the promotion of access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Further investments are required to ensure that mechanisms providing access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to justice reach those who need it the most. Eligibility criteria and, in particular, 
</b></p>
<p><b>documentation requirements for the provision of legal aid must be revised to avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>these becoming obstacles to obtaining legal aid. Systematic evaluations of the quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and effectiveness of the legal aid system must be carried out and their results </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>thoroughly discussed. In that context, consideration should be given to the possible 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of an office for public defence in the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Paying specific attention to victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Particular attention must be paid to all obstacles preventing victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>from accessing justice. Access to a lawyer from the moment police custody starts, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as during the serving of sentences, must be systematically guaranteed in practice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Attention should continue to be paid, and efforts made, to limit the use of pretrial 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention and to improve conditions of detention, as recommended by other human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights protection mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Judges, prosecutors and lawyers must continue to receive adequate training in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to better respond to domestic violence cases. Judicial proceedings must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>carefully revised in order to prevent the re-victimization of victims. Investments can 
</b></p>
<p><b>also be made in raising awareness of the existing mechanisms to report domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, of the impact of all forms of violence, including gender-based violence, on 
</b></p>
<p><b>society and of the existence of violence against children, persons with disabilities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the elderly. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Investing in the training of judges, prosecutors and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Investments must be made to review and update the education, training and 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building curricula, programmes and courses for lawyers, judges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors. This should not only include sustained attention being given to reviewing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the work of the Centre for Judicial Studies, but also the courses offered by Portuguese 
</b></p>
<p><b>law schools, in order to keep up-to-date with the latest case law and developments in 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards. Attention must be paid to ensuring a multidisciplinary approach that is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>confined to formal legal content and enables a good understanding of the social, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic and cultural dimensions of the problems brought before the courts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Attention must also be paid to enhancing the understanding of international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights law, principles, standards and case law.
