<p>The Government further stressed that &#8220;The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture

implementation of the provisions of the &#8220;European Convention for the Prevention of Torture or 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment&#8221;.

The CPT has been closely monitoring the imprisonment and health conditions of convict &#214;calan. 
CPT reports on the detention conditions are all published with the consent of the Turkish 
Government. 
</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights, in its judgment on 12 May 2005, has already declared the 
imprisonment conditions of &#214;calan to be in conformity with the requirements of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and international law. The Grand Chamber of the Court has 
concurred with the fact that &#214;calan&#8217;s &#8220;<i>detention poses exceptional difficulties for the Turkish 
authorities</i>&#8221; and that &#8220;<i>it is understandable that the Turkish authorities should have found it 
necessary to take extraordinary security measures to detain &#214;calan</i>&#8221;. The Court further decided 
that &#8220;<i>&#214;calan cannot be regarded as being kept in sensory isolation or cellular confinement</i>&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#214;calan enjoys the basic rights accorded to all inmates in high security closed prisons in Turkey. 
These include access to means of redress, health and psycho-social services, outdoor privileges, 
as well as books, newspapers, periodicals and radio. Receiving visits, consulting with legal 
representatives, establishing communication with the outside world through letter and telegram 
is also available. 
</p>
<p>As to consultations with his representatives, between 11 March 1999 and 11 June 2008, &#214;calan 
received 326 visits from a total of 1055 visitors. Out of 326 visits, 324 were by his legal 
representatives including foreign lawyers, amounting to 1041 visitors. The remaining 14 visitors 
were 8 officials, visiting him twice and 6 interpreters who were accompanying foreign lawyers. 
Moreover, the convict met his sisters and brother 135 times at 108 visits between 2 April 1999 
and 30 April 2008. 
</p>
<p>International law, guidelines and practices regarding the execution of penal sentences show that 
it is suitable and common to detain dangerous criminals in high security institutions. In countries 
such as Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, 
Sweden, Denmark Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Austria to name a few, dangerous criminals 
are also detained alone in maximum security cells, where extraordinary security measures are 
applied. 
</p>
<p>According to Recommendation R(82)17 and its explanatory memorandum concerning dangerous 
criminals adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, activities of such 
prisoners can be restricted for the security of the prison and they can be detained in single rooms 
separated from the prison community. 
</p>
<p>Articles 67, 68 and 69 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners provide that some convicts by reason of their criminal records or bad character may be 
separated from other convicts and this can be done within the same institution or in separate 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>In light of the foregoing, the allegation that &#214;calan is kept in isolation remains baseless.&#8221;
