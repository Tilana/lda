<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, Michel Forst, to the Human Rights Council, pursuant to resolution 
</p>
<p>25/18 of the Human Rights Council. The document provides observations on the 
</p>
<p>communications on specific cases addressed by the Special Rapporteur to States, as well as 
</p>
<p>observations on the replies received from States.  
</p>
<p>2. The cases raised by the Special Rapporteur in this report include urgent appeals, 
</p>
<p>allegation letters and other letters sent between 1 December 2013 and 30 November 2014 
</p>
<p>and responses received from States from 1 December 2013 until 31 January 2015. It also 
</p>
<p>contains late responses received from communications issued during previous reporting 
</p>
<p>periods. The report also includes press releases issued between 1 December 2013 and 28 
</p>
<p>February 2015, as well as updates and follow up information received on individual cases 
</p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur up to the end of February 2015. 
</p>
<p>4.  For ease of reference, cases have been grouped by region, with countries within 
</p>
<p>each region listed alphabetically according to their names in English.  Each communication 
</p>
<p>is referenced in one of six categories: urgent appeal (UA), allegation letter (AL), other letter 
</p>
<p>(OL), joint urgent appeal (JUA), joint allegation letter (JAL) and joint other letter (JOL). 
</p>
<p>This is followed by the date that the communication was issued, as well as the case number 
</p>
<p>and the date of the State&#8217;s reply. The electronic version of the present document contains 
</p>
<p>hyperlinks to both the communications and the replies from the concerned States, and 
</p>
<p>clicking on them will open the documents, as uploaded on the OHCHR website. In bold, is 
</p>
<p>a short reference to the allegations contained in the communication in the language of 
</p>
<p>submission. Press releases (PR) published during the reporting period are referenced below 
</p>
<p>the communications, with a hyperlink to the statement as uploaded on the OHCHR website. 
</p>
<p>In bold, is title of the press release in the language of the statement. 
</p>
<p>5.  The Annex contains information on the communications procedure, including 
</p>
<p>information on how to submit allegations to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>6. Between 1 December 2013 and 30 November 2014, the Special Rapporteur sent 231 
</p>
<p>communications to 84 States. Of these communications, 128 were urgent appeals and 103 
</p>
<p>were allegation letters.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur drew attention to the situation of over 530 people, of whom 
</p>
<p>119 were women. 88 cases consisted of follow-ups on persons or organisations that were 
</p>
<p>previously the subject of communications, including 23 press releases. 
</p>
<p>8. Examined by region, the figures show that 80 communications were addressed to 
</p>
<p>countries in the Asia-Pacific region (35%); 49 to countries in the Americas (21%); 37 to 
</p>
<p>countries in the Middle East and North Africa (16%); 37 to countries in Europe and Central 
</p>
<p>Asia (16%); and 26 to countries in Africa (11%). 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur sent 32 communications concerning acts of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>reprisals against human rights defenders for their cooperation with the United Nations, its 
</p>
<p>representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. These cases included a wide 
</p>
<p>range of violations committed against human rights defenders, from harassment, intimidation, 
</p>
<p>smear campaigns, direct threats and travel bans to arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of 
</p>
<p>medical treatment and physical attacks. Communications were sent to the following 22 
</p>
<p>countries: Bahrain, China, Cuba, Cyprus, Egypt, Honduras, India, Iran, Malaysia, the 
</p>
<p>Maldives, Mexico, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Viet Nam.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10.  With regard to such cases of intimidation and reprisals, the Special Rapporteur wishes 
</p>
<p>to reiterate that the Human Rights Council, in resolution 22/6, strongly called upon all States to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;refrain from, and ensure adequate protection from, any act of intimidation or reprisals against 
</p>
<p>those who cooperate, have cooperated or seek to cooperate with international institutions, 
</p>
<p>including their family members and associates&#8221;. Furthermore, he would like to recall that, in 
</p>
<p>resolution 24/24, the Council urged all States to prevent and refrain from all acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation or reprisal against those who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, or who have provided 
</p>
<p>testimony or information to them. It also urged States to ensure accountability for any acts of 
</p>
<p>such intimidation or reprisal and to take all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of 
</p>
<p>intimidation or reprisals. The Secretary-General, in his 2014 report on cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, reminded that it is primarily the obligation of States to protect those who 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights and to ensure that they may do so safely and without hindrance. He urged to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;collectively denounce reprisals, defend the right to cooperate freely with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>and protect those targeted&#8221;.1  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur also sent 28 communications concerning draft legislation at 
</p>
<p>the national level that could have a negative impact on the environment in which human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders perform their activities.  
</p>
<p>12. At the time of writing, 128 replies had been received to the 231 communications 
</p>
<p>sent, a response rate of 55 per cent which is a significant increase on the numbers of 
</p>
<p>responses received during the previous reporting period. While certain replies were simply 
</p>
<p>acknowledgements of receipt, the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank countries who have 
</p>
<p>fully engaged and cooperated with the Special Procedures mechanisms and provided 
</p>
<p>detailed replies with information in response to the allegations addressed therein. 
</p>
<p><b>AFRICA REGION 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. During the present reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 26 communications 
</p>
<p>to countries in the African region. He takes note of the response rate of 35 per cent for the 
</p>
<p>region, which is the lowest response rate of any region. He therefore urges States who have 
</p>
<p>not responded to his communications as part of a continuous dialogue and cooperation and 
</p>
<p>ensure that the issues raised in the communications are thoroughly addressed. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at instances of arbitrary arrest and 
</p>
<p>detention, as well as judicial harassment and unfair court proceedings, of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders due to their peaceful and legitimate human rights work. He is particularly 
</p>
<p>concerned by the high percentage of communications related to the involvement of State 
</p>
<p>actors in the harassment and prosecution of human rights defenders in the region. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, in communications to a number of countries in the region, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur draws attention to the use of ambiguous legislation, such as anti-terrorism laws 
</p>
<p>that result in the criminalisation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate concern regarding the introduction of 
</p>
<p>anti-homosexuality legislations in the region that criminalise legitimate activities of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders that work to protect and promote rights of LGBTI persons.

</b></p>
<p>16. Another issue of concern is related to the restrictions on the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>assembly and association, including legislation pertaining to peaceful protests and 
</p>
<p>assembly, as well as instances of the excessive use of force against protesters. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur considers these measures to be a disproportionate response, which limits the 
</p>
<p>legitimate activities of human rights defenders.

<p>18. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Angola for the 
</p>
<p>response received to the communication sent during his reporting period.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his concerns regarding information 
</p>
<p>received on the alleged excessive use of force against protesters involved in peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstrations on the part of the authorities, in particular regarding the alleged killing of 
</p>
<p>human rights defender Mr. Manuel &#8216;Gange&#8217; de Carvalho. He also expresses his concern 
</p>
<p>regarding information received of arrests and arbitrary detention of protesters and

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of finalising this report, no response 
</p>
<p>has been received to the communications sent during the reporting period, especially due to 
</p>
<p>the serious nature of these allegations.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the misuse of anti-terrorism legislation 
</p>
<p>to curb freedom of expression and of association in the country, as was the subject of a 
</p>
<p>Press Release in September 2014 by a group of United Nations human rights experts. He 
</p>
<p>further reiterates the call to release all those detained arbitrarily under the pretext of 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism measures due to their peaceful and legitimate work as human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, political opponents, journalists and religious leaders.  The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>remains concerned regarding the denial of specialised medical treatment of Ms. Reeyot 
</p>
<p>Alemu who is detained on charges of &#8220;promotion or communication of a terrorist act&#8221; due 
</p>
<p>to her work as a journalist. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by the reported excessive use of force 
</p>
<p>against peaceful protestors, including children, in the state of Oromia, as well as mass 
</p>
<p>arrests and arbitrary detentions of peaceful protestors and bystanders. The reports of the use </p>

<p>of live ammunitions and hand grenades during protests by security forces and military

<p>Special Forces, resulting in the killing of at least 35 peaceful protestors, as well as cases of 
</p>
<p>torture in detention and of incommunicado detention are particularly worrying.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>44. Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of finalising this report, no response has 
</p>
<p>been received to the allegation letter sent on 3 April 2014. The Special Rapporteur takes 
</p>
<p>note of the acknowledgment of receipt from the authorities to the allegation letter sent on 
</p>
<p>18 March 2014. He awaits further substantial responses to both the communications sent 
</p>
<p>during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the arbitrary arrests and detentions of 
</p>
<p>members of civil society organizations in the context of peaceful assemblies, including the 
</p>
<p>denial of access to a lawyer. He is particularly concerned by the reported excessive use of 
</p>
<p>force by police, including beating in custody of 7 members of the organisation and a 
</p>
<p>woman who was eight months pregnant and the sexual abuse of one female demonstrator.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern at the labelling of human rights 
</p>
<p>activist Ms. Lucy Elizabeth Hannan as a prohibited immigrant by government authorities, 
</p>
<p>which appears to be a form of reprisal for her work in a human rights organisation with UN 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the rights of freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association Mr. 
</p>
<p>Maina Kiai. Since this, her freedom of association, expression and movement have been 
</p>
<p>restricted and her work criminalised and she now faces threats, arrest, prosecution and 
</p>
<p>deportation.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by the tendency towards restrictions on 
</p>
<p>the space for civil society and human rights organisations in light of proposals to amend 
</p>
<p>existing laws. A bill proposed in 2013 that would give the authorities the power to deny the 
</p>
<p>registration of organisations and to cap foreign funding was rejected. However, a new 
</p>
<p>proposed amendment which, at the time of writing, is being debated in the Parliament, 
</p>
<p>contains many of the same provisions, but had excluded the condition on foreign funding, 
</p>
<p>recognising the opposition to this. The Special Rapporteur sees this as another example of 
</p>
<p>limitations and restrictions being put on human rights defenders and organisations, which 
</p>
<p>hinders their legitimate and peaceful human rights work.

</p>
<p>receive responses shortly, especially considering that they address new legislation, which 
</p>
<p>may restrict the space for civil society organisations. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur reiterates regret that the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition 
</p>
<p>Act, addressed in a communication dated 13 January 2014, was approved by the President 
</p>
<p>in January 2014. Serious concerns are expressed that this law unduly limits the free exercise

</p>
<p>restrict the work of human rights defenders in relation to the human rights of LGBTI

</p>

</p>
<p>threatens the work and independence of civil society organizations in the country as it 
provides that, to be considered as a NGO, an association should perform only a defined list 
</p>
<p>of activities, which appears to exclude defending human rights, promoting good governance 
</p>
<p>and combating corruption. It also proposes the establishment of a regulatory body, as well 
</p>
<p>as restrictive registration and financial procedures. In October 2014 the Bill was reportedly

<p>68. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its responses to two of the three 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period. However, he regrets that no response has 
</p>
<p>been received to the remaining communication sent on 7 May 2014. He trusts that a

</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at allegations of intimidation, threats 
</p>
<p>and human rights defenders and their families in Sudan, such as in the case of human rights 
</p>
<p>defender Mr. Adam Eldouma Suleiman and his family who received threats through text

<p>concern at the arrest and detention of defenders in relation to their legitimate and peaceful 
</p>
<p>activities, and at allegations of the National Intelligence and Security Service&#8217;s involvement 
</p>
<p>in these incidents. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the release in July 2014 
</p>
<p>of the student activist Mr. Mohamed Salah Mohamed Abdelrhman who was arrested in 
</p>
<p>March 2014 following a statement he made at the memorial event for a fellow student 
</p>
<p>activist during which he named the National Intelligence and Security Service agents who 
</p>
<p>were responsible for the killing. However, he remains concerned at allegations of torture of 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdelrhman while in detention, as was noted by the UN Independent Expert on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in the Sudan, Professor Mashood Adebayo Baderin, following his

<p>which promoted women&#8217;s rights and gender equality. He takes note of the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>response received on 6 June 2014, in which it states that the organisation was not registered 
</p>
<p>with the Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, although the organisation was registered with 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations identified in this letter remain valid as these measures appear to form part of a 
</p>
<p>pattern targeting independent civil society actors, including those defending and promoting 
</p>
<p>women rights and gender equality.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of finalising this report, no response 
</p>
<p>was received to the communication sent on 2 April 2014. He encourages the Government to 
</p>
<p>fully consider the allegations therein and he hopes to receive a response addressing the 
</p>
<p>questions asked shortly. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at the charges of criminal contempt of 
</p>
<p>court brought against Mr. Thulani Maseko and Mr. Bheki Makhubu in connection with 
</p>
<p>articles that they wrote about a High Court case in which they raised concerns about the 
</p>
<p>lack of judicial accountability, impartiality and independence in the case. There were 
</p>
<p>worrying indications of a lack of due process in their case and, on 6 April 2014, Mr. 
</p>
<p>Maseko and Mr. Makhubu were released following a High Court judgment which set aside 
</p>
<p>the initial warrant for their arrest as unconstitutional, unlawful and irregular. However, this 
</p>
<p>decision was appealed and they were re-detained at a provisional detention centre.  In June 
</p>
<p>2014, a number of UN human rights experts expressed their concern at the repeated arrests 
</p>
<p>and detention of Messrs. Maseko and Makhubu. The Special Rapporteur is concerned 
</p>
<p>regarding reports received that, on 17 July 2014, Messrs. Maseko and Makhubu were 
</p>
<p>sentenced to two years of prison and the magazine that had published the articles received a 
</p>
<p>fine. Their conviction constitutes a violation both of the right to freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>under the Constitution of Swaziland, and international human rights law and occurs in the 
</p>
<p>context of the wider systematic use of domestic legislation against individuals critical of the 
</p>
<p>King and State institutions and is considered be directly related to their legitimate exercise 
</p>
<p>of their right to freedom of expression.

<p><b>2013. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the acknowledgement of receipt of one of the 
</p>
<p>two communications sent during the reporting period. However, he regrets the lack of 
</p>
<p>response from the Government to the communications sent, especially given the grave 
</p>
<p>nature of the allegations therein. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his concern at the provisions included in 
</p>
<p>the Public Order Management Act, which was approved by the President in October 2013. 
</p>
<p>A number of the provisions included in this Act curtail the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of expression, including burdensome requirements on organisers of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies and that organisers and participants of peaceful assemblies could be held 
</p>
<p>criminally and financially liable and face disproportionate sanctions for a range of vaguely 
</p>
<p>described offences and for the unlawful acts of others.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur is pleased that the Anti-Homosexuality Act was annulled by 
</p>
<p>the Constitutional Court, which ruled that the Parliament lacked a quorum when it was 
</p>
<p>passed. However, he reiterates his concern that the Act had been passed by Parliament 
</p>
<p>which, as the then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated, would 
</p>
<p>institutionalise discrimination against lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender people and 
</p>
<p>could encourage harassment and violence against them. The Act also criminalised the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>&#8216;promotion of homosexuality&#8217;, which would have a detrimental impact on healthcare 
</p>
<p>providers and Ugandan and international organizations advocating on human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about severe discrimination that is 
</p>
<p>still faced by LGBTI people in Uganda.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Zambian Government for the response submitted 
</p>
<p>to his communication regarding the de-registration of two international NGOs operating in 
</p>
<p>Zambia. He acknowledges that the wording of the Act does not focus on de-registration, per 
</p>
<p>se, but on the obligation to re-register in order to be recognised under the Act. However, he 
</p>
<p>is concerned that the reported re-registration requirement established by the Act puts NGOs 
</p>
<p>at risk of arbitrary termination or suspension of their activities and which would unduly 
</p>
<p>interfere with the substantive work and organisational structure of civil society 
</p>
<p>organisations in Zambia.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Zimbabwe for the response 
</p>
<p>submitted to the communication sent on 7 February 2014 regarding the charges brought 
</p>
<p>against the head of the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe Association.  
</p>
<p>84. He welcomes the decision by the Magistrate on 26 February 2014 to quash the 
</p>
<p>charges of running an &#8216;unregistered&#8217; organisation brought against Ms. Tholanah and order 
</p>
<p>the return of property that had been confiscated. 
</p>
<p><b>   
</b></p>
<p><b>AMERICAS REGION 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>85. The Special Rapporteur sent 49 communications to countries in the Americas region 
</p>
<p>during the reporting period. He notes with satisfaction the response rate of 61 per cent for 
</p>
<p>the region, which constitutes a significant increase compared to 49 per cent during the 
</p>
<p>previous reporting period. The Special Rapporteur also received four late responses to 
</p>
<p>communications issued during previous reporting periods. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur reiterates grave concern at the number of killings of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders in the region. He is also concerned regarding the high number of cases of 
</p>
<p>physical attacks, intimidation and harassment, perpetrated by State and non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the continuous pattern of threats, in particular death threats, made against 
</p>
<p>activists in a number of countries is also of major concern. The Special Rapporteur wishes 
</p>
<p>to remind Governments of their responsibility to ensure a safe and enabling environment in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>which human rights defenders can carry out their work. While acknowledging that some 
</p>
<p>regional countries have established national mechanisms for the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, the Special Rapporteur has received concerns about their effectiveness. He 
</p>
<p>therefore encourages Governments that have not yet established national protection 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to do so in an urgent matter, and those which have such mechanisms in place 
</p>
<p>to engage fully with human rights defenders to ensure their protection needs are adequately 
</p>
<p>met so that they continue their work without fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur also draws attention to particular risks faced by 
</p>
<p>environmental, land and indigenous rights defenders, who oppose government and private 
</p>
<p>large-scale projects that could have negatives impacts on the environment and on local 
</p>
<p>communities. There have been a number of incidents in which activists were threatened, 
</p>
<p>arrested and detained on unfounded charges, physically attacked and killed. In addition, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes increased restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>assembly and association, including restrictive legislation, as well as incidents of the use of 
</p>
<p>excessive force during peaceful protests. 
</p>
<p>88. Another worrying trend in the Americas region is the defamation and stigmatisation 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders, often by State actors including government representatives. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur urges Governments to ensure that public officials and media outlets 
</p>
<p>refrain from taking part in smear campaigns against human rights defenders. He reiterates 
</p>
<p>that the State has a duty to protect activists and promote a safe and enabling environment so 
</p>
<p>that they can carry out their legitimate human rights work. 
</p>
<p>89. With regards to the accountability and responsibility of the Government to ensure 
</p>
<p>that those responsible for human rights violations, including against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, are brought to justice, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the high level 
</p>
<p>of impunity in a number of countries in the region. He regrets that those who campaign 
</p>
<p>against impunity often face threats due to their work to ensure that the perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations are brought to justice.

</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the reply received to two of the 
</p>
<p>three communications sent during the reporting period. In particular, he thanks the 
</p>
<p>Government for the detailed responses in relation to reported restrictions on the freedom of 
</p>
<p>assembly and on the use of excessive force by law enforcement agents, in particular with 
</p>
<p>regards to investigations that are being carried out and measures and initiatives in the 
</p>
<p>training of law enforcement officers which take into account human rights principles. He 
</p>
<p>encourages the Government to respond to the communication sent on 25 August 2014, and 
</p>
<p>to answer the questions therein, as he considers the further allegations of the use of 
</p>
<p>excessive force to be very serious. The Special Rapportuer reiterates concerns expressed in 
</p>
<p>relation to restrictions and the use of excessive force against peaceful assemblies, including 
</p>
<p>the violent dispersal of peaceful demonstrations, excessive use of violence, and arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrests of protestors, including human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists.  
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur expresses further concern at the reported use of Law 12.850 
</p>
<p>on Criminal Organizations to investigate, arrest and prosecute demonstrators and members 
</p>
<p>of civil society organisations. In July 2014, an arrest warrant was issued for 30 individuals, 
</p>
<p>including human rights defenders, who were allegedly suspected of conspiracy and 
</p>
<p>belonging to a criminal organisation. Those arrested were later released pursuant to a 
</p>
<p>habeas corpus mandate. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern that the broad 
</p>
<p>powers of investigation and potential abuse of such powers under law 12.850 may put the 
</p>
<p>independence of associations and the safety of their members at risk, and may unduly 
</p>
<p>interfere with the exercise of the right to freedom of association. While it is reported that 
</p>
<p>allegations of the use of this law to investigate civil society organisations and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders are currently being investigated, he regrets that the Government has yet to 
</p>
<p>response to the communication containing these allegations. 
</p>
<p>102. Further concern is expressed at the consideration of draft laws which, if adopted, 
</p>
<p>would contravene international human rights law and standards and could unduly curtail the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of opinion and expression. A number of 
</p>
<p>draft laws criminalizing acts of terrorism have been considered by the Parliament, in 
</p>
<p>particular draft laws 728/2011, 499/2013 and 236/2012. While the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that law 728/201, regarding public safety during international sporting 
</p>
<p>events, was rejected, the other two laws are still pending at the National Congress. He 
</p>
<p>expresses concern that the proposed broad definitions contained in the aforementioned draft 
</p>
<p>laws may unduly limit human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular, the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern at threats and attacks against a 
</p>
<p>human rights defender for reportedly publicly denouncing the actions of the police against 
</p>
<p>sex workers during a raid, which included entering the building without a warrant, 
</p>
<p>extortion, theft, robbery and rape. The Special Rapporteur welcomes developments in the 
</p>
<p>investigations and the protection measures provided to the victim of these abuses. However, 
</p>
<p>he remains concerned at the abuse of power and authority exercised by the police to 
</p>
<p>intimidate and deter her from accessing justice.

</p>

</p>
<p>responder&#225; las otras tres comunicaciones pendientes de contestaci&#243;n. El Relator destaca 
</p>
<p>tambi&#233;n el impulso que el Gobierno da al proceso de paz y el decisivo papel que en &#233;ste 
</p>
<p>cumplen la/os defensora/es de derechos humanos. El Relator lamenta no haber recibido 
</p>
<p>respuestas del Gobierno a las dos otras comunicaciones enviadas durante el periodo del 
</p>
<p>presente informe y queda a la espera de recibir respuestas sustantivas lo antes posible. 
</p>
<p>117. El Relator Especial contin&#250;a preocupado por la persistencia en Colombia de un 
</p>
<p>patr&#243;n persistente de asesinatos, ataques, amenazas de muerte y allanamientos en contra de 
</p>
<p>defensora/es de derechos humanos. En su mayor&#237;a, estas violaciones son en su mayor&#237;a 
</p>
<p>perpetradas por grupos armados ilegales o personas desconocidas, y se producen en contra 
</p>
<p>defensores y defensoras que reivindican el proceso de restituci&#243;n de tierras, los derechos 
</p>
<p>humanos ambientales, los derechos de pueblos y comunidades ind&#237;genas, o se desempe&#241;an 
</p>
<p>como abogados, periodistas o sindicalistas. 
</p>
<p>118. El Relator Especial llama la atenci&#243;n sobre los actos de acoso e intimidaci&#243;n, los 
</p>
<p>hostigamientos, las amenazas y los intentos de asesinato contra miembros de asociaciones 
</p>
<p>de v&#237;ctimas y familiares que promueven procesos de verdad y justicia. El Relator expresa su 
</p>
<p>seria preocupaci&#243;n por las amenazas de muerte proferidas en contra de defensora/es de 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos, que son suscritas por grupos armados ilegales tales como 
</p>
<p>autodenominados &#193;guilas Negras, las Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia, el Ej&#233;rcito 
</p>
<p>Antirestituci&#243;n y Los Rastrojos. El Relator expresa su profunda preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho 
</p>
<p>de que las amenazas estuvieran directamente relacionadas con sus actividades de 
</p>
<p>promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular, por las relacionadas con el 
</p>
<p>impulso de procesos de justicia y reparaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>119. Para el Relator Especial, sin duda, la situaci&#243;n m&#225;s preocupante es el alto n&#250;mero de 
</p>
<p>asesinatos de defensora/es de derechos humanos, adem&#225;s de las amenazas de muerte contra 
</p>
<p>ellos y sus familiares. El Relator expresa consternaci&#243;n por los asesinatos de sindicalistas y 
</p>
<p>manifiesta grave preocupaci&#243;n por las amenazas recibidas por miembros de sindicatos y 
</p>
<p>federaciones sindicales, que trabajan por los derechos laborales.  
</p>
<p>120. El Relator expresa su preocupaci&#243;n por que conductas que afectan a defensora/es y 
</p>
<p>defensoras de derechos humanos, tales como amenazas, detenciones arbitrarias y lesiones 
</p>
<p>personales, no se encuentran expresamente excluidas del conocimiento de la justicia penal 
</p>
<p>militar. El Relator recuerda que la pr&#225;ctica de otorgar a tribunales militares el juzgamiento 
</p>
<p>de violaciones graves de derechos humanos puede vulnerar  principios b&#225;sicos del derecho </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1

<p>a la justicia, entre ellos el del juez natural, el de igualdad ante la ley y el derecho a un

</p>
<p>121. Por &#250;ltimo, el Relator Especial contin&#250;a preocupado por el grado persistente de 
</p>
<p>impunidad que prevalece en torno a los ataques y las violaciones perpetradas en contra de 
</p>
<p>defensora/es de derechos humanos en Colombia. En algunos casos, se informa que no se 
</p>
<p>han iniciado las investigaciones correspondientes a las denuncias recibidas por la Fiscal&#237;a 
</p>
<p>General de la Naci&#243;n. Por tanto, el Relator quisiera subrayar la importancia de que se 
</p>
<p>realicen investigaciones prontas e imparciales, de que los responsables sean juzgados, y de 
</p>
<p>que las v&#237;ctimas reciban una reparaci&#243;n adecuada.

</p>

</p>
<p>malos tratos en particular en el marco de manifestaciones o reuniones pac&#237;ficas en favor de

<p>expresa tambi&#233;n grave preocupaci&#243;n por las amenazas, ataques, hostigamiento y detenci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>de periodistas independientes, incluyendo casos de malos tratos contra periodistas que 
</p>
<p>ejercen su profesi&#243;n para promover los derechos humanos.

<p>127. Al Relator le preocupa alegaciones de malos tratos y abuso f&#237;sico y psicol&#243;gico en 
</p>
<p>detenci&#243;n. Como consecuencia, hay casos de defensores que  hasta han intentado de

</p>

<p>154. El Relator Especial agradece la respuesta recibida a una de las comunicaciones 
</p>
<p>enviadas durante el periodo del presente informe y agradece la informaci&#243;n detallada que se 
</p>
<p>proporcion&#243; en relaci&#243;n con los procesos legales actualmente en curso en el caso de los 
</p>
<p>defensores ind&#237;genas referidos en la comunicaci&#243;n el 16 de abril de 2014. Sin embargo, 
</p>
<p>lamenta que, en el momento de finalizar este informe, no se haya recibido respuesta a la 
</p>
<p>mayor&#237;a de las comunicaciones enviadas. El Relator Especial insta a las autoridades a 
</p>
<p>considerar de manera adecuada las comunicaciones enviadas desde esta oficina y a 
</p>
<p>responder lo antes posible, considerando la gravedad de las violaciones. 
</p>
<p>155. El Relator Especial expresa su honda preocupaci&#243;n por el clima inh&#243;spito y poco 
</p>
<p>favorable en el que operan las y los defensores en Honduras. En particular, subraya los 
</p>
<p>graves atentados contra la vida, adem&#225;s de ataques contra las familias de defensores de 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos, incluyendo menores de edad. Expresa grave preocupaci&#243;n tambi&#233;n por 
</p>
<p>la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de defensores respecto a casos de actos de represalias, 
</p>
<p>vigilancia y allanamientos por cooperaci&#243;n con instituciones internacionales, incluyendo la 
</p>
<p>ONU. 
</p>
<p>156. Al Relator tambi&#233;n le preocupa el patr&#243;n de ataques y actos de intimidaci&#243;n y 
</p>
<p>hostigamiento contra integrantes de asociaciones que trabajan por los derechos humanos de 
</p>
<p>las personas lesbianas, gays, bisexuales, transexuales e intersexuales (LGBTI). 
</p>
<p>Desafortunadamente, el Relator no ha recibido una respuesta del Gobierno a la 
</p>
<p>comunciaciones del presente informe ni en relaci&#243;n con comunicaciones anteriores, las 
</p>
<p>cuales tratan de este asunto preocupante, en un contexto de creciente violencia e 
</p>
<p>inseguridad para las personas LGBTI en Honduras y para aqu&#233;llas que trabajan contra la 
</p>
<p>discriminaci&#243;n basada en la orientaci&#243;n sexual e identidad de g&#233;nero.  
</p>
<p>157. Adem&#225;s, el Relator Especial reitera su preocupaci&#243;n por la protecci&#243;n de los y las 
</p>
<p>defensoras de derechos humanos y los periodistas y sobre los mecanismos nacionales de 
</p>
<p>protecci&#243;n, los cuales no proporcionan la protecci&#243;n adecuada para los y las en riesgo. En 
</p>
<p>particular, destaca la falta de investigaci&#243;n pronta y exhaustiva sobre los hostigamientos y 
</p>
<p>amenazas en contra de defensores, y por lo tanto, la falta de protecci&#243;n contra los asesinatos 
</p>
<p>o atentados contra la vida. 
</p>
<p>158. El Relator Especial se muestra muy preocupado por el alto nivel de impunidad que 
</p>
<p>prevalece respecto a las agresiones y violaciones de los derechos de los defensores y 
</p>
<p>defensoras, incluyendo asesinatos y atentados contra la vida, situaci&#243;n que ha sido objeto de 
</p>
<p>numerosas comunicaciones por parte de los Procedimientos Especiales de las Naciones 
</p>
<p>Unidas. El Relator exhorta a las autoridades a que tomen las medidas necesarias para que 
</p>
<p>estos actos sean investigados de forma pronta y adecuada, que los culpables respondan ante 
</p>
<p>la justicia y que las v&#237;ctimas obtengan reparaci&#243;n adecuada, en particular, en casos en los 
</p>
<p>cuales la polic&#237;a, u otros agentes estatales, est&#225;n involucrados en las violaciones de los 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos de defensores, incluyendo el hostigamiento judicial.

<p>171. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno las respuestas recibidas a todas las 
</p>
<p>comunicaciones enviadas durante el periodo del presente informe, as&#237; como la informaci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>proporcionada sobre el mecanismo de protecci&#243;n, las investigaciones que se realizan y la 
</p>
<p>participaci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas en estas investigaciones. Tambi&#233;n toma nota de los esfuerzos 
</p>
<p>para garantizar que el derecho de libertad de expresi&#243;n y de asociaci&#243;n pac&#237;fica y el papel 
</p>
<p>del periodismo sean respectados. Sin embargo, reitera su preocupaci&#243;n sobre el clima cada 
</p>
<p>vez menos favorable en el que trabajan los defensores de derechos humanos en M&#233;xico, en </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>particular los que trabajan con comunidades campesinas e ind&#237;genas y en favor al derecho a 
</p>
<p>la tierra. 
</p>
<p>172. El Relator expresa su honda preocupaci&#243;n por un caso muy grave de ejecuciones 
</p>
<p>extrajudiciales y actos de tortura, malos tratos y desaparici&#243;n sufridos por defensores de los 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos en el estado de Guerrero, perpetrados por un grupo armado no estatal 
</p>
<p>que opera presuntamente con la complicidad o acquiescencia de agentes de la Polic&#237;a 
</p>
<p>Municipal. El Relator condena la brutalidad sufrida por las v&#237;ctimas. Uno de los defensores 
</p>
<p>fue torturado a golpes, mediante quemaduras y pu&#241;aladas con un machete, antes de ser 
</p>
<p>asesinado. El resto del grupo tambi&#233;n fue v&#237;ctima de torturas, por medio de golpes con 
</p>
<p>machetes en el abdomen y en las rodillas, mientras eran objeto de constantes amenazas. 
</p>
<p>Dos de ellos fueron asesinados. Adem&#225;s, las familias de las v&#237;ctimas tuvieron que 
</p>
<p>abandonar su pueblo por motivos de seguridad. La gravedad de este caso subraya la 
</p>
<p>situaci&#243;n peligrosa para muchos defensores y, aunque las autoridades lo investigan, es 
</p>
<p>necesario recalcar otra vez la responsabilidad de las autoridades de proteger los defensores, 
</p>
<p>en particular considerando el hecho de que agentes estatales est&#225;n involucrados en esas 
</p>
<p>violaciones. Asimismo, el Relator expresa grave preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones sobre 
</p>
<p>actos violentos y degradantes en contra de defensores de los derechos humanos por partede 
</p>
<p>miembros de las fuerzas del orden y las informaciones recibidas indicando que los 
</p>
<p>agresores no habr&#237;an sido llevados ante la justicia.  
</p>
<p>173. El Relator se inquieta tambi&#233;n por el alto nivel de participaci&#243;n de agentes del orden 
</p>
<p>y polic&#237;a en actos de hostigamiento e intimidaci&#243;n de defensores de los derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p>Sobre todo, son preocupantes las alegaciones de actos de tortura en manos de agentes del 
</p>
<p>orden cuando las v&#237;ctimas est&#225;n bajo disposici&#243;n policial, &#243;rdenes de aprehensi&#243;n sin 
</p>
<p>motivo justificado y falta del derecho a un juicio imparcial. Se&#241;ala alegaciones de secuestro 
</p>
<p>y retenci&#243;n ordenadas por la Subprocuradur&#237;a Especializada en Investigaci&#243;n de 
</p>
<p>Delincuencia Organizada, durante las cuales las v&#237;ctimas enfrentan detenci&#243;n incomunicada 
</p>
<p>tortura, amenazas a sus familias y, en algunos casos, confesiones bajo coacci&#243;n. Asimismo, 
</p>
<p>expresa preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones de actos de intimidaci&#243;n y represalias que 
</p>
<p>resultar&#237;an de la cooperaci&#243;n de estas personas con otro Relator Especial durante su visita al 
</p>
<p>pa&#237;s. Al Relator Especial le preocupa tambi&#233;n las alegaciones que indican que algunos de 
</p>
<p>los defensores de los derechos humanos han sido imputados con cargos penales que 
</p>
<p>pudieran estar relacionados con sus leg&#237;timas actividades de defensa y promoci&#243;n de los 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos, lo cual inhibir&#237;a el ejercicio de su trabajo en el campo de los derechos 
</p>
<p>humanos. 
</p>
<p>174. En este contexto, el Relator quisiera se&#241;alar que algunas de las personas 
</p>
<p>mencionadas en las comunicaciones enviadas durante el periodo del presente informe eran 
</p>
<p>beneficiarias de protecci&#243;n por parte del Mecanismo Nacional de Protecci&#243;n para las 
</p>
<p>Personas Defensoras de Derechos Humanos y Periodistas. Esta informaci&#243;n es preocupante 
</p>
<p>y revela ciertas deficiencias en la implementaci&#243;n de dicho mecanismo. Sobre todo, existen 
</p>
<p>problemas en la ejecuci&#243;n de su mandato por deficiencias estructurales. En una 
</p>
<p>comunicaci&#243;n anterior, los Relatores enviaron un an&#225;lisis detallado sobre las medidas 
</p>
<p>necesarias para mejorar el mecanismo y esperan que pudieran implementarse los cambios 
</p>
<p>requeridos.  
</p>
<p>175. El Relator Especial quisiera de nuevo llamar la atenci&#243;n sobre el alto nivel de 
</p>
<p>impunidad que prevalece en torno a las violaciones cometidas contra los defensores en el 
</p>
<p>pa&#237;s. Sobre todo cuando se alega que las autoridades o agentes estatales participan en las 
</p>
<p>violaciones. El Relator quisiera destacar la importancia de que se lleven a cabo 
</p>
<p>investigaciones prontas, eficaces e imparciales sobre violaciones cometidas contra 
</p>
<p>defensores y defensoras, que los responsables sean traducidos en justicia y que las v&#237;ctimas 
</p>
<p>reciban una compensaci&#243;n adecuada. La lucha contra la impunidad es esencial para 
</p>
<p>combatir y prevenir las violaciones de los derechos de los defensores y las defensoras.   </p>

<p>176. En sus conclusiones, el Relator reitera el peligro para los defensores en algunas 
</p>
<p>partes de M&#233;xico e insta al Gobierno a asegurar que hay mecanismos adecuados en marcha 
</p>
<p>para protegerlos. Reitera tambi&#233;n su preocupaci&#243;n por casos de tortura, sobre todo en 
</p>
<p>detenci&#243;n, y nota la necesidad de realizar el Protocolo de Estambul en cada caso de 
</p>
<p>supuesta tortura. Es importante reconocer la responsabilidad del Gobierno de M&#233;xico de 
</p>
<p>crear un clima seguro y favorable para los defensores de los derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p>177. El Relator Especial espera que el Gobierno responda favorablemente a su solicitud 
</p>
<p>(2015) de visitar M&#233;xico para fortalecer su comprensi&#243;n sobre la situaci&#243;n de los

</p>
<p>181. El Relator Especial manifiesta su especial preocupaci&#243;n por los ataques y asesinatos 
</p>
<p>contra miembros de comunidades ind&#237;genas y defensores/as de derechos humanos, adem&#225;s 
</p>

</p>
<p>agentes estatales adem&#225;s de empresas privadas, contra defensores/as de derechos humanos 
</p>
<p>y sus familiares. La mayor&#237;a de las violaciones cometidas contra defensores/as ind&#237;genas 
</p>
<p>son consecuencia de su f&#233;rrea  oposici&#243;n a proyectos que amenazan el derecho a la tierra. 
</p>
<p>Dichos defensores/as realizan labores de promoci&#243;n y defensa de los derechos humanos y

</p>
<p>Interculturalidad del Ministerio de Cultura para coordinar la respuesta del Estado en

<p>committees in a non-governmental capacity to disclose any payment they or the entity they 
</p>
<p>are paid to represent have received from foreign Governments. The right of associations to

<p>provides that any restrictions must be proportionate and a necessary response to a pressing

<p>may stigmatise civil society organisations and human rights defenders. The Special

<p>y la creaci&#243;n de la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n de la Tortura, desarrollos reconocidos 
</p>
<p>y promovidos por los Relatores Especiales.  
</p>
<p>195. El Relator expresa su honda preocupaci&#243;n por el patr&#243;n de graves violaciones de los 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos contra defensores, en particular casos de asesinatos, tortura, detenci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>arbitraria y l&#237;mites a la libre expresi&#243;n y asociaci&#243;n. En este contexto, toma nota 
</p>
<p>espec&#237;ficamente de los casos en los cuales, durante manifestaciones pac&#237;ficas, incluyendo 
</p>
<p>de estudiantes y de periodistas, las autoridades han respondido con la &#8220;mano de hierro&#8221; 
</p>
<p>contra quienes consideran como &#8220;conspiradores&#8221;. Este modo de abordar las manifestaciones 
</p>
<p>incluye detenciones arbitrarias, malas condiciones en detenci&#243;n, falta de acceso a abogados 
</p>
<p>y el uso desproporcionado de la fuerza por agentes de seguridad del Estado, adem&#225;s de 
</p>
<p>ataques por parte de grupos civiles armados. Mientras el Relator reconoce que ha recibido 
</p>
<p>una respuesta del Gobierno respecto de las manifestaciones y as&#237; como informaci&#243;n con 
</p>
<p>datos estad&#237;sticos proporcionados en relaci&#243;n con los manifestantes detenidos y la legalidad 
</p>
<p>de su detenci&#243;n, le preocupa que el Gobierno ha utilizado la Ley anti-terrorista (Ley 
</p>
<p>Org&#225;nica contra la Delincuencia Organizada y Financiamiento al Terrorismo) para justificar 
</p>
<p>los arrestos de todos los manifestantes detenidos y de nombrarlos &#8216;terroristas&#8217; indicando 
</p>
<p>que la mayor&#237;a de los manifestantes no eran estudiantes, ni defensores leg&#237;timos.  
</p>
<p>196. El Relator Especial expresa particular preocupaci&#243;n por la tendencia creciente de 
</p>
<p>comentarios difamatorios contra defensores de derechos humanos por parte de altas 
</p>
<p>autoridades p&#250;blicas, entre ellos el Presidente de la Asamblea Nacional, el cual acusa a los 
</p>
<p>defensores de apoyar la lucha pol&#237;tica de la oposici&#243;n y de participar en la promoci&#243;n de 
</p>
<p>violencia. Asimismo, expresa grave preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones recibidas indicando la 
</p>
<p>detenci&#243;n, y actos de acoso, amenazas y se&#241;alamientos por parte de altas autoridades 
</p>
<p>p&#250;blicas contra defensores y defensoras de derechos humanos. Esta es una tendencia 
</p>
<p>preocupante para defensores en Venezuela, considerando que las autoridades, quienes son 
</p>
<p>las responsables de la seguridad de los ciudadanos, se pudieran convertir en la causa de la 
</p>
<p>inseguridad. 
</p>
<p> 197. El Relator expresa preocupaci&#243;n tambi&#233;n por la detenci&#243;n y criminalizaci&#243;n de un 
</p>
<p>activista LGBTI, nuevamente bajo la Ley anti-terrorista. Estas alegaciones son formuladas 
</p>
<p>en un contexto de creciente violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos de 
</p>
<p>las personas LBGTI en Venezuela.

</p>
<p><b>ASIA-PACIFIC REGION 
</b></p>
<p>200. During the present reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 80 communications 
</p>
<p>to countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 35 per cent of the total number 
</p>
<p>of communications sent from his mandate. He observes that the response rate for the region 
</p>
<p>is 49 per cent. The Special Rapporteur also received one late response to a communication 
</p>
<p>issued during the previous reporting period. 
</p>
<p>201. The Special Rapporteur notes with grave concern the high number of 
</p>
<p>communications sent to the Asia-Pacific regionwith regard to acts of reprisals against 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders for their cooperation with the United Nations and its human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. In total, 58 per cent of the reprisal cases taken up by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>during the present reporting period were from this region. This is a worrying development, 
</p>
<p>and the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the States in this region bear responsibility to 
</p>
<p>ensure that human rights defenders can fully participate and cooperate with the UN and its 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms without fear of intimidation or reprisals of any sort. 
</p>
<p>202. During the present reporting period, the Special Rappoteur observes a concerning 
</p>
<p>number of communications that raised issues of intimidation, threats, harassment, physical 
</p>
<p>attacks, killings and enforced disappearances of human rights defenders in the region. He 
</p>
<p>expresses particular concern at the involvement of State agents in the harassment and unfair 
</p>
<p>prosecution of human rights defenders in the region amid numerous reports of arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrests and detention, judicial harassment and lack of due process. In particular, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur draws attention to increasing restrictions on freedom of assembly. In a number 
</p>
<p>of countries, legislation that puts disproportionate restrictions on the organisation of, and 
</p>
<p>participation in, peaceful demonstrations has led to cases of mass arrests and detentions of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and protestors during peaceful demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>203. Grave concern is expressed at numerous reports of ill treatment and torture of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders who are in detention. In a number of cases that the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>addressed during the present reporting period, the cases of ill treatment also included the 
</p>
<p>denial of adequate medical care, leading to the deteriorating health of some detained 
</p>
<p>activists. The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind States in the region of their 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect and provide a safe and enabling environment for human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders to conduct their work as well as to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in 
</p>
<p>detention, including the provision of adequate medical care and treatment.

</p>
<p><b>incidents that took place between 16 and 18 February 2014 in Manus Regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Processing Centre, Papua New Guinea. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>206. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Australia for its replies to the two 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period. While the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>understands that not all details can be shared in the case regarding the acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>and ill treatment of a human rights defender at the Manus Regional Processing Centre due 
</p>
<p>to litigation in the High Court on the issue, he awaits a more substantive response once this 
</p>
<p>case has concluded. 
</p>
<p>207. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the enactment of the Workplaces 
</p>
<p>(Protection from Protesters) Act by Royal Assent on 17 December 2014, which unduly 
</p>
<p>restricts the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression. Although he is pleased that the mandatory imprisonment provision was 
</p>
<p>removed from the Bill prior to enactment, he is concerned regarding the excessive 
</p>
<p>restrictions on protests, which remain in the Act, including financial penalties. 
</p>
<p>208. The Special Rapporteur is also gravely concerned at the intimidation and ill 
</p>
<p>treatment of asylum-seekers in Manus Regional Processing Centre following statements 
</p>
<p>that they made regarding the violent attacks against asylum-seekers and the killing of an 
</p>
<p>asylum-seeker in February 2014. While the Government&#8217;s response highlights the fact that 
</p>
<p>the Centre falls under the legal jurisdiction of Papua New Guinea, as was recognised by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur as both countries received communications on the issue, and while 
</p>
<p>certain improvements have been made, the Australian Government hired the company that 
</p>
<p>runs the facility. When a state&#8217;s security is privatised, this does not change the state&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations and, as such, Australia has an obligation to investigate allegations 
</p>
<p>made against the company.

</p>
<p>five of the communications sent during the reporting period. He trusts that substantive 
</p>
<p>responses will be provided shortly to all of these communications, particularly due to the 
</p>
<p>serious allegations addressed therein. 
</p>
<p>215. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern at the violent suppression of public 
</p>
<p>opinion and the torture of members of the political opposition, journalists and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders as well as in the arbitrary execution of at least 150 individuals. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also expresses concern for the physical and psychological integrity of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders in the context of physical attacks against them, as well as cases of arrest 
</p>
<p>and detention and of surveillance and harassment, as a result of their peaceful and 
</p>
<p>legitimate activities in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>216. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by the draft Foreign Donations 
</p>
<p>(Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act 2014 which, if adopted, would unduly restrict the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of association. An earlier version of the Bill was the subject of an 
allegation letter sent on 23 October 2012 and the Special Rapporteur urges the Parliament 
</p>
<p>to ensure its compliance with international human rights norms and standards.

<p>221. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for responses that were received to 
</p>
<p>two of the four communications sent during the reporting period. He trusts that substantive 
</p>
<p>responses will be received shortly to the remaining two communications, given the severity 
</p>
<p>of the allegations contained therein. 
</p>
<p>222. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned at the obstruction to the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of assembly whereby the space for protests and demonstrations was restricted, in particular 
</p>
<p>the ban on demonstrations introduced in Phnom Penh in January 2014. He is also concerned 
</p>
<p>about the excessive use of force against protestors involved in demonstrations in January </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1

</p>
<p>2014, which led to the death of four people and several injuries, as well as the arbitrary 
</p>

</p>
<p>acknowledges the Government&#8217;s response detailing the provisions of the Peaceful 
</p>
<p>Demonstrations Law and the steps to establish commissions to investigate the events 
</p>
<p>surrounding the protests in January 2014. However, he remains concerned at the 
</p>
<p>convictions and suspended sentences imposed on protestors with lack of due process or the 
</p>
<p>right to a fair trial.  
</p>
<p>223.  The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern about the targeting of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders involved in the protection of land rights in Cambodia, including acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation and threats against those protecting the rights of the families on disputed land. 
The Special Rapporteur is pleased that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
</p>
<p>Cooperation has asked the Ministry of Interior to open an investigation into the intimidation 
</p>
<p>and threats against land rights defender Mr. Vann Sophath. He thanks the Government for 
</p>
<p>its response containing information on the investigation. However, he reiterates his concern 
</p>
<p>at reports of the appropriation of the land of certain communities and the judicial 
</p>
<p>harassment, intimidation and frequent attacks on these communities. He encourages the 
</p>
<p>Government to protect the communities and land rights defenders from such intimidation

<p>and attacks due to disputes over the right to land.

<p><b>Deadly reprisals: UN experts deplore the events leading to the death of Chinese

</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>235. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for responses to five out of ten 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period. However, he raises concern that the 
</p>
<p>response rate has decreased since the previous reporting period and therefore hopes to 
</p>
<p>receive substantive responses to the remaining communications.  
</p>
<p>236.  The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern that the majority of the 
</p>
<p>communications sent were regarding the situation of human rights defenders who have 
</p>
<p>been subject of several previous communications and that there seems to have been little, if 
</p>
<p>any, change in their situation. 
</p>
<p>237. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the harassment, interrogation, 
</p>
<p>detention, beatings and disappearances of numerous human rights defenders and of human 
</p>
<p>rights lawyers in China as a result of their peaceful and legitimate human rights activities. 
</p>
<p>There have been a number of cases of arbitrary and incommunicado detention, including 
</p>
<p>cases of prolonged solitary confinement, whereby the human rights defenders have not been 
</p>
<p>granted access to their families or lawyers and in certain cases information on their exact 
</p>
<p>whereabouts and situation was not communicated. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to 
</p>
<p>highlight his concern at the instances of intimidation, threats and ill treatment in detention, 
</p>
<p>which has been widely reported as well as cases in which families of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders face harassment. Grave concern is expressed at the violent and repressive 
</p>
<p>measures taken against human rights lawyers and activists while carrying out their peaceful 
</p>
<p>work promoting democracy, combatting corruption, and providing legal representation to 
</p>
<p>victims of human rights violations. As noted by the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Navi Pillay on 3 June 2014, there was increased concern as numerous civil society activists, 
</p>
<p>journalists and lawyers were detained in the run up to the anniversary of the 1989 
</p>
<p>Tiananmen Square protests and restrictions on the media and the internet. 
</p>
<p>238. The Special Rapporteur is also seriously concerned at the high number of reports of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders who have been denied adequate access to medical care. One such 
</p>
<p>high-profile case is that of human rights defender Ms. Cao Shunli, whose health 
</p>
<p>deteriorated rapidly in detention as she was not granted access to medical care or essential 
</p>
<p>medicine, despite suffering from serious medical conditions, which led to her death on 14 
</p>
<p>March 2014. 
</p>
<p>239. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the arrest, detention 
</p>
<p>and intimidation of human rights defenders in China due to their cooperation and 
</p>
<p>engagement with the UN and its human rights mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>strongly urges the Government of China to ensure that human rights defenders can carry 
</p>
<p>out their legitimate activities in a safe and an enabling environment; this includes through 
</p>
<p>open and unhindered access to international human rights bodies without fear of reprisal.  
</p>
<p>240. The Special Rapporteur expresses his hope that the Government will respond 
</p>
<p>favourably to his request (2015) to visit China to enable him to gain a better understanding 
</p>
<p>of the situation of human rights defenders in the country. He remains available to provide 
</p>
<p>guidance and assistance the Government might require. </p>

<p>responses had been received to the three communications sent during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>He trusts that the Government will provide responses to these communications shortly, 
</p>
<p>especially given the repeated incidents and ongoing harassment of many of these defenders, 
</p>
<p>with little change to their situation. 
</p>
<p>245. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern regarding repeated defamation campaign 
</p>
<p>and false charges against certain human rights defenders in India, most notably Ms. Teesta 
</p>
<p>Setalvad and Mr. Javed Anand. They have faced continued harassment and the use of 
</p>
<p>financial laws and allegations of embezzlement to obstruct their work. Ms. Setalvad, in 
</p>
<p>particular, has been the subject of numerous communications from our office. In the 
</p>
<p>majority of these cases brought against her, the allegations have been found to be false. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also expresses concern at the alleged threats against and surveillance of 
</p>
<p>human rights defender Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal by the police. 
</p>
<p>246. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern regarding the alleged ban on entering 
</p>
<p>India imposed on Ms. Mary Aileen Diez Bacalso, Secretary General of the Asian 
</p>
<p>Federation against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAD). During her three previous visits to 
India, she traveled to Kashmir to meet with families of disappeared persons and wrote 
</p>
<p>reports on cases of enforced disappearances there and she had campaigned for the 
</p>
<p>ratification by India of the Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance. This is not the first time that a representative of AFAD was not allowed to 
</p>
<p>enter India. In 2010, an administrative officer of AFAD, who accompanied Ms. Diez 
</p>
<p>Bacalso in her visit to Kashmir in 2009, was also refused entry. It is believed that these 
</p>
<p>bans were imposed solely as a result of their legitimate human rights work.

<p>250. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of finalising this report, no reply had 
</p>
<p>been received from the Government of Indonesia to the three communications sent during 
</p>
<p>the reporting period, particularly as the communications reiterate concerns previously 
</p>
<p>expressed during other reporting periods and for which no replies were received. 
</p>
<p>251. The Special Rapporteur reiterates concerns regarding undue restrictions on the

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>261. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
</p>
<p>the response received to one of the communications sent during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>However, he regrets that no responses have been received to the remaining seven 
</p>
<p>communications and urges the Government to respond in a timely manner, particularly due 
</p>
<p>to the serious allegations addressed therein.  
</p>
<p>262. The Special Rapporteur expresses his serious concern at the arrest, arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention and sentencing of human rights defenders, student activists, journalists and 
</p>
<p>lawyers on the serious charge of &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, often without the 
fundamental guarantees of due process and fair trial for exercising their rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association. 
</p>
<p>263. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern regarding reports of acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation and reprisals in detention, including the torture and ill treatment of detainees, 
</p>
<p>prolonged solitary confinement, prolonged and harsh investigation and psychological 
</p>
<p>mistreatment. He also wishes to draw attention to the worrying denial and inadequate 
</p>
<p>provision of medical care to individuals charged and sentenced based on their involvement 
</p>
<p>in human rights activities. During this reporting period, the majority of communications 
</p>
<p>sent by the Special Rapporteur to the Government have been in relation to the poor state of 
</p>
<p>health and lack of access to health care for human rights defenders who are in detention. A 
</p>
<p>number of these human rights defenders suffer from serious health conditions and are in 
</p>
<p>urgent need of adequate treatment. The Special Rapporteur the Government for its 
</p>
<p>responses regarding the health condition of four of the seven detained human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders mentioned in the communication sent on 15 July 2014. However, he urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to provide information on the remaining three detainees, as well as those 
</p>
<p>included in other communications during the present reporting period, as soon as possible 
</p>
<p>as grave concern is expressed about their state of health and limited access to medical 
</p>
<p>treatment.  
</p>
<p>264. The Special Rapporteur is also particularly concerned about numerous reports of 
</p>
<p>reprisals against human rights defenders due to their engagement with the UN Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran and cooperation with other UN 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and representatives. This includes reprisals against a prisoner and his family 
due to a letter addressed to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran 
</p>
<p>on the conditions in detention.

<p>269. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Lao People&#8217;s Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic (Lao PDR) for the response transmitted to the communication sent on 9 December 
</p>
<p>2013. However, he regrets that no response has been received to the other communication 
</p>
<p>sent during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>270. In relation to the ongoing disappearance of Mr. Sombath Somphone, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterates his grave concern that this could be related to his legitimate work on 
</p>
<p>land rights in Lao PDR. In a joint press release on 16 December 2013, a group of UN 
</p>
<p>human rights experts urged the Government to increase its efforts in the investigations into 
</p>
<p>the enforced disappearance of Mr. Sombath Somphone as his case could greatly deter 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders from operating in the country.  
</p>
<p>271. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern about Decree No. 327 on Internet-
</p>
<p>Based Information Control/Management, which entered into force on 1 October 2014 and 
</p>
<p>which appears to unduly restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Lao 
</p>
<p>PDR. Concern is expressed that the vaguely defined provisions may be used to silence any 
</p>
<p>form of criticism of the policies and practices of the ruling party. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reiterates the call made in the communication sent on 7 November 2014 urging the 
</p>
<p>Government to repeal this Decree or to review it in order to ensure its consistency with 
</p>
<p>existing human rights norms and standards. Due to the restrictive nature of this Decree on 
</p>
<p>the space for freedom of expression in civil society, the Special Rapporteur further 
</p>
<p>encourages the Government to respond promptly to the questions raised in the 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>279. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed responses received 
</p>
<p>to two of the four communications sent during the present reporting period, as well as to 
</p>
<p>two communications that were sent in the previous reporting period.  
</p>
<p>280. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern at apparent acts of reprisals against 
</p>
<p>COMANGO, a coalition of Malaysian NGOs, following their engagement in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Periodic Review process. Concern is expressed at the harassment and apparent attempt to 
</p>
<p>ban the coalition. On 10 January 2014, the spokesperson of the UN High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, Ms. Navi Pillay, publicly expressed her grave concerns regarding what she 
</p>
<p>believes appears to be an act of reprisal against COMANGO for its engagement with 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms6. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the fact 
</p>
<p>that COMANGO is no longer considered &#8220;illegal&#8221; and that, according to the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>response, the coalition had been deemed &#8220;unregistered&#8221; under the Societies Act, rather than 
</p>
<p>illegal.  The Special Rapporteur further welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to the full 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society in the Universal Periodic Review process. However, he 
</p>
<p>expresses concern in relation to the Government&#8217;s compliance with certain provisions, 
</p>
<p>which are protected under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>281. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to concerns at charges that have 
</p>
<p>been brought against an increasing number of human rights defenders, lawyers, political 
</p>
<p>activists, academics and journalists under the Sedition Act of 1948, including for publicly 
</p>
<p>expressing opinions, publishing books, articles, notes or disseminating opinions and 
</p>
<p>information through different channels, including through the Internet and traditional 
</p>
<p>media. It is reported that the authorities have made increasing use of the Sedition Act to 
</p>
<p>prevent and criminalise the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression.  The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the vagueness of the provisions in the 
</p>
<p>Act could be used to suppress expression and curb peaceful assembly. He welcomes the 
</p>
<p>decision by the Sessions Court to allow an application by one of the persons charged with 
</p>
<p>sedition to challenge the constitutionality of the Sedition Act at the High Court. He urges 
</p>
<p>the Government of Malaysia to end the criminalization and prosecutions against the 
</p>
<p>legitimate exercise of freedom of expression and opinion and to adjust its legislations 
</p>
<p>including the 1948 Sedition Act, to be in-line with the international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>282. The Special Rapporteur expresses further concern at the violations of the rights of 
</p>
<p>environmental and human rights defenders in relation to their participation in a peaceful 
</p>
<p>protest, including the excessive use of force by the police and their subsequent arrest, 
</p>
<p>detention and the charges brought against them. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reminds the Government of their responsibility to protect the right to the freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly.

</p>
<p>286. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports of the situation of journalists in the

</p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>293. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for the detailed 
</p>
<p>responses provided to all four communications sent during the reporting period. However, 
</p>
<p>he expresses his concern that the Government&#8217;s responses received on 25 July 2014, which 
</p>
<p>request the withdrawal of the joint letters sent to the Government and, as such, do not 
</p>
<p>address the allegations raised in the communications. 
</p>
<p>294. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at the arrest and detention of Mr. 
</p>
<p>Thaw Zin. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the release of Mr. Thaw Zin on 26 
</p>
<p>September 2014, he remains concerned about the restrictive nature of the Right to Peaceful 
</p>
<p>Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law which was adopted in 2011, as reiterated by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar in January 20157. 
</p>
<p>295. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by reports of reprisals against human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders for their cooperation with the UN human rights mechanisms and the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council Special Procedures. In particular he reiterates his concern at the 
</p>
<p>arrest and sentencing of Mr. Sein Than following his cooperation with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, Ms. Yanghee Lee. Mr. Sein 
</p>
<p>Than met with Ms. Yanghee Lee during her mission to Myanmar in July 2014 and was 
</p>
<p>arrested while he was on his way to the main UN compound to provide further 
</p>
<p>documentation for her attention. 
</p>
<p>296. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the Law relating to 
</p>
<p>Registration of Organisations and the draft laws on religious conversion and on interfaith 
</p>
<p>marriage which are being debated by the Parliament. While the Special Rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>welcomes the constructive dialogue between Members of Parliament, representatives of 
</p>
<p>civil society and members of the international community, in relation to these laws, and the 
</p>
<p>efforts to bring the laws into compliance with international norms and standards, there is 
</p>
<p>still concern over a number of provisions which would unduly restrict a number of 
</p>
<p>fundamental human rights, including the rights to religion and to freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar has further

<p>highlighted the possible backtracking in the political reform process if these laws are not

<p><b>  Observations

<p>303. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the acknowledgements of receipt to two of the 
</p>
<p>three communications sent to the Government of Pakistan during the present reporting 
</p>
<p>period, and trusts that a substantive response to each communication will be received 
</p>
<p>shortly, given the seriousness of the allegations presented.  
</p>
<p>304. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern in relation to the Foreign 
</p>
<p>Contributions Bill, which, if adopted, would regulate the use of foreign contributions by 
</p>
<p>national and international non-governmental organisations. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reiterates his concern at the proposed law which could impose undue restrictions on the 
</p>
<p>recipients of foreign funds, including criminalisation, as well as a limitation on right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association. The Special Rapporteur highlights his concern that the provisions 
</p>
<p>of the Bill are vague and fall short of complying with international human rights norms and 
</p>
<p>standards and that the adoption of this Bill could result in significant restrictions on the 
</p>
<p>space for civil society and human rights organisations in Pakistan, and as such limit their 
</p>
<p>legitimate and peaceful human rights activities. 
</p>
<p>305. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by the intimidation of Mr. Nasrullah 
</p>
<p>Baloch, which appear to have been an act of reprisal for his work on disappeared persons 
</p>
<p>and his legitimate engagement with the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the physical and psychological integrity 
</p>
<p>of Mr. Nasrullah Baloch, as well as of his relatives and his colleagues. 
</p>
<p>306. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the intimidation of lawyers who 
</p>
<p>advocate against the misuse of blasphemy laws in Pakistan and the killing of Mr. Rashid 
</p>
<p>Rehman and who defend persons who are charged under such laws. He is further concerned 
</p>
<p>for the physical integrity and safety of lawyers who work on blasphemy cases in Pakistan, 
</p>
<p>amid reports that many are unwilling to take up such cases due to acts of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>threats. The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind the Government of its responsibility to 
</p>
<p>ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights lawyers whereby they can practice 
</p>
<p>without fear of repercussions.

<p>He urges the Government to promptly respond to the communications sent, given the

<p>344. The Special Rapporteur expresses particular concern at the reports of a series of 
</p>
<p>killings, attempted killings and death threats against human rights defenders in the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, especially of indigenous leaders, peasant leaders and environmental activists. 
All three communications sent during the reporting period raised concerns about an

<p>increasingly dangerous environment for human rights defenders amid cases of killings, 
</p>
<p>threats and harassment as well as concern for the physical and psychological integrity of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and their families. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to

<p>ensure that prompt, thorough and impartial investigations are conducted with the aim of

<p>bringing those responsible to justice and to guarantee a safe and enabling environment in 
</p>
<p>which human rights defenders can carry out their legitimate activities.

<p>319. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed replies to the three 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>320. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at indications of restrictions on the space 
</p>
<p>for trade unions, including on the right to strike. The unduly restriction on trade unions, 
</p>
<p>including massive layoffs of staff, arrests, raids of offices, disbandment and possible

<p>disciplinary and criminal sanctions against some union members, has been highlighted in 
</p>
<p>two of the three communications sent during the reporting period in relation to the

</p>

<p>investigations that are taking place into the legality of the measures taken and hopes that a 
</p>
<p>fair and impartial conclusion can be achieved. 
</p>
<p>321. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern at the reported excessive use of force 
</p>
<p>by governmental, private security and police forces against environmental and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, as well as communities affected by the construction of nuclear power 
</p>
<p>transmission towers as a result of peaceful sit-ins that were taking place in opposition to

<p>331. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Sri Lanka for its responses to 
</p>
<p>three of the six communications sent during the present reporting period and trusts that 
</p>
<p>responses will be received to the three remaining communications shortly. 
</p>
<p>332. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern in relation to acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>and death threats directed against human rights defenders. Grave concern is also expressed 
</p>
<p>that in some cases, this includes acts of reprisals for cooperating with the UN and its 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and representatives in the field on human rights, notably in connection with 
</p>
<p>the visit of High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Navanethem Pillay, to Sri Lanka in 
</p>
<p>2013. He also expresses concern at further reports of reprisals against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders following their participation and engagement with the UN Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, including the use of media to defame human rights defenders and threats made to 
</p>
<p>a human rights defender who participated in a side-event during a Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>session in Geneva. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government response 
</p>
<p>received on 23 September 2014, which outlines the parameters of domestic law specific to 
</p>
<p>this case. However, he wishes to remind the Government of its responsibility under </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>international human rights law to ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders to carry out their legitimate work.  
</p>
<p>333. The Special Rapporteur notes the response from the Government in relation to 
</p>
<p>human rights lawyer Mr. Upul Jayasuriya detailing the steps taken to provide him with 
</p>
<p>special protection as well as information on the investigation into his case and urges them 
</p>
<p>to ensure that human rights defenders are in a position to continue with their legitimate and 
</p>
<p>peaceful work. He however expresses concerns regarding the arrest and detention, 
</p>
<p>surveillance and intimidation of human rights defenders and for their physical and 
</p>
<p>psychological integrity.  
</p>
<p>334. In addition, the Special Rapporteur wishes to encourage the adequate protection of

<p>the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in relation to the dispersal of, 
</p>
<p>and acts of intimidation against, a group of individuals who had gathered to discuss cases of 
</p>
<p>disappearances. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the acknowledgement of receipt and 
</p>
<p>awaits a substantive response from the Government and urges the Government to ensure the 
</p>
<p>physical and psychological integrity of human rights defenders working on the issue of

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>344. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses received from the 
</p>
<p>Royal Thai Government to three of the six communications issued during the reporting 
</p>
<p>period. He trusts that responses to the remaining communications will be received shortly, 
</p>
<p>given the situation for human rights defenders in a context of restrictions to the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression following the military coup on 22 May 2014. In this 
</p>
<p>regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that the State has a duty to protect and 
</p>
<p>to provide a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders to conduct their 
</p>
<p>work. 
</p>
<p>345. The Special Rapporteur expresses particular concern at the consideration of a draft 
</p>
<p>Public Assembly Act, which may unduly curtail the right to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and the right to freedom of opinion and expression, if adopted without further changes. He 
is concerned that the vague wording of the draft law could be used to arbitrarily restrict the 
</p>
<p>right of peaceful assembly and impose disproportionate penalties, including holding 
</p>
<p>organisers accountable for the actions of others. He encourages that the draft Act be 
</p>
<p>amended in accordance with international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>346. The Special Rapporteur is also particularly concerned by reports of attempted 
</p>
<p>killings, intimidation, revocation of national passport, arrest warrants and criminal 
</p>
<p>complaints filed against human rights defenders who document cases of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations or who publicly voice criticism about measures adopted by the National Council 
</p>
<p>for Peace and Order in Thailand in what appears to be reprisals for the legitimate exercise 
</p>
<p>of the right to freedom of expression. He stresses his concerns regarding the use of the 
</p>
<p>judicial proceedings on cases related to defamation, such as the defamation charges against 
</p>
<p>journalists Mr. Alan Morison and Ms. Chutima Sidasathian for their monitoring and 
</p>
<p>reporting on the situation of the stateless Rohingya people. The use of defamation laws to 
</p>
<p>restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression of journalists is a worrying trend. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur notes, however, an update to the communication sent on 12 
</p>
<p>November 2014 regarding the formal submission by the police of a report to the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General's office recommending non-prosecution for the complaint against Ms. Pornpen 
</p>
<p>Khongkachonkiet and Mr. Somchai Homla-or. The Special Rapporteur further 
</p>
<p>acknowledges the proposal by the Right and Liberties Protection Department to establish 
</p>
<p>further provisions to ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders, as 
</p>
<p>detailed in the Government&#8217;s responses received on 9 September 2014 and 9 October 2014. 
</p>
<p>As such, he encourages the Government to follow through with this proposal, in 
</p>
<p>consultation with human rights defenders, to ensure that appropriate protection measures be 
</p>
<p>put in place for human rights defenders at risk. 
</p>
<p>347. In relation to the attacks, threats and subsequent charges against villagers of 
</p>
<p>Nanongbong and members of the Khon Rak Ban Keod Group due to their opposition to a 
</p>
<p>gold mine, the Special Rapporteur thanks for the update received on 8 December 2014 
</p>
<p>informing him that the cases against the villagers, including human rights defenders, were

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>356. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the substantive responses to six 
</p>
<p>of the seven communications that were sent during the reporting period and he looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving responses to the remaining communication.  
</p>
<p>357. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at the arrest, detention, and 
sentencing, as well as the judicial harassment and assault of human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>bloggers for exercising their right to freedom of opinion and expression, including activities 
</p>
<p>advocating for freedom of religion or belief. He is further concerned by the lack of due 
</p>
<p>process in the trials of those sentenced. The reported shrinking space for human rights 
</p>
<p>discussion and debate online is an increasingly worrying development. He is further </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>concerned by the treatment and conditions of a number of human rights defenders in 
</p>
<p>detention, some of whom have been refused access to legal counsel, books and religious 
</p>
<p>guidance.  
</p>
<p>358. The Special Rapporteur expresses further concern at the apparent restrictions, 
</p>
<p>including the imposition of travel bans, against citizens and human rights defenders seeking 
</p>
<p>to engage with the UN and its human rights mechanisms. This includes the denial of Mr. 
</p>
<p>Pham Chi Dung from travelling to Geneva to participate in a side-event at the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its responsibility to 
</p>
<p>ensure that human rights defenders can cooperate freely with international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>359. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to cases of reprisals against human 
</p>
<p>right defenders and some members of the independent religious communities for their 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion of belief during his 
</p>
<p>visit to the country from 21 to 31 July 2014. Following the visit, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief stated that any incidents of reprisal for engagement with him 
</p>
<p>during his visit would be reported to the Human Rights Council and the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly11. Since his visit, there have been a number of cases of reprisals against 
</p>
<p>independent Hoa Hao Buddhists and Duong Van Minh believers who cooperated, or sought 
</p>
<p>to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief during his official 
</p>
<p>visit to Vietnam. Concerns are expressed at the continued suppression and persecution of 
</p>
<p>independent religious communities, most of who are religious minorities and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. 
</p>
<p>360. The Special Rapporteur expresses his hope that the Government will respond 
</p>
<p>favourably to his request (2015) to visit Viet Nam to enable him to gain a better 
</p>
<p>understanding of the situation of human rights defenders in the country. He remains 
</p>
<p>available to provide guidance and assistance the Government might require. 
</p>
<p><b>EUROPE &amp; CENTRAL ASIA REGION 
</b></p>
<p>361. During the present reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 37 communications 
</p>
<p>to Governments in the Europe and Central Asia region.  He notes with satisfaction the 
</p>
<p>response rate of 79 per cent for communications sent to the region, which is significantly 
</p>
<p>higher than other regions. The Special Rapporteur also received five late responses to 
</p>
<p>communications issued during previous reporting periods. 
</p>
<p>362. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the increasing obstructions to 
</p>
<p>civil society space and the work of human rights defenders in a number of countries in 
</p>
<p>Europe and Central Asia. A significant number of communications sent to the region 
</p>
<p>addresses the drafting, passing or implementation of restrictive legislation. As has been the 
</p>
<p>situation in recent years, non-governmental organisations in a number of countries in the 
</p>
<p>region are operating under very restrictive legislation and face restrictions in connection to 
</p>
<p>receiving foreign funding, to the extent that many can no longer continue their legitimate 
</p>
<p>human rights activities. The use of anti-terrorism laws to restrict civil society space is also 
</p>
<p>of concern, as well as the use of investigations and judicial harassment to further obstruct 
</p>
<p>the work of human rights organisations. 
</p>
<p>363. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his concern regarding the ongoing 
</p>
<p>targeting of defenders advocating for the rights of LGBTI persons, both by non-State actors

<p>in the form of threats, intimidation and physical attacks, as well as through recent 
</p>
<p>legislation criminalising much of the work that they undertake.  
</p>
<p>364. In a number of communications, the Special Rapporteur has also highlighted a 
</p>
<p>particularly worrying pattern of arbitrary arrest and detention, judicial harassment, charges 
</p>
<p>brought against and the sentencing of human rights defenders as a result of their human 
</p>
<p>rights work. A number of prominent human rights defenders from the region have been and 
</p>
<p>remain detained due to their work. In addition, there are reports of ill treatment in detention. 
</p>
<p>In terms of judicial harassment, instances of enforced psychiatric treatment for human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders are of grave concern. 
</p>
<p>365. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern for cases of reprisals against human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders for their cooperation with UN human rights mechanisms, as well as cases 
</p>
<p>where travel bans have prevented human rights defenders from attending meetings and 
</p>
<p>engaging with the UN. 
</p>
<p>366. The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind States in the region of their responsibility 
</p>
<p>to protect and provide a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders to 
</p>
<p>conduct their work as well as to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in detention, 
</p>
<p>including the provision of adequate medical care and treatment.

</p>
<p>concerning the adoption of Law No. 57 on Equal Rights and Equal Opportunities for Men 
</p>
<p>and Women. He appreciates the Government&#8217;s expressed commitment to gender equality as 
</p>
<p>evidenced by the introduction of this law. He further notes the role of the Council on 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Affairs, set up by the Prime Minister in 2000, to promote women&#8217;s rights in 
</p>
<p>society. The Special Rapporteur also acknowledges the Government&#8217;s shared concern at the 
</p>
<p>incidents of intimidation and harassment of non-governmental organisations working on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and urges it to ensure that the law enforcement agencies are aware of such 
</p>
<p>concerns and take necessary actions to adequately address them. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>looks forward to receiving further information on the conclusion will be reached in the 
</p>
<p>investigation into these incidents. However, the concluding observations by the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in July 2014 highlights its concern at the deep-

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>376. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the replies transmitted to two of 
</p>
<p>the five communications sent during the reporting period but notes that this constitutes a 
</p>
<p>decrease in the response rate compared to the last reporting period.13  
</p>
<p>377. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the increased persecution of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders and civil society organisations in Azerbaijan, including continued 
</p>
<p>surveillance, arrest, interrogation, charging and pre-trial detention of a number of high-
</p>
<p>profile human rights defenders in the country. He is also concerned about received reports 
</p>
<p>which indicate that a number of human rights defenders in pre-trial detention are being 
</p>
<p>detained in poor prison conditions and have not been granted adequate access to medical 
</p>
<p>care. 
</p>
<p>378. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned about the amendments to the Law on 
</p>
<p>Grants, the Law on Non-governmental Organisations, and the Code of Administrative 
</p>
<p>Offences, which increased penalties for organisations that are not approved by the 
</p>
<p>Government through registration and that are therefore not legally entitled to receive 
</p>
<p>funding for their cause. The Special Rapporteur believes that this constitutes an undue 
</p>
<p>restriction to the right to associate freely, which further narrows the space for legitimate and 
</p>
<p>independent work by human rights defenders, as was previously highlighted in the previous 
</p>
<p>reporting period.14  
</p>
<p>379. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about restrictions on the freedom of the 
</p>
<p>media in the country and the number of received reports of death threats against a human 
</p>
<p>rights journalist, which have allegedly not been investigated by the authorities. In that 
</p>
<p>context, he shares concerns expressed by the Chair of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly&#8217;s

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>383. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to the 
</p>
<p>communication sent regarding the deportation of Ms. Elena Tonkacheva, chair of the board 
</p>
<p>of the Legal Transformation Centre (Lawtrend). While acknowledging the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>clarifications for the decision of the internal affairs authorities to deport Ms. Tonkacheva 
</p>
<p>and bar her from entering Belarus for three years, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
</p>
<p>Government reportedly expelled her from the country on 21 February 2015. 
</p>
<p>384. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive concerns at the severe restrictions in 
</p>
<p>place on the rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression in the country. This 
</p>
<p>includes the use of legal and administrative provisions or the use of the judicial system to 
</p>
<p>criminalise defenders and significantly curtail civil society activism. Such actions by the 
</p>
<p>State, including revoking permanent residence status, highlights the ever&#8211;increasing 
</p>
<p>restrictions on civil society and the legitimate work of human rights defenders. The 
</p>
<p>restrictive context has also been underlined by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in Belarus, who notes that human rights defenders are under constant political 
</p>
<p>pressure from the authorities in the context of severe limitations of the right to independent 
</p>
<p>civil society activities.16  
</p>
<p>385. Following requests from the Government of Belarus for more information

<p>his availability to provide guidance to the Government in that connection, as well as on any

</p>
<p>398.   The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the detailed response from the Government to 
</p>
<p>the communication sent on 31 January 2014, which outlines Kazakshtan&#8217;s policies and 
</p>
<p>legislations in the area of freedom of religion. He however urges the Government to 
</p>
<p>provide more specific information concerning the questions raised in the communication on 
</p>
<p>the case of human rights lawyer Mr. Yuriy Toporov, who was convicted of an 
</p>
<p>administrative offence in March 2014 and had to leave the country after legally 
</p>
<p>representing the religious minority of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses who are reportedly subjected to 
</p>
<p>crackdown and persecution.  
</p>
<p>399. The Special Rapporteur is particularly seized by the case of the involuntary 
</p>
<p>psychiatric confinement of human rights lawyer Ms. Zinaida Mukhortova. He is concerned 
</p>
<p>that in its response the Government does not recognise Ms. Mukhortova as a human rights 
</p>
<p>defender, despite abundant evidence of her work as a lawyer on human rights issues for ten </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>years. While welcoming the release of Ms. Mukhortova on 15 December 2014, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur remains concerned with her physical and psychological integrity given that her 
</p>
<p>release is only conditional and that she might be detained again. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reiterates that a State has a duty to protect and provide a safe and enabling environment for 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders to conduct their work in Kazakhstan, and he remains available to 
</p>
<p>provide guidance the Government may require in this regard.

<p>405. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of finalising this report, no responses 
</p>
<p>have been received to any of the communications sent during the reporting period. He 
</p>
<p>strongly urges the Government to provide responses to the communications due to the 
</p>
<p>severity of the issues addressed therein. 
</p>
<p>406.  The Special Rapporteur expresses particular concern regarding two draft laws 
</p>
<p>which are being considered by the Parliament that would restrict the work of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and defenders working on the rights of LGBT persons. He is concerned by the 
</p>
<p>draft bill &#8220;On the formation of a positive attitude toward non-traditional forms of sexual 
</p>
<p>relations&#8221;, which would impose a range of criminal and administrative sanctions for 
</p>
<p>disseminating information that encourages what are considered &#8220;non-traditional sexual 
</p>
<p>relations&#8221; in the Kyrgyz Republic. He notes that in April 2014 the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee underlined reports of violence against LGBT persons by both State and non-
</p>
<p>State actors, and the failure on the part of the State to address such violence.17 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterates his concerns given that the draft law passed its first reading at the 
</p>
<p>parliament in October 2014 and urges the Kyrgyz Parliament to reject the proposed law, 
</p>
<p>which would be in contravention to fundamental human rights and impede the work of 
</p>
<p>LGBT activists in the country.

</p>
<p>adopted, would restrict the right to freedom of association and may lead to the

<p>amendment would contradict both national and international law pertaining to freedom of

</p>
<p>408. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the situation for human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders in the Kyrgyz Republic, especially with regards to cases where the authorities 
</p>
<p>have been accused of perpetrating the physical attacks and threats against human rights 
</p>

<p>424. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the Government&#8217;s replies received 
</p>
<p>for all of the communications sent during the reporting period.  However, he observes that 
</p>
<p>not all of the questions raised in the communications were addressed by the Government in 
</p>
<p>its responses.  
</p>
<p>425. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his serious concern about the use of the legal and 
</p>
<p>administrative framework to restrict the exercise of the rights to freedom of opinion and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>expression, association and peaceful assembly, which creates an extremely challenging 
</p>
<p>environment for human rights defenders to carry out their legitimate human rights work. 
</p>
<p>426 The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the enforcement of and amendments 
</p>
<p>to the Law on Introducing Amendments to Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in 
</p>
<p>Part Regulating Activities of Non-commercial Organizations which Carry Functions of 
</p>
<p>Foreign Agents. Concern has previously been expressed by a number of special procedures 
</p>
<p>and UN treaty bodies, as well as noted in the previous observations report of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur,
19
</p>
<p> with regard to the negative impact of this law, in particular the interpretation 
</p>
<p>of vaguely defined concepts such as &#8220;engaging in political activities&#8221; or &#8220;staging political 
</p>
<p>actions to influence public policy or opinion&#8221;, on the legitimate work of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and civil society organisations.  
</p>
<p>427. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the amendment to article 22 of the same 
</p>
<p>law to allow the Ministry of Justice, at its own initiative and without a court decision, to 
</p>
<p>register non-commercial organizations that act as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221;. There is further concern 
</p>
<p>at the use of this law to restrict the activities of a number of organisations due to their 
</p>
<p>criticism of this very law, which is a worrying trend for human rights defenders who 
</p>
<p>exercise their rights to freedom of expression and of assembly as part of their human rights 
</p>
<p>work. In this context, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern that a renowned 
</p>
<p>organization &#8220;Human Rights Center Memorial&#8221; is facing a legal battle in the courts against 
</p>
<p>the Justice Ministry&#8217;s decision to include them into the registry of &#8220;foreign agents.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>428. Special Rapporteur notes that the submission was made in February 2015 to the State 
</p>
<p>Duma of the Russian Parliament of a draft law to introduce procedures to remove non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations from the &quot;foreign agent&quot; register. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court on 28 January 2015 to reject the lawsuit filed 
</p>
<p>by the Minister of Justice against NGO Historical, Educational, Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Charitable Society &#8220;Memorial&#8221; on the charges of &#8220;infringements&#8221; due to the group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>organisational structure. This is a positive move in the context of increasing restrictions on 
</p>
<p>the space for civil society in the country.  
</p>
<p>429. The Special Rapporteur strongly regrets reports of reprisals against human rights 
</p>
<p>organisations for their cooperation with UN human rights mechanisms, as well as cases 
</p>
<p>where the authorities have prevented the participation of activists in the events organised by 
</p>
<p>the United Nations. He also expresses concern regarding the detention of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, including their ill treatment and denial of access to family and lawyers. He is 
</p>
<p>equally concerned by a number of cases of smear campaigns, stigmatisation and harassment 
</p>
<p>against defenders, notably by certain state-controlled television channels and by state 
</p>
<p>actors.  
</p>
<p>430. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his availability to provide guidance to the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Russian Federation on issues related to the establishment and 
</p>
<p>strengthening of a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders, including 
</p>
<p>through a conducive legal, institutional and administrative framework. He hopes that the

<p>Government to investigate all allegations of ill treatment and lack of due process and to 
</p>
<p>ensure the complaint procedure for those in detention is accessible, he expresses concern at 
</p>
<p>the contrasting accounts of the facts presented by witnesses to the events and those 
</p>
<p>provided by the Government. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, to date, prison authorities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>have not carried out an impartial investigation into allegations of torture against those who 
</p>
<p>witnessed Mr. Ikromzoda&#8217;s death. 
</p>
<p>446. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern at the allegations of espionage against 
</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander Sodiqov for the legitimate and peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and opinion, and to the freedom of association in the context of his research on 
</p>
<p>conflict resolutions and other topics in Tajikistan. While he welcomes the decision of the 
</p>
<p>authorities to release Mr. Sodiqov on bail and to allow him to return to Canada, he remains 
</p>
<p>concerned that the investigation into the criminal case against Mr. Sodiqov is ongoing. 
</p>
<p>447. The Special rapporteur expresses his concern at the sentencing of human rights 
</p>
<p>lawyer Mr. Shukhrat Kudratov, which is believed to be in relation to his legitimate human 
</p>
<p>rights work, notably representing opposition activists. He is further concerned by the 
</p>
<p>reported sentencing of Mr. Kudratov on 13 January 2015 to nine years in a penal colony.

<p>451. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the Government&#8217;s replies received

<p>452. He expresses concern at the use of recent legislative amendments that allow the

</p>
<p>and Youtube webpages. He reiterates the statement in March 2014 by the previous Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Margaret Sekaggya, who 
</p>
<p>highlighted the key role of social media and access to information for those who defend and 
</p>
<p>promote human rights, including by monitoring elections and public debate, and by raising 
</p>
<p>issues of public interest.  Concern is expressed at the use of such legislation to restrict the

<p>461. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses provided to both 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>462. The Special Rapporteur reiterates concern about information received regarding the 
</p>
<p>continuous harassment, detention, and prosecution of human rights defenders due to their 
</p>
<p>legitimate human rights work. He expresses particular concern regarding the lack of due 
</p>
<p>process in the trial of human rights defenders according to international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards. 
</p>
<p>463. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern at allegations received of the 
</p>
<p>arbitrary detention and torture of human rights defender Mr. Fakhriddin Tillaev, as well as 
</p>
<p>of a lack of due process in his trial and the severity of the sentencing.  
</p>
<p>464. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern at the alleged arbitrary nature of Mr. 
</p>
<p>Mamatkhonov&#8217;s detention and sentencing, which may be linked to his legitimate human 
rights activities. Similar concern is raised that his trial did not meet basic international 
</p>
<p>standards of fairness and that he was denied access to a lawyer.  
</p>
<p><b>  MIDDLE EAST &amp; NORTH AFRICA REGION 
</b></p>
<p>465. During the current reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 37 communications 
</p>
<p>to countries in the region of Middle East and North Africa.  He takes note of the response 
</p>
<p>rate of 65 per centfor the region, a substantial increase on the previous reporting period. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also received four late responses to communications issued during 
</p>
<p>previous reporting periods. 
</p>
<p>466. In the communications sent, the Special Rapporteur has brought a number of issues 
</p>
<p>to the attention of Governments in the region. He is particularly concerned by the 
</p>
<p>involvement of State actors in the restriction of civil society space, as well as the direct 
</p>
<p>targeting of human rights defenders, including instances of arbitrary arrests and detention, 
</p>
<p>and unfair legal proceedings. He is also troubled by reports of ill treatment and torture in 
</p>
<p>detention. He deeply regrets the continued use of a range of legislation to restrict the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression in the region, including the broad 
</p>
<p>interpretation and use of anti-terrorism laws and other laws regarding the registration of 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organisations.  
</p>
<p>467. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight another worrying pattern of 
</p>
<p>intimidation, harassment, threats and persecution of media workers and journalists, 
</p>
<p>including bloggers, who bring attention to human rights issues and are seen to criticise 
</p>
<p>governments and authorities in this regard. In a number of countries, the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression is severely restricted. Those who highlight human rights abuses and call for the 
</p>
<p>situation to be addressed, either in their professional capacity or through social media, face 
</p>
<p>varying levels of intimidation, judicial harassment, arrest, charges and harsh sentencing. 
</p>
<p>468. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by instances of reprisals against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders in the region, including detention and the issuing of travel bans, as a result of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>65 
</b></p>
<p>their legitimate engagement with UN human rights mechanisms. He also underlines his

<p>concern that travel bans are increasingly used in order to obstruct defenders&#8217; possibility to

<p>cooperate with international institutions and organisations.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>480. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Kingdom of Bahrain for the 
</p>
<p>responses received to three out five communications sent during the reporting period. He 
</p>
<p>trusts that a substantive response will be provided in due course to the other 
</p>
<p>communications. He expresses his repeated concern with regards to the volume of the 
</p>
<p>allegations received and the severity of the issues raised therein.  
</p>
<p>481. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern at the ongoing harassment and 
</p>
<p>intimidation of members of human rights organisations, a number of who remain at risk of 
</p>
<p>alleged arbitrary detention and ill treatment as a result of their legitimate and peaceful 
</p>
<p>activities. Furthermore, concern is expressed at the use of national security interests to 
</p>
<p>justify measures and acts aimed at supressing opposition, including groups working 
</p>
<p>peacefully for the defence of human rights, and at repressive practices against civil society 
</p>
<p>that exceed limitations set in international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>482. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the physical and psychological integrity 
</p>
<p>of activists, including women human rights defenders, who exercise their rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression, peaceful assembly and association, as well as of those who monitor such 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms in Bahrain, including prominent human rights defenders. Grave 
</p>
<p>concern is expressed about reports that arrest and detention of some activists might also be 
</p>
<p>an act of reprisal due to cooperation with the United Nations and its human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. In this regard, he strongly urges the Government to ensure that human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders can carry out their legitimate activities in a safe and an enabling environment, 
</p>
<p>including through open and unhindered access to international human rights bodies such as 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in the field of human rights, without 
</p>
<p>fear of harassment, stigmatisation or criminalisation of any kind. 
</p>
<p>483. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about information received regarding 
</p>
<p>the treatment and conditions in detention, including physical abuse, isolation and refusal of 
</p>
<p>access to family members and legal representatives.  
</p>
<p>484. The Special Rapporteur regrets that human rights defenders continue to be 
</p>
<p>persecuted in Bahrain despite the Government&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations made 
</p>
<p>during its Universal Periodic Review in 2012 to abandon restrictions on human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. In that context, it is noted that two visits to Bahrain by the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in 2012 and 2013 
</p>
<p>were postponed, or effectively cancelled.23 The Special Rapporteur urges the Government

<p>494. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for providing responses to

</p>
<p>the previous reporting period. While he acknowledges that a number of the responses 
</p>
<p>address the issues that were subject of the communications, he encourages the Government 
</p>
<p>to provide detailed answers that are specific to the questions raised therein. 
</p>
<p>495. The Special Rapporteur expresses his repeated concern at the escalating violence, 
</p>
<p>intimidation and judicial harassment against journalists and media workers including 
</p>
<p>alleged killings, arbitrary arrests and detention and raids of the offices of news channels and 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1

</p>
<p>496. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by the arrests and sentencing of 
</p>
<p>protestors, including journalists and human rights defenders, following peaceful assemblies 
</p>
<p>due to the enforcement of Law No. 107/2013 &#8220;For organizing the right to peaceful public 
meetings, processions and protests&#8221;. This law was the subject of a number of 
</p>
<p>communications from various Special Rapporteurs, as well as two public statements24 by 
</p>
<p>the then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay who expressed her concern 
</p>
<p>at the increasing restrictions on the right to freedom of assembly and criminalisation of 
</p>
<p>peaceful protests. The Government&#8217;s response, which outlines the provisions of the law and 
</p>
<p>gives its detailed account of the protests, states that the protesters who were detained had 
</p>
<p>deliberately disrupted the peace and engaged in violence during the protest. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur regrets that a number of protestors have received prison sentences for their 
</p>
<p>participation in peaceful demonstrations amid claims of their arbitrary arrest, ill treatment 
</p>
<p>and lack of due process. In a number of cases, those arrested were peacefully protesting 
</p>
<p>against this very law, including on on 21 June 2014 when a large number of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders were arrested and later sentenced to three years imprisonment. While the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur acknowledges that, on 28 December 2014, this sentence was reduced on appeal, 
</p>
<p>he remains gravely concerned at the disproportionate punishments under this law, which 
</p>
<p>heavily restricts the right to freedom of assembly and has a deleterious impact on the work 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders in the country.  
</p>
<p>497. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern regarding undue restrictions on the 
</p>
<p>peaceful work of civil society organisations, in particular with regards to the NGO Law 
</p>
<p>84/2002, which has been the subject of a number of previous communications. It is 
</p>
<p>important to note that, following the Universal Periodic Review of Egypt in 2010, the 
</p>
<p>Government pledged to revise the law. While the Special Rapporteur notes the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s response in which it expresses its commitment to revise the law with the 
</p>
<p>input of civil society, he remains distressed at the negative environment for civil society 
</p>
<p>organisations and the disproportionate sanctions for non-compliance with this highly 
</p>
<p>restrictive law. 
</p>
<p>498. The Special Rapporteur is also troubled by the reports of the targeting of human 
</p>
<p>rights organisations by security officials, including raids on the offices of the Egyptian 
Centre for Economic and Social Rights and the arbitrary arrest and detention of its 
</p>
<p>members and the ill treatment suffered during their arrest. According to the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>response, the raid was to find Mr. Mohamed Adel, who was subsequently arrested and 
</p>
<p>sentenced for peacefully protesting. However, the organisation is known to have cooperated 
</p>
<p>with UN human rights mechanisms and is involved in a campaign together with other 
</p>
<p>NGOs to revoke Law no.107/2013. Furthermore, in April 2014 the Cairo Court of Urgent 
</p>
<p>Matters issued a ban on the April 6 Youth Movement, the organisation where Mr. 
</p>
<p>Mohamed Adel was director. The organisation was accused of a number of charges, 
</p>
<p>including using the movement &#8220;to cause chaos and bloodshed&#8221;, attacking the State Security 
</p>
<p>building, using international influence to cut aid to Egypt and threatening national security 
</p>
<p>under the pretense of defending rights and liberties. 
</p>
<p>499. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned at the targeting of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and their families. In particular, he expresses serious concern at the beating and 
</p>
<p>subsequent death of Mrs. Mahrousa Badawy Ragab by members of the security forces, as

<p>504. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s response to one of three 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period. He regrets that at the time of the 
</p>
<p>finalisation of this report, the Government had not transmitted a reply to the other two 
</p>
<p>communications, nor to the three sent during the previous reporting period. He expresses 
</p>
<p>concern at the pattern of violations against human rights defenders in the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>especially in relation to the excessive use of force by the Israeli Defence Forces. It should 
</p>
<p>be noted that UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra&#8217;ad Al Hussein, has urged 
</p>
<p>the Israeli authorities to take urgent steps to halt continuing injuries and fatalities during 
</p>
<p>protests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and to investigations all such incidents.25 
</p>
<p>505. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets that the excessive use of force by Israeli 
</p>
<p>security forces during a peaceful demonstration led to the killing of a human rights 
</p>
<p>defender, and during clashes that erupted afterwards resulted in the killing of two more 
</p>
<p>protestors. He is distressed at receiving similar reports of the excessive use of force by 
</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Force soldiers and Border Police in the eviction and dismantlement of a 
</p>
<p>peaceful protest camp, as well as several instances of interference with the exercise of the 
</p>
<p>right to peaceful assembly by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>506. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern regarding the worrying pattern of 
</p>
<p>harassment of human rights defenders in the West Bank, as well as about allegations of 
</p>
<p>ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Issa Amro and the intimidation directed against 
</p>
<p>him and members of Youth against Settlement (YAS), previously mentioned in the 
</p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>508. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response to the 
</p>
<p>communication concerning the violent dispersal of peaceful demonstrations by the police in 
</p>
<p>Kuwait City from 2 to 7 July 2014, including the arbitrary detention of a few dozens of 
peaceful protesters and the infliction of serious injuries against at least five peaceful 
</p>
<p>protesters, including one journalist covering the protests. While noting general references 
</p>
<p>made in the Government&#8217;s reply to the guarantees provided by the Constitution of Kuwait 
</p>
<p>with regard to the right to peaceful assembly, the Special Rapporteur regrets that a more 
</p>
<p>substantial response was not provided despite the reassurances expressed in the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s letter dated 19 September 2014. The Special Rapporteur therefore urges the 
</p>
<p>Government to provide more specific information on the questions raised in the 
</p>
<p>communication JUA 31/07/2014, including on the legal grounds for the mass arrests and 
</p>
<p>detentions of the peaceful protesters as well as the results of any investigations, mentioned 
</p>
<p>in the reply dated 8 October 2014, into the use of excessive and disproportionate force 
</p>
<p>against protesters. Furtheremore, the Special Rapporteur hopes to receive clarifications 
</p>
<p>regarding reports that on 4 September 2014 Mr Abdulhakim Al Fadhli, a human rights 
</p>
<p>defender mentioned in the communication, was sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment by 
</p>
<p>the Kuwaiti Misdemeanour Court for allegedly insulting a police officer.  
</p>
<p>509. The Government&#8217;s cooperation in providing further information on the communication 
</p>
<p>is especially pertinent given a number of recommendations made to the Government at the 
</p>
<p>twenty-first session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review in January 
</p>
<p>2015 to guarantee, in law and practice, the exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly, association and expression in Kuwait.27  
</p>
<p>510. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the Government of Kuwait will respond 
</p>
<p>favourably to his request (2015) for a country visit, which will enable him to gain a better 
</p>
<p>understanding of the situation of human rights defenders in the country.

<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>512. The Special Rapporteur regrets that so far no reply has been received in response to 
</p>
<p>the communication sent during the reporting period, especially given the severity of the 
</p>
<p>case referred to therein of the killing of human rights defender Ms. Salwa Bugaighis and 
</p>
<p>the suspected abduction of her husband. He is concerned about reports of an increasing 
number of attacks targeting human rights defenders and political figures in the country. In 
</p>
<p>that context, he notes that in October 2014 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mr. 
</p>
<p>Zeid Ra&#8217;ad Al Hussein expressed concern at numerous reports of intimidation, harassment, 
</p>
<p>abductions and murder of members of civil society, causing human rights defenders to flee 
</p>
<p>the country, curtail their activism or go into hiding.28 The Special Rapporteur wishes to 
</p>
<p>highlight the 2015 report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation 
</p>
<p>of human rights in Libya,29 in which he refers to reports of civil society activists in 
</p>
<p>Benghazi and Tripoli being threatened, abducted, unlawfully killed or having their homes 
</p>
<p>looted or burned down. The report further points out instances of threats and intimidation 
</p>
<p>towards staff of the National Council of Civil Liberties and Human Rights, which had been 
</p>
<p>established in December 2011 and started functioning as a national human rights institution 
</p>
<p>in January 2013 (paras.79-81). 
</p>
<p>513. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the Security Council on 27 August 2014 adopted 
</p>
<p>resolution 2174 on the situation in Libya, decreeing that asset freeze and travel ban 
</p>
<p>measures will apply to listed individuals or entities that plan, commit, or direct acts that 
</p>
<p>violate international human rights and humanitarian law, or acts that constitute human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses. He urges the Government of Libya and all those with effective authority on 
</p>
<p>the ground to take urgent measures to protect human rights defenders and ensure a safer and 
</p>
<p>more enabling environment for them to conduct human rights work in the country.

</b></p>
<p>539. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of the finalisation of this report, the 
</p>
<p>Government had not responded to four of his six communications sent during the present 
</p>
<p>reporting period. The allegations included in these communications are very serious, as 
</p>
<p>they refer to undue restrictions on a number of basic rights and freedoms that are 
</p>
<p>fundamental to the activities of human rights defenders. He hopes that a detailed response 
</p>
<p>to each communication will be provided at the earliest convenience of the Government.  
</p>
<p>540. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern in relation to reports of the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention and conviction of human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, especially 
</p>
<p>when the arrest and detention are due to their legitimate and peaceful human rights work. 
</p>
<p>On a number of occasions, no reasons were given for the arrests of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is also concerned regarding information of imposed travel bans, 
</p>
<p>judicial harassment and unfair trials. 
</p>
<p>541.  The Special Rapporteur notes the worrying pattern of arrests and lengthy detention 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders on charges relating to involvement with &#8220;illegal organisations&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>among other charges that relate to criticising, disrespecting or planning to overthrow the 
</p>
<p>King. This appears to particularly target those who are involved in human rights 
</p>
<p>organisations that monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country, a number 
</p>
<p>of which have been forced to close. Members of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>Association have faced particular persecution in this regard. The Special Rapporteur deeply 
</p>
<p>regrets instances of reprisals against human rights defenders who cooperated with United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights mechanisms, and he wishes to reiterate the right of everyone to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;unhindered access to and communication with international bodies&#8221;.30   
</p>
<p>542.  The Special Rapporteur expresses particular concern at the restrictions on freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression on those who monitor and document human rights abuses in the country, 
</p>
<p>which has been evidenced through the case of blogger Mr. Raef Badawi, who faces an 
</p>
<p>extremely harsh sentence of ten-year, 1000 lashes, a fine, travel ban and a ban on using 
</p>
<p>media outlets on charges of blasphemy for documenting abuses by the national religious 
</p>
<p>and morality police. Grave concern is expressed for the physical and psychological 
</p>
<p>wellbeing of Mr. Badawi who is to receive 50 lashes at a time with a break of no less than a 
</p>
<p>week between lashings.  
</p>
<p>543.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur wishes to express his concern at the conditions 
</p>
<p>in detention of a number of human rights defenders, including reports of ill treatment, 
</p>
<p>torture, solitary confinement, incommunicado detention, overcrowding and the denial of 
</p>
<p>access to essential medical care.

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>549. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response to one of the 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the present reporting period and for the response to a 
</p>
<p>communication sent during the previous reporting period. He encourages the Government 
</p>
<p>to provide responses to remaining communications in due course. 
</p>
<p>550. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological 
</p>
<p>integrity of human rights defenders in the Syrian Arab Republic amid reports of threats, 
</p>
<p>abductions, arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention and attempted killings, as well as the 
</p>
<p>continued targeting of certain human rights defenders. He acknowledges the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>response to the communication sent on 17 December 2013 regarding the abduction of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders Ms. Razan Zaitouneh, Ms. Samira Khalil, Mr. Wa&#8217;el Hamada and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Nazem Hamadi, whose whereabouts and fate are still unknown. He urges the 
</p>
<p>Government to thoroughly investigate their enforced disappearance and to establish and 
</p>
<p>provide information on their whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>551. While the Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s response on 31 March 2014 
</p>
<p>to a communication sent during the previous reporting period regarding the prolonged 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention, torture and ill treatment of human rights defenders Messrs. 
</p>
<p>Mazen Darwish, Hussayn Gharir and Hani Zitani, he reiterates his concern about these 
</p>
<p>individuals who have been detained for three years due to their legitimate human rights 
</p>
<p>activities and whose trial has been repeatedly postponed, most recently in January 2015. 
</p>
<p>552. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned by acts of reprisals against human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders for their cooperation with UN human rights mechanisms, as was the case 
</p>
<p>of Mr. Jdea Abdullah Nawfal and Mr. Omar Al-Shaar who were detained following their 
</p>
<p>participation at a human rights monitoring and documentation workshop organised by the 
</p>
<p>Regional Office for the Middle East of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the release on bail of Mr. Nawfal 
</p>
<p>and Mr. Al-Shaar on 17 December 2014, he urges the Government to drop the charges 
</p>
<p>against the human rights defenders. Furthermore, he urges the Government to ensure that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>76</b>  
</p>
<p>human rights defenders can carry out their legitimate activities in a safe and an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment; this includes through open and unhindered access to international human 
</p>
<p>rights bodies such as the United Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights, without fear of harassment, stigmatisation or criminalisation of any kind.

</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>554. The Special Rapporteur notes the acknowledgement of the Government of the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates of the communication issued within the present reporting period and 
</p>
<p>awaits a detailed response from the Government to the allegations and questions raised 
</p>
<p>therein. 
</p>
<p>555. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern at the arbitrary arrest, detention, 
</p>
<p>subsequent sentencing of Mr. Osama Al-Najjar, especially due to reports of torture and ill 
</p>
<p>treatment despite his deteriorating health and the advice from the doctor of the detention 
</p>
<p>center that he should be transferred to hospital due to the injuries sustained. He is distressed 
</p>
<p>that his arrest and detention may be related to his legitimate activities in advocating for 
</p>
<p>justice and human rights in the country and the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression, as well as his cooperation with the United Nations and its human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
</p>
<p>lawyers. In that context, he calls on the Government to ensure that human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>can carry out their legitimate activities in a safe and an enabling environment; this includes 
</p>
<p>through open and unhindered access to international human rights bodies such as the United

<p>Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in the field of human rights, without fear of 
</p>
<p>harassment, stigmatisation or criminalisation of any kind.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>557. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned by the alleged arbitrary dismissal of Mr. 
</p>
<p>Moncef Kateb, President of the World Intellectual Propery Organization (WIPO) staff 
</p>
<p>council on 19 September 2014. He thanks the WIPO for the response received to this 
</p>
<p>communication. However, he wishes to ensure the WIPO that the office of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs acts impartially based on the relevant facts and he reiterates concern that the 
decision to dismiss him may have been taken in retaliation of his activities as a staff 
</p>
<p>representative and as a result of his legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of

</b></p>
<p><b>  Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communications of the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders: frequently asked questions 
</b></p>
<p>558. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
</p>
<p>established by the Human Rights Council, includes a broad range of responsibilities.31 As 
</p>
<p>part of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur undertakes country visits and presents annual 
</p>
<p>reports to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on particular topics or 
</p>
<p>situations related to human rights defenders. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>mandated to seek, receive, examine and respond to information on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders, which includes taking up, with the State and non-State actors concerned, 
</p>
<p>individual cases of human rights violations committed against defenders. He can therefore 
</p>
<p>intervene directly with Governments on allegations of violations of human rights that come 
</p>
<p>within his mandate by means of communications. 
</p>
<p><b>Who is a defender? 
</b></p>
<p>559. &#8220;Human rights defender&#8221; is a term used to describe people who, individually or with 
</p>
<p>others, act to promote or protect human rights. Human rights defenders are identified above 
</p>
<p>all by what they do and it is through a description of their actions and of some of the 
</p>
<p>contexts in which they work that the term can best be explained. For more information, 
</p>
<p>please see: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/Defender.aspx. 
</p>
<p><b>Who can submit information? 
</b></p>
<p>560. Information on such cases is received through a variety of sources including 
</p>
<p>individual defenders, NGOs, legal representatives and family members as well as through 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p><b>What happens when the information reaches the Special Rapporteur? 
</b></p>
<p>561. As information arrives, the Special Rapporteur first seeks to determine if it falls 
</p>
<p>within the mandate.  
</p>
<p>562. Secondly, every effort is made to determine the probable validity of the allegations 
</p>
<p>of human rights violation and the reliability of the source of the information. Often, 
</p>
<p>important details may be missing from the information initially received and the OHCHR 
</p>
<p>staff supporting the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate contact sources to collect additional 
</p>
<p>information. 
</p>
<p>563. Thirdly, the Special Rapporteur reaches out to the Government of the State where 
</p>
<p>the alleged violation is thought to have occurred. This is usually done through 
</p>
<p>communications, including &#8216;Urgent appeal&#8217; or &#8216;Allegation&#8217; letters, addressed to the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>diplomatic mission with the United Nations in Geneva for transmission to capitals. The 
</p>
<p>letters provide details of the victim, the human rights concerns and the alleged events. 
</p>
<p>What is the objective of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s intervention?<b> 
</b></p>
<p>564. The primary objective of these letters is to protect human rights defenders by 
</p>
<p>ensuring that State authorities are informed of allegations as early as possible and that they 
</p>
<p>have an opportunity to investigate them and to end or prevent any human rights violation. 
</p>
<p>With both Urgent appeal and Allegation letters, the Special Rapporteur asks the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 See Human Rights Council resolutions 25/18 and 16/5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>78</b>  
</p>
<p>Government to take all appropriate action to investigate and address the alleged events and 
</p>
<p>to communicate the results of its investigation and actions to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>Allegation letters focus primarily on asking the State authorities to proceed with an 
</p>
<p>investigation of the events and to conduct criminal prosecutions of those responsible. 
</p>
<p><b>What happens next? 
</b></p>
<p>565. Ideally, the Government within the period prescribed to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>letter and investigate the alleged facts, taking action to prevent or end any violation. 
</p>
<p>Governments are urged, under the Human Rights Council resolution renewing the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, to respond to the letters sent. In many instances, responses are not 
</p>
<p>received, are received several months later or do not address the substantive concerns raised 
</p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>566. Where new allegations are received, a follow-up communication may be sent to the 
</p>
<p>State concerned. However, resource limitations make it impossible for the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to follow-up on every case. 
</p>
<p>567. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur to Governments are published 
</p>
<p>in a report presented to the Human Rights Council. Since September 2011 onwards, this 
</p>
<p>report has been issued three times per year and presented at the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>sessions. These are available at: 
</p>
<p>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/CommunicationsreportsSP.aspx. 
</p>
<p><b>  Confidentiality 
</b></p>
<p>568. The identity of persons and organisations that send information to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is always kept confidential and is never referred to in the letters to Governments 
</p>
<p>or in public reports. Before a communication is sent, the Special Rapporteur seeks either 
</p>
<p>direct consent from the human rights defender or, if not possible, from the family or lawyer 
</p>
<p>of the human rights defender. If requested on behalf of the human rights defender, 
</p>
<p>protection measures can be included in the communication by which their identity can be 
</p>
<p>kept confidential.  
</p>
<p><b>How to submit allegations
