Senior Notes due 2020, referred to in this prospectus as the &#147;exchange 
notes,&#148; for any
and all of our outstanding unregistered 8.000% Senior Notes due 2020 issued on 
May&nbsp;18, 2015, referred to in this prospectus as the &#147;original 
notes.&#148; The exchange notes and the original notes are sometimes referred to
in this
prospectus together as the &#147;notes.&#148; The terms of the exchange notes 
are identical in all material respects to those of the original notes, except 
that the exchange notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, 
as amended, or
the Securities Act, and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and 
additional interest provisions related to the original notes do not apply to the
exchange notes. The original notes may only be tendered in an amount equal to 
$2,000 in
principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. This 
exchange offer is subject to certain customary conditions and will expire at 
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2015, unless we extend it (as such 
date and time may be extended, the &#147;Expiration Date&#148;). The exchange 
notes will not
trade on any established exchange. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each 
broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account pursuant to the 
exchange offer
must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale
of such exchange notes. The letter of transmittal states that by so 
acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed
to admit that it is
an &#147;underwriter&#148; within the meaning of the Securities Act. This 
prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used 
by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of exchange notes received in 
exchange for
original notes where such original notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as 
a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. We have agreed
that, for a period ending on the earlier of (a)&nbsp;180 days after the date on 
which
the registration statement containing this prospectus is declared effective by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and (b)&nbsp;the date on which a
broker-dealer is no longer required to deliver a prospectus in connection with
market-making or other trading activities, we will make this prospectus 
available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See 
&#147;Plan of Distribution.&#148; </P>

REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">We are including the following discussion to inform
our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and
uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the 
&#147;safe harbor&#148; protection for forward-looking statements afforded by 
applicable federal securities laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">All statements other than statements of historical 
facts included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus regarding our 
financial
position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future
operations, industry conditions, and indebtedness covenant compliance are 
forward-looking statements. When used in this prospectus, forward-looking 
statements are generally
accompanied by terms or phrases such as &#147;estimate,&#148; 
&#147;project,&#148; &#147;predict,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; 
&#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; 
&#147;plan,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;seek,&#148;
&#147;goal,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;may&#148; or other
words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or 
outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential 
future
sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or operating results also 
constitute such forward-looking statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">Forward-looking
statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many
of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, include the 
following:
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices; the pace of drilling and 
completions activity on our properties; our ability to acquire additional 
development opportunities; changes in our reserves estimates or the value 
thereof; general economic or
industry conditions; nationally or the regions in which our company conducts 
business; changes in the interest rate environment; legislation or regulatory 
requirements; conditions of the securities markets; our ability to raise or 
access capital;
changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; financial or political
instability; acts of war or terrorism; and other economic, competitive, 
governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our operations, 
products and prices.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have based any forward-looking 
statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. 
While our management
considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are 
inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory 
and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to
predict and many
of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, results actually achieved may 
differ materially from expected results in these statements. Forward-looking 
statements speak only as of the date they are made. You should consider 
carefully the statements
under the heading &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in this prospectus and in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and the other 
documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, which describe factors
that could
cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking 
statements. We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to 
update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances 
occurring after the
date of such statements other than as may be required by applicable law or 
regulation. </P>

font-family:Times New Roman">We are an independent energy company engaged in the
acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas 
properties,
primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks formations within the Williston Basin in
North Dakota and Montana. We believe the location, size and concentration of our
acreage position in one of North America&#146;s leading unconventional oil-
resource
plays provide us with drilling and development opportunities that result in 
significant long-term value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary focus 
is oil
exploration and production through non-operated working interests in wells 
drilled and completed in spacing units that include our acreage. As a non-
operator, we are able to diversify our investment exposure by participating in a
large number of
gross wells, as well as entering into more project areas by partnering with 
numerous experienced operating partners. In addition, because we can elect to 
participate on a well-by-well basis, we believe we have increased flexibility in
the timing and
amount of our capital expenditures because we are not burdened with various 
contractual development agreements or a large operating support staff. Further, 
we are able to avoid exploratory costs incurred by many oil and gas producers.

Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, which is 
incorporated by reference
into this prospectus, before tendering your original notes in the exchange

not accept will, following the exchange offer, continue to be restricted 
securities, and
you may not offer to sell them except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a 
transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities 
law. We will issue exchange notes in exchange for the original notes pursuant to
the exchange
offer only following the satisfaction of the procedures and conditions set forth
in &#147;The Exchange Offer&#151;Procedures for Tendering.&#148; These 
procedures and conditions include timely receipt by the exchange agent of such 
original notes (or
a confirmation of book-entry transfer) and of a properly completed and duly 
executed letter of transmittal (or an agent&#146;s message from The Depository 
Trust Company, or &#147;DTC&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

notes will elect to exchange their original notes, we expect that the liquidity 
of the
market for any original notes remaining after the completion of the exchange 
offer will be substantially limited. Any original notes tendered and exchanged 
in the exchange offer will reduce the aggregate principal amount of the original
notes
outstanding. Following the exchange offer, if you do not tender original notes 
you generally will not have any further registration rights, and your original 
notes will continue to be subject to certain transfer restrictions. Accordingly,
the
liquidity of the market for the original notes could be adversely affected. </P>

Date. You
should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the necessary 
documents. Neither the exchange agent nor us are under any duty to give 
notification of defects or irregularities with respect to the tenders of 
original notes for exchange. If
you beneficially own original notes that are registered in the name of a broker,
dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and you wish to tender 
in the exchange offer, you should promptly contact the person in whose name your
original
notes are registered and instruct that person to tender your original notes on

Court of Delaware has held in published opinions that a provision in an 
indenture requiring a majority of the directors of the issuer be 
&#147;continuing directors&#148; could breach the fiduciary duties of the 
directors and be unenforceable if
improperly used to prevent shareholders from effecting a change of control of

directors&#148; defined as either (i)&nbsp;a director on the date of the
indenture or (ii)&nbsp;a director whose nomination for election, or whose 
election, to the board of directors was approved by a majority of the continuing
directors. Under the
court&#146;s decision, a decision by a board of directors not to approve 
dissident shareholder nominees as continuing directors and to allow a change of 
control to occur would be subject to enhanced fiduciary duties typically applied
in corporate
change of control disputes. If the directors did not properly discharge those 
fiduciary duties, the change of control put right could be unenforceable by the 
holders of the notes. As a result, the ability of the holders of notes to 
enforce the
continuing director provision in situations in which the provision acted to 
impede a change of control would be subject to the enhanced judicial scrutiny of
the actions by our directors not to approve the director nominees whose election
caused the
provision to be invoked. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">You can find the definitions of certain terms used 
in this description under the subheading &#147;&#151;Certain Definitions.&#148; 
In this
description, the term &#147;company,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; or 
&#147;we&#148; refers only to Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. The term &#147;original
notes&#148; refers to the company&#146;s notes issued pursuant to a private 
placement
completed on May&nbsp;18, 2015, the term &#147;exchange notes&#148; refers to 
the company&#146;s notes being offered hereby in exchange for a like principal 
amount of original notes, and the term &#147;notes&#148; refers to the original 
notes and
exchange notes, collectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;
text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We issued the 
original notes and will issue the exchange notes under an indenture between us 
and Wilmington
Trust, National Association, as trustee. The terms of the notes include those 
stated in the indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the &#147;Trust Indenture Act&#148;). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The following description is a summary of the 
material provisions of the indenture and does not restate the indenture in its 
entirety. We urge
you to read the indenture because it, and not this description, defines your 
rights as Holders of the notes. Certain defined terms used in this description 
but not defined below under &#147;&#151;Certain Definitions&#148; have the 
meanings assigned
to them in the indenture. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The registered 
Holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only 
registered Holders
will have rights under the indenture. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the 
exchange offer is consummated, Holders of original notes who do not exchange 
their notes for
exchange notes will vote together with the Holders of the exchange notes for all
relevant purposes under the indenture. In that regard, the indenture requires 
that certain actions by the Holders under the indenture must be taken, and 
certain rights
must be exercised, by specified minimum percentages of the aggregate principal 
amount of all notes issued under the indenture. In determining whether Holders 
of the requisite percentage in principal amount have given any notice, consent 
or waiver or
taken any other action permitted under the indenture, any original notes that 
remain outstanding after the exchange offer will be aggregated with the exchange
notes, and the Holder of any original notes and the exchange notes will vote 
together as a
single series for all such purposes. Accordingly, all references in this 
&#147;Description of the Exchange Notes&#148; to specified percentages in 
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes mean, at any time after the 
exchange offer for the
original notes is consummated, such percentage in aggregate principal amount of 
such notes and the exchange notes then outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

and there was a $338 million outstanding balance at a weighted average interest 
rate of 2.17% and $212 million of borrowing capacity available thereunder. We 
amended our

at any time is dependent on the amount of borrowings relative to the borrowing 
base at such
time. We may elect, from time to time, to convert all or any part of our LIBOR 
loans to base rate loans or to convert all or any of our base rate loans to 
LIBOR loans. A commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance based on an annual 
rate of either
0.375% or 0.50%. At March&nbsp;31, 2015, the commitment fee was 0.5% and the

will be issued with original issue discount (&#147;OID&#148;) for U.S. federal

price by more than a statutory <I>de minimis </I>amount as defined below. The 
stated
redemption price at maturity of an exchange note is the total amount of all 
payments to be made under the exchange note other than payments of qualified 
stated interest. Qualified stated interest generally is stated interest that is 
unconditionally
payable at least annually either at a single fixed rate or at certain variable 
rates that properly take into account the length of intervals between payments. 
The stated interest on the exchange notes will qualify as qualified stated

of OID for each day on which the U.S. holder held the exchange note during the 
taxable year, regardless of such U.S. holder&#146;s regular method of accounting
for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. To determine the daily portions of OID, the amount 
of OID allocable to an accrual period is determined, and a ratable portion of 
such OID is allocated to each day in the accrual period. The amount of OID 
allocable to an
accrual period will equal the product of the exchange note&#146;s adjusted issue
price at the beginning of the accrual period and the exchange note&#146;s yield

exchange note&#146;s adjusted issue price at any time generally will be its 
original issue price, increased by the
amount of OID on such exchange note accrued for each prior accrual period. An 
exchange note&#146;s yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used in 
computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made on
the
exchange note, produces an amount equal to the exchange note&#146;s original 
issue price. An accrual period may be of any length and the length of the 
accrual periods may vary over the life of the exchange note, provided that no 
accrual period may
be longer than one year. Each scheduled payment of interest or principal on the 
exchange note must occur on either the first day or last day of an accrual

disposition, not including any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid 
interest which will be taxable as interest income as described above to the 
extent not previously included in income, and the U.S. holder&#146;s adjusted 
tax basis in the
exchange note. In general, the U.S. holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in an 
exchange note will be equal to the purchase price of the note paid by the U.S. 
holder, increased by any accrued OID that the U.S. holder previously included in
income with
respect to the exchange note. Gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or 
retirement of an exchange note generally will be capital gain or loss and will 
be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange or retirement
the exchange
note has been held for more than one year. For individuals, long-term capital 
gains generally are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. The deductibility

believe that a holder of original notes who exchanges original notes for 
exchange notes in the exchange offer generally may offer such exchange notes for
resale, sell the
exchange notes and otherwise transfer the exchange notes without further 
registration under the Securities Act and without delivery of a prospectus that 
satisfies the requirements of Section&nbsp;10 of the Securities Act. This does 
not apply,
however, to a holder who is our &#147;affiliate&#148; within the meaning of Rule

the writing
of options on the exchange notes or a combination of such methods of resale, at 
market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such 
prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made 
directly to
purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in

purchasers of any such exchange notes. Any broker-dealer that resells exchange 
notes that were

against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, 
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such 
liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or 
paid by a director, officer

suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person

Statement on Form S-4 of the Company (such Registration Statement, as it may be 
amended, the
&#147;Registration Statement&#148;) filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), with respect to up to $200,000,000 
aggregate principal
amount of the Company&#146;s 8.000% Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#147;Exchange 
Notes&#148;) to be offered in exchange for the Company&#146;s outstanding 8.000%
Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#147;Original Notes&#148;), originally issued on

in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and duly issued and 
delivered by the
Company in exchange for an equal principal amount of Original Notes, the 
Exchange Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the 
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject 
to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, 
receivership or other laws affecting creditors&#146; rights generally from time 
to time in effect and subject to general equity principles including, without 
limitation,
concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the 
possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other 
equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a 
proceeding in equity or
at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any 
governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments 
outside of the United States. As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, 
in rendering the
foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws 
relating to fraudulent transfers. The opinions expressed also do not address

Unless you intend to tender your Original Notes through the ATOP procedures of 
DTC, you should complete, sign and submit this Letter of Transmittal to the

send to the
Exchange Agent a &#147;book-entry confirmation,&#148; which shall include an

a DTC participant tendering Original Notes that the participant has received and
agrees to be bound by the terms of this Letter of Transmittal as an undersigned 
hereof
and that Northern Oil may enforce such agreement against the participant.

(3)&nbsp;such
holders are not engaged in, and do not intend to engage in, a distribution of 
such Exchange Notes and have no arrangement or understanding with any person to 
participate in the distribution of such Exchange Notes. However, the staff of 
the SEC has
not considered this Exchange Offer in the context of a no-action letter, and 
there can be no assurance that the staff of the SEC would make a similar 
determination with respect to the Exchange Offer as in other circumstances. If a

the ordinary course of such holder&#146;s business or is engaged in or intends 
to engage in a distribution of the Exchange Notes or has any arrangement or 
understanding
with respect to the distribution of the Exchange Notes to be acquired pursuant 
to the Exchange Offer, such holder could not rely on the applicable 
interpretations of the staff of the SEC and must comply with the registration 
and prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any secondary resale 
transaction. </P>

(along with any other required account information) needed to permit such 
delivery must be provided in the table on page 4 entitled &#147;Method of 
Delivery.&#148;
Failure to do so will render a tender of the Original Notes defective, and 
Northern Oil will have the right, which it may waive, to reject such delivery.

font-family:Times New Roman"><B>12. Tax Identification Number.&nbsp;</B>An 
exchange of Original Notes for Exchange Notes
pursuant to the Exchange Offer will not be treated as a taxable exchange or 
other taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, no 
backup withholding or information reporting is required in connection with such 
an exchange.
However, under U.S. federal income tax laws, payments made with respect to the 
Exchange Offer or the Exchange Notes may be subject to backup withholding 
(currently at a rate of 28%). Generally, such payments may be subject to backup 
withholding
unless the holder (i)&nbsp;is exempt from backup withholding or 
(ii)&nbsp;furnishes the payer with its correct taxpayer identification number 
(&#147;TIN&#148;) and provides certain certifications. Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Rather,
the amount of backup withholding is treated as an advance payment of a tax 
liability, and a holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax liability will be reduced
by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of 
taxes, a refund
may be obtained by the holder from the Internal Revenue Service (the 
&#147;IRS&#148;), provided that the required information is timely furnished to 
the IRS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. Holder (defined
below) should notify the Exchange Agent of its correct TIN by completing the 
Substitute
Form W-9 included herein and certifying on Substitute Form W-9 that the TIN 
provided is correct (or that the holder is awaiting a TIN). In addition, a U.S. 
Holder is required to certify on Substitute Form W-9 that the holder is not 
subject to backup
withholding because (i)&nbsp;the holder is exempt from backup withholding, 
(ii)&nbsp;the holder has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to 
backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends,
or (iii)&nbsp;the
IRS has notified the holder that the holder is no longer subject to backup 
withholding. If the U.S. Holder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for 
one or intends to apply for one in the near future, such U.S. Holder should 
write &#147;Applied
For&#148; in the space provided for the TIN in Part I of Form W-9, and sign and 
date Form W-9. If &#147;Applied For&#148; is written in Part I and the Exchange 
Agent is not provided with a TIN by the time of payment, the Exchange Agent will
withhold
28% from any payments made pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Consult the enclosed 
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute 
Form W-9 for guidelines on completing the Substitute Form W-9. If the Exchange 
Agent is
provided with an incorrect TIN or the holder makes false statements resulting in
no backup withholding, the holder may be subject to penalties imposed by the 
IRS. As used herein, a &#147;U.S. Holder&#148; means a beneficial owner of 
Original Notes
or Exchange Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a)&nbsp;a 
citizen or individual resident of the United States as determined for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes, (b)&nbsp;a corporation, or other entity classified 
as a corporation
for such purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United 
States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (c)&nbsp;an estate, the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of the 
source of the
income, or (d)&nbsp;a trust if (i)&nbsp;a court within the United States can 
exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more 
&#147;United States persons,&#148; as defined in the Code, have the authority to
control all of the
substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii)&nbsp;the trust has validly elected 
to be treated as a &#147;United States person&#148; under applicable 
regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">To prevent backup withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder 
(as defined below) should submit the following applicable IRS Form W-8 to the 
Exchange Agent,
certifying under penalties of perjury to the holder&#146;s foreign status: 
(i)&nbsp;if an individual,&nbsp;submit a properly completed IRS Form W-8 BEN; 
(ii)&nbsp;if an entity, submit a properly completed IRS Form W-8 BEN-E; 
(iii)&nbsp;if a
pass-through entity, intermediary, foreign branch of a U.S. person, or a U.S. 
Branch acting as an intermediary to income not effectively connected with the 
United States, submit a properly completed IRS Form W-8 IMY; or (iv)&nbsp;if the
Non-U.S.
Holder has effectively connected income with the United States, submit a 
properly completed IRS Form W-8 ECI. If applicable, establish an exemption per
the instructions on the applicable IRS Form W-8. IRS Forms W-8 may be obtained 
on the web
at&nbsp;<U>www.irs.gov</U>. As used herein, a &#147;Non-U.S. Holder&#148; means 
a beneficial owner of Original Notes or Exchange Notes that is not a U.S. 
Holder. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Certain holders (including, among others, 
corporations and certain non-U.S. persons) may be exempt from these backup 
withholding requirements.
See the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number 
on Substitute Form W-9 for further information regarding exempt holders. Exempt 
holders should furnish their TIN, check the box in Part 2 of the Substitute Form
W-9, and
sign, date and return the Substitute Form W-9 to the Exchange Agent. </P>
