<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>Sierra Leone has made progress in building its capacity for the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. The enactment of some crucial laws in the fields of women 
and children rights has improved the legal framework to protect the rights of vulnerable 
groups. However, customs and traditions perpetuate harmful practices such as female 
genital mutilation and discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>Socio-economic conditions remain extremely challenging. Financial and capacity 
constraints have limited the ability of the national human rights institutions to comply 
with their tasks, negatively impacting the administration of justice, and creating room for 
impunity. The constitutional review process has been delayed and crucial 
recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including the 
abolition of the death penalty and amendment of discriminatory legal provisions, have 
not been implemented. The Reparations Programme has been affected due to gaps in the 
financial requirements and lack of political will. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR has been involved in Sierra Leone since 1998, as part of successive UN 
missions, including the current United Nations Integrated Peace-building Office in Sierra 
Leone (UNIPSIL). The Human Rights Section of UNIPSIL has engaged with the 
Government in promoting legislation to protect human rights and has supported the 
Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone and civil society in their efforts to advance 
human rights in the country. The Human Rights Section has engaged in training and 
advocacy activities with a wide range of stakeholders and has continuously monitored 
the human rights situation and provided advice and technical services to authorities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, in which 
the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions 
adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and 
studies. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
had initially interpreted decision 2/102 as extending previous reports of the Commission on 
Human Rights and providing for an annual reporting cycle. Until recently, this 
interpretation had been deemed to have received the tacit approval of member States. 
However, an objection was placed on the record in 2010 in the context of another report 
which also referred to decision 2/102 as the basis for its annual reporting. OHCHR has thus 
reviewed the said decision, and concluded that the Human Rights Council sought to fill a 
technical gap by ensuring that reports which were deemed to have been submitted to the 
sixty-second session of the Human Rights Commission would be extended by one year and 
transferred to the subsequent substantive session of the Human Rights Council. With this 
transition period over and an objection now on record with regard to the initial 
interpretation of annual reporting cycles, if the Human Rights Council wishes such 
reporting to be continued, a new Human Rights Council resolution or decision on the matter 
should be tabled. 
</p>
<p>2. In 2010, the Human Rights Section of the United Nations Integrated Peace-building 
Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) continued its engagement in implementing the human 
rights mandate of Security Council resolution 1829 (2008) and the subsequent extension 
under resolutions 1886 (2009) and 1941 (2010) which extended UNIPSIL's mandate until 
15 September 2011. The mandate emphasizes UNIPSIL&#8217;s role in providing assistance to the 
Government by promoting the rule of law and human rights, including more specifically, 
support to the National Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>3. The human rights situation in Sierra Leone has improved since the original 
resolutions were adopted by the Commission on Human Rights. National elections in 2002 
and 2007, and local Government elections in 2004 were peaceful and democratic, as was 
the transfer of power from one elected Government to another in September 2007. The 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) issued it final report in 2004, and some of its 
recommendations are being implemented. There has been a comprehensive reform of 
national security institutions, such as the Sierra Leone Police, the Armed Forces and the 
Office of National Security, and the creation of democratic institutions such as the National 
Electoral Commission, the Political Parties Registration Commission, the Human Rights 
Commission Sierra Leone (HRCSL) and the Anti Corruption Commission. While Sierra 
Leone continues to register a consistent trend towards respect for civil and political rights,  
many challenges still remain, and the Human Rights Section will continue to provide 
support to state institutions and all relevant stakeholders to address these challenges.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights situation in Sierra Leone 
</b></p>
<p>4. There has been progress in the advancement of human rights legislation on disability 
and freedom of information. At the time of writing this report, a Disability Bill and a 
Freedom of Information Bill were at advanced stages for enactment by Parliament. There 
have also been positive developments in relation to policy formulation as the Ministry of 
Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs developed a National Gender Strategic Plan 
(NGSP) in June 2010, and the President has launched a National Action Plan based on 
United Nations Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). The NGSP aims </p>


<p>at empowering women in all fields, including educational, economic, and political sectors, 
while the National Action Plan focuses on the participation, protection and promotion of 
women in all areas pertaining to peace and security. Discussions are already underway 
between HRCSL, civil society and the Ministry of Justice to develop a national human 
rights plan of action. 
</p>
<p>5. However, the report submitted by the Constitutional Reform Commission in 2008 
has not received any attention by the Government, and no progress has been made with the 
review of the Constitution, one of the key recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Equality and non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>6. Some provisions of the Constitution affecting women, including Section 27(4)(d) 
and (e), have encouraged discriminatory practices with respect to adoption, marriage, 
divorce, burial, devolution of property on death, and other personal law issues, thus limiting 
the general principle of non-discrimination, and compromising the implementation of the 
three &#8220;gender&#8221; laws enacted in 2007, which have attempted to promote equal rights in areas 
of property, adoption, marriage and divorce.  
</p>
<p>7. Similarly, members of the Lebanese and other Caucasian communities born in Sierra 
Leone continue to raise serious concerns about the denial of Sierra Leonean citizenship to 
them as Section 2(b) of the Sierra Leone Citizenship Act (1973) states that only persons 
whose father is &#8220;of Negro African descent&#8221; can qualify for Sierra Leone citizenship by birth 
or naturalization. Sierra Leone has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms 
of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>8. Though Sierra Leone has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, disabled persons have also been the target of inequality and discrimination. 
This is further compounded by social stereotyping, as they are mostly regarded as beggars 
and people deserving favours, and not as holders of the right to equal access to social 
services. In an effort to address this situation, a Disability Bill, currently in the final stages 
of enactment by parliament, provides for fundamental improvements in relation to the 
welfare of disabled persons, including free access to education, health care and 
criminalization of discriminatory practices against disabled persons.  
</p>
<p>9. Women constitute 51 per cent of the population, but are underrepresented in the 
Government (two Cabinet Ministers and four deputies). Out of a total of 124 members, only 
17 women sit in Parliament, which is below the 30 per cent quota recommended by the 
TRC. Traditional practices further compound this situation by forbidding women from 
holding traditional Paramount Chieftaincy positions in the entire Northern Province and in 
the Kono district in the east. However, in December 2010, a female candidate participated 
for the first time in the election to a Paramount Chieftaincy after the High Court ruled that 
her candidature should be admitted. On another positive note, the by-election for the 
District Council Chair in Kono was won by a female contestant, who became the first and 
only female District Council Chairperson in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to life and physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p>10. Sierra Leone has maintained a de facto moratorium on the death penalty for the last 
10 years. However, the moratorium has only put a stay on executions and not disallowed 
the pronouncement of death sentences, despite the TRC&#8217;s recommendation to expunge the </p>


<p>death penalty from the statute books. A total of 16 prisoners, including 4 women, are 
currently sentenced to death.  
</p>
<p>11. Ritual murder continues to be a major concern to the enjoyment of the right to life in 
Sierra Leone, and the lack of systematic investigation and prosecution of such cases is an 
issue. In many of these cases, perpetrators enjoy impunity. The culture of silence and 
secrecy among residents of the communities in which such crimes occur is also an obstacle 
to effective investigation.  
</p>
<p>12. There have also been incidents of assault by security authorities during the reporting 
period. In February 2010, it was alleged that security forces assaulted employees of Bo-
Kenema Power Station. Police sources confirmed the assault and stated that some youths of 
the ruling APC Party in the area were involved in the incident. The Human Rights 
Commission recommended that the Government conduct a thorough investigation, but none 
was ever carried out. In March 2010, residents of the adjoining settlement at Benguema 
Training Center complained that a group of soldiers had assaulted them and that their 
houses had been burned and demolished.   
</p>
<p>13. Metropolitan police also came under criticism over the manner in which they 
conducted tax collection exercises in Freetown, which included harassing people who could 
not produce receipts of payment of local taxes, and indiscriminately stopping taxis and 
other vehicles to check whether they had paid the taxes.  
</p>
<p>14. The Registration of Customary Marriages and Divorce Act (2007) sets the legal age 
for marriage at 18 and requires the consent of both parties. It empowers both spouses to 
acquire property, and states that gifts, payments, or dowries are non-refundable. 
Furthermore,, the Devolution of Estates Act (2007) requires property to be equally 
distributed between a deceased&#8217;s spouse and children, and criminalizes expulsion of 
widows from their homes after the death of their husbands. However, marriage is an area 
where gender discrimination is still widespread, especially in rural areas. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Violence against women and harmful traditional practices 
</b></p>
<p>15. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a very sensitive cultural issue in Sierra Leone as 
it is considered part of the initiation of the &#8220;rite of passage&#8221; from childhood to adulthood. 
The practice is central to the processes involved in becoming a member of many secret 
societies and constitutes a major source of livelihood for the initiators. Campaigns to 
discourage the practice have not always been well received by law enforcement officials 
and politicians alike. There is no law prohibiting FGM in Sierra Leone, although the Child 
Act (2007) prohibits cruel practices on children.   
</p>
<p>16. The national consultative dialogues held by the local authorities with 266 <i>sowies</i> 
(circumcisers) in November and December 2010 has led to a positive change in the 
attitudes of the <i>sowies</i> in some districts. In fact, the <i>sowies</i> in one district contacted the 
human rights actors to ask them to go and certify that all initiates were above 18 years. 
Nonetheless. the practice continues with widespread and systematic conscription of young 
girls, and there have been reports of girls being forcefully subjected to FGM, which has had 
various consequences, including fatalities.  
</p>
<p>17. Although the Child Rights Act (2007) prohibits early marriage, cases of forced and 
early marriages have been registered. In June 2010, a 14 year-old girl was forced by her 
parents to marry a diamond dealer in Zimmi Makpele Chiefdom, Pujehun district. 
Similarly, a 15 year-old girl in Joru, Kenema district was forced into marrying a 45 year-old 
man, and apparently dropped out of school after her parents received a bride price on her 
behalf. Both marriages were annulled following intervention by UNIPSIL Human Rights 
Section and the Human Rights Commission.  </p>


<p>18. Harmful traditional practices have continued to perpetuate inequality of and 
discrimination towards women. The Human Rights Section of UNIPSIL together with the 
national human rights commission have intervened with the local authorities in cases 
brought to its attention, and discriminatory decisions in relation to inheritance and forced 
and early marriage have been reversed on the basis of the existing legal framework. 
Nonetheless, the persistence of FGM and violence against women remain a challenge.    
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to liberty/prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>19. Arbitrary arrest and detention by police officers continued to occur in many parts of 
the country. During monitoring visits to police cells by the Human Rights Section 
UNIPSIL, it was found that on many occasions, suspects had been detained for minor 
offences beyond the constitutionally stipulated period of 72 hours. Indiscriminate arrest and 
detention by police were observed during peaceful demonstrations. In November 2010,  
some fifty people were indiscriminately arrested and detained after a community rose up 
against a mining company in Tonkolili district. They were detained in unhygienic police 
cells for more than a week without being charged.  
</p>
<p>20. In 2008/2009, the United Nations Peace-Building Fund (PBF) provided assistance to 
the Sierra Leone Prison Department, enabling improvements to infrastructure, and the 
purchase of beds, mattresses and vehicles. However, prison facilities continue to face 
problems of overcrowding, lack of water, and health and sanitation facilities. The prisons 
also lack adequate recreational and educational facilities, which makes the rehabilitation of 
convicts a major challenge. The Pademba prison in Freetown, for example, was intended to 
house 325 prisoners, but currently houses more than 1,000 inmates. On a positive note, in 
November 2010, all female detainees at the Pademba prison were relocated to the detention 
premises of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), which previously hosted only 
SCSL detainees, and which was handed over the Sierra Leone Prison Service in November 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>21. Enormous progress was made during the reporting period in the judicial sector in 
terms of improvement to infrastructure, and the appointment of more magistrates and 
judges to the bench. The justice system has gained more independence, and overt political 
interference into the administration of justice has been mitigated. Development partners, 
including the UK&#8217;s Department for International Development (DFID) and the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have been providing financial support to these 
processes. Notwithstanding, there are still challenges: the judicial system is critically under-
resourced and understaffed, which has resulted in undue delays especially, with criminal 
proceedings. For close to 6 million residents, Sierra Leone has only 14 judges, 15 
magistrates and 7 public prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>22. Some districts (for example Bonthe) have been without a resident magistrate for a 
long time. The remuneration for judges and magistrates is still not attractive enough to 
attract young and energetic legal practitioners to the bench. The insufficient number of 
public prosecutors has led to the use of police prosecutors in an effort to compensate. 
However, despite numerous training sessions by international partners, knowledge retention 
among police prosecutors remains low due to the high frequency of personnel transfers. 
The technical capacity of justice actors also undermines human rights protection. During 
interaction with the judiciary, the need for more training in emerging legal areas, such as 
transnational crimes, as well as longstanding areas of concern, such as juvenile and gender 
justice, was highlighted. These shortfalls have affected the efficiency of the administration 
of justice and contributed, in part, to the backlog of criminal and civil cases. </p>


<p>23. Access to the formal justice system is limited, especially in rural areas where a large 
part of the population resorts to Sierra Leone&#8217;s 302 local courts and the traditional justice 
system. Local courts apply customary law and operate under the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and Local Government. Currently, there are only 3 customary law officers charged 
with reviewing all local court decisions to ensure that there have been no errors in law or 
miscarriages of justice. This situation is made even more serious by the inadequate 
infrastructure, such as a shortage of court houses, dilapidated court premises, and the 
absence of a court database system to ensure vital case tracking.  
</p>
<p>24. Local court staff are also in crucial need of ongoing training. The independence of 
local court chairpersons to decide matters put before them impartially &#8211; without restriction, 
improper influence, inducements or pressure &#8211; has been questioned as the lack of tenure 
security is perceived as affecting decision making. There are also concerns that paramount 
chiefs, tribal heads and other traditional leaders continue to adjudicate in courts which do 
not meet the basic principles on independence of the judiciary nor observe due process 
guarantees. In addition, customary laws discriminate against women and undermine their 
general empowerment and access to justice, especially in rural communities. The 
codification of laws used by local courts, as well as their jurisdiction needs to be addressed 
and determined.   
</p>
<p>25. In the area of juvenile justice, challenges remain despite the enactment of the Child 
Rights Act (2007). There is only one Juvenile Court in the country, which is based in 
Freetown. In the whole country, there are just two remand homes and one approved 
school.1 Juveniles frequently share prison cells with adults.   
</p>
<p><b> 5. Freedom of thought, conscience and religion  
</b></p>
<p>26. A high level of religious tolerance has been enjoyed at the national level between 
Muslims, who constitute about 55 per cent of the population, and Christians. Christian and 
Muslim leaders meet regularly as an Inter-religious Council and use this forum for 
promoting religious tolerance and peace. Official meetings and events normally commence 
by a recital of Muslim and Christian prayers.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Human rights defenders and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>27. There have been a number of incidents in which human rights defenders have been 
intimidated and harassed. The Chairs of the District Human Rights Committees in a number 
of districts were targeted.  One chairman was detained by the Police and threatened with 
prosecution for treason for leading a peaceful protest in front of the President&#8217;s residence to 
draw the President&#8217;s attention to the increasing number of incidents of sexual and gender-
based violence in the district. Another municipality banned the Chairman of the District 
Human Rights Committee from holding any public office in the district, because his 
practice of consistently raising human rights issues was not welcome. A Paramount Chief 
was reported to have humiliated and intimidated a human rights defender for sensitizing 
residents against forced labour, which the Chief was allegedly imposing on youths in his 
chiefdom.  
</p>
<p>28. Citizens of Sierra Leone generally enjoy the right of freedom of expression and 
information. Sierra Leone Broadcasting Cooperation, an independent broadcasting body, 
was officially launched by the Secretary-General in June 2010. In September 2010, the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Remand homes are facilities that accommodate juveniles on trial. If convicted, juveniles serve their 
</p>
<p>sentence in approved schools.. </p>


<p>establishment of two new independent radio stations contributed to increased access to 
information. 
</p>
<p>29. Restrictions resulting from the application of a Seditious Libel Law (1965) limit the 
full enjoyment of the rights of freedom of expression and information. The seditious or 
criminal libel offence is widely used to intimidate journalists by taking them to court, even 
though magistrates have, in the past, mostly dismissed such cases. In February 2010, a 
journalist was acquitted of six counts of criminal libel and awarded compensation by the 
magistrate, while in another district, the court dismissed a case involving the editor of  
<i>Awareness Times</i> who had been charged with committing seditious libel against the 
President of the country.  
</p>
<p>30. There have also been instances whereby journalists have suffered other forms of 
intimidation. In May 2010, the President of the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists 
(SLAJ) alleged that he had received a death threat as a result of a report which he had sent 
to the British Broadcasting Corporation about the former Minister of Marine Resources, 
who was standing trial for corruption-related offences. In December 2010, four journalists 
were arrested in Freetown, allegedly on the instruction of the Minister of Land. The 
journalists claimed that they had been investigating a case of fraud involving the Ministry. 
They were later released on bail.  
</p>
<p>31. The Sierra Leone Association of Journalists led the advocacy for the enactment of a 
Freedom of Information bill. At the time of writing this report, the bill had been approved 
by the Cabinet, discussed in Parliament, and was currently at the Legislative Committee for 
further consideration. If adopted, Sierra Leone will be the second West African country to 
have a freedom of information law, which will enhance accountability and transparency 
among public officials. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>32. An active multi-party democracy has evolved since the end of the civil war, 
evidenced by two rounds of largely free, fair and credible elections for President, 
Parliament and Local Councils, with high voter turnout. A policy of political 
decentralization with direct elections of local councils and ward representatives, combined 
with devolution of public service delivery, is a welcome development.  
</p>
<p>33. However political tension, in particular between the governing All Peoples&#8217; 
Congress (APC) and the major opposition party, Sierra Leone Peoples&#8217; Party (SLPP), has 
broken out on several occasions and the relationship between the two major political parties 
could intensify especially as the 2012 elections approach. Incidents of political violence, as 
witnessed during the local council by-election in Kenema in February 2010, and the 
parliamentary by-elections in Pujehun in May 2010, underscored the fragility of the 
situation. In late November/early December 2010, the run up to the by-elections in Kono 
District was marked by some worrying incidents, including supporters from each party 
throwing stones and human faeces at each other, beatings and damage to property. 
Allegations of voter intimidation in a few chiefdoms have also been reported. Despite these 
incidents, the elections were peaceful, free and fair, although they highlighted the need to 
enhance voter education, ensure cancelation of invalid votes. and ensure the full enjoyment 
of the right to vote. 
</p>
<p>34. Paramount Chieftaincy elections in 2010 were also surrounded by some tension, and 
pre- and post-election violence has had a negative impact on the right to property, physical 
integrity and security of the person. Violence erupted in one election following allegations 
that a supporter of one of the candidates was bribing tribal authorities to influence their 
votes.  </p>


<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. In 2009, the Government of Sierra Leone formulated its second Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper (PRSP),called the &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221;. While broad-based economic 
growth is the main goal of this four-year strategy, the rule of law, human rights, peace and 
security are considered as essential pre-requisites for poverty reduction in the strategy. The 
United Nations family in Sierra Leone adopted a Joint Vision with 21 programmes aimed at 
supporting the Government&#8217;s Agenda for Change2 which is now in implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Right to work  
</b></p>
<p>36. The population employment ratio has remained constant at 40 to 45 per cent since 
</p><p>2004. The labour market has not been able to absorb the supply of labour for several 
reasons, including lack of access to finance and poor infrastructure, but also lack of critical 
skills in the existing labour force, including lack of general or specific education In the 
short term, the Government is responding to youth unemployment through semi-capital 
programmes, known as &#8220;cash for work&#8221;. In the medium to long term, key interventions will 
be required in investment in infrastructure, skills and growth areas as highlighted in the 
Government&#8217;s Agenda for Change. The recently established Youth Commission and the 
National Youth Secretariat will provide the institutional framework for coordination and 
oversight of youth-related interventions, which are supported by country programmes of 
FAO, UNDP, WFP, the World Bank and GTZ. The achievement of full and productive 
employment and decent work for all, including women and young people, hinges on 
accelerating growth and investment in areas such as agriculture, improving the quality and 
access to essential rural social services, promoting rural employment and industry, and 
strengthening the capacity for monitoring and evaluating the country&#8217;s employment 
situation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>37. The level of poverty in Sierra Leone is still very high. Absolute poverty had fallen 
from around 70 per cent, after the war, to around 60 per cent by 2007. Although the 
malnutrition ratio fell from 31per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in 2008, progress towards 
reducing the proportion of people suffering from hunger by half in 2015 is still a daunting 
challenge. However, current and expected growth in agriculture (subsistence as well as 
commercial), and recent inflow of private sector investments in the mining and agribusiness 
sectors are expected to improve livelihoods and boost food acquisition.  
</p>
<p>38. Inflation is forecast to increase from 11 per cent in 2009 to 14 per cent in 2010, due 
to the weak currency and rising global oil prices. Food prices have increased as nearly 40 
per cent of Sierra Leone&#8217;s food needs are fulfilled through importation. Real GDP growth is 
expected to pick up after a dip in 2009, with a rise to 5.2 per cent in 2010, and 6 per cent in 
2011, as the global economy improves. This should boost prices for exports and drive 
greater foreign investment in mining projects.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p>39. Progress in promoting the right to health has been noted. Within the framework of 
the National Health Strategy that was launched in November 2009, a Free Health Care 
(FHC) scheme was introduced for under-fives, pregnant and lactating mothers on 27 April 
</p>
<p>  
 2 The Agenda for Change is the strategy document unveiled by the Government of Sierra Leone in 
</p>
<p>2007 outlining the priority areas which it felt would lead to economic transformation and allow for 
broad-based economic growth, which is the primary route out of poverty. </p>


<p>2010. The introduction of the FHC program in April 2010 has led to a steady increase in the 
number of individuals accessing free health care. However, constraints remain and a 
number of maternal mortalities have been reported at the Makeni Government Referral 
Hospital, including 12 deaths in September and October 2010 alone. The causes included 
the absence of a gynecologist and midwives in the hospital, lack of commitment among the 
nurses and patients, and delays in getting access to hospitals.  
</p>
<p>40. In November 2010, the President launched &#8220;Mami en Pikin Wel Bodi Week&#8221; 
(mother and child health week), during which free medication was administered to children 
nationwide and 3.2 million bed nets were distributed for free to every household in the 
country, with a view to reducing the high rate of malaria among children, pregnant and 
lactating mothers. Efforts were made by the Government and its partners to combat yellow 
fever, bird flu, elephantiasis and polio by providing free vaccines and treatment to the 
public. On another positive note, the National AIDS Secretariat stated that the HIV/AIDS 
transmission rate has been lowered by 25 per cent in Sierra Leone, although out of 48,000 
individuals living with HIV/AIDS, only 10,000 were on anti-retro viral treatment.   
</p>
<p>41. However, enhancement of the right to health continues to be undermined by the lack 
of access to clean water and the shortage of medical practitioners, drugs and equipment. 
Expired and sub-standard drugs also adversely affected the right to health; on a few 
occasions, the Sierra Leone Pharmacy Board confiscated and destroyed a quantity of such 
drugs.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Right to education  
</b></p>
<p>42. The education sector in Sierra Leone is undergoing reform in a bid to improve the 
quality of education, and meet the Millennium Development Goals. Following the poor 
performance of pupils in public examinations in 2008, the Government set up the 
Gbamanja Commission to investigate the causes, and submit recommendations. The reform 
measures contained in the Government&#8217;s White Paper on the Commission&#8217;s report, which 
was presented to the President in March 2010, include, inter alia, a compulsory early 
childhood component, extension of senior secondary school by one year, free and 
compulsory primary education in both policy and practice, phasing out of the two shift 
system, review of the conditions of service for teachers. The Government accepted various 
recommendations put forward by the Commission, such as the extension of contact hours in 
schools and criminalizing the practice of illegally accepting pupils who do not meet the 
pass mark set for public exams. The 2004 Education Policy is also under revision with the 
aim, inter alia, of improving access to, and the quality of, education, as well as retention 
and completion of school for the girls. 
</p>
<p>43. In December 2010, Parliament enacted the Sierra Leone Teaching Service 
Commission Act (2010) aimed at improving the quality of service provided in educational 
institutions, with provisions for the establishment of a Teaching Commission to be 
responsible for the recruitment, development, training and management of teachers in the 
country. Overall, it is expected to make the teaching profession more attractive for 
graduates, and improve service delivery in the educational sector. Furthermore, in an effort 
to improve school attendance by girls in rural areas, the Government has put in place a 
policy that provides free junior secondary education, uniforms and school materials to girls 
in the eastern and northern regions.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Interaction with international human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>44. Interaction with international human rights mechanisms improved in 2010, although 
a number of reports are overdue, notably to CERD (4th report overdue since 1976), CCPR </p>


<p>(1st report overdue since 1997), CESCR (1st report overdue since 1998), CAT (1st report 
overdue since 2002), and CEDAW (6th report overdue since 2009).  
</p>
<p>45. The Human Rights Secretariat within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in charge of 
coordinating all reporting obligations to international treaty bodies. This was established 
with the technical advice and support of the Human Rights Section of UNIPSIL. The 
government has also established an Inter-ministerial Council to serve as an oversight body. 
</p>
<p>46. In June 2010, a National Consultative Workshop organized by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, with technical assistance from UNIPSIL and 
OHCHR, validated the common core document. Representatives from the Government, 
HRCSL, civil society organizations (CSOs), and local and international NGOs, faith-based 
organizations, and members of the fourth estate were present. The document is presently 
awaiting adoption by the Inter-ministerial Council. 
</p>
<p>47. In August 2010, the President of Sierra Leone formally launched the Government&#8217;s 
engagement in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process as the country is scheduled 
for review in May 2011. The Human Rights Secretariat of the Government conducted 
nationwide consultations with all relevant stakeholders for the UPR country report. CSOs 
and NGOs have also been strongly encouraged to fully participate in the key steps of the 
UPR process, and UNIPSIL/OHCHR has assisted the Human Rights Commission with 
coordinating the stakeholders&#8217; submission for the UPR. In August 2010, HRCSL, with 
support from UNIPSIL and OHCHR, organized three regional workshops with CSOs from 
all districts, followed by a National Consultative Workshop in September 2010. The civil 
society organizations presented their submissions to the UPR in November 2010.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Transitional justice mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>48. Attempts to move towards fully implementing the recommendations of the Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) have been obstructed by both a lack of political will 
and serious funding gaps. Six years after the publication of the TRC report, several key 
recommendations in the area of human rights have not yet been implemented, including 
separation of the Offices of the Attorney General and that of the Minister of Justice, setting 
up of the TRC follow-up committee, abolition of the death penalty, decriminalization of 
libel, Constitutional review and repeal of discriminatory provisions against women.  
</p>
<p>49. In addition, the Sierra Leone Reparations Programme (SLRP), established in 2008 to 
benefit amputees, victims of sexual violence, civilian war widows, severely wounded and 
child war victims, has delivered only partial benefits to 20,000 of the 32,000 registered 
victims and conducted symbolic reparation events at the community level. The Government 
of Sierra Leone also established the national Trust Fund for Victims to contribute to 
sustaining the Programme by financing emergency medical treatment for victims with life-
threatening ailments. Additional grants have been received by UNIFEM (1 million USD for 
microcredit activities for victims of sexual violence) and the German Government, but there 
is a dire need for further support from the international community. Failure to continue the 
reparations entails the risk of fuelling anger, as the victims&#8217; fate is in contrast to that of 
former combatants (apparent perpetrators) who have received financial assistance and 
training as part of demobilization and reintegration programmes.  
</p>
<p>50. The trial of former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, for crimes allegedly 
committed in Sierra Leone, is at an advanced stage at the Special Court. After completion 
of the defence case and the prosecution rebuttal case, the Trial Chamber will render a 
judgment on the merits, which is expected to be delivered in June 2011. A sentencing 
judgment, if applicable, will be delivered 6 to 8 weeks later, followed by the appeal 
proceedings. The United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone have also reached a </p>


<p>new agreement on the setting up of a Residual Special Court to facilitate the transition from 
the Special Court to the residual mechanism upon closure. The Residual Special Court will 
be mandated to try the only remaining indictee at large, Johnny Paul Koroma, if the case is 
not transferred to national jurisdiction, preserve and manage the archives, provide 
protection and support to witnesses and victims, respond to requests for access to evidence 
by national prosecution authorities, supervise enforcement of sentences, review convictions 
and acquittals; conduct contempt-of-court proceedings, provide defence counsels and legal 
aid for the conduct of proceedings before the Residual Special Court, respond to requests 
from national authorities with respect to claims for compensation, and prevent double 
jeopardy.  
</p>
<p>51. The United Nations Peace-building Fund has secured seed money in the amount of 
195,000 dollars to assist the Government in establishing a Peace Museum within the 
complex of the Special Court. The project has three components: archiving of transitional 
justice-related documents, building of a monument dedicated to war victims, and building a 
museum that reflects on sufferings during the war, and the process underway towards 
achieving lasting peace in the country.  
</p>
<p>52. In retrospect, a better balance between retributive justice and efforts to strengthen 
existing structures in areas such as the administration of justice and reparations may have 
contributed to more effective results in developing the country&#8217;s capacity to promote and 
protect human rights. Therefore, it may be timely to open discussion on how to ensure the 
best impact of transitional justice mechanisms on human rights and institutional capacity 
building. Conclusions from this debate may then be applied to other post-conflict situations.  
</p>
<p>53. In May 2010, the Government proposed to set up an inquest into the execution of 29 
individuals which took place in December 1992 under the regime of the National 
Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC). While the Government maintains that the inquest is 
not politically motivated, but rather aims to fight impunity, prominent members of Sierra 
Leone People&#8217;s Party stated that it was designed to target its leading members, including 
some potential presidential candidates for the 2012 elections. They argue that it would be 
contrary to the Lom&#233; Peace Agreement of 1999 which grants amnesty and pardon for 
offences committed during the civil war. Furthermore, HRCSL stated that the investigation 
is unnecessary because the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has extensively reviewed 
the circumstances of those executions. At the time of writing this report, there had been no 
further move on the part of the Government on the issue.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights activities of the Human Rights Section  
</b></p>
<p>54. Monitoring, capacity building, technical assistance, financial support, training and 
sensitization activities have been conducted with partners and stakeholders. The Section 
also provided logistical support such as hiring of office space, communications, including 
means of transport, and furniture to district human rights committees. Advocacy and 
sensitization activities were conducted, including radio programmes, activities with pupils 
in schools, workshops, support to partners in celebrating human rights days, and direct 
engagement with a number of institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights monitoring  
</b></p>
<p>55. The Human Rights Section of UNIPSIL continued monitoring incidents of human 
rights violation and conducted periodic monitoring of Court proceedings, as well as 
inspections of prisons and police cells. The issues identified in the monitoring exercises 
were discussed with Government authorities at the local, regional and central levels with </p>


<p>the aim of engaging relevant authorities in addressing human rights issues. Regular district 
and regional security meetings constituted important forums for discussing those issues. 
The Section also conducted joint monitoring with district human rights committees and the 
Human Rights Commission, aimed at building national capacity for human rights 
monitoring.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Capacity-building and technical assistance 
</b></p>
<p>56. Training was conducted for nearly 600 law enforcement personnel, and a curriculum 
on human rights and gender was developed for the training of security forces. Similarly, 
280 members of district committees, as well as another 275 beneficiaries from the civil 
society were trained on human rights. Seventeen sensitization activities on the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child were carried out in schools for more than 6,000 pupils, and 
engagement with 250 traditional women leaders on FGM and gender violence had a 
significant impact in changing their attitude towards FGM. Technical assistance was 
provided to the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone, Parliamentary Committee on 
Human Rights, and Human Rights Secretariat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Partnerships with national actors and United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>57. Bilateral partnerships with State and non-State actors, including the Human Rights 
Secretariat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone, 
Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, Office of the Ombudsman, Ministry of Social 
Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs, Police and other law enforcement institutions was 
enhanced.  A draft memorandum of understanding has been finalized with the Human 
Rights Commission to provide technical support for establishing a human rights monitoring 
directorate within the Commission, developing monitoring tools, and training staff on 
human rights monitoring. District Human Rights Committees, comprising coalitions of civil 
society organizations in all 14 districts in the country, also formed an integral part of the 
Section&#8217;s bilateral partnerships. The Section played an observer role in District and 
Provincial Security Committee meetings. 
</p>
<p>58. The Human Rights Section played a major role in implementing programme 2, 
&quot;Access to justice &amp; human rights,&quot; under the United Nations Joint Vision, together with 
UNDP, UNICEF &amp; IOM. Outside of the United Nations, the Human Rights Section co-
chairs with the Human Rights Commission, regular meetings of the Human Rights 
Working Group established in 2010. The Working Group brings together UN actors, 
donors, embassies, national institutions, international NGOs and CSOs for the purposes of 
discussing priorities, identifying gaps, ensuring coordination, and mobilizing resources 
among others. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges  
</b></p>
<p>59. Sierra Leone has made progress in building its capacity for promoting and protecting 
human rights. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 
domestication of some crucial laws in the field of children and women&#8217;s rights have 
improved the legal framework to protect the rights of vulnerable categories. The 
establishment of the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone and other institutions in 
charge of human rights is contributing to equipping the State with an institutional structure 
to better cope with international human rights obligations. The Government&#8217;s efforts in 
tackling poverty and improving the socio-economic condition of the population through the </p>


<p>Agenda for Change, and strategies adopted to address the challenges in the areas of health 
and education are some of the positive developments.  
</p>
<p>60. However, the level of poverty in Sierra Leone is very high, and the effective 
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy depends on the mobilization of resources 
by the Government, as well as on the support of international partners. The Human Rights 
Commission of Sierra Leone and other human rights institutions are facing enormous 
financial constraints which limit their capacity to comply with their tasks. Customs and 
traditions continue to bar full implementation of the laws intended to advance the protection 
of children and women, and harmful traditional practices, including FGM and gender 
discrimination, are still widespread. The low rate of prosecution, out of court settlements 
and interference by traditional leaders in judicial matters continue to undermine the judicial 
process, thus creating room for impunity, particularly regarding sexual and gender-based 
violence. The three gender acts enacted to address the rights of women, including the 
Domestic Violence Act, have not been fully implemented.  
</p>
<p>61. The law reform process, including the Constitutional review process, is making little 
progress. The reparations programme, including crucial recommendations made by the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, are yet to be implemented. The removal of the death 
penalty and the amendment of some blatantly discriminatory provisions in the Constitution 
are issues yet to be addressed, together with other existing obstacles to the full enjoyment 
of civil rights, such as the seditious libel provision. There has been slow progress in 
domesticating the international human rights instruments which have been ratified, and in 
fulfilling treaty reporting obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Government of Sierra Leone should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>ensure adequate support to the Human Rights Commission to enable it to
