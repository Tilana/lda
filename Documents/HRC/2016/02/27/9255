</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted in pursuance of Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, by 
which the Council, after examining the mandate of the Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the human rights of internally displaced persons, decided to extend the mandate of the 
Representative for a period of three years, in order, inter alia, to address the complex problem of 
internal displacement and strengthen the international response in that regard, and invited him to 
submit annual reports. 
</p>
<p>2. The Representative takes this opportunity to thank the members of the Council and all 
member States for the trust they have shown in him, and to reiterate his resolve to continue to 
work tirelessly to promote the rights of internally displaced persons and ensure that they are 
better respected. 
</p>
<p>3. In the Representative&#8217;s view, the extension of the mandate and the marking of the 
tenth anniversary of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement<b>1</b> offer an opportunity to 
draw up an overview of his activities since his appointment in September 2004. This is also an 
opportunity to face the future and, in response to the challenges which are currently taking shape, 
outline the actions he plans to take in the near future in pursuance of his mandate. 
</p>
<p>4. The Representative will also submit a summary of his activities during the period under 
review, from January 2007, when his last report was submitted, to March 2008. Lastly, the 
Representative sets out a number of conclusions and recommendations addressed primarily to 
governments, which bear primary responsibility for providing assistance and protection for 
displaced persons, and to others working in this field. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK 
</b></p>
<p>5. In 1992, in response to growing international concern over the large number of internally 
displaced persons throughout the world and their need for assistance and protection, the 
Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General to appoint a representative on  
internally displaced persons,<b>2</b> thus creating a new mechanism whose work had a triple focus: 
understanding the dynamics of displacement and identifying the needs of those displaced; 
devising a normative framework to meet the need of displaced persons for protection and 
assistance; and analysing the institutional response to these needs. 
</p>
<p>6. The 1998 Guiding Principles undeniably constitute the main achievement under the first 
phase of the mandate. Based on international humanitarian law, international human rights law 
and, by analogy, the law governing refugees, the Guiding Principles are designed to guide 
governments, international organizations and all others concerned in their efforts to protect and 
assist displaced persons. These principles constitute a major contribution to the development of 
international rules relating to displaced persons. The Commission on Human Rights and the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>General Assembly took note of these principles, recognized that they constituted an important 
tool and encouraged the agencies and bodies of the United Nations, regional organizations and 
non-governmental organizations to disseminate them and apply them. At the 2005 World 
Summit, heads of State and government recognized the Guiding Principles as an important 
international framework for the protection of internally displaced persons.<b>3</b> Treaty bodies<b>4</b> and 
regional organizations<b>5</b> have also referred to these principles in their conclusions and decisions. 
The Guiding Principles have been translated into over 35 languages, and have already served as 
a basis for legislation or specific policies on internal displacement in some 20 countries, but also 
for international agreements on displacement issues, such as the Protocol on Protection and 
Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons, which is an integral part of the 2006 Pact on 
Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region. 
</p>
<p>7. At its sixty-first session, in resolution 2004/55, the Commission on Human Rights 
requested the Secretary-General to establish a new mechanism that would &#8220;address the complex 
problem of internal displacement, in particular by mainstreaming human rights of the internally 
displaced into all relevant parts of the United Nations system&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. In September 2004, the Secretary-General appointed Walter K&#228;lin as his Representative on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>9. In the report on the performance and effectiveness of the new mechanism on internal 
displacement which he submitted in 2006 at the request of the Commission on Human Rights, 
the Secretary-General concluded that this new mechanism was positive and helped to improve 
the protection of displaced persons. The human rights-based approach adopted by the 
Representative both with States and with the United Nations has served to strengthen the 
effectiveness of the response to situations of internal displacement.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>10. In pursuit of his mandate, the Representative has devised a strategy based on the 
conviction that displaced persons can fully exercise their human rights only if a number of

 <p> 
</p>
<p>conditions are met: a solid normative framework, the political will to respect and apply those 
rules, and the ability of States to discharge their responsibility to protect and assist displaced 
persons. 
</p>
<p>11. In the light of these elements, the Representative is focusing in the first place on promoting 
the 1998 Guiding Principles and securing their incorporation into national legislation and policy. 
He works with governments and other partners to ensure that such legislation is in keeping with 
the international rules set out in the Guiding Principles. The Representative is also working 
with the Brookings-Bern project on internal displacement on the drafting of a handbook for 
legislators and decision-makers on the national implementation of these principles, which is to 
be published in the autumn of 2008 following a series of consultations with experts from 
government and civil society. At the regional level, the Representative also draws the attention 
of relevant organizations to the need to take account of the Guiding Principles when drawing up 
new conventions or new rules which may relate to aspects of internal displacement, as in work in 
the African Union to draft a convention on internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>12. In pursuit of his mandate, the Representative has also focused on the need to mobilize 
political will, especially through his ongoing dialogue with governments. Since his appointment 
in 2004, the Representative has carried out a dozen missions in Africa, America, Asia and 
Europe. He attaches great importance to following up the recommendations relating to his 
previous missions, or the pursuit of dialogue with governments in the context of his working 
visits. In many cases, he has been told that these missions had directly contributed to the 
adoption of positive measures to benefit displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>13. The Representative works to assist States to develop their capabilities to respond to their 
obligation to protect and assist displaced persons. He provides a wealth of technical advice in the 
drafting of legislation, policies, strategies or action plans to benefit displaced persons. He has 
also developed tools to guide the various parties involved in their activities: a <b>Framework for 
national responsibility</b> in 2005;<b>7</b> operational guidelines on human rights and natural disasters, 
which were endorsed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee in 2006;<b>8</b> and a conceptual 
framework on durable solutions in 2007.<b>9</b> Lastly, the Representative organizes an annual course 
on internal displacement for government officials. 
</p>
<p>14. The Representative is also working on mainstreaming the fundamental rights of 
displaced persons into the activities of all the competent agencies of the United Nations system. 
He is involved in particular in institutional machinery such as the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee or the cluster working groups on protection and early recovery. He gives priority to

<p>close cooperation with key stakeholders dealing with displacement in the United Nations, 
namely the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the 
Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA). More recently, he has embarked on more regular cooperation with the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the 
United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). The Representative wishes to 
make special mention of the cooperation which has been taking shape since last year with the 
new Peacebuilding Commission to ensure that greater account is taken of the rights and needs of 
displaced persons in peace processes. 
</p>
<p>15. Lastly, the Representative considers that he has a responsibility to draw the attention of 
those concerned to the emergence of new challenges. In this context, he wishes to highlight the 
protection of persons displaced as a result of natural disasters, which are likely to increase as a 
result of climate change and other factors. He also believes that an additional effort must be 
made to address the challenges specific to displacement in the context of peace processes, peace 
agreements and peacebuilding activities. In addition, there is a need for serious thought to be 
given to the way to respond to the needs of displaced persons in the transitional phase between 
the end of a humanitarian crisis proper and what is judged to be the best moment for 
development activities. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
SECRETARY-GENERAL IN PURSUANCE OF HIS MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>16. As in previous years, the Representative has continued to pursue his mandate by according 
priority to regular and open dialogue with governments. He has also made an effort to continue 
to cooperate with regional organizations and United Nations agencies with the aim of working 
together to ensure better mainstreaming of the human rights of internally displaced persons into 
their activities. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Dialogue with governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the period under review, the Representative travelled on official mission to the 
Central African Republic, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He 
also carried out working visits to Armenia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Afghanistan and the United States of 
America.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p>18. At the Government&#8217;s invitation, the Representative made an official visit to the Central 
African Republic from 24 February to 3 March 2007. A detailed report containing his analysis 
of the situation, his conclusions and his recommendations is also being submitted to this Council 
session (A/HRC/8/6/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>19. During his visit, the Representative observed that the violence prevailing in the north of the 
Central African Republic is the main cause of population displacement. This violence is a direct 
result of the conflict affecting these regions; it also stems from the acts of brutality and human </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights violations committed against civilians and their property by the armed forces, and is linked 
to the attacks by highway robbers (<i>coupeurs de route</i>) and other bandits in certain areas. As a 
result of this violence, the Central African Republic is experiencing a severe protection crisis, 
highlighted by the very large number of displaced persons who are often living in complete 
destitution, in many cases having lost their homes and with no access to drinking water, health 
care or education for their children. 
</p>
<p>20. According to information received by the Representative, since his mission some people 
have returned home, in particular to a number of villages along the Bossangoa-Paoua road. At 
the same time he has learned that, although displacements caused by the security forces have 
markedly diminished, many people have had to flee their homes as a result of growing insecurity 
in certain localities related to the activities of highway robbers or incursions by Chadian army 
elements into villages around Makounda, for example. 
</p>
<p>21. The Representative hopes that the deployment of the United Nations Mission in the Central 
African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) in the north and Operation EUFOR Tchad/RCA will 
have a stabilizing effect over the country as a whole, including the western regions which have 
been particularly affected by displacements. 
</p>
<p>22. In order to prevent the perpetuation of displacement and ensure that displaced persons 
benefit from lasting solutions in the future, the Representative recommends a three-pronged 
strategy: continued political dialogue between the Government and the various armed groups; 
strengthened humanitarian assistance and protection from international organizations; and 
implementation of a targeted development programme in the north of the country in order to 
attack the root causes of the crisis, which lie in the marginalization and underdevelopment of this 
region. In his view, renouncing violence, dealing with the impunity that reigns in the country and 
engaging in constructive dialogue are the only ways to curb the serious human rights violations 
suffered by displaced persons, and he calls on all concerned to faithfully honour their 
commitments under applicable international law. He also appeals to humanitarian organizations 
to support the country in its efforts to respond to its displaced population&#8217;s need for assistance 
and protection and calls on donors to commit themselves, without delay and on a proactive basis, 
to an ambitious development programme for the north of the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Azerbaijan 
</b>23. At the invitation of the authorities, the Representative carried out an official mission to 
Azerbaijan from 2 to 6 April 2007. The purpose of the mission was to study the situation of 
displaced persons and review the measures adopted to deal with this issue. A report setting out 
the Representative&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations in detail is being submitted to this 
Council session (A/HRC/8/6/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>24. At the conclusion of the mission, the Representative indicated that the situation of internal 
displacement in Azerbaijan is serious, while noting that, since his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 1998, 
genuine progress has been achieved in providing assistance to meet the needs of displaced 
persons and protecting their rights. He noted, in particular, that some of the unhealthiest camps 
had finally been closed down and that new housing had been built in rural areas, enabling 
displaced persons to lead a decent life. He has also learned that, since his mission, the last tented 
camp was closed by the authorities in December 2007 and that over 11,000 families have been </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rehoused. He has also been informed of the adoption of Presidential decree No. 2475 in 
October 2007, providing for the allocation of large sums for the renovation of some displaced 
persons&#8217; camps in rural areas and the relocation of persons who had taken refuge in schools or 
army premises. 
</p>
<p>25. The Representative encourages the Government to continue its efforts, drawing attention to 
the situation of thousands of displaced persons living in particularly difficult conditions in 
collective housing in the urban areas. He also urges the Government to give priority to 
programmes designed to increase displaced persons&#8217; means of subsistence and make them more 
self-sufficient while giving them an opportunity to become active and productive members of 
their society once again. He also emphasizes the importance of measures to integrate displaced 
persons in the sectors of education and the economy so as to prevent any sense of 
marginalization and discrimination against this vulnerable group. 
</p>
<p>26. Lastly, the Representative calls on the international community to renew and step up its 
efforts to secure a peaceful solution, and to implement the resolutions of the Security Council 
which demand the withdrawal of occupying troops and support the return of displaced persons to 
their places of origin in safety and in dignity. He encourages the Government of Azerbaijan to 
continue its efforts to improve the living conditions of displaced persons in their current places 
of residence or elsewhere in the country, pending a solution to the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>27. At the invitation of the Government, the Representative paid an official visit to Sri Lanka 
from 14 to 22 December 2007. A detailed report by the Representative is being submitted to this 
Council session (A/HRC/8/6/Add.3). During his visit, the Representative went to Colombo and 
the districts of Puttalam, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa. He was able to observe the 
complexity and scale of the phenomenon of internal displacement in Sri Lanka. Over the past 
two years, more than 300,000 people have been displaced because of the conflict. In Jaffna and 
Puttalam, northern Muslims have been in an internal displacement situation for more than 
17 years. A very small number of persons displaced following the tsunami are still in Eastern 
Province. There is a risk that the intensification of fighting in the north of the country will 
prompt further displacements. 
</p>
<p>28. The purpose of the mission was to identify the main obstacles and the conditions which 
would enable the displaced persons to find durable solutions to their situation. Security is the 
major concern of both those who have returned home and those who are still displaced. There are 
a variety of sources of this insecurity, including the methods used by the security forces, such as 
round-ups; identification; failure to notify families why and where their relatives have been 
detained; the continuous incursions and attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
including the detonation of Claymore mines; threats and attacks by illegal armed groups, 
including Tamileela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP); enforced disappearances carried out by 
all the parties to the conflict and abductions by unidentified persons; looting; and partial 
demining. 
</p>
<p>29. Another issue requiring urgent attention is that of access to means of subsistence for 
displaced persons, which is still limited for security reasons. The Representative also considers 
that the Government should redouble its efforts to consult and share information not only with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the displaced persons and returnees, but also with humanitarian workers, in order to improve the 
humanitarian response and reduce the feeling of insecurity. The Representative is particularly 
concerned that the recent returns which have taken place in the east of the country may not be 
sustained because the displaced persons did not always have freedom of choice, were not 
consulted and did not participate in organizing the returns, and because of possible cases of 
coercion on the part of military personnel present in the camps and threats that assistance would 
be discontinued. 
</p>
<p>30. The Representative acknowledges the efforts made by the Government to assist the 
displaced persons, and the authorities&#8217; readiness to recognize the difficulties related to internal 
displacement and the need to find durable solutions to the situation faced by those who have 
been displaced for many years. Aware that fighting continues in the north of the country, the 
Representative calls on all parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian 
law and international human rights law, and in particular to facilitate the provision of 
humanitarian assistance and the safe passage of civilians. He encourages the Government to 
draw up a comprehensive policy covering all the aspects of internal displacement, in keeping 
with the Guiding Principles, clearly identify the institutional responsibilities it bears and ensure 
that the rights of displaced persons are protected. The Representative offers the authorities his 
support in any efforts made in these areas. 
</p>
<p><b>Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Representative carried out an official mission to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo from 12 to 22 February 2008. The report on this mission is being submitted to this 
Council session (A/HRC/8/6/Add.4). 
</p>
<p>32. Following his visit, the Representative considers that the eastern part of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo is experiencing a situation involving a serious protection crisis and a 
serious humanitarian crisis, highlighted inter alia by the very large numbers of displaced persons, 
mainly owing to the presence of foreign and Congolese militias and the intensification of clashes 
and acts of violence. The Representative notes with satisfaction that in other parts of the country, 
for example in Katanga, almost 1 million people have been able to return home as a result of the 
improved security in many areas. 
</p>
<p>33. In most cases, people have been forced to leave their homes owing to clashes between the 
Congolese armed forces and the various armed groups which are present in the east of the 
country, or following clashes between different armed groups. But widespread insecurity and 
violence, including killing, systematic rape and forcible recruitment of children and young 
people, which are prevalent in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, as a result of the 
violations of human rights committed against civilians by the armed groups and members of the 
Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), have also forced many 
Congolese to move. Lastly, and to a lesser extent, population displacements have also been due 
to the natural disasters affecting various regions of the country, such as the recent earthquakes in 
the region of Bukavu. 
</p>
<p>34. The Representative observed during his visits to the field that displaced persons are living 
in absolute poverty, and sometimes suffer from considerable food insecurity. A large number of 
them have lost the voters&#8217; cards which serve as identity cards in the Democratic Republic of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Congo, and this increases their vulnerability. The Representative also learned that, even during 
displacements, acts of sexual violence and the forcible recruitment of children continued to 
occur. He also noted that, although the vast majority of displaced persons are living with host 
families, the aid is mainly sent to the displaced persons&#8217; camps, whether informal or organized. 
The host communities and families receive comparatively little aid, although many of them are 
overwhelmed by the burden of supporting the new arrivals, and are often unable to do more. 
</p>
<p>35. The recent political developments which led to the statements of commitment signed at 
the Conference for Peace, Security and Development in North and South Kivu, held in Goma 
from 6 to 23 January 2008, as well as the November 2007 Nairobi communiqu&#233;, potentially offer 
genuine opportunities for stabilization, and, for the displaced persons, a possible return home. 
Nevertheless, the process of implementation of these agreements appears complex and difficult, 
the situation remains unstable and displacements continue following local clashes. In addition, a 
military approach to the remaining problems would run the risk of creating new humanitarian 
crises and large-scale displacements. 
</p>
<p>36. The Representative was able to observe during these different meetings that the 
authorities are well aware of the challenges posed by the large number of displaced persons in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the conditions in which they are living. However, 
he regrets that, while taking account of the limited resources of a country in the middle of a 
transition, more effort has not been made to provide them with aid and assistance, and that no 
legal framework has been devised to tackle these problems. The Representative notes that, 
above and beyond humanitarian assistance, the United Nations Organization Mission in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and humanitarian agencies have begun major 
protection-related activities. He noted in particular that, in keeping with its mandate to protect 
the civilian population, MONUC, through the deployment of troops, has in many cases 
facilitated or even enabled humanitarian access and stabilized the security situation, thus 
making an extremely important contribution to the protection of civilians. He encourages any 
actions which are aimed at broadening protection activities, on the operational level, beyond 
this coordination with the armed forces, while emphasizing the need to uphold the fundamental 
distinction between humanitarian action and military action at all times. 
</p>
<p>37. In order to provide assistance and protection to displaced persons in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo with a view to a durable solution to the issue of displacement in the 
country - a precondition for peacebuilding - the Representative recommends a strategy focusing 
on the pursuit of political dialogue between the Government and the various armed groups and 
the other groups concerned. Support for host families, humanitarian assistance and protection 
activities for displaced persons as well as early recovery measures where returns are already 
under way or can be contemplated must be stepped up. He recommends the adoption of the 
measures needed to ensure that displaced persons take part in the local elections scheduled 
for 2008. He encourages the international community to continue to provide substantial and 
sustained support to the displaced persons assistance and protection programmes, and calls on 
the humanitarian agencies to broaden the support provided to the host communities which are 
overwhelmed by the presence of displaced persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Working visits, follow-up activities and other actions  
related to internal displacement issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>Armenia 
</b></p>
<p>38. At the invitation of the Government, the Representative undertook a working visit to this 
country from 12 to 15 April 2007, following the visit made by his predecessor in 2001. During 
his visit, the Representative met the Prime Minister and the principal senior officials responsible 
for internal displacement issues, as well as representatives of international and non-governmental 
organizations. He also went to Yerevan and to Chambarak in Gegharkunik province. 
</p>
<p>39. According to a survey conducted by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the 
Department of State for Migration and Refugees, 8,399 people, or 10 per cent of those 
initially displaced by conflict, are still displaced. Meanwhile, the number of persons who are 
still displaced following the earthquake that devastated the north-west of the country in 
December 1998 remains unknown. During his field visits, the Representative noted that some of 
the displaced persons are living in conditions which give cause for concern, sometimes with no 
income, and are completely dependent on government humanitarian assistance programmes.  
</p>
<p>40. The Representative observes that local reintegration is the preferred approach in 
Armenia. He considers that Armenia is unique in that it can resolve the remaining cases of 
internal displacement and thereby graduate from the list of countries with internal displacement 
problems. In that regard, he calls on the Government to adopt a programme of support for 
displaced persons wishing to return, and appeals to the international community to support its 
implementation. The Representative transmitted a memorandum containing his conclusions and 
detailed recommendations to the Armenian authorities in May 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire  
</b></p>
<p>41. In recent months important developments have taken place in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, opening 
up new prospects for its displaced population. The signing of the Ouagadougou Agreement 
constitutes a major landmark in the country&#8217;s recent history. On 9 March 2007, the 
Representative wrote to the President of the Republic and the Secretary-General of the 
Forces Nouvelles in order to draw their attention to a number of points which he deemed vital 
to the process of national reconciliation, namely: helping displaced persons to recover their 
property and belongings or providing them with appropriate compensation; paying particular 
attention to the land issue; and ensuring that displaced persons participate in all stages of the 
electoral process. 
</p>
<p>42. Subsequently, at the invitation of the Government, the Representative undertook a 
follow-up visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in June 2007. In addition to Abidjan, he visited the Guiglo, 
Blol&#233;quin and Bouak&#233; regions. He noted that, since the Ouagadougou Agreement, the situation 
has calmed down considerably and some spontaneous returns have already taken place in the 
north and the west of the country. He emphasizes, however, that major challenges remain with 
regard to protection and humanitarian assistance to displaced persons, and that just and lasting 
solutions must be found for the displaced in order to achieve long-term peace. In his view, unless </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>appropriate solutions are found to substantive issues, such as that of identifying individuals in 
order to determine who is and who is not an Ivorian, or that of rural land ownership, the peace 
process could be derailed by a fresh outbreak of tensions. 
</p>
<p>43. The Representative welcomes the clear commitment of the authorities, at the highest level, 
to allow the displaced persons to return, and the commitment of their communities of origin to 
reintegrate them. However, in the west of the country the Representative is seriously concerned 
at the challenges posed by the series of displacements to which he had already referred in his 
mission report.<b>10</b> Thus those displaced from Zou, who had found refuge in Blol&#233;quin, left the 
farms they were occupying in order to allow the inhabitants to return, but were not able to return 
to their own villages, which were still occupied by other displaced persons, and so found 
themselves in a particularly difficult situation. The Representative calls on the authorities to pay 
particular attention to this situation and to seek comprehensive solutions that would allow the 
phased return of the displaced persons. While he welcomes the conclusion of agreements 
between indigenous communities and returnees based on the traditions of the country, which 
should ensure greater ownership of the process by the population groups involved, the 
Representative is concerned about conflicts that could arise from such agreements. No provision 
appears to have been made for a mechanism to handle any conflicts between returnees and their 
legal representatives, and at times these agreements appear to be inconsistent with the Law on 
Rural Land Tenure, which could complicate the implementation of the Law.  
</p>
<p>44. The Representative considers that, for the most part, the obstacles to return in the north are 
due to the marginalization of this region, which is suffering from a high level of unemployment, 
virtually no public administration and a slight increase in crime, but also has a considerable 
number of occupied, looted and/or destroyed houses. He noted in particular the impoverishment 
of the displaced population, and especially the dire conditions in which particularly vulnerable 
groups such as women heads of household or very young mothers are living. He also noted that 
there was rising tension between communities. 
</p>
<p>45. The Representative points out that identification and the issue of identity papers are key 
issues in the normalization process in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. He noted with interest the efforts made in 
this sphere by the Government, but wishes to emphasize that the current procedure could create 
special difficulties for the displaced as it provides that a birth certificate must be issued at the 
birthplace of the individual concerned. He is particularly concerned at the fact that, in the context 
of the current electoral process, displaced persons might not be able to exercise their right to vote 
and participate in public life like their fellow citizens.  
</p>
<p>46. In July 2007 the Representative transmitted detailed conclusions and recommendations to 
the authorities and called on the Government to take concrete measures to finalize, adopt and 
implement without delay the plan of action for the return of displaced persons prepared by the 
Ministry of Solidarity. He recommends that the international community should continue to 
develop and support programmes for displaced persons by remaining on the ground and 
reinforcing its presence in the areas of return when necessary. The Representative reminds

</p>
<p>donors of the importance of assisting the peace process by continuing to provide substantial 
support to programmes for displaced persons, in order to support the process of return and 
ensure the continued presence of agencies and organizations involved in this field. 
</p>
<p>47. In the context of his constructive dialogue with the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire authorities, the 
Representative wrote to Prime Minister Soro on 12 March 2008 to draw his attention to reports 
of clashes between returnees and indigenous groups in the west of the country. He also took the 
opportunity to reiterate his concern about participation by displaced persons in the electoral 
process, in view of the difficulties they are encountering in obtaining court declarations to 
replace birth certificates. 
</p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Representative took advantage of his attendance at a United Nations conference 
on the protection of civilians in Afghanistan from 11 to 17 August 2007 to meet 
Vice-President Karim Khalili, several ministers and representatives of international 
agencies and non-governmental organizations on the situation of displaced persons in the 
country. The Representative considers that if the conflict continues at the present pace, there is 
potential for a significant increase in the number of persons displaced as a result of military 
operations and fighting in the south of the country. He deplores the difficulties encountered by 
humanitarian personnel in gaining access to them as a result of the prevailing insecurity. The 
situation could worsen if refugees returning from Pakistan or the Islamic Republic of Iran are 
unable to return to their places of origin or become integrated in another region. Furthermore, if 
the volume of such returns exceeds the ability of Afghan society to absorb them, there is a risk 
that the number of displaced persons will also rise. 
</p>
<p>49. On the subject of protection against displacement, the Representative wishes to remind all 
parties to the conflict that strict compliance with international humanitarian law can help to 
minimize the scale and duration of displacement. In particular, he cites the obligation to respect 
the distinction between civilians and combatants, the principle of proportionality and the 
obligation to take all necessary precautionary measures. In addition, the Representative draws 
the attention of all those involved to the fact that, in the quest for durable solutions for displaced 
persons, special attention must be paid to their right to security, shelter and a livelihood, as well 
as the need to address land disputes and the question of land redistribution. 
</p>
<p>50. During his visit, the Representative encouraged the Government and the international 
humanitarian community to evaluate the needs of displaced persons in terms of assistance and 
protection, but also in the framework of the search for durable solutions. He also called for the 
development of a national strategy on internal displacement and the clear identification of 
coordination machinery and specification of responsibilities. The Representative is continuing 
the dialogue on these issues with the United Nations country team, and welcomes the fact that 
the evaluation and efforts to enhance coordination are under way. 
</p>
<p><b>United States of America 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Representative went to the United States from 14 to 18 January 2008 for a working 
visit to study the impact of Hurricane Katrina, which had devastated the south-eastern coast of 
the country between 29 August and 1 September 2005, on the situation of the persons who are </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>still displaced as a result of this disaster. This visit formed part of a series of visits to various 
regions planned in 2008 and 2009 to seek better understanding of the challenges posed by 
natural disasters in terms of the protection of persons displaced by such disasters and engage the 
authorities and civil society in a dialogue with a view to the adoption of a human rights-based 
response to such disasters. 
</p>
<p>52. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), over 64,000 families 
are still occupying temporary housing following this disaster. During his visit, the Representative 
went to Houston (Texas) and New Orleans. He held discussions with government officials and 
the American Red Cross, local elected officials, members of civil society and displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>53. The visit showed that, despite the great generosity of communities, the main challenges for 
most of the displaced persons he met continue to relate to access to decent housing at affordable 
prices, access to jobs, the very low level of their incomes, and poor prospects in the medium and 
long term. Durable solutions have not yet been found to the situation of the displaced persons, 
owing in part to the lack of reconstruction plans properly focused on the needs of such people, 
particularly the most deprived of them, including those living in social housing, who do not have 
the funds required to rebuild their houses or do not meet the conditions for government aid, and 
consequently feel marginalized. In order to tackle these problems, the Representative chaired 
several workshops together with municipal officials and representatives of the various affected 
communities in order to draw their attention to the Guiding Principles and the conceptual 
framework on durable solutions and invite them to consider the applicability of these tools in the 
context of post-Katrina reconstruction. 
</p>
<p><b>Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 4/8:  the Group of Experts on the 
Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>54. During the period under review, the Representative participated in the work of the 
group of experts<b>11</b> as Rapporteur. This group was requested by the Human Rights Council 
&#8220;to work with the Government of the Sudan, the appropriate human rights mechanisms of the 
African Union and to closely consult with the Chairman of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and 
Consultation to ensure the effective follow-up and to foster the implementation of resolutions 
and recommendations on Darfur, as adopted by the Human Rights Council, the Commission on 
Human Rights and other United Nations human rights institutions as well as to promote the 
implementation of relevant recommendations of other United Nations human rights mechanisms, 
taking into account the needs of the Sudan in this regard, to safeguard the consistency of these

The group, which submitted its final report to the sixth session of the Council in December 2007, 
noted that, although initiatives have been introduced by the Government in the light of a number 
of recommendations, they have not yet yielded a tangible impact on the ground, according to 
reports received from organizations present in Darfur.<b>13</b> The Council took note of the group&#8217;s 
report and requested the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan to 
ensure that the recommendations of the group of experts were effectively followed up.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Norway and Canada 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Representative visited Norway on 9 November 2007 and Canada on 5 February 2008. 
These visits enabled him to renew his excellent relations with the authorities of these countries 
and to discuss matters of common interest. 
</p>
<p><b>Press releases and other activities 
</b></p>
<p>56. During the period under review, aside from the press releases published at the end of his 
missions and working visits, the Representative issued joint statements with other experts under 
the special procedures concerning Somalia (1 May 2007) and Kenya (4 January 2008), calling on 
those concerned to fulfil their human rights-related obligations vis-&#224;-vis population groups, 
including internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>57. On 17 and 18 April 2007, the Representative was invited to participate in the International 
Conference on Addressing the Humanitarian Needs of Refugees and Internally Displaced 
Persons inside Iraq and in Neighbouring Countries, organized in Geneva by UNHCR. In his 
statement, the Representative sought to highlight some of the challenges posed by the situation 
of almost 2 million displaced Iraqis, which he viewed as a far greater cause for concern than 
that of those who had found refuge in other countries. The Representative pointed out that it was 
the responsibility of the Government to protect and assist its internally displaced citizens. In 
response to reports of restrictions imposed by some regions on entry by displaced persons, the 
Representative emphasized the fundamental right to seek to escape violence inside one&#8217;s 
country; he also urged local authorities to ensure that displaced persons were not impeded in 
their efforts to find security and protection inside their country. He encouraged the international 
community, including United Nations agencies and bodies, to focus their endeavours on the 
situation of displaced persons in Iraq and provide support to the Iraqi Government in that regard. 
</p>
<p>58. In the context of his continuing dialogue with all those concerned by the situation of 
displaced persons in Georgia, the Representative sent a message to the participants in the 
symposium on the legal aspects of the return of displaced persons to Abkhazia, Georgia, which

<p>was organized in New York on 29 November 2007. In his message, he referred to the three types 
of durable solutions available to the internally displaced persons (return, integration in the area 
of displacement, resettlement in another part of the country) and the conditions required for a 
durable return, including security, return of property, reconstruction of homes and creation of an 
environment conducive to return and reintegration. He welcomed the Government&#8217;s adoption of 
the national strategy on internal displacement, which referred to displaced persons&#8217; right to 
return while allowing them to live normal lives pending the time when return in safety and 
dignity becomes possible. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Forthcoming missions 
</b></p>
<p>59. As part of his activities for the second half of 2008, the Representative plans to carry out 
an official mission to the Sudan and Kenya. He has written to the Kenyan and Sudanese 
authorities on this subject. He urges the authorities of these two countries to respond speedily to 
these letters so that the dates can be set jointly. He has also been invited to carry out a follow-up 
visit to Georgia, and plans to visit Timor-Leste. As part of his work on persons displaced as a 
result of natural disasters, the Representative is to visit Central America and South Africa. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Promotion and development of the normative framework  
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Continued dialogue with regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Representative continues regular contacts with his counterpart from the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Special Rapporteur on Refugees, Asylum 
Seekers and Displaced Persons in Africa, with whom he continues to plan a mission soon to the 
Sudan in order to gain insight into the situation of displaced persons in Darfur and the pattern of 
returns in the south of the country. 
</p>
<p>61. The Representative commends the African Union on its initiative of drawing up a 
convention on internally displaced persons. He cooperates closely with the African Union on 
this topic, and has played an active part in discussions on this draft at the invitation of the 
African Union Commission. He has also been invited to participate in a consultative meeting in 
April 2008. 
</p>
<p>62. The Representative, who was invited to submit a few comments, welcomes the adoption 
of resolution 2277 by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) at 
its thirty-seventh regular session, which was held in Panama City in June 2007. The resolution 
urges member States &#8220;to consider using the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, 
prepared by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General &#8230;, as a basis 
for their plans, policies, and programmes in support of such persons, and, in accordance with 
international law, in support of, inter alia, indigenous communities and communities of African 
descent, and the specific needs of children, women, the elderly, and persons with disabilities&#8221;. 
It also calls on States to incorporate the Guiding Principles into their domestic law. 
</p>
<p>63. As part of his ongoing dialogue with the Council of Europe, the Representative visited the 
Council in January 2007 and met the Secretary-General, the Commissioner for Human Rights 
and various members of the secretariat, including the support staff of the committees on legal 
cooperation and migrations. Among the many issues of mutual concern addressed, the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Representative notes in particular those relating to protracted displacement situations, the search 
for durable solutions for displaced persons and the need to give further consideration to some 
issues, such as the right of internally displaced persons to rent or have the use of property. In all 
the discussions, the need to strengthen cooperation between the Representative and the Council 
was stressed. 
</p>
<p><b>International Organization of la Francophonie 
</b></p>
<p>64. The issue of internal displacement in the countries of French-speaking Africa is 
increasingly engaging the attention of the Representative, who wishes to cooperate more 
closely with the International Organization of la Francophonie (OIF) in this area. He made an 
initial visit to the Permanent Representative of OIF to the United Nations in Geneva and 
discussed with him the challenges to be faced by French-speaking countries which are 
experiencing situations of internal displacement. He also suggested that OIF should participate 
in organizing the course on the law relating to internal displacement which is to be held in 
French this year. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Mainstreaming of the fundamental human rights of displaced  
persons into all relevant parts of the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Representative continues to work for better integration of the rights of displaced 
persons in the activities of the competent United Nations bodies in accordance with his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Representative continued to work closely with the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and with the Emergency Relief Coordinator, one of whose 
colleagues has the task of supporting the work of the Representative. During the period under 
review, the Representative was invited to contribute to major documents prepared by OCHA. 
He also participated in major OCHA activities such as the seminar organized in Kabul in 
August 2007 on protection of civilians. At the operational level, he is in regular communication 
with OCHA officials in mission preparation and follow-up. He also enjoys a special relationship 
with the Displacement and Protection Support Section, with which he cooperates closely in 
dealing with specific country situations. 
</p>
<p><b>Inter-Agency Standing Committee 
</b></p>
<p>67. During the reporting period, the Representative actively participated in the deliberations of 
the Inter-Agency Standing<b> </b>Committee, at both the level of principals and that of the working 
group, and in particular in the discussions on reform of the humanitarian sector and reform of the 
Committee&#8217;s working methods. 
</p>
<p>68. As regards the work of the working group on protection, the Representative made major 
contributions to the &#8220;handbook for the protection of internally displaced persons&#8221;, which was 
published informally in December 2007. He also drew the attention of the members of the 
Committee&#8217;s working group to the need for greater focus on the conceptual and practical 
challenges posed by protection issues in the context of natural disasters. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>69. In 2007, the Committee adopted the conceptual framework on durable solutions for 
displaced persons devised by the Representative following an extensive consultation process. 
This conceptual framework provides criteria for determining when and in what circumstances 
displaced persons no longer need to be so classified, or to be considered as requiring special 
assistance and protection. These criteria relate to the material conditions which need to be met in 
order to speak of durable solutions (such as security, non-discrimination, return of property, 
access to basic services), as well as the process leading to such solutions (mechanisms for 
consultation with the affected population, access to objective information on conditions in the 
new place of residence, etc.). 
</p>
<p><b>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Representative continues his close cooperation with UNHCR, which includes the 
presence of a colleague in UNHCR offices. He thanks UNHCR for the support it has provided in 
mounting and conducting field missions, and welcomes the dialogue which has been instituted 
with officials following his missions. 
</p>
<p>71. In June 2007, the Representative together with UNHCR and the Brookings-Bern project 
organized a brainstorming workshop on protracted displacement situations with a view to 
identifying the measures needed to improve the assistance and protection offered to displaced 
persons in such situations, with an emphasis on durable solutions. A report on the meeting was 
prepared, which included recommendations for the future relating to advocacy, reform of the 
humanitarian sector and institutional cooperation, in the context of operational development and 
research. A further seminar on early recovery and the search for durable solutions for internally 
displaced persons, which is to be organized with the cooperation of UNHCR but also UNDP and 
OCHA, is scheduled for 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Representative continues to receive support from the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in accordance with the Office&#8217;s mandate 
for assistance to special procedures. In addition to general support in the implementation of 
the Representative&#8217;s mandate, the Office provides both substantive and logistical assistance 
in preparations for his missions. The Office also cooperates closely with the Representative in 
organizing the course on internal displacement held each year in San Remo. 
</p>
<p><b>Peacebuilding Commission 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Representative, who is convinced that the search for solutions to the problems of 
displacement and the prevention of displacement are inextricably linked to the search for durable 
peace, considers that the Peacebuilding Commission should systematically examine the issues of 
internal displacement, in particular those related to the return and reintegration of displaced 
persons in the countries with which it is working. 
</p>
<p>74. Armed with this conclusion, the Representative was invited to address the Commission 
on 2 May 2007, together with the High Commissioner for Refugees. In his address, the 
Representative stressed that the search for durable solutions for displaced persons would boost 
the sustainability of efforts to build peace. Consequently, the search for such solutions should be </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>undertaken as soon as possible in order to avoid protracted displacement situations. He pointed 
out that peacebuilding processes were vital to efforts to find durable solutions for displaced 
persons, but also that, without durable solutions, such processes might be short-lived. 
</p>
<p>75. On 13 March 2008, the Representative was invited once again to participate in a thematic 
discussion on internal displacement in the Working Group on Lessons Learned in order to draw 
conclusions at the national and international levels from post-conflict interventions. On that 
occasion, the Representative emphasized that the return and reintegration of displaced persons 
are often the solutions favoured by the persons concerned, and that the way in which such 
solutions are implemented has a considerable impact on the sustainability of peace. Drawing on 
experience gained in post-conflict situations, the Representative concluded by outlining the 
following fundamental considerations: the mere signing of peace agreements is not sufficient to 
provide durable solutions for internally displaced persons; the quality of the process leading to 
durable solutions is a key element necessary for ensuring stability; the successful return of 
displaced persons requires as a minimum that their safety is guaranteed, that their property is 
restored and that an environment conducive to return is created; activities relating to the 
establishment of security, property restitution and the creation of an environment conducive to 
return should as far as possible take place in parallel; peacebuilding efforts should take into 
account the specific needs of displaced persons and returnees; funding must be rapidly available 
and flexible so as to avoid the traditional dichotomy between humanitarian activities and 
development activities. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Capacity-building activities and research 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Representative also attaches particular importance to activities designed to build the 
skills of those called on to work on issues relating to internal displacement. As in previous years, 
the Representative continued to implement a number of capacity-building initiatives. He also 
continued, in cooperation with the Brookings-Bern project, to carry out and commission research 
on internally displaced persons and related issues. 
</p>
<p>77. From 4 to 7 June 2007, the Representative organized the third course on internal 
displacement at the Institute for International Humanitarian Law in San Remo (Italy). This 
one-week course was for the first time organized jointly with OHCHR. It was attended 
by 28 participants from 19 countries. The purpose of the course was to build national capacity by 
focusing on three main areas: promoting understanding of the normative framework; dialogue 
and exchanges of views on national legislation and policies relating to internal displacement; and 
the development of tools for the implementation of legislation and policies. The participants 
were principally government officials, but also representatives of United Nations agencies and 
bodies and civil society. The next course, which will take place in June 2008, will be organized 
for the first time in French so as to benefit officials from French-speaking countries affected by 
the phenomenon of internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>78. As a part of research activities, a study on displaced persons and peace processes was 
finalized and published in 2007.<b>15</b> This study shows the extent to which the solving of internal

<p>displacement problems is inextricably linked to the search for durable peace. The study also 
suggests a number of practical strategies: including internally displaced persons in peace 
processes; taking their specific needs into account when drafting peace agreements; ensuring that 
they can play an active part in building peace. This report was extensively discussed at 
workshops organized in Geneva, New York and Washington. 
</p>
<p>79. During 2008, the Representative plans to prepare a handbook for mediators, in cooperation 
with the United Nations Mediation Support Unit and the Brookings-Bern project, highlighting 
the key principles relating to internal displacement which need to be taken into consideration in 
peace agreements. 
</p>
<p>80. The Brookings-Bern project has also prepared a short study on the advisability of drafting 
a set of principles and a handbook for governments, non-governmental organizations and other 
humanitarian personnel on whether, when and how to involve internally displaced persons in the 
decision-making process, using the techniques of information-sharing, consultation and 
participation. A workshop attended by representatives of governments, United Nations agencies 
and bodies and non-governmental organizations involved in protection and assistance for 
internally displaced persons was organized on this issue. After consultations with these partners, 
the principles and handbook will be finalized, published and distributed widely in countries 
facing internal displacement issues.

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Representative acknowledges and welcomes the efforts which have led to greater 
recognition of the reality of the phenomenon of internal displacement and to progress in 
the development of the normative framework and the coordination of the response to these 
questions. However, he wishes to point out that millions of people are still displaced, living 
in serious distress, and that they have specific needs for assistance and protection by virtue 
of their displaced status. The Representative points out to governments that, as the Guiding 
Principles state, they have the primary duty and responsibility to provide protection and 
assistance to displaced persons at all stages of displacement: as part of efforts to prevent 
displacement, during displacement itself and as part of the quest for durable solutions. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Guiding Principles, the 
Representative welcomes the fact that these principles are widely accepted at the 
global, regional and national levels. In this context, the Representative wishes to make 
the following recommendations to governments and regional organizations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) They should develop national legislation and policies which are in keeping with 
the Guiding Principles and ensure that they are implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) They should bring existing legislation into line with the Guiding Principles; 
 (c) They should develop regional legal instruments based on the Guiding Principles 
and ensure that they are implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Representative is seriously concerned at the difficulties - sometimes systematic in 
nature - encountered by humanitarian personnel in gaining access to displaced persons. He </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>calls on governments and others concerned to authorize and facilitate speedy, unhindered 
access to displaced persons on the part of providers of humanitarian assistance, in 
accordance with the Guiding Principles. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Representative is particularly interested in the fate of displaced persons in the 
context of peacebuilding. Several of the missions and working visits he has organized have 
revealed that displaced persons often prefer return to and integration in their places of 
origin, and the Representative has also observed that the way in which durable solutions to 
displacement are implemented has a considerable impact on the sustainability of peace. He 
points out, firstly, that return - or any other solution to the problem of displacement - must 
be the result of a voluntary individual decision, taken without coercion, on the basis of 
adequate information. Secondly, he points out that at least three conditions must be met if 
the return of displaced persons to their homes and their reintegration are to be durable: 
the assurance of physical safety during and after return; the restitution of property and the 
reconstruction of homes; and the creation of an economic and social environment 
conducive to return. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> In this context, the Representative wishes to make the following recommendations to 
governments, which should endeavour: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To guarantee the physical safety of returnees; 
 (b) To create an independent mechanism for monitoring during and after return; 
 (c) To set up machinery for the restitution of property which takes into account 
both the written law and traditional rules concerning property; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To give returnees back their documents without discrimination and without 
delay; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To guarantee returnees access, without discrimination, to public services, 
livelihoods and income-generating activities. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Representative recommends that governments and the international community 
should embark in parallel on various activities related to early recovery, in such areas as 
security, reconstruction and development, so as to ensure the durable reintegration of 
returnees and respect for their rights. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Representative recommends that the international community should give 
further thought to the machinery for financing early recovery programmes, so as to ensure 
a smooth transition between the emergency phase and the development phase. Such 
machinery is often ignored when resources are concentrated on humanitarian or 
development issues.
