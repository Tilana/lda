Gran Tierra Energy Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2016 Results Highlighted by Continued
Balance Sheet Strength and Transformational Acquisition
CALGARY, Alberta, August 8, 2016, Gran Tierra Energy Inc. ("Gran Tierra" or the "Company")
(NYSE MKT: GTE, TSX: GTE), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in
Colombia, today announced its financial and operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. All
dollar amounts are in United States ("U.S.") dollars unless otherwise indicated.
Second quarter 2016 financial and operational highlights include:
Production:
•
Working interest ("WI") production before royalties for the quarter averaged 25,744 barrels of oil
equivalent per day ("BOEPD"), or 21,695 BOEPD net after royalty ("NAR"), compared with 25,610
BOEPD WI before royalties and 22,788 BOEPD NAR in the first quarter of 2016 (the "Prior Quarter").
•
Sales volumes for the quarter were 22,418 BOEPD compared with 25,430 BOEPD in the Prior Quarter.
Sales volumes decreased due to the effect of inventory changes (1,919 BOEPD) and higher royalty
volumes (1,227 BOEPD), partially offset by higher working interest production (134 BOEPD).
Gran Tierra continues to expect 2016 production to average between 27,500 and 29,000 BOEPD WI
before royalties, however, with the deferral of workovers and performance of its non-operated production,
the Company expects to be at the lower end of the range.
•
Financial and Operational:
•
•
•
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $27.4 million compared with $10.8 million in
the Prior Quarter.
Funds flow from operations for the quarter was $33.8 million compared with $11.6 million in the Prior
Quarter. Funds flow increased due to increased oil and natural gas sales, decreased operating and
transportation, general and administrative ("G&A"), severance, equity tax and income tax expenses, and
lower realized foreign exchange losses of $0.5 million.
Net loss for the quarter was $63.6 million, or $0.21 per share basic and diluted, compared with a net loss
of $45.0 million, or $0.15 per share basic and diluted, in the Prior Quarter. The loss recorded in the
second quarter of 2016 included $61.5 million of non-cash impairment losses, net of income tax recovery,
resulting from the continued low commodity price environment.
The Company maintains a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents (including current
•restricted cash) of $181.2 million, and working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $210.8
million at June 30, 2016.
•
Average realized prices increased to $35.15 per barrel of oil equivalent ("BOE") for the quarter
compared with $24.81 per BOE in the Prior Quarter, primarily due to higher benchmark oil prices.
•Operating expenses for the quarter increased to $8.70 per BOE from $8.24 per BOE in the Prior Quarter.
•
Transportation expenses for the quarter decreased to $3.05 per BOE from $5.33 per BOE in the Prior
Quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher percentage of sales at the wellhead, 48% of
production in the quarter compared with 33% in the Prior Quarter, in which transportation expenses are
netted from realized price. As a result of favorable marketing contracts, the Company realized overall
higher operating netbacks in the quarter.
•
G&A expenses for the quarter decreased by 4% compared with the Prior Quarter. The decrease was
primarily due to higher allocations to recoveries and capital projects. The Company continues its efforts
to reduce costs across the organization.
On June 30, 2016, Gran Tierra entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding common shares of PetroLatina Energy Ltd. ("PetroLatina") for cash consideration of $525.0
million (the "Acquisition"), subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. The Acquisition
is also subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, any required regulatory
approval. Approval from the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbon Agency)
("ANH") of Colombia was received on July 29, 2016 and the Acquisition is expected to close prior to
August 31, 2016.

Message to Shareholders
Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented "Gran Tierra's strong
results in second quarter 2016 clearly demonstrate that we are well-positioned for ongoing success in
Colombia. Our second quarter funds flow from operations increased 192% relative to the first quarter of
2016 to $33.8 million. The strong funds flow generation at an average Brent price of $45.52 per barrel of
oil for the quarter is a testament to the quality of our assets and our cost structure. The robust quarterly
funds flow was driven in part by a strong rebound in our operating netback, which increased 108%
quarter-over-quarter to $23.40 per BOE. During the first half of 2016, Gran Tierra's funds flow from
operations of $45.3 million covered 102% of the Company's first half 2016 capital expenditures of $44.6
million. Our second quarter 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was $27.4 million compared
with $10.8 million in first quarter 2016.
We are financially disciplined and returns-driven and, with funds flow from operations matching capital in
the first half of the year, we deemed it prudent to defer certain workovers. Whilst working interest
production before royalties was up only 1% from the prior quarter, we deferred the majority of our workover
program until the second half of 2016 as we anticipate higher commodity prices later in the year. We
expect the completion of the workover program plus appraisal activity in Putumayo-7 to allow Gran Tierra
to increase production in line with our 2016 production guidance.
Oil prices rebounded in the second quarter, with Brent prices averaging $45.52 per barrel, a 35% increase
from the first quarter of 2016, while Gran Tierra's realized oil price increased 42% to $35.15 per BOE in
the same time period. Gran Tierra has successfully driven down combined operating and transportation
expenses to $11.75 per BOE in the second quarter, a decrease of 34% from one year ago. We believe our
low cost and low decline production allows us to be successful in a variety of pricing environments. With
the development programs for both the Costayaco and Moqueta fields completed in second quarter 2016,
for the reserves we currently have booked, we expect free cash flow from these two core oil fields to fund
our future exploration programs over the next five years.
We have commenced our 2016 exploration program with ongoing civil work activities on the PUT-7 block.
We expect to spud the Cumplidor exploration/appraisal well in the PUT-7 block during third quarter 2016.
We expect this well to be followed immediately by the Alpha-1 exploration well from the same drilling pad.
These wells are the first to test the N-sands exploration play in PUT-7, which we believe is prospective
and is expected to lead to long term reserve and production growth. In addition, we are proceeding with a
near field exploration opportunity ("Guriyaco") which is a potential separate pool adjacent to the
Costayaco field. Civil works have commenced on an extension of an existing Costayaco lease and we
expect this well to be spud in third quarter 2016.
We are also successfully executing our strategy to pursue new value-added growth opportunities in
Colombia, having announced, on July 1, 2016, the planned strategic acquisition of PetroLatina for $525.0
million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. The Acquisition represents a unique
material opportunity in Colombia in terms of scale and upside potential and would add a new core
platform area for Gran Tierra in the prolific Middle Magdalena Basin. The Acquisition is expected to
increase Gran Tierra’s pro forma December 31, 2015 proved plus probable ("2P") reserves by 70% to 129
million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBOE”)1. In addition to the 53 MMBOE2 of 2P reserves, the Acquisition
is expected to add 45 MMBOE2 of possible reserves. With our strong technical and operating teams, we
expect to be able to convert a portion of these possible reserves into 2P reserves over time. One of the
many attractive aspects of the Acquisition is that 89% of the 2P reserves are in the Acordionero field,
which is in the Middle Magdalena Basin and is 100% owned and operated by PetroLatina2. Following the
Acquisition, we expect to operate over 90% of our production and reserves.
Our strong balance sheet has allowed Gran Tierra to pursue this transformational Acquisition to further
expand and diversify our asset base. With $210.8 million of working capital (including cash and cash
equivalents) as at June 30, 2016, robust cash flows and an undrawn credit facility, we are well positioned
to fund the Acquisition, which is expected to close prior to August 31, 2016, as approval of the Acquisition
was received from the ANH on July 29, 2016. The Acquisition is expected to be funded through a
combination of our current cash balance, the proceeds of a recently consummated private placement of
$173.5 million of subscription receipts, available borrowings under our existing revolving loan credit
facility and $130.0 million of borrowings under a new term loan under the credit facility that is contingent
upon the closing of the Acquisition. We believe the Acquisition also demonstrates how Gran Tierra can
effectively allocate capital to develop and grow reserves and add value. Our team is focused on emerging
from the current low oil price environment as one of the strongest and largest independent Colombia-
focused exploration and production companies, with a robust portfolio to grow net asset value per share
for our stakeholders.
On behalf of our board of directors and the team at Gran Tierra, I want to thank all of our stakeholders for
their continued support during this difficult commodity price environment. We look forward to
communicating additional updates in the coming quarters. We believe that Gran Tierra is well positioned
for growth in 2016 and beyond."

Second Quarter 2016 Operational Highlights
Colombia
Chaza Block, Putumayo Basin (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)
The Company continued its development program in both Costayaco and Moqueta.
Costayaco
During the second quarter, artificial lift was optimized in 6 wells, which resulted in estimated incremental
production of approximately 2,140 barrels oil per day (“bopd”). Production is expected to be continuously
optimized as water cut increases from the maturing waterflood at Costayaco. Potential well workovers
were identified for the third quarter of 2016 with an estimated investment of $5.7 million and expected
production gain of approximately 2,000 bopd. Workovers are booked as operating expenses.
During a workover of the Costayaco-1 well in the first week of August 2016, a 10-foot interval of the N-
Sand was perforated which naturally flowed at an average test rate over a 21 hour time period of 364
bopd of 24 degree API oil with an average watercut of 5.3% through a fully opened 2-inch wellhead choke
at an average tubing head pressure of 40 psi. After this encouraging well test, Gran Tierra's technical
team is preparing a development plan to further assess the N-Sand's production potential in Costayaco.
Facility work has also progressed in the Costayaco field with the gas-to-power project being
commissioned to generate electricity in second quarter 2016. Operating cost reductions of $1.6 million per
year are expected from this project, as Gran Tierra utilizes the Company's associated natural gas
production to generate its own power.
The water injection system for CYC-23i injection well was also finished in the second quarter. The well,
which has been producing oil since early 2016, is planned to be converted to an injector in the fourth
quarter of this year to increase the water injection into the field.
Preliminary laboratory screening has demonstrated that Costayaco is potentially a favorable target for
chemical enhanced oil recovery (“CEOR”) and in particular alkaline surfactant polymer (“ASP”) flooding. A
laboratory study has been completed to evaluate and design a high performance CEOR process suitable
for implementation in both the T Sand of the Villeta formation and the Caballos Formation sands. Further
analysis is required before considering a potential pilot project.
Moqueta
A high resolution full field history match was completed for Moqueta field using numerical three
dimensional reservoir simulation. This history matched model and its predictions are currently guiding
production forecasting and being utilized by Gran Tierra's operations team to optimize water injection,
pump operations, and zonal production. The model is enabling us to mitigate operational risks with a
focused strategy to efficiently target undeveloped reserves in the future.
Artificial lift was also optimized in 3 wells, which resulted in estimated incremental production of 890 bopd
in second quarter 2016. Production is expected to be continuously optimized as water cut increases from
the Moqueta waterflood.
Potential well workovers and stimulations were identified for the third and fourth quarters of 2016, with an
estimated investment of $4.3 million and expected production gain of approximately 1,700 bopd.
In the second quarter, electric wireline logs on Moqueta-23 identified an attractive pay interval in the U
Sand formation of the Moqueta North Block. The U Sand found in Moqueta-23 appears to be the highest
quality U Sand rock in the area with porosities reaching 14% and continuous pay thickness of 48 feet.
This interval is planned to be stimulated and tested in September 2016.
Similar to Costayaco, a preliminary screening has demonstrated that the Moqueta field is also a
potentially favorable target for CEOR and in particular ASP flooding.
Other Highlights in Colombia
Putumayo 7 ("PUT-7"; Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)
Gran Tierra has been assigned operatorship of the PUT-7 block by the ANH after the consolidating
acquisitions of PTA and PGC which results in Gran Tierra owning a 100% WI. Both acquisitions closed in
January 2016. Gran Tierra has completed the archaeological and biological screenings, and lease
construction for the Cumplidor exploration/appraisal well is proceeding. The project is on schedule and
Cumplidor-1 is expected to spud in the third quarter 2016. The drilling of the Alpha-1 exploration well is
expected to immediately follow Cumplidor-1 from the same pad. A contingent third well (Cumplidor-3) may
also be drilled from this same exploration/appraisal pad.
These wells will be the first to test the basin-wide N sands exploration play in PUT-7, which the Company
believes is prospective and expects to lead to long term reserve and production growth. Additional wells
in the Putumayo Basin continue to be progressed in the licensing process.
Chaza Block/Costayaco Exploration
Preparation is underway to drill an exploration well at Guriyaco-1 from the existing Costayaco multi-well
pad to a total depth of approximately 9,800 feet. This well is expected to evaluate the productivity of the
Caballos, T and U sands in a separate structure from the main Costayaco field. The well is expected to
spud in late third quarter 2016.
Llanos Basin (El Porton Block; Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)
The planned Crypto-1 exploration well is expected to target a Llanos Basin structure with multi-zone oil
potential. The access has been secured and civil works are expected to be initiated during third quarter
2016. The well is planned to be spud in the fourth quarter 2016.
Llanos Basin (Gran Tierra 45% WI, non-operated)
In the Llanos Basin during the second quarter 2016, Gran Tierra approved a (non-operated) workover
campaign in the Jilguero and Las Maracas fields. The program is expected to include the workovers of the
Jilguero-3, Jilguero-4, Las Maracas-10, Las Maracas-12 and Las Maracas-15 wells. The campaign is
expected to result in incremental WI production of approximately 300-400 bopd for Gran Tierra.
Suroriente Block (Gran Tierra 15.8% WI, non-operated)
In the Suroriente block, Gran Tierra approved a (non-operated) workover campaign at the Cohembi and
Quinde fields. The pump replacements in 3 wells are expected to add 200-250 bopd of WI incremental
production. Gran Tierra is encouraging the operator to consider several other low-risk workovers during
the third quarter 2016.
Sinu-San Jacinto Basin (Sinu-1 Block - 60% WI, operated; Sinu-3 Block - 51% WI, operated)
The program has been initiated to conduct 281 kilometers of two dimensional seismic over these 2 blocks.
This seismic program is expected to provide additional information for assessment of leads and prospects
on these blocks.
Cost reduction
Gran Tierra continued cost-cutting measures in the second quarter 2016. Negotiations for new contracts to
provide drilling and workover rigs, directional and fluid services, stimulation services, air transport,
helicopter services, goods and tubular transportation services, fuels and lubricants were successful in
reducing operating and future capital costs. In addition, optimizing operations such as road construction
and maintenance, location and camp maintenance, rental equipment, special services, catering and
logistics have all contributed to cost reductions. Second quarter 2016 operating expenses of $8.70/BOE
were down 33% from one year ago.
Drilling Efficiencies
In the second quarter 2016, Gran Tierra drilled one development well (Moqueta-22D) in the Moqueta field.
Moqueta-22D was drilled with high geological and operational complexity but the drilling team still
managed to reduce the cost per foot by 20% compared to previous wells drilled in first quarter 2016
(Moqueta-20D, Moqueta-23D).

on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources and reserves described can be profitably
produced in the future.
The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and
expectations and assumptions of Gran Tierra including, without limitation, that Gran Tierra will continue to
conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations, the accuracy of testing and
production results and seismic data, pricing and cost estimates (including with respect to commodity
pricing and exchange rates), rig availability, the effects of drilling down-dip, the effects of waterflood and
multi-stage fracture stimulation operations, the extent and effect of delivery disruptions, and the general
continuance of current or, where applicable, assumed operational, regulatory and industry conditions
including in areas of potential expansion, and the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its current business and
operational plans in the manner currently planned. Gran Tierra believes the material factors, expectations
and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance
can be given that these factors, expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the
forward-looking statements in this press release are: sustained or future declines in commodity prices and
potential resulting future impairments and reductions in proved reserve quantities and value; Gran Tierra’s
operations are located in South America, and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity;
technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production, transport or sale of
our products; geographic, political and weather conditions can impact the production, transport or sale of
our products; the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil
consumption more than Gran Tierra currently predicts; the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its business
plan; the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur;
the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities; the failure of
exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells; unexpected delays due to the limited availability of
drilling equipment and personnel; the risk that oil prices could continue to fall, or current global economic
and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than Gran Tierra currently
predicts, which could cause Gran Tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program; and
the risk factors detailed from time to time in Gran Tierra’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, under the caption " Risk Factors" in Gran Tierra's
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
August 5, 2016. These filings are available on the Web site maintained by the Securities and Exchange
Commission at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although the current capital
spending program and long term strategy of Gran Tierra is based upon the current expectations of the
management of Gran Tierra, should any one of a number of issues arise, Gran Tierra may find it
necessary to alter its business strategy and/or capital spending program and there can be no assurance
as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed.
All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press
release remains available does not constitute a representation by Gran Tierra that Gran Tierra believes
these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary
materially from the expected results expressed in forward-looking statements. Gran Tierra disclaims any
intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable securities laws. Gran
Tierra’s forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
The estimates of future production set forth in this press release may be considered to be future-oriented
financial information or a financial outlook for the purposes of applicable Canadian securities laws.
Financial outlook and future-oriented financial information contained in this press release about
prospective financial performance, financial position or cash flows are based on assumptions about future
events, including economic conditions and proposed courses of action, based on management’s
assessment of the relevant information currently available, and to become available in the future. In
particular, this press release contains projected operational information for 2016 and certain Blocks.
These projections contain forward-looking statements and are based on a number of material
assumptions and factors set out above. Actual results may differ significantly from the projections
presented herein. These projections may also be considered to contain future-oriented financial
information or a financial outlook. The actual results of Gran Tierra’s operations for any period will likely
vary from the amounts set forth in these projections, and such variations may be material. See above for a
discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to vary. The future-oriented financial information and
financial outlooks contained in this press release have been approved by management as of the date of
this press release. Readers are cautioned that any such financial outlook and future-oriented financial
information contained herein should not be used for purposes other than those for which it is disclosed
herein. The Company and its management believe that the prospective financial information has been
prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management’s best estimates and judgments, and represent,
to the best of management’s knowledge and opinion, the Company’s expected course of action. However,
because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future
results.
Non-GAAP Measures
This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP
measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP. Investors are cautioned that these measures
should not be construed as alternatives to net income or loss or other measures of financial performance
as determined in accordance with GAAP. Gran Tierra's method of calculating these measures may differ
from other companies and, accordingly, they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other
companies. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP
measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.
Operating netback as presented is oil and gas sales net of royalties and operating and transportation
expenses. Management believes that netback is a useful supplemental measure for investors to analyze
financial performance and provide an indication of the results generated by Gran Tierra's principal
business activities prior to the consideration of other income and expenses.
EBITDA, as presented, is net loss adjusted for DD&A expenses, asset impairment, interest expense and
income tax recovery or expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for gain on acquisition and
foreign exchange gains and losses. Management uses these financial measures to analyze performance
and income or loss generated by Gran Tierra's principal business activities prior to the consideration of
how non-cash items affect that income or loss, and believes that these financial measures are also useful
supplemental information for investors to analyze performance and the Company's financial results. A
reconciliation from net loss to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Funds flow from operations, as presented, is net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for net
change in assets and liabilities from operating activities and cash settlement of asset retirement
obligation. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, Gran Tierra changed its method of
calculating funds flow from operations to be more consistent with its peers. Funds flow from operations is
no longer net of cash settlement of asset retirement obligation. Additionally, foreign exchange gains and
losses on cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from funds flow. Comparative information has
been restated to be calculated on a consistent basis. Management uses this financial measure to analyze
liquidity and cash flows generated by Gran Tierra's principal business activities prior to the consideration
of how changes in assets and liabilities from operating activities and cash settlement of asset retirement
obligation affect those cash flows, and believes that this financial measure is also useful supplemental
information for investors to analyze Gran Tierra's liquidity and financial results. A reconciliation from net
cash provided by operating activities to funds flow from operations is as follows:

Presentation of Oil and Gas Information
BOEs have been converted on the basis of 6 thousand cubic feet ("Mcf") of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil.
BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 barrel is
based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not
represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current
price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one,
utilizing a BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 barrel would be misleading as an indication of value.
Estimates of reserves for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of
reserves for all properties, due to the effect of aggregation.
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be
recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved
reserves.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the
sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.
Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable
reserves. There is a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of
Proved plus Probable plus Possible reserves.
Estimates of Gran Tierra’s and PetroLatina’s reserves, are based upon the GTE McDaniel Reserves
Report, the PTA McDaniel Reserves Evaluation, the PGC McDaniel Reserves Evaluation and the
PetroLatina McDaniel Reserves Evaluation. The estimates of reserves provided in this press release are
estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves
may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this in this presentation and the differences
may be material. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by McDaniel
in evaluating the disclosed reserves will be attained and variances could be material.
Well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long-term
performance or of ultimate recovery. Well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not
necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery.
Disclosure of Reserve Information and Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors
Unless expressly stated otherwise, all estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and related
future net revenue disclosed in this presentation have been prepared in accordance with NI 51-101.
Estimates of reserves and future net revenue made in accordance with NI 51-101 will differ from
corresponding estimates prepared in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC “) rules and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),
and those differences may be material. NI 51-101, for example, requires disclosure of reserves and
related future net revenue estimates based on forecast prices and costs, whereas SEC and FASB
standards require that reserves and related future net revenue be estimated using average prices for the
previous 12 months. In addition, NI 51-101 permits the presentation of reserves estimates on a “company
gross” basis, representing Gran Tierra’s working interest share before deduction of royalties, whereas
SEC and FASB standards require the presentation of net reserve estimates after the deduction of royalties
and similar payments. There are also differences in the technical reserves estimation standards
applicable under NI 51-101 and, pursuant thereto, the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook, and
those applicable under SEC and FASB requirements.
In addition to being a reporting issuer in certain Canadian jurisdictions, Gran Tierra is a registrant with the
SEC and subject to domestic issuer reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities law, including
with respect to the disclosure of reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with U.S.
federal securities law and applicable SEC rules and regulations (collectively, “SEC requirements”).
Disclosure of such information in accordance with SEC requirements is included in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports and materials filed with or furnished to the SEC and, as
applicable, Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The SEC permits oil and gas companies that are
subject to domestic issuer reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities law, in their filings with the
SEC, to disclose only estimated proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions
of such terms. Gran Tierra has disclosed estimated proved, probable and possible reserves in its filings
with the SEC. In addition, Gran Tierra prepares its financial statements in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles, which require that the notes to its annual financial statements
include supplementary disclosure in respect of the Company’s oil and gas activities, including estimates
of its proved oil and gas reserves and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating
to proved oil and gas reserve quantities. This supplementary financial statement disclosure is presented
in accordance with FASB requirements, which align with corresponding SEC requirements concerning
reserves estimation and reporting.
Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures and risk factors in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in the other reports and filings with the SEC, available
from the Company’s offices or website. These forms can also be obtained from the SEC via the internet at
www.sec.gov or by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.
