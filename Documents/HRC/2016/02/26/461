<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the light of the increasing concerns regarding the adverse impact of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights,1 the Human Rights Council, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 19/32, requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR) to organize a workshop to explore the issue of the relationship of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures and human rights, including the various aspects of the negative 
</p>
<p>impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the affected 
</p>
<p>population, with the participation of States, academic experts and civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives. The workshop, which was held in April 2013, examined the various issues 
</p>
<p>and views relating to the issue, including the legitimacy of the said measures from the 
</p>
<p>perspective of human rights. A number of conclusions and recommendations were 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Council for its consideration, including a proposal that the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee be tasked to conduct an overall review of independent mechanisms to assess the 
</p>
<p>impact of unilateral coercive measures and to promote accountability.2 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 24/14, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee to prepare a research-based report containing recommendations on mechanisms 
</p>
<p>to assess the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights and to promote accountability. The present progress report, to be presented to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its twenty-eighth session, was prepared pursuant to that request. In resolution 
</p>
<p>24/14, the Council also requested the Advisory Committee to seek the views and inputs of 
</p>
<p>Member States and relevant special procedures, national human rights institutions and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations during the preparation of the report. It requested OHCHR to 
</p>
<p>organize a workshop on the impact of the application of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by the affected populations, in particular the socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>impact on women and children, in the States targeted, and to prepare a report on the 
</p>
<p>proceedings of the workshop and to submit it to the Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to that request, a workshop was held on 23 May 2014 in Geneva and the 
</p>
<p>proceedings of the workshop submitted to the Council at its twenty-seventh session.3 The 
</p>
<p>progress report has also greatly benefited from the outcomes of the workshop. 
</p>
<p>3. Pursuant to Human Rights Council recommendation 12/6, the Advisory Committee 
</p>
<p>established a drafting group comprising Mikhail Lebedev, Obiora Chinedu Okafor, Ahmer 
</p>
<p>Bilal Soofi, Jean Ziegler and Imeru Tamrat Yigezu. The drafting group elected Mr. Ziegler 
</p>
<p>as Chairperson and Mr. Yigezu as its Rapporteur.4 The Committee requested the drafting 
</p>
<p>group to submit a draft progress report to the Committee at its thirteenth session, taking into 
</p>
<p>account the replies to the questionnaire prepared during the twelfth session and 
</p>
<p>subsequently circulated to Member States, relevant special procedures, national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>4. Accordingly, the drafting group submitted a draft progress report to the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee at its thirteenth session, in August 2014.5 At the session, members of the 
</p>
<p>Committee as well as States and non-governmental organizations provided useful 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See for example, General Assembly resolutions 66/156 and 67/170. See also A/65/199, A/66/138, 
</p>
<p>A/67/181 and A/68/211. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/24/20, para. 31. 
</p>
<p> 3 See A/HRC/27/32. 
</p>
<p> 4 The members of the drafting group thank Herman Gill and Joanna Enns of the Osgoode Hall Law 
</p>
<p>School, York University, Toronto, Canada, and Mohammed Mahmood Al Hinai for their valuable 
</p>
<p>research input to the present study. 
</p>

<p>comments and inputs on the draft report. In its decision 13/5 adopted at the session, the 
</p>
<p>Committee took note of the draft progress report and requested the drafting group to 
</p>
<p>recirculate the questionnaire prepared earlier in order to further seek the views and inputs of 
</p>
<p>the various stakeholders so as to allow for more informed work. It furthermore requested 
</p>
<p>the drafting group to finalize the draft progress report, taking into account the discussion 
</p>
<p>held at its thirteenth session, and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
</p>
<p>eighth session. 
</p>
<p>5. As at November 2014, 12 States, one inter-governmental organization, one special 
</p>
<p>procedure, three national human rights institutions and one non-governmental organization 
</p>
<p>had responded to the questionnaire.6 
</p>
<p><b> II. Scope of the report 
</b></p>
<p>6. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/14, the present report focuses on 
</p>
<p>the adverse consequences of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights 
</p>
<p>by the civilian population of targeted States and includes recommendations on the 
</p>
<p>appropriate mechanism that may be used to assess the negative consequences of such 
</p>
<p>measures and to promote accountability. The question of the legality of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures, therefore, does not fall within the scope of the report. This issue has already been 
</p>
<p>extensively examined in the thematic study of OHCHR on the impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures on the enjoyment of human rights,7 and was also a subject of discussion during 
</p>
<p>the two workshops organized by OHCHR in April 2013 and in May 2014 at the request of 
</p>
<p>the Council.8 
</p>
<p><b> III. Notion of unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p>7. The term &#8220;unilateral coercive measures&#8221; is a recent one. It has been used broadly to 
</p>
<p>include measures such as &#8220;unilateral economic sanctions&#8221;, &#8220;unilateral economic measures&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;coercive economic measures&#8221; in various studies on the subject, as well as in United 
</p>
<p>Nations documents and resolutions. To date, the term &#8220;unilateral coercive measures&#8221; does 
</p>
<p>not seem to have a commonly agreed-upon definition. Despite the intensive discussion that 
</p>
<p>the term has triggered among scholars and within the different bodies of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>in recent decades, the definition used for the term and, particularly the main elements to be 
</p>
<p>used for describing the term, remain elusive in certain respects. 
</p>
<p>8. The most commonly used definition of the term is &#8220;the use of economic measures 
</p>
<p>taken by one State to compel a change of policy of another State&#8221;.9 Some recent studies 
</p>
<p>thereon, however, tend to hold the view that the term &#8220;unilateral&#8221; may be used in a broader 
</p>
<p>sense to include States, group of States and &#8220;autonomous&#8221; regional organizations, unless 
</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Pueblo del Estado (Plurinational State of Bolivia), Conseil national des droits humains (Madagascar), 
</p>
<p>and the National Human Rights Institution of Romania; and the Permanent Assembly for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights.

</p>
<p> 8 See presentations and statements made during the workshops available from the OHCHR webpage 
</p>
<p>dedicated to the issue of human rights and unilateral coercive measures.  
</p>
<p> 9 See Andreas F. Lowenfeld, <i>International Economic Law</i> (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 
</p>

<p>such measures are authorized under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.10 In a 
</p>
<p>recent article, one author stated that &#8220;&#8230;one can distinguish the unilateral sanctions practice 
</p>
<p>of individual states and organizations &#8211; such as the EU, the US, Canada or Japan &#8211; from the 
</p>
<p>mandatory sanctions of the [Security Council]&#8221;.11 This approach to defining unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures currently seems to have, more or less, gained support. Owing to the 
</p>
<p>current increased use of what are referred to as &#8220;targeted&#8221; or &#8220;smart sanctions&#8221; employed 
</p>
<p>by States against individuals, groups and/or entities believed to be in a position of power to 
</p>
<p>influence or determine actions in targeted States, defining the term &#8220;unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures&#8221; should also consider taking these categories of persons or entities into account. 
</p>
<p>9. On the basis of the above considerations, the working definition of the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;unilateral coercive measures&#8221; preferred for the purposes of the present study is &#8220;the use of 
</p>
<p>economic, trade or other measures taken by a State, group of States or international 
</p>
<p>organizations acting autonomously to compel a change of policy of another State or to 
</p>
<p>pressure individuals, groups or entities in targeted states to influence a course of action 
</p>
<p>without the authorization of the Security Council&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. Sanctions, including unilateral coercive measures employed by States, take different 
</p>
<p>forms or a combination of measures, ranging from the restriction or disruption of trade, or 
</p>
<p>financial and investment flows between sender and targeted countries to restrictions on 
</p>
<p>social and cultural exchanges.12 Most of these categories of sanctions, usually called 
</p>
<p>traditional or comprehensive sanctions, involve coercive measures intended to impose 
</p>
<p>economic pressure on targeted States by preventing them from importing or exporting 
</p>
<p>certain goods and services deemed strategically important, or more specifically target 
</p>
<p>banking and financial sectors of targeted States. &#8220;Targeted&#8221; or &#8220;smart sanctions&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>regarded as new forms of coercive measures aimed at applying pressure to persons or 
</p>
<p>entities thought to hold political decision-making power in targeted Governments or 
</p>
<p>persons deemed to engage in terrorism or other forms of violence and whose behaviour is 
</p>
<p>thought to be undesirable from the perspective of the sender State. These sanctions may 
</p>
<p>comprise the freezing of assets or travel bans on individuals, groups or entities in targeted 
</p>
<p>countries; they may also target particular commodities from being exported from targeted 
</p>
<p>States or entering such States (such as diamonds or luxury goods, or arms embargoes).13 
</p>
<p>11. Different sanctions imply a different negative impact on human rights. The 
</p>
<p>motivations for sanctions may vary significantly, and in some case are even used as a 
</p>
<p>geopolitical weapon. It seems almost certain that reshaping local and global markets, 
</p>
<p>destroying competitive economies, challenging sovereign credibility and leadership, 
</p>
<p>endangering conciliatory talk, destabilizing Governments and transforming independent 
</p>
<p>countries into failed States may induce a downturn in global economic growth. Such 
</p>
<p>situations may in turn lead to negative consequences for the livelihood of disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>populations in sanctioned countries, including in the country of origin of the sanctions. 
</p>
<p>12. Unilateral coercive measures that are comprehensive in nature are intended to cause 
</p>
<p>economic and political hardship for targeted States; they therefore make no real distinction 
</p>
<p>between States and the civilian population, including women and children and other 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups, residing in targeted States, who bear the brunt of such severe 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 See A/HRC/24/20, para. 11 and the presentation made by Antonios Tzanakopoulos, available on the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR website dedicated to the issue of human rights and unilateral coercive measures.

<p>economic hardship. Consequently, comprehensive unilateral coercive measures usually 
</p>
<p>have an adverse impact on the enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population of 
</p>
<p>targeted States, disproportionately affecting the poor and vulnerable groups in society, 
</p>
<p>particularly in terms of access to food, health care and basic livelihood, contrary to the 
</p>
<p>political declarations of the initiators and, as such, leading to or constituting the root cause 
</p>
<p>of furthering the encroachment and limitation of and restrictions on numerous human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms enshrined in universal instruments. 
</p>
<p>13. &#8220;Targeted sanctions&#8221; are, by contrast, designed to apply economic pressure to 
</p>
<p>selected individuals or entities and may therefore not entail negative consequences for the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population at large. This by no means implies 
</p>
<p>that targeted sanctions do not give rise to violations of human rights of the individuals or 
</p>
<p>entities targeted, particularly with regard to their civil and political rights.14 Since 
</p>
<p>comprehensive sanctions are the ones that usually have negative consequences on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population of targeted States, however, the 
</p>
<p>present study focuses mainly on such measures. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. In several resolutions and declarations adopted by United Nations entities human 
</p>
<p>rights bodies, including the Commission on Human Rights, increasing concerns were 
</p>
<p>expressed about the negative impact of sanctions, including unilateral coercive measures, 
</p>
<p>on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly their negative impact on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>the civilian population of targeted States and, even more so, on such vulnerable groups as 
</p>
<p>women, children, older persons and minorities.15 The Human Rights Council has followed 
</p>
<p>this trend.16 
</p>
<p>15. There is general consensus that unilateral coercive measures, particularly those that 
</p>
<p>are comprehensive in nature and manifested in the form of trade embargoes and restrictions 
</p>
<p>on financial and investments flows between sender and target States, may have a serious 
</p>
<p>impact on the enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population in targeted and non-
</p>
<p>targeted States alike. This is so because economic sanctions in general, including unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures, irrespective of their declared intent (such as preventing gross violations 
</p>
<p>of human rights in targeted States), usually translate into a severe impact on the population 
</p>
<p>at large, and in particular vulnerable groups in the society who become the true victims of 
</p>
<p>such sanction rather than the States or Governments they are supposed to target.17 In this 
</p>
<p>regard, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 8, on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, declared that the inhabitants of a given country do not forfeit basic 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 See Thomas Biersteker and Sue Eckert, &#8220;Addressing Challenges to Targeted Sanctions: An Update of 
</p>
<p>the &#8216;Watson Report&#8217;&#8221;, Watson Institute, Geneva, 2009, and Bardo, Fassbender, &#8220;Targeted Sanctions 
</p>
<p>and Due Process: The responsibility of the UN Security Council to ensure that fair and clear 
</p>
<p>procedures are made available to individuals and entities targeted with sanctions under Chapter VII of 
</p>
<p>the UN Charter&#8221;, study commissioned by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, Office of the 
</p>
<p>Legal Council. See also A/HRC/19/33, para. 27. 
</p>
<p> 15 See General Assembly resolutions 51/103, 52/120, 53/41, 54/172, 66/156, 67/170 and S-27/2, para. 
</p>
<p>30, and the World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), paras. 106 &#8211; 110; Subcommission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights resolution 2000/1; the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, para. 145; and Sub-
</p>
<p>Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities resolution 1997/35. 
</p>

<p>economic, social and cultural rights by virtue of any determination that their leaders have 
</p>
<p>violated norms of international peace and security.18 Although this comment seems to apply 
</p>
<p>to sanctions adopted by the Security Council, it applies equally to unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures. 
</p>
<p>16. Several human rights obligations of States incorporated into the various core 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments provide limitations on unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>that have an impact on the enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population in targeted 
</p>
<p>States. These include, inter alia, the right to life;19 the right to an adequate standard of 
</p>
<p>living, including food, clothing, housing and medical care;20 and the right to health.21 In this 
</p>
<p>regard, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action called upon States:  
</p>
<p>to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and 
</p>
<p>the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among 
</p>
<p>states and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments, in 
</p>
<p>particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and 
</p>
<p>well-being, including food and medical care, housing and the necessary social 
</p>
<p>services.22 
</p>
<p>17. Previous studies conducted at the request of the Subcommission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and by the Human Rights Council already documented the likely negative impact of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures on the civilian population of targeted and non-targeted States, 
</p>
<p>and included case studies documenting the impact of such measures. These studies clearly 
</p>
<p>indicated the likely and actual negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>civilian population, particularly on vulnerable groups, including women, children, the 
</p>
<p>infirm and older persons, as well as the poor, caused by the deprivation of access to basic 
</p>
<p>services, such as life-saving equipment and medication, food, educational equipment and 
</p>
<p>the loss of jobs. They also pointed out that long-term unilateral coercive measures have a 
</p>
<p>more severe negative impact on the economic, social and cultural rights of the affected 
</p>
<p>population enshrined in the core human rights instruments, such as the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights.23 
</p>
<p>18. In this regard, the presentations made during the workshops organized by OHCHR 
</p>
<p>in April 2013 and May 2014 highlighted some of the negative effects of both multilateral 
</p>
<p>and unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the civilian 
</p>
<p>population, particularly the disproportionate impact such measures have on women and 
</p>
<p>children. One of the panellists stressed that the impact of unilateral coercive measures was 
</p>
<p>more deeply felt by women and marginalized communities, and that women were the first 
</p>
<p>to lose jobs, to be moved out of higher education, suffer from malnourishment and face 
</p>
<p>food insecurity. He also gave specific relevant examples of the plight of women and 
</p>
<p>children in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Cuba.24 In several of the presentations made at

<p>the workshop held in May 2014, the negative impact of both multilateral and unilateral

<p>and persons with disabilities. Panellists cited examples of such impact in States such as 
</p>
<p>Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the former Yugoslavia, Haiti and Myanmar.25 
</p>
<p>19. Almost all the responses to the question regarding the impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures on the enjoyment of human rights underlined the fact that such measures often 
</p>
<p>had a negative impact on the civilian population of targeted and non-targeted States and, in 
</p>
<p>particular, on women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities. The examples 
</p>
<p>given by the respondents with regard to the human rights affected by unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures included the rights to life, food, health, work and education, as well as to the right 
</p>
<p>to development. They also pointed out that the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures on targeted States was compounded where such a State was, to a greater degree, 
</p>
<p>economically dependent on the State that imposed the measure. 
</p>
<p>20. In several studies and reports, attention was drawn to the difficulty of assessing the 
</p>
<p>impact of unilateral coercive measures, particularly those that are comprehensive in nature. 
</p>
<p>They recommended a more robust and independent mechanism to assess and monitor the 
</p>
<p>impact of such measures, including by promoting accountability in this regard.26 Some of 
</p>
<p>the reasons that give rise to this challenge are the restrictions on access to the target country 
</p>
<p>in which sanctions are imposed, and the difficulty to distinguish the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the affected population 
</p>
<p>when such measures are imposed in conjunction with multilateral sanctions. When 
</p>
<p>considering an appropriate mechanism for the assessment and monitoring of the negative 
</p>
<p>impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, it is hence 
</p>
<p>essential to establish a body that, as far as possible, may have access to targeted States in 
</p>
<p>which human rights are likely to be affected by such measures and with adequate expertise 
</p>
<p>to undertake such a task. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Case studies 
</b></p>
<p>21. To date, few case studies on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population in targeted or non-target States have 
</p>
<p>been available. The case studies below, which are well documented, serve to highlight 
</p>
<p>some of the main adverse effects of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights in target and non-targeted States. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Cuba 
</b></p>
<p>22. The economic sanctions on Cuba were initially imposed by the United States of 
</p>
<p>America in the 1960s, and were subsequently amended by the Cuban Democracy Act of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 See in particular the presentations made by Haifa Zangana, Dursun Peksen and Sarah Zaidi at the 
</p>
<p>workshop on the application of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the 
</p>
<p>affected population, in particular their socioeconomic impact on women and children in States 
</p>
<p>targeted, Geneva, 23 May 2014.

</i></p>
<p><i>and Current Policy</i>, 2nd ed. (Washington, D.C., Peterson Institute, 1990), pp. 32&#8211;33; and Richard 
</p>

<p>1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, as well as other legislative and executive acts. 
</p>
<p>These acts essentially impose an economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba.27 
</p>
<p>23. In the United States, Congress passed the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export 
</p>
<p>Enhancement Act in October 2000. The Act eased somewhat the enforcement of the 
</p>
<p>embargo and allowed the sale of agricultural goods and medicine to Cuba for humanitarian 
</p>
<p>reasons. From 2005 onwards, exports to Cuba were required to be on a cash-in-advance 
</p>
<p>basis, with full payment made before the products were shipped to Cuba; transactions had 
</p>
<p>to be made through banks in a third country. In 2009, the Government of the United States 
</p>
<p>eased the restrictions by allowing the Government of Cuba to pay for food and agricultural 
</p>
<p>products after the shipment was made.28 
</p>
<p>24. The embargo of the United States on medicines and technologies in Cuba has led to 
</p>
<p>limitations of the enjoyment of human rights by citizens in Cuba. Amnesty International 
</p>
<p>has shown, on the basis several fact-finding reports, that the embargo had contributed to 
</p>
<p>malnutrition that mainly affected women and children, poor water supply and lack of 
</p>
<p>medicine.29 The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights described the effect 
</p>
<p>of the embargo on Cuban people as &#8220;disastrous&#8221;.30 According to the American Association 
</p>
<p>for World Health, which conducted a detailed health survey in Cuba, the embargo on food 
</p>
<p>and the de facto embargo on medical supplies had wreaked havoc with the island&#8217;s model 
</p>
<p>primary health-care system.31 
</p>
<p>25. According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), Cuba is unable to 
</p>
<p>import nutritional products intended for children and for consumption in schools, hospitals 
</p>
<p>and day-care centres.32 In addition, food shortages are linked to a devastating outbreak of 
</p>
<p>neuropathy numbering in the tens of thousands. By one estimate, daily caloric intake 
</p>
<p>dropped by 33 per cent between 1989 and 1993.33 
</p>
<p>26. The embargo also restricts the State&#8217;s access to water treatment chemicals and spare 
</p>
<p>parts for the island&#8217;s water supply system. This has led to serious cutbacks in the supply of 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water, which in turn has become a factor in the rising incidence of morbidity 
</p>
<p>and mortality rates due to water-borne diseases. 
</p>
<p>27. Access to essential medicines and equipment has also been affected by the sanctions<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>Of the 1,297 medications still available in Cuba in 1991, physicians now have access to 
</p>
<p>only 889, and many only occasionally. Because most major new drugs are developed by 
</p>
<p>United States pharmaceutical companies, Cuban physicians have access to less than 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the new medicines available on the world market. Owing to the direct or indirect 
</p>
<p>effects of the embargo, the most routine medical supplies are in short supply or entirely 
</p>
<p>absent from some Cuban clinics.34 In the case of patients with psychiatric disorders,

<p>advanced drugs are also not available. The embargo imposed against Cuba not only affects 
</p>
<p>the supply of medicine. Health services depend on functioning water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, electricity and other equipment, such as X-ray equipment and refrigerators to 
</p>
<p>store vaccines. The embargo has also slowed down the renovation of hospitals, clinics and 
</p>
<p>care centres for older persons.35 
</p>
<p>28. According to the Government, the State is forced to pay above-market prices and 
</p>
<p>tariffs on goods purchased and shipped from distant markets, while the blockade imposes 
</p>
<p>difficult terms on credit and trade and blocks access to many goods and technologies. It is 
</p>
<p>estimated that the embargo on Cuba creates a virtual tax of 30 per cent on all imports.36 
</p>
<p><b> B. Zimbabwe 
</b></p>
<p>29. The European Union imposed sanctions on Zimbabwean leaders in 2002. The 
</p>
<p>sanctions include, inter alia, targeted sanctions in the form of a travel ban and asset freeze 
</p>
<p>on members of the Government and persons and entities associated with it. The motivation 
</p>
<p>of the sanctions had its origins in the agrarian reform begun by President Mugabe in 
</p>
<p>2000/01, which entailed the expropriation of land from white farmers, and which was 
</p>
<p>accompanied by a wave of political violence and the intimidation of the opposition.37 
</p>
<p>30. The country&#8217;s population of 13 million people has suffered from the sanctions. 
</p>
<p>Poverty and unemployment rates are high, while infrastructure is sorely lacking. Diseases 
</p>
<p>such as HIV/AIDS, typhoid and malaria give the country an average life expectancy of 
</p>
<p>between 53 to 55 years. The country is rich in minerals, but this has been translated into 
</p>
<p>neither sustainable economic growth nor prosperity for its people. 
</p>
<p>31. In a report published in 2010, UNICEF found that some 34 per cent of children 
</p>
<p>under 5 were underdeveloped, 2 per cent were stunted and 10 per cent underweight. 
</p>
<p>Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of orphaned children in the world (25 per cent of all 
</p>
<p>children), and experience of violence and abuse is widespread. At least 21 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>first sexual encounter experienced by girls is forced, and the perception that family violence 
</p>
<p>is acceptable is shared by both women and men (48 and 37 per cent, respectively). Corporal 
</p>
<p>punishment is legally administered. Two-thirds of children report experiencing such 
</p>
<p>punishment at school. The combination of poverty, neglect and violence contributes to the 
</p>
<p>large number of children on the move, resulting in unsafe migration and child 
</p>
<p>exploitation.38 
</p>
<p><b> C Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>32. Acting through the Security Council and regional or national authorities, the United 
</p>
<p>States of America, the States members of the European Union, Japan, the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, Canada, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and others have put in place a strong 
</p>
<p>interlocking matrix of sanctions and measures relating to the nuclear, missile, energy, 
</p>
<p>shipping, transportation and financial sectors of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

</p>

<p>33. According to a non-profit organization based in the United States, smart sanctions 
</p>
<p>imposed on the banking, gas and insurance sectors have wreaked havoc with the lives of 
</p>
<p>many Iranian citizens, as price hikes have led to the high cost of food (increases by 1,500 
</p>
<p>per cent in the period 2010&#8211;2012). Besides strengthening the black cash economy and 
</p>
<p>increasing criminalization, women&#8217;s access to higher education has decreased. Women are 
</p>
<p>being pushed out of the job market. Furthermore, the sanctions have triggered a collapse in 
</p>
<p>industry, skyrocketing inflation and massive unemployment. The country&#8217;s middle class 
</p>
<p>has disappeared, and even access to food and medicine has been compromised.39 
</p>
<p>34. Although the United States of America and the European Union claim that the 
</p>
<p>sanctions do not apply to humanitarian items, in actual fact they have deeply affected the 
</p>
<p>delivery and availability of medical supplies. The import of medicines containing 
</p>
<p>antibiotics (of types not produced inside the country) has decreased by 20.7 per cent, and 
</p>
<p>prices have increased by more than 300 per cent. The estimated 20,000 persons suffering 
</p>
<p>from thalassemia in the country receive only a few days of their monthly medicinal needs. 
</p>
<p>Survivors of chemical weapons used during the war with Iraq in the 1980s, in need of 
</p>
<p>medicine and equipment, including cornea transplants and inhalers, similarly suffer from a 
</p>
<p>shortage or lack of medical supplies. In general, the medicines used to treat haemophilia, 
</p>
<p>cancer, thalassemia, multiple sclerosis and kidney transplant and dialysis are not produced 
</p>
<p>domestically, and of those that are, most are not as effective as those imported from Europe 
</p>
<p>and North America. The shortage of medicine for such chronic diseases often leads to the 
</p>
<p>death of the patient. In addition, every year, 85,000 Iranians are diagnosed with some form 
</p>
<p>of cancer; the facilities for providing them with chemotherapy and radiotherapy are 
</p>
<p>however scant. While the financial sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic of Iran do 
</p>
<p>not, in principle, cover medicine and medical equipment, they make it almost impossible 
</p>
<p>for Iranian importers to finance the import of medical equipment and medicine. In 
</p>
<p>particular, depriving the country of SWIFT services has made international payments to 
</p>
<p>Western companies almost impossible. As a result, Western pharmaceutical companies &#8211; 
</p>
<p>often the sole producers of these medicines &#8211; have all but stopped exporting to the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran, and every year tens of thousands of patients die as a result. The economic 
</p>
<p>sanctions have therefore led to a deterioration in living conditions. Those living in poverty 
</p>
<p>and in marginalized areas suffer most from the effect of the sanctions.40 
</p>
<p>35. According to the UNICEF annual report of 2012, the mortality rate of children under 
</p>
<p>5 years of age dropped from 36 to 22.52 per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2010. 
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 20.3 out of 1,000 children die before their first birthday, and 15.29 during the 
</p>
<p>first month of life &#8211; statistics that highlight the need to improve neonatal health care. The 
</p>
<p>report also revealed that the average under-5 mortality rate in lower income regions is three 
</p>
<p>times that of higher income regions. 
</p>
<p>36. Owing to the imposition of both multilateral and unilateral sanctions on the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran, it is difficult to distinguish the specific impact that unilateral sanctions 
</p>
<p>have had on the enjoyment of the human rights by the civilian population. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p>37. While according to international law the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are 
</p>
<p>under Israeli occupation, the Government of Israel treats this area as a foreign entity, 
</p>
<p>submitting its inhabitants to a severe financial and economic blockade.

<p>of Sanctions on the Lives of Ordinary Iranians&#8221;, Brief 3, July 2012. 
</p>

<p>38. During the 52 days of fighting in July and August 2014, Israeli bombs destroyed or 
</p>
<p>severely damaged more than 53,000 houses in the Gaza Strip. The ongoing blockade 
</p>
<p>violates the social, economic and cultural rights of the people suffering from the unilateral 
</p>
<p>sanctions. Undernourishment is rampant, especially among children. Tens of thousands of 
</p>
<p>families live in the ruins of their houses or in unheated containers furnished by the local 
</p>
<p>authorities. In December 2014, the death from cold of a number of children under the age 
</p>
<p>of 10 was reported to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees 
</p>
<p>in the Near East. 
</p>
<p>39. According to numerous reports of the United Nations and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, the lack of clean drinking water in the Gaza Strip has caused kidney disease 
</p>
<p>to spread, affecting severely the health of hundreds of thousands of people. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Impact of unilateral coercive measures on third States: the case of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>40. More recently, unilateral sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran, which have been 
</p>
<p>revised and enforced over time, have negatively affected non-targeted neighbouring States, 
</p>
<p>such as Pakistan, by blocking a gas pipeline project critical for Pakistan to overcome its 
</p>
<p>grave energy crisis.41 Industrial development in Pakistan has in fact been depressed since 
</p>
<p>industries highly dependent on electricity and gas began to face supply shortfalls. The result 
</p>
<p>has been a rising unemployment rate in a predominantly young population, with severe 
</p>
<p>consequences for the economy and society, and most importantly the individuals affected. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, endemic load-shedding across the country lasting up to 18 hours daily has led to 
</p>
<p>violence in the form of frequent energy riots.42 The energy crisis is thus hindering the 
</p>
<p>progressive realization of the socioeconomic rights of the citizens of Pakistan in addition to 
</p>
<p>compromising their rights to security of life and property. 
</p>
<p>41. To meet its energy shortages, the Government of Pakistan signed a multi-billion 
</p>
<p>dollar agreement for the supply of 750 million cubic feet of gas per day, extendable to one 
</p>
<p>billion cubic feet gas per day, through a pipeline from the Islamic Republic of Iran.43 This 
</p>
<p>would ease the gas deficit in the country to a reasonable level and help to curb rising 
</p>
<p>inflation. The gas pipeline project, however, came to a halt as a direct consequence of the 
</p>
<p>unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States of America on the Islamic Republic of 
</p>
<p>Iran.44 Failure to complete the project within the stipulated time frame would make Pakistan 
</p>
<p>liable for $3 million a day in penalties. Significantly, a State already burdened with 
</p>
<p>international and local loans could hardly afford such additional financial burdens. 
</p>
<p>42. Failure to complete the project would clearly have an adverse impact on the human 
</p>
<p>rights of citizens of Pakistan, including, inter alia, their rights to life, food, health, 
</p>
<p>development, education and employment, as well as national socioeconomic growth. These

<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Potential mechanisms to assess the negative impact of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures and to promote accountability 
</b></p>
<p>43. In exploring the mechanisms that can be used to assess the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures and/or to mitigate their adverse impact on human rights, it is 
</p>
<p>essential to point out from the outset that the possible mechanisms considered in the present 
</p>
<p>study would, for obvious reasons, be focused on the relevant human rights bodies because 
</p>
<p>of their greater and more specialized expertise in human rights. The human rights bodies 
</p>
<p>were specifically established with the aim of promoting and protecting all human rights, as 
</p>
<p>well to ensure that human rights obligations incorporated into international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments and those assumed by States are respected. 
</p>
<p>44. Accordingly, non-human rights oriented bodies, such as the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization, are excluded from the scope of the present study since their mandate is not 
</p>
<p>directly related to the promotion of human rights.45 The General Assembly and the Security 
</p>
<p>Council may be considered potential mechanisms for this purpose given that they have 
</p>
<p>frequently dealt with the potential impact of sanctions on human rights, including unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures. However, neither body seems to be an appropriate mechanism, since 
</p>
<p>they are more political and their experience to date reflects difficulties in balancing 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures with human rights.46 
</p>
<p>45. In general, United Nations human rights bodies may be categorized into two broad 
</p>
<p>types: treaty-based bodies, on the one hand, and their Charter-based counterparts, on the 
</p>
<p>other. The relevant treaty-based bodies include the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human Rights Committee.47 The Charter-
</p>
<p>based bodies include the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms and procedures, such 
</p>
<p>as the universal periodic review mechanism, the complaint procedure and the special 
</p>
<p>procedures. 
</p>
<p>46. Owing to the multiplicity of treaty-based and Charter-based human rights bodies and 
</p>
<p>their different characteristics and mandates, it would be necessary to examine further some 
</p>
<p>of the main considerations, challenges and opportunities that may be taken into account in 
</p>
<p>identifying the most suitable candidate to take on the role of assessing the adverse impact of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and to promote 
</p>
<p>accountability in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenge of territorially and jurisdictionally limited obligations 
</b></p>
<p>47. Given that unilateral coercive measures are imposed by one State on another or 
</p>
<p>against persons of another State, one issue that arises is whether treaty-based bodies would 
</p>

</p>

<p>be suitable as a mechanism of choice for assessing and/or promoting accountability with 
</p>
<p>regard to unilateral coercive measures that adversely affect the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Generally, the obligations assumed by State parties to almost all human rights treaties are 
</p>
<p>framed in a rather narrow manner; for instance, State parties to the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights undertake to ensure the enjoyment of all rights contained in 
</p>
<p>the Covenant for all individuals and peoples within their territories or subject to their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction (art. 2). Articles 2 to 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination limit the obligations of State parties in a similarly narrow 
</p>
<p>territorial and jurisdictional manner. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (art. 2) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 
</p>
<p>2) follow the same pattern. Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights describes the obligations assumed by State parties in a more or less similar 
</p>
<p>fashion, with the exception that the obligations to ensure the enjoyment of human rights by 
</p>
<p>individuals within the territory of a State subject to its jurisdiction is modified by the 
</p>
<p>obligation of the relevant States parties to engage in &#8220;international assistance and 
</p>
<p>cooperation&#8221; towards the achievement of that goal. Whether or not a State is legally (as 
</p>
<p>opposed to morally) obliged to help to ensure the enjoyment of socioeconomic and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights in another State is, however, still a subject of controversy.48 
</p>
<p>48. The foregoing discussion tends to suggest that the territorial and jurisdictional 
</p>
<p>mandates conferred to treaty-based bodies within their respective treaties is framed quite 
</p>
<p>narrowly and does not seem to extend to victims of the adverse impact of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures who usually do not reside within the territory or are subject to the 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the State imposing the measures challenged. This begs the question as to 
</p>
<p>how such treaty-based bodies could procedurally entertain petitions of individuals or groups 
</p>
<p>who claim to have been victim of human rights violations when such persons are outside 
</p>
<p>the territory or jurisdiction of the State against which they are bringing the complaint. It 
</p>
<p>may be argued, however, that the obligations of State parties to ensure the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights by all individuals and peoples within their territory or those subject to their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction could be read more flexibly in order to accommodate the ability of the relevant 
</p>
<p>treaty-based bodies to entertain claims lodged against State parties by persons outside the 
</p>
<p>territory of such States or normally regarded as being outside their jurisdiction.49 In this 
</p>
<p>instance, the phrase &#8220;within its jurisdiction&#8221;, found in almost all of the treaties, may be 
</p>
<p>interpreted to include any person against whom the State has taken measures, including 
</p>
<p>unilateral measures, that may affect their human rights. Even such interpretive manoeuver 
</p>
<p>is, however, subject to significant controversy.50 
</p>
<p>49. It should be noted, however, that a treaty body may require State parties to include 
</p>
<p>in their periodic State reports information on how unilateral coercive measures that they 
</p>
<p>have taken may have violated the human rights of persons who are outside their territory or 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, or on measures, if any, taken to assess or mitigate such adverse effects. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, past experience has shown that treaty bodies have an indirect way of exercising 
</p>
<p>their jurisdiction through the adoption of general comments. Even then, the issue of the 
</p>
<p>territorial and jurisdictional limits of treaty bodies may pose a challenge. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 48 With regard to the debate on the ways and means of ensuring the enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>development, see Obiora Chinedu Okafor, &#8220;A regional perspective: article 22 of the African Charter 
</p>
<p>on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights&#8221; in <i>Realizing the Right to Development: Essays in Commemoration of 
</i></p>
<p><i>25 Years of the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development</i> (Geneva and New York, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, 2013), p. 373. 
</p>
<p> 49 See Hugh M. Kindred et al, <i>International Law: Chiefly as Interpreted and Applied in Canada</i>, 7th 
</p>
<p>edition (Toronto, Emond Montgomery, 2006), pp. 431 and 547. 
</p>

<p>50. What the above discussion shows is that, in the process of identifying appropriate 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to assess and/or to promote accountability to mitigate the effects of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, efforts should, at a minimum, be 
</p>
<p>made to avoid, or at least to minimize, any potential controversy regarding the limits of the 
</p>
<p>territorial and jurisdictional mandate of the treaty bodies. One obvious way of doing this 
</p>
<p>would be to eschew the treaty bodies as the mechanism of choice for the task. 
</p>
<p>51. This would lead to the consideration of the Charter-based bodies as the more 
</p>
<p>preferable mechanisms of choice to undertake the assessment and/or to promote 
</p>
<p>accountability to mitigate the adverse impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, since the mandates of these bodies are formulated in a more 
</p>
<p>flexible manner. This stems from the fact that the Charter of the United Nations, the source 
</p>
<p>from which the Charter-based bodies ultimately derive their mandates, calls for all States 
</p>
<p>Members to pledge to take joint and separate action to achieve universal respect for, and 
</p>
<p>observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction to race, 
</p>
<p>sex, language and religion (Arts. 55 and 56). The language used is clearly more flexible and 
</p>
<p>better avoids potential controversy with regard to jurisdiction, which could be used to 
</p>
<p>distract and even impede the assessment of unilateral coercive measures and their impact on 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The accountability imperative 
</b></p>
<p>52. The fact that States that impose unilateral coercive measures with an impact on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights of the civilian population of targeted or non-targeted States 
</p>
<p>ought to be accountable in some way for their actions is a matter beyond debate. Indeed, the 
</p>
<p>entire human rights system would be much weaker were accountability of one kind or 
</p>
<p>another not one of its main goals, without which the entire human rights system would lose 
</p>
<p>its rationale. For instance, in the area of addressing poverty reduction and the right to 
</p>
<p>development, which has historically witnessed one of the largest accountability gaps in the 
</p>
<p>broader field of human rights, the creation of institutions that ensure accountability has 
</p>
<p>been deemed imperative. Indeed, the key documents that will shape the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda have called for development efforts to be driven and shaped by 
</p>
<p>building &#8220;accountable institutions for all,&#8221;51 and further emphasized the need to establish &#8220;a 
</p>
<p>participatory monitoring framework for tracking progress&#8221; and &#8220;mutual accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for all stakeholders&#8221;.52 According to a working paper prepared for the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, the full array of legal remedies should be available for 
</p>
<p>victims of sanctions regimes at any point for the violation of international law, notably 
</p>
<p>national courts, international or regional human rights bodies and the International Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice.53 
</p>
<p>53. All United Nations human rights bodies, be they treaty-based or Charter-based, 
</p>
<p>suffer to a similar degree from a lack of a supranational authority that can enforce their 
</p>
<p>demands on States that have allegedly violated their human rights obligations.54 All of these 
</p>
<p>bodies exact accountability in a similarly &#8220;softer way&#8221;, primarily through a slower, more 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 51 See United Nations, A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies  
</p>

</p>
<p>  Post-2015 Development Agenda (New York, 2013).

<p>consensual process of socialization, and sometimes, ostracization.55 Rarely is a State 
</p>
<p>punished for its human rights violations in the way that violations are sanctioned in the 
</p>
<p>domestic legal system.56 
</p>
<p>54. Although the choice between a Charter-based or treaty-based mechanism is not 
</p>
<p>clear-cut when considering accountability for unilateral coercive measures that have an 
</p>
<p>adverse impact on the enjoyment of human rights, the universal periodic review may be 
</p>
<p>better suited to ensuring accountability at the global level since it targets each and every 
</p>
<p>State Member of the United Nations throughout each four-year cycle. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to independent evidence 
</b></p>
<p>55. Another important consideration when selecting the best-suited mechanisms for the 
</p>
<p>assessment and/or mitigation of the adverse effects of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights is the extent to which that body would have access to robust or 
</p>
<p>direct independent evidence. The special procedures of the Human Rights Council do in 
</p>
<p>fact enjoy such an advantage over other mechanisms, since they are often able to undertake 
</p>
<p>on-site visits to the relevant States and territories. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Consideration of financial and administrative efficiency 
</b></p>
<p>56. The United Nations system is currently striving to be as financially and 
</p>
<p>administratively efficient and cost-effective as possible without significantly cutting down 
</p>
<p>its relevant programmes. This consideration suggests that a multiplicity of mechanisms to 
</p>
<p>take on the task of assessing and promoting accountability for the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures should be avoided. A single Charter-based or treaty-based 
</p>
<p>body ought therefore to be considered the mechanism of choice for the task at hand. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Need to secure the most appropriate expertise 
</b></p>
<p>57. Given the fact that unilateral coercive measures of a comprehensive nature are more 
</p>
<p>likely to have an adverse impact on the enjoyment of economic and social rights, especially 
</p>
<p>in relation to women, children and other vulnerable groups in targeted States (also 
</p>
<p>emphasized by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 24/14), the mechanism of choice 
</p>
<p>may need to be a body or a person with the requisite expertise in the area of economic and 
</p>
<p>social rights. In the context of treaty-based bodies, this would point to three specific bodies 
</p>
<p>that could perform the task jointly, namely, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Financial and administrative considerations 
</p>
<p>might, however, militate against this more cumbersome route, where multiple mechanisms 
</p>
<p>would be involved in looking at the adverse impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
</p>
<p>human rights. This would once again suggest a Charter-based option, such as the 
</p>
<p>appointment of a special procedure by the Human Rights Council. The selection process of 
</p>
<p>the appropriate mandate holder would moreover provide the Council with more flexibility 
</p>
<p>when identifying the person it considers best suited for the position, with adequate expertise 
</p>
<p>in the areas identified.

<p><b> F. Minimizing politicization 
</b></p>
<p>58. The issue of the imposition of unilateral coercive measures is directly tied to global 
</p>
<p>politics and the challenge that is posed to the multilateral ideal by the actions of many 
</p>
<p>States.57 For the mechanism eventually selected to perform the task to gain the most popular 
</p>
<p>legitimacy and effectiveness, preference should be given to one that has the potential to 
</p>
<p>minimize the politicization of the issue. With a few exceptions, both treaty-based and 
</p>
<p>Charter-based bodies are designed to be as non-political as possible and therefore do not 
</p>
<p>enjoy any specific advantage in this respect. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Concluding remarks and recommended actions 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The fact that unilateral coercive measures are likely to have a negative impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the enjoyment of human rights by the civilian population of targeted and, in some 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases, non-targeted States does not seem to be a matter of controversy. However, 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessing the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the human rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian population, and more particularly, on vulnerable groups, such as women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>children, would require on-site visits to the States affected by such measures to verify, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in an independent manner, the actual effects of such measures on the different 
</b></p>
<p><b>segments of the population. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> One obvious conclusion of the discussions above is that this function should 
</b></p>
<p><b>squarely rest on one of the relevant human rights mechanisms, namely, either a 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty-based or a Charter-based mechanism. The challenge faced by treaty-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies in discharging this function is the narrow territorial and jurisdictional manner 
</b></p>
<p><b>in which the obligations of States are framed in the relevant treaties. For this reason, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Charter-based bodies, which tend to have a more flexible mandate, are to be preferred 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the task. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> Almost all of the factors considered for selecting the most appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism for the assessment of the adverse effect of unilateral coercive measures on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the enjoyment of human rights seem to lead to the conclusion that a special procedure 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be established to undertake the task. The need for the selected mechanism to 
</b></p>
<p><b>have as much direct access as possible to robust and independent evidence, to align 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the United Nations administrative and financial efficiency goals, and to have a 
</b></p>
<p><b>great degree of flexibility to select and deploy the most appropriate technical expertise 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the area would indeed tend to point to the creation of a special procedures mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> Almost all of the stakeholders who responded to the questionnaire were also of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the view that the most appropriate mechanism for assessing the negative impact of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights should be a special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure mandate, although some stated that the establishment of a world court on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights might be more appropriate. The European Union did not consider the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council to be the appropriate forum for addressing the issue.

</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, the most appropriate

<p><b>means to hold States to account would seem to be the use of the universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review mechanism and for the relevant treaty-based bodies to require Member States 
</b></p>
<p><b>to address the issue in their periodic reports so as to raise public awareness to 
</b></p>
<p><b>pressure States to prevent or, at least, to mitigate the impact of such measures on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of human rights. There may also be a need for the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>to consider developing specific rules, procedures and guidelines to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency and more accountability if and when States employ unilateral coercive 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures that are likely to have a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>in targeted or non-targeted States. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> In this regard, the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-seventh session, in fact 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted resolution 27/21, in which it created, for a period of three years, a new 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate of Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the enjoyment of human rights, thus corroborating the findings of the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>study. The Special Rapporteur has a mandate: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To gather all information, wherever it may occur, including from 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments, non-government organizations and any other parties, relating to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To study trends, development and challenges in relation to the negative 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>guidelines and recommendations on ways and means to prevent, minimize and redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>the adverse impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To make an overall review of independent mechanisms to assess 
</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures to promote accountability; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To contribute to strengthening the capacity of OHCHR to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected countries with technical assistance and advisory services to prevent, minimize 
</b></p>
<p><b>and redress the adverse impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> In discharging the mandate, the Council also requested the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) to draw the attention of the Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner to 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations and cases regarding the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the full enjoyment of human rights; and (b) to cooperate with other relevant United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations bodies, including the High Commissioner, human rights treaty bodies, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>special procedures and mechanisms, specialized agencies, fund and programmes, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional intergovernmental organizations and their mechanisms, with the aim to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent, minimize and redress the adverse impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights. </b></p>


<p>66.<b> The specific mandates and tasks assigned to the Special Rapporteur by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council in resolution 27/21 are consistent with what has already been 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommended by the Advisory Committee in its progress report, and should therefore 
</b></p>
<p><b>be commended. It is now important to ensure that all relevant United Nations human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights treaty bodies and subsidiary organs of the Council mainstream the issue of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>perform specific monitoring activities, such as during the review of periodic reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>submitted by States to such bodies and under the universal periodic review, and draw 
</b></p>
<p><b>the attention of the Special Rapporteur to any potential or actual violation of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights that may occur as a result of the application of unilateral coercive measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Furthermore, it would also be necessary to develop quantitative and qualitative 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators that would allow a comparison between the situation of human rights in 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted and non-targeted States prior to and during the imposition of unilateral 
</b></p>
<p><b>coercive measures.</b>
