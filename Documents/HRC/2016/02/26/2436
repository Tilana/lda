<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Rural women are women residing and/or working in predominantly agricultural, 
coastal and forest areas. This definition includes women engaged in paid or unpaid work, in 
regular or seasonal activities, on or off the farm, in food preparation, in the management of 
the household, in childcare or other activities, in home-based and natural resources-based 
industries.<footnote name="1">08 Submission by IOM. </footnote> The study on discrimination in the context of the right to food (A/HRC/16/40) 
identified rural women as a group suffering from discrimination. It found that: 
</p>
<p> The intersection between women&#8217;s rights and the right to food provides a rich 
overview of a number of interrelated dimensions of discrimination against women 
related to access to land, property and markets, which are inextricably linked to 
access to education, employment, health care and political participation. On a global 
scale, although women cultivate more than 50 per cent of all food grown, they 
account for 70 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry and are disproportionately affected by 
malnutrition, poverty and food insecurity. Governments are not living up to their 
international commitments to protect women from discrimination, as the gap 
between de jure equality and de facto discrimination continues to persist and resist 
change (para. 29). 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 16/27 of 25 March 2011, requested the 
Advisory Committee to undertake a comprehensive study on the right to food of rural 
women, including patterns of discrimination, strategies and policies for their legal 
protection and best practices, with a special focus on female-headed households and 
temporary and seasonal workers. 
</p>
<p>3. In its recommendation 7/4 of 12 August 2011, the Advisory Committee assigned the 
preparation of the study on rural women and the right to food to the drafting group on the 
right to food comprising Jos&#233; Bengoa Cabello, Chinsung Chung, Latif H&#252;seynov, Jean 
Ziegler (until August 2012) and Mona Zulficar.<footnote name="2">0 K. Crenshaw, &#8220;Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: A black feminist critique of 
 </footnote> At the eighth session of the Committee, 
the drafting group presented a concept note for the study. As requested by the Council in its 
resolution 19/7 of 22 March 2012, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on 
Human Rights collected the views and comments of all Member States, all relevant United 
Nations agencies and programmes, in particular Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO), and all other relevant stakeholders, so that the Advisory Committee 
could take them into account in the preparation of the preliminary study. 
</p>
<p>4. Views and comments on the concept note were received from the following States: 
Belgium, Colombia, Cuba, Greece, Indonesia, Namibia, Qatar, Paraguay and the 
Philippines; national human rights institutions (the National Human Rights Commission of 
India and the National Centre for Human Rights Jordan); NGOs such as Caritas 
Internationalis, the Comisi&#243;n Colombiana de Justicia, the International Federation for 
Human Rights, and the Mouvement mondial des m&#232;res. Submissions were also received 
from the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). 
</p>
<p>  
 1 This definition is based upon the submission by the Philippines of 24 May 2012. 
 2 The drafting group on the right to food would like to thank Ioana Cismas and Ivona Truscan from the 
</p>
<p>Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights for their important 
contribution during the drafting of the present study. </p>


<p>5. The drafting group took these contributions into account in the preparation of the 
preliminary study, which it presented during the ninth session of the Advisory Committee. 
The oral comments of various stakeholders and the fruitful discussions among the members 
of the Committee further shaped the study and made possible its conclusion in the present 
form. 
</p>
<p>6. The study examines the international legal framework protecting the right to food of 
rural women, followed by the identification of patterns of discrimination that impede rural 
women&#8217;s full enjoyment of this right. Strategies and policies to address the identified forms 
of discrimination are discussed, and several good practices are highlighted. The study 
provides a special focus on female-headed households and temporary and seasonal workers. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The international legal framework applicable to rural women 
</b></p>
<p>7. Any analysis on the enjoyment of the right to food of rural women must start with 
the acknowledgement of the principles of universality and interdependence of human 
rights. In addition to this legal imperative, empirical evidence shows that the realization of 
the right to food of rural women is intrinsically linked to a number of other human rights. 
Among these are the rights to education (including vocational training), to health care, to 
water and sanitation, to housing, to decent work, to property and to resources and 
technology for food production, to credit and other financial services, to economic and 
social benefits and protection (including protection in case of disasters), to information 
access to justice, political representation and participation and indeed the general 
prohibition on non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>8. A key instrument in the analysis of the right to food of rural women is the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). In its article 11  
the Covenant provides explicit recognition of the right to food under its two dimensions: 
the right to adequate food as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living 
(para.<footnote name="1">9  See CERD, general recommendation No. 25; A/55/18, annex V; CEDAW, General Recommendation 
No. 18; Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, 1995, http://www.un.org/womenwatch 
/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf and in the Outcome Document of the twenty-third special session 
of the General Assembly &#8220;Women 2000: Gender, Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-
First Century&#8221;. 
</footnote>), and the right to be free from hunger (para. 2). Additionally, in the framework of 
international cooperation to achieve freedom from hunger, States need to adopt measures to 
improve not only the methods of production, conservation, distribution of food and 
reforming the agrarian systems, but also to ensure the equitable distribution of world food 
supplies in relation to need.  
</p>
<p>9. The protection of the right to food is reinforced by article 2 of the Covenant which 
provides for the prohibition of discrimination, including on the ground of sex, and for the 
equal enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant by women and men. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights articulated in its general comment No. 
12 that the measures adopted by Governments have to reflect a particular attention to the 
need to prevent discrimination in access to food or resources for food.3 In the words of the 
Committee, States need to ensure &#8220;guarantees of full and equal access to economic, 
resources, particularly for women, including the right to inheritance and the ownership of 
the land and other property, credit, natural resources and appropriate technology; measures 
to respect and protect self-employment and work which provides a remuneration ensuring a 
decent living for wage earners and their families [&#8230;]; maintaining registries on rights in 
land (including forests)&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>10. The right to food requires that women have physical and economic access at all 
times to adequate food or means for its procurement.5 All resources to ensure food, 
including water, firewood, or livestock, need to be physically accessible for rural women. 
They also need to dispose of economic accessibility, individually and at household level. 
This means that rural women need to have the means for the acquisition of food through 
purchase, inheritance, production or work. Thus, they should be able to have access to 
income-generating sources, such as employment that ensure decent wages for decent living, 
credit or loans, property and inheritance rights; access to production services, such as land, 
tools, technology, seeds, or production certificates; and access to produced goods and their 
markets. 
</p>
<p>11. Specific State obligations in relation to the right to food exist at three levels. First, 
the obligation to<i> respect</i> requires States not to take actions that would impair the access to 
food of women, either by &#8220;arbitrarily taking away people&#8217;s right to food or by making it 
</p>
<p>difficult for them to gain access to food&#8221;.6 All exclusions or restrictions based on gender 
suffered by rural women in their access to resources for ensuring their right to food 
constitute violations of this obligation. Second, the obligation to <i>protect</i> requires State 
actions that prevent private actors from depriving women of their access to food.7 By 
allowing practices within families that prevent rural women from accessing resources, 
States are failing to protect their right to food. Third, the obligation to <i>fulfil </i>has two 
dimensions. The obligation to <i>facilitate </i>means that States have to take positive actions to 
strengthen women&#8217;s access to and utilization of resources and to other means of ensuring 
their livelihood.8 The absence of legislation ensuring property and inheritance rights for 
women and the lack of services such as employment or credit underlines the failure of 
States to comply with their obligation to facilitate. In situations where women are unable to 
realize their right to food for reasons beyond their control, States are under the obligation to 
<i>provide </i>food directly.9 
</p>
<p>12. A second key instrument for the legal protection of the right to food of rural women 
is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW). Article 14 emphasizes the prohibition of discrimination against women in rural 
areas and the equal enjoyment by women and men alike of the right to participate and 
benefit from rural development. It contains a list of specific rights upon which the 
livelihood of rural women is strongly dependent and that shall be ensured by States: 
</p>
<p>(a) To participate in the elaboration and implementation of development 
planning at all levels; 
</p>
<p>(b) To have access to adequate health care facilities, including information, 
counselling and services in family planning; 
</p>
<p>(c) To benefit directly from social security programmes; 
</p>
<p>(d) To obtain all types of training and education, formal and non-formal, 
including that relating to functional literacy, as well as, inter alia, the benefit of all 
community and extension services, in order to increase their technical proficiency; 
</p>
<p>(e) To organize self-help groups and co-operatives in order to obtain equal 
access to economic opportunities through employment or self employment;

</p>
<p>(g) To have access to agricultural credit and loans, marketing facilities,

resettlement schemes; 
</p>
<p>(h) To enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to housing, 
sanitation, electricity and water supply, transport and communications (art.<footnote name="1">0 CEDAW, arts. 2 (f) and 5 (b).

 14 CRC, art. 24, para. 2 (c). 
 15 Ibid., art. 27, para. 3. </footnote>4, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>13. The Convention entails further State obligations that are of great relevance for the 
condition of rural women. As such, States must take all necessary steps to modify and 
abolish discriminatory laws, customs and practices, as well as change skewed, bigoted and 
stereotypical gender roles.<footnote name="1">6. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), States are bound to take 
measures to combat disease and malnutrition, including in the framework of primary 
healthcare and through the provision of adequate nutritious food and clean drinking water.14 
The provisions of CRC may carry great significance for female-headed household and 
seasonal workers. For instance, the Convention requires States to assist parents and others 
responsible for the care of the child, and in case of need, to provide material assistance and 
support programmes, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing.15 The right 
to education the cornerstone of human and economic development of girl children is 
devoted particular protection in article 28. 
</footnote>0 
</p>
<p>14. The change of gender relations in the public sphere needs to be complemented by 
efforts in the private sphere. The Convention stresses that the legal capacity of women is 
identical to that of men and prescribes the right of women to conclude contracts and 
administer property, not least during marriage.11 As such, States have an obligation to 
ensure the same rights for both spouses in respect to ownership, acquisition, management, 
administration, enjoyment and disposition of property.12 Other international instruments 
reinforce these provisions. Article 23, paragraph 4, of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides for States&#8217; obligation to take steps to ensure equality 
of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its 
dissolution, and article 5(e) (vi) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) provides for women&#8217;s right to inherit. Moreover, 
in the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries 
and Forests in the Context of National Food Security adopted in May 2012 by the 
Committee on World Food Security, States undertook to &#8220;remove and prohibit all forms of 
discrimination related to tenure rights, including those resulting from change of marital 
status, lack of legal capacity, and lack of access to economic resources&#8221; (para. 4.6). 
</p>
<p>15. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) provides for the 
equal access of persons with disabilities, in particular women and children with disabilities 
and older persons with disabilities, to social protection programs and poverty reduction 
programs.13 Of relevance is also article 25(c), which stipulates that health-care services 
need to be located as close as possible to people&#8217;s own communities, including in rural 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>

<p>17. The Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(CMW) provides entitlements for rural women to access education and vocation training as 
well as protection against the use of misleading information related to migration, 
trafficking, or unfavourable conditions of employment and remuneration. 
</p>
<p>18. Not least, the protection framework applicable to rural women comprises a series of 
equality provisions to be found in Conventions of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO). Of these, the two fundamental ILO Conventions, those on Equal Remuneration (No. 
110) and on Discrimination (No. 111) should be mentioned here. 
</p>
<p>19. The integration of these identified human rights safeguards into comprehensive 
legislative and policy instruments is necessary in order to achieve the full realization of the 
right to food of rural women. States may find guidance in the updated version of the United 
Nations Comprehensive Framework for Action to draw up food and nutrition security 
policies.16 Certainly, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and in particular those 
aiming at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, promoting universal education, gender 
equality and women empowerment, at reducing child mortality and improving maternal 
health, may result in better livelihoods for rural women. States should nonetheless be 
mindful that following such initiatives does not relieve them from the obligations 
undertaken under human rights treaties. Voluntary schemes may be seen as temporary 
benchmarks on the path towards the compulsory full realization of the right to food of every 
human being, including rural women. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Patterns of discrimination against rural women 
</b></p>
<p>20. A human rights approach requires the identification of vulnerable groups. The same 
human rights approach, however, recognizes that vulnerability is not a given attribute 
explainable by the sex of a person, but that vulnerability is a social construct.17 More often 
than not, patterns of discrimination, de jure and de facto, stemming either from the action or 
inaction of the State or the family, are responsible for this vulnerability. The established 
fact that women across the world, and especially in Africa, Asia and South America, are 
more likely to go hungry than men finds its roots in patterns of discrimination.18 
</p>
<p>21. A number of treaty bodies and United Nations initiatives have joined the pioneer 
academics who have long advocated the need to take an intersectional approach to 
discrimination.19 Kimberle Crenshow&#8217;s work has exposed the &#8220;single-axis framework&#8221; that 
has been dominant in anti-discrimination law, which in her example, blinded the analysis, 
since it excluded black women&#8217;s experiences not as women, or as black people, but as black 
women.20 There is an increasing recognition today of the importance of addressing

<p>discrimination based on gender, race, socio-economic position, disability, age, not 
separately, but as a compound of any such two or more characteristics.21 
</p>
<p>22. The topic of the report compels the adoption of an intersectional approach since it 
involves two categories (rural&#8211;urban) and gender; combined, these categories reveal 
experiences that are not necessarily shared by urban women, or by men in rural areas, but 
are discriminatory experiences specific to rural women. Moreover, the discrimination 
against the two particular groups on which the report focuses, i.e. female-headed 
households and temporary seasonal workers, can be fully grasped only in an intersectional 
framework. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Access, control and ownership of land and water resources by rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>women 
</b></p>
<p>23. Based on an international comparison of census data, a 2010 report estimates that at 
global level less than 20 per cent of land is owned by women.22 In North Africa and West 
Asia fewer than 5 per cent of land-holders are women, while the figure for Sub-Saharan 
Africa reaches a meager 15 per cent.23 An estimation cited by UN-Women puts the 
ownership of property by women worldwide less than 2 per cent of all property.24 The 
access, control and ownership of land and water resources by rural women are influenced 
by a number of factors, some related to the specificities of rurality, others affecting women 
more broadly. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Nature of the rights recognized to women in respect of land 
</b></p>
<p>24. Concern arises in cases where women have access to land and resources based not 
on property or ownership rights, but on user rights, while control rests with the senior men 
in the community. In the absence of relevant assets, women may also lack decision-making 
powers in the household and the community.25 As a direct consequence, women also own 
fewer and smaller animals. Women have the care of the animals and of the trade of the 
resulting products, while the decisions on the income and expenses belong to the male-head 
of household.26 The lack of land-ownership rights also impacts the possibility of women to 
access credit. With no stable income, women have difficulties in nourishing their children.27 
</p>
<p>25. Certain customs recognize women&#8217;s ownership rights but only in community with 
the male head of household, with his approval, or signature. For instance, in Indonesia, 
although land is co-owned by spouses, it is often registered only on the name of the male 
head of the household. This situation is mainly due to the fact that authorities and

examining the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination&#8221;.

<p>communities do not adequately involve women in the land-registration process Moreover, 
often women lack information concerning the options for land registration.28  
</p>
<p>26. Even in cases where women can register land in their name, the enjoyment of the 
property rights may be set back by the lack of alignment of the marriage legislation with the 
norms on land registration. Under certain customs, land is not transferrable from one village 
to another. As a consequence, women who marry men from other villages than their own 
may have to relinquish their lot of land or pay a fine.29 In addition to the proof of 
registration of the land, ownership is also tested against conclusive evidence. This test 
frustrates women&#8217;s exercise of ownership rights because, despite the formal recognition, the 
decision-making and control of land usually rests with the man head of household.30 
Although titling individualizes the right to land, it also has the negative effect of excluding 
those rural residents who previously had user land rights through customary law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Structure of communities and formal law in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>27. Rural areas are perceived as spaces with a low density of population separated by 
distance from urbanized areas, and endowed with social traditions and cultures.31 As holders 
and users of traditions and customs, rural residents may be more inclined to enforce these 
customs prior to formal law. Even in cases where domestic legislation provides for 
women&#8217;s rights, the prevalence of certain customs may weaken the enjoyment of those 
</p>
<p>rights.32  
</p>
<p>28. The World Bank&#8217;s <i>Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook</i> points out that formal law has 
a weaker enforcement power than customs and traditions in rural areas.33 The perception is 
that formal law answers predominantly to urban problems and provides for urban 
solutions.34 The predominance of local sources of authority has consequences on the 
realization of women&#8217;s rights in rural areas in the sense that it may deprive women of the 
capacity to claim their rights and to challenge those sources of authority.35 As custom is a 
specificity of the rural environment, abolishing customs may not necessarily result in an 
enhanced cohabitation of gender equality with cultural traditions.36 The economic 
empowerment of women may only happen through a change in the gender relations at all 
levels and institutions, including the household and, importantly, with the active 
participation and representation of women.37 Therefore, the provision of information to 
women about their right to food and concerning their right to access courts to challenge 
discrimination is of paramount importance.

<p><b> 3. Structure of the household and power relations 
</b></p>
<p>29. The analysis of the access to resources by rural women needs to take into 
consideration the composition of the household, whether nuclear or joint family systems (as 
in the case of polygamous or extended households) and the power relations within. 
</p>
<p>30. Skewed gender roles tend to favour the traditional supremacy of the husband in rural 
households. At the level of the household, such patriarchal valuation translates into a 
greater power for men in the control of land and water resources, in deciding the allocation 
of the household budget and influencing the distribution of food within the family (see 
section D below). 
</p>
<p>31. In polygamous households, there may be inequalities in the distribution of resources 
among wives. Unfavoured wives and their children may suffer severe forms of 
discrimination, resulting in heavier domestic workloads and poorer access to education 
along with poorer access to nutrition and healthcare.38 Additionally, in polygamous 
households, the succession to the male head of household fragments land parcels and 
titles.39 
</p>
<p>32. Single women in extended family households may face higher degrees of poverty 
and lack of access to resources, including land, even though the household may otherwise 
have a good livelihood security.40 
</p>
<p><b> 4. </b>Global pressure on women&#8217;s rig<b>hts to land and water resources 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food pointed out that the privatization of 
local markets where women sell their produce as a way to increase the income of their 
households, together with the pursuit of land by private actors and the current emphasis on 
biofuels, endanger women&#8217;s food security and livelihoods.41 
</p>
<p>34. Some studies show that the openness of markets and trade liberalization may 
contribute to the economic empowerment of rural women.42 Nevertheless, in order to 
ensure the presence of rural women and their products on the market, they need to have 
their resources protected, such as land, and producer status regulated. 
</p>
<p>35. Large-scale land acquisitions and leases for the production of sugarcane and maize 
for biofuels reverse the use of agricultural land for food production.43 Many of the 
traditional occupations of rural women, such as handicrafts, gathering  fruit and other 
foodstuff, fishing, hunting or finding water are dependent on access to land, water and other 
resources. For instance, in its concluding observations to Togo, the CEDAW Committee 
requested the State party to ensure that &#8220;land lease contracts with foreign companies do not 
result in forced eviction and internal displacement or the increased food insecurity and 
poverty of local populations, including women and girls, and that the company concerned 
and/or the State party provide the affected communities with adequate compensation and

<p>alternative land&#8221;.44 The pursuit of land and water as commodities are particularly 
problematic for women belonging to indigenous communities for whom the environment 
and the land are essential elements with a strong cultural value.45 
</p>
<p><b> B. Insufficient or discriminatory access to financial services, markets and 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Credit and other financial services 
</b></p>
<p>36. Frequently, practical factors, such as limited financial skills due to lack of education 
and training, limited time, mobility, transport services, lack of control over land or livestock 
that could serve as guarantees, as well as institutional practices blended with socioeconomic 
and cultural barriers obstruct rural women&#8217;s access to credit.46 In turn, the lack of loans 
stifles the entrepreneurship potential of rural women, as they lack the means to invest in 
technology, production materials and infrastructure. In particular storage facilities are 
relevant for income generation when perishable foodstuffs are produced and to store food 
products for food-insecure times or famine. 
</p>
<p>37. It has been observed that most rural financial programmes have been designed for 
male heads of households as clients, thus omitting to recognize women as productive agents 
with their own financial needs and constraints.47 The confinement of women in the private 
space in certain countries limits their participation in agricultural or financial training and 
their ability to benefit from working with extension agents, or veterinarians.48 
</p>
<p>38. Research indicates that women prefer programmes that help them build savings, 
insure against risks, and borrow without the risk of losing their assets. However, financial 
institutions often rely on biased practices that do not offer women tailored financial 
products. Institutions may not fund activities run by women, may not accept women 
guarantors, or may grant smaller credits to women than to men for similar activities.49 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, among financial institutions there is also the assumption that women 
may rely on the male head of household to obtain the funds they need. This assumption 
does not take into consideration the different models for composition of families, such as 
the polygamous households50 or family dynamics that may be harmful for women and result 
in domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>40. For this reason, it is not sufficient to design financial programmes addressing poor 
households, but it is important to make women direct beneficiaries. This would have the 
effect of strengthening the position of women in the household and enhance their control 
over resources and decision-making capacity. Thus, financial services can improve rural 
women&#8217;s condition if they address the constraints of rural women and if they enhance 
women&#8217;s productive capacity51 with a focus on the creation of women&#8217;s cooperatives and 
</p>
<p>self-help groups.

<p><b> 2. Markets 
</b></p>
<p>41. The market represents a social space that connects rural and urban areas. They 
provide income and support products for rural households, food resources for urban 
residents and taxes for local administrations. Markets must be accessible for women both as 
vendors and as consumers. 
</p>
<p>42. The vast majority of market vendors are women. In countries in the Pacific region, 
80&#8211;90 per cent of market vendors are women. Yet, market spaces rarely offer vendors 
access to sanitation services or cooking facilities despite paying market day fees. Most 
women who travel long distances and spend several days at the market site lack adequate 
housing. These conditions increase the risk of women falling victims to harassment, 
extortion, sexual violence or ill-health. This situation is exacerbated for pregnant and 
nursing market vendors.52 
</p>
<p>43. Where women have limited access to travel to urban markets they would commonly 
use the local markets to sell their produce. The privatization of such markets may, thus, 
restrict women&#8217;s access to markets. As consumers, rural women may face higher prices for 
urban products because of distance, fuel costs and poor infrastructure. Therefore, rural 
women are more frequently faced with higher prices for consumer goods, and lower prices 
for produce goods.53 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>44. In rural areas, there is a clearly gendered division of labour. Rural women are more 
likely to be involved in informal work, which is usually part-time, seasonal and low-paid. 
When compared to their female peers from urban areas, they do not enjoy rights as 
pregnant women (paid maternity leave). Additionally, rural women rarely have work 
contracts and they constantly fear dismissal. Overtime work, sexual harassment, verbal and 
physical abuse combined with unsafe working conditions due to exposure to hazardous 
pesticides and other substances often characterize rural women&#8217;s employment conditions.54 
</p>
<p>45. Research shows that the employment of rural women in off-farm related jobs 
reduces their dependency on agriculture and provides them the assets to cope with 
economic or environmental shocks.55 However, opportunities for women&#8217;s off-farm 
employment are often scarce. 
</p>
<p>46. Income security is internally linked with social security benefits, access to essential 
services, education, and labour market participation. In the absence of a stable income, rural 
women cannot access these social benefits schemes. Studies in Latin America indicate that 
irrespective of household headship, more women are living below the poverty line, which is 
mainly due to the exclusion of women from the lucrative work force.56 
</p>
<p><b> C. Poor or discriminatory access to education, information, health care 
</b></p>
<p><b>and justice  
</b></p>
<p>47. As has been affirmed previously (para. 7 above) other human rights serve as 
collaterals for the realization of the right to food of rural women. Conversely, poor or

<p>discriminatory access to an array of rights, including, but not exclusively, to education, 
information, health care and justice stifles rural women&#8217;s capacity to feed themselves and 
their families in dignity. 
</p>
<p>48.  Registration of girls in schools is only a first step to ensuring gender equality in 
access to education. Several factors undermine the quality of education of girl children in 
rural areas. First, the withdrawal of girls from school is an adjustment method to economic 
or environmental shocks in the absence of other resources to alleviate the coping process. 
Second, schools in rural areas in certain regions are unsafe, unhygienic or lack sanitation 
facilities altogether. This favours dropout, in particular that of adolescent girls.57 Third, the 
early marriage of girls confines their perspectives to the traditional role of women and 
limits their access to education.58 Fourth, classes maintain the traditional roles assigned to 
girls and women.59 The United Nations report on the progress made in achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals points out that very slow progress has been made to 
overcome the challenges in the axis poverty-malnutrition-limited access to education.60 
</p>
<p>49. Education is strongly connected to the capacity to access information. Illiteracy 
disempowers rural women in a variety of areas and forms. For instance, the consequence of 
illiteracy for rural women is lack of access to credit facilities and employment and meagre  
participation in decision-making processes.61 Rural women&#8217;s limited access to education 
and information has also negatively impacted on their capacity to organize.62 Although rural 
residents may be able to organize within a village, distances, lack of infrastructure or the 
costs of transport as well as the social norms informing relationships among villages 
contribute to difficulties in organizing across villages.63 For this reason, the provision of 
Convention on the Elimination All Forms of Discrimination against Women regarding the 
organization of women&#8217;s self-groups and cooperatives is one of the essential factors to 
achieve the empowerment of rural women. 
</p>
<p>50. In the absence of adequate health-care facilities in rural areas, both rural women and 
men face restrictions in terms of access to health care. Their mobility is often hampered by 
lack of physical or economic access to transport. Women have a need, however, for family 
planning and childbirth assistance and, in this context, lack of access represents a greater 
burden. With difficulties to access health workers, rural women rely on traditional 
knowledge and medicinal plants together with native food varieties and practices for their 
sustenance and health care.64 At times, this may have harmful effects on their health 
condition and that of their children. For example, a report of UN-Women indicates that in 
rural villages in Cambodia, women diagnosed with HIV know very little about the 
treatment and have difficulties in accessing information about their rights. Discrimination 
from the local communities further isolates these women. As many women are infected by 
their husbands, they become widows or have to care for a sick spouse while unwell 
themselves.65 Access to adequate nutrition is essential for pregnant and breastfeeding 
mothers living with HIV. Yet, HIV treatment may require up to half of a household&#8217;s 
annual income, leaving numerous families in poverty.66

<p>51. An obstacle to the realization of the right to food of rural women is their poor access 
to justice. The main barriers faced by women concern the substance of law, institutional 
elements and cultural aspects.67 Discriminatory land, property or inheritance laws fall in the 
first category; lack of information on legislation intended to protect the rights of women, 
high costs of legal counsel and of transport from the rural to the urban areas belong to the 
second; stigma and stereotypes in the case of domestic violence or inheritance disputes, for 
example, belong to the third category of obstacles hampering the access to justice of rural 
women.68 
</p>
<p><b> D. The gendered role of women in society and the family  
</b></p>
<p>52. Rural women do not form a homogenous group. Their roles and needs vary 
culturally and geographically. The common thread is that most rural women are unpaid 
family workers or self-employed in the low-paid sale of products in local markets. They 
have limited opportunities and time to become involved in the remunerated labour market. 
</p>
<p>53. Due to the lack of remuneration or low pay, women&#8217;s work is perceived as being 
less valuable.69 A higher value is often attributed to the activities of men and boys. This 
construction results not least from the image of men as &#8220;protectors&#8221; in case of armed 
conflict. Such gendered roles relegate rural women to being &#8220;helpers&#8221; of the male head of 
household in Guatemala70 or &#8220;farmers&#8217; wives&#8221; in Sri Lanka.71 A 2003 report provides an 
example of the dire consequence of the gendered roles for women&#8217;s right to food. In 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh, custom required that women and girls ate last, which also meant that they ate 
less than men and boys.72 This situation was reflected in the higher rates of women and girls 
suffering of malnutrition and stunting.73 
</p>
<p>54. Rural women carry a heavy triple burden.74 Globally, they produce about half of the 
world&#8217;s food.75 They cultivate food crops, manage livestock, grow vegetables in home 
gardens, fish and harvest from the forest and control small animals.76 Women and girls are 
responsible for the household, for gathering fuel and carrying water to prepare meals or for 
agricultural purposes. A study showed that in one year women in Africa carried over 80 
tons of fuel, water and farm produce for a distance of one kilometre, while men carried only 
one eighth of that.77 The care of children, sick adults, orphans or the elderly is commonly 
the responsibility of women.78 
</p>
<p>55. Problems with rural women&#8217;s work arise from the fact that agricultural work is not 
placed in the framework of decent work as stated in the ICESCR and does not conform to 
the labour rights and standards promoted in the ILO conventions. The lack of access to 
decent work is a major cause of poverty, especially in the case of women in the rural areas.

<p>Being denied property and inheritance rights, with limited capacity to engage in contracts 
and trade, and little availability of resources to be exchanged, work and the capacity to 
produce goods remain the main asset rural women have to support themselves and their 
families and households.79 Although being the main asset, the agricultural work of women 
is not yet conducive of economic empowerment because of its lack of recognition in 
institutional and legislative frameworks.  
</p>
<p>56. The agricultural roles of women have changed as a consequence of migration.80 The 
out-migration of men may augment rural women&#8217;s workload. At the same time, women 
who migrate and who build households in urban areas maintain the perception that they 
belong to larger families in the rural areas and often send remittances.81  
</p>
<p><b> E. Case study: female-headed households 
</b></p>
<p>57. Female-headed households vary in structure. They can be female-maintained 
households, female-led, mother-centred, lone-mother or male-absent households. As to 
composition, this type of households may include single parents living alone with children, 
or grandmother-headed households.82 Several factors contribute to the formation of female-
headed households, such as age differences between male and female at marriage, gender-
differentiated life-expectancy, land and property ownership, family and divorce legislation83 
as well as male and female infidelity, male alcohol abuse, intra-family violence, migration, 
armed conflicts, or rape taking place during such conflicts leaving girls and women rejected 
by their families.84 Moreover, historical, demographic and socio-economic factors have also 
influenced the formation of women-headed households. For instance in Kenya, colonial 
powers outsourced male labourers from colonial villages for European plantations and 
estates. The development of infrastructure in the colonies and military conscription also 
demanded the migration of men out of their households.85 
</p>
<p>58. Based on women&#8217;s headship, two categories of households are known. De jure 
female-headed households establish women as the legal and customary heads and the 
absence of a male partner on a permanent basis. This category includes households headed 
by widows, unmarried, separated, or divorced women. De facto female-headed households 
refer to either the situation where the reported head of the household is the woman whose 
husband is also present, or where the reported head is the woman in the absence of the 
husband.86 
</p>
<p>59. These definitions also suppose limitations. The definitions assume that the husband 
is the main breadwinner and head of household. The definitions of women-headed 
households are based on the absence of a male partner, either temporarily as in the case of 
de facto women-headed households, or on a permanent basis as in the case of de jure 
women-headed households. These distinctions fail to take into consideration functions such 
as provision and management of resources that distinguish heads of households irrespective

<p>of gender,87 and the composition of households. In joint family systems where several 
generations live together or in households where the husband&#8217;s kinship assumes the control 
of resources in his absence, it is more difficult to establish the actual household headship. 
</p>
<p>60. Widow heads of household are identified as particularly vulnerable to poverty.88 
They have fewer productive assets, less savings and they are less likely to have pension 
income for which reason they depend on the support of their sons.89 Single mothers tend to 
bear the responsibility of caring for the family dependants which severely diminishes their 
income. Although unmarried mothers in Peru live in precarious conditions due to unequal 
power relations and resource allocation within the household, these women have been 
excluded from cash-transfer programmes because the overall economic condition of the 
household the women belonged to exceeded the income threshold.90 Female-headed 
households have a higher rate of dependency than households headed by men.91 
</p>
<p>61. When determining the costs of household maintenance, the calculus should not only 
focus on the number of dependants, but it should also take into consideration small 
economies of scale as larger households may produce more goods at lower costs.92 In 
addition, studies comparing the economic condition of female-headed households with that 
of male-headed households disregard the investigation of the relative welfare of women in 
male-headed households and conversely, of men in female-headed households.93 
</p>
<p>62. While rural women are more numerous than men among the population living in 
poverty, this may, in turn, not always lead to the situation that female-headed households 
are poorer than male-headed households. A study conducted by FAO in 20 countries 
indicates that the condition of poverty of rural women is passed on to the household.94 
Further research indicates that results depend on a number of factors, such as the domestic 
context, the type of female-headed household, the choice and use of equivalence scales and 
the consideration for the economies of scale.95 
</p>
<p>63. The factors that determine women&#8217;s precarious condition contribute to their 
vulnerability to poverty because women lack the means to cope with risks.96 The poverty 
status of households usually varies over time. However, there are also situations where the 
status of poverty of certain households is permanent.97 
</p>
<p>64. The Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that female-headed 
households be ensured adequate availability and accessibility to welfare programs, 
alternative care facilities and early child-care services.98 The standard of living of female-
headed households can be improved by allowing women access to employment, housing,

<p>food, potable water, sanitary services and electricity.99 Zero-hunger programmes can 
contribute to the reduction of poverty and hunger among such households provided that 
human rights principles of non-discrimination, transparency, participation and 
accountability are integrated.100 For female-heads of households who are employed, 
extended maternity leaves, counselling, financial support should be provided.101 In addition, 
stigmatization and discrimination against single mothers must be addressed.102 Rural 
communities may view divorced or separated women as deviant and deny their rights.103 
This means that female-headed households lack the support of both the State and the 
community. 
</p>
<p>65. Displaced females heading households require access to public specialized facilities. 
Social housing should be made available in areas from which they fled or in the areas 
where they currently reside104 until durable solutions to the question of landlessness are 
implemented.105 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
recommends support schemes for female-headed households through the allocation of 
funds for vocational training, adult literacy, credit plans, creation of incentives for their 
employment, and assistance with health care and subsidies for housing.106 
</p>
<p><b> F. Case study: temporary or seasonal workers 
</b></p>
<p>67. Rural women may need to take up temporary work, often depending on the season; 
otherwise they remain unemployed or underemployed for long periods of time.107 In the 
view of the IOM, women&#8217;s decision to migrate, while based on reasons related to food 
security, escaping traditional gender roles, unsatisfying family relationships and gender-
based violence and discrimination, covers an increasing urban demand for domestic 
workers, health, child and elder care, the agriculture, garment and entertainment 
industries.108 Due to their low level of qualifications and skills, rural women can only opt 
for low-skilled employment in the above sectors. 
</p>
<p>68. The types of jobs they would carry out are found in the sectors of domestic work, 
nursing, as sex workers, employees in export-oriented garment factories in urban areas and 
non-traditional export agriculture. Regarding the quality of jobs in terms of human rights

<p>protections, there is a marked absence of freedom of association and collective bargaining,  
which are often associated with forced labour, discrimination and harassment.109 
</p>
<p>69. Temporary and seasonal workers are in many countries ineligible for paid parental 
leave.110 In New Zealand, rural women together with Maori, Pacific, and other minority 
women face difficulties in accessing child care and parental leave. 
</p>
<p>70. Social security systems based on individual contributions do not provide adequate 
social security for women involved in informal employment, or who are unable to 
contribute sufficiently to the system, such as seasonal or temporary workers.111 Rural 
women employed in the garment sector in the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic represent 
80 per cent of the workers and they face poor working conditions and discrimination. 
Women in Laos are more likely to be involved in temporary and seasonal employment, 
which provides little job security.112 
</p>
<p>71. In Spain, the intensive farming of strawberries relies almost entirely on a seasonal 
workforce. The recruitment of workers takes place in the country of origin and it is based 
on criteria such as marital status, motherhood and commitment to return at the end of the 
contract. The Spanish legal framework offers very little protection to seasonal workers. 
Days not worked are not paid and union representation of these workers is almost 
impossible. This situation exposes women to discriminatory recruitment practices and 
disrespect for labour rights while maintaining them in the host country in a condition of 
dependency on their employers, which increases the risks of abuse.113 
</p>
<p>72. Climate change and disasters may also constitute factors inducing migration. These 
factors may aggravate social problems and augment the pressure on gender roles and status 
of women.114 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Strategies and policies for the legal protection of rural 
women 
</b></p>
<p>73. All strategies and policies need to recognize at the outset that: 
</p>
<p>(a) Rural women and men have specific requirements in carrying out their 
livelihoods, roles and responsibilities; 
</p>
<p>(b) Participatory processes involving equally rural women and men are required 
in the design of all projects; 
</p>
<p>(c) Rural women are productive agents and active actors in rural development, 
agriculture, local and national economies, and contributors to food security and social 
wellbeing; and 
</p>
<p>(d) Rural women are a diverse group by age, religion, ethnicity, socio-economic 
status, marital status, or geographic residence. 
</p>
<p>74. The primary consideration for increasing the protection of women through strategies 
and policies which promote de jure and de facto equality is of a legal nature, flowing from 
states&#8217; human rights obligations under international law. There is a legal imperative to treat

<p>rural women as equal to rural men, to women and men in general. This requires that States 
acknowledge the multiple patterns of discrimination faced by rural women and that targeted 
action be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>75. In parallel to the legal obligations, research attests that addressing inequality 
between men and women in access to productive resources is beneficial for economic 
growth and development. A 2011 study by FAO suggests that if rural women had equal 
access with men to productive resources, they could increase yields on their farms by 20 to 
30 per cent, thereby reducing the toll of people going hungry by 100 to 150 million. 
Women would thus contribute to both food security and economic growth.115 The Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food proclaims gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment as 
the &#8220;secret weapon against hunger&#8221;.116 
</p>
<p>76. Strategies and policies for the protection of rural women should be directed towards: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ratification of international law instruments which have been referred to in 
part II of the Study to offer protection to the rights of women in rural areas and/or the 
elimination of reservations made thereon; 
</p>
<p>(b) The transposition of international law provisions addressing the rights of 
women in rural areas into national legislation. This may require reform of existing laws but 
also the passing of new legislation. Both should address traditions or social customs, the 
effect of which is discriminatory against rural women, including through affirmative action 
policies; 
</p>
<p>(c) Adequate international cooperation and foreign aid policies for rural women. 
Currently this is happening only marginally. For instance, Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development estimates show that in recent years only 5 per cent of aid 
directed to the agricultural sector specifically focused on gender equality.117 Moreover, in 
the context of an increasingly liberalized trade in agricultural products, governmental 
strategies and policies should be designed to specifically protect women&#8217;s access to food 
and to enhance their capacity and entitlement to purchase food; 
</p>
<p>(d) Equal access to and control of land and other rural productive resources. 
National laws and policies have to guarantee women&#8217;s right to land and property rights. 
Legislation needs to promote changes, including in customary law, to provide for the 
registration of land in women&#8217;s names and the consent of women to the modification of the 
land rights. Contract-farming schemes that favour women as contractors could be 
encouraged to offset the generalized practice whereby buyers contract almost always 
men.118 National instruments also need to recognize and support women in processes of 
adaptation and mitigation of climate change and disaster risk reduction by protecting 
resources of water, food, energy, livelihoods and health; 
</p>
<p> (e) The establishment of financial services responsive to women&#8217;s needs and 
concerns, and which address women as direct beneficiaries. Safety-net mechanisms and the 
emergency food reserves may constitute strategies to address rural women&#8217;s food insecurity 
due to high prices of commodities.119 Encouragement of bank loans in women&#8217;s names

<p>facilitates their direct access to financial resources and enhances the visibility of their 
specific needs as financial actors. This also contributes to the financial security of women, 
creates further ties within the household, and reduces the rates of divorce and abandonment 
of women;120 
</p>
<p>(f) Economic policies that ensure decent work and employment for rural women, 
including temporary and seasonal workers, in both formal and informal economy. These 
policies should provide decent wages, food and nutrition security, improved living 
conditions, social protection, collective bargaining, and freedom of association. Non-
agriculture employment opportunities should be developed in the rural infrastructure, 
health, education, and finance sectors as well as in insurance services, rural industry or 
shops.121 These should be complemented by social protection mechanisms, including child-
care facilities, health insurance and pensions in order to alleviate women&#8217;s household work 
</p>
<p>and allow them to take up employment;122 
</p>
<p>(g) Targeted educational programs and information campaigns on nutrition, 
family planning, financial services and policies aimed at ensuring women&#8217;s representation, 
participation in decision-making and association in agricultural cooperatives. Access to and 
information concerning fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, vaccination for the livestock, storage 
facilities and technology which is appropriate to the needs and activities performed by 
women, but also to the requirements of their physical capacity and use needs to be provided 
to rural women;123 
</p>
<p> (h) The promotion of technologies designed to meet women&#8217;s needs, which can 
increase productivity and shorten physically demanding labour, therefore helping relieve 
women in their heavy burdens.124 Policy makers need to acknowledge that rural women&#8217;s 
knowledge, needs, interests and constraints in developing crop varieties, or breeding 
livestock differ from those of men. Alternative sources of cooking fuels shorten 
preparation, increase storage time of foods and decrease the need for daily firewood 
collection. Reducing the use of cook stoves alimented by firewood is an important aspect 
for the improvement of women&#8217;s health condition;125 
</p>
<p>(i) Monitoring and evaluation. Data needs to be collected regarding the 
distribution of resources within the household taking into account its decision-making 
structure and composition. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Legislation 
</i></p>
<p>77. Rwanda reformed its legislation concerning inheritance and land tenure with 
pronounced protection for gender equality. The enactment of these new legislative acts was 
supported by the participation of women in local government following the constitutional 
provision that at least 30 per cent of all decision-making representatives must be women.126

</p>

<p><i>  Political commitments 
</i></p>
<p>78. At regional level, the African Union Declaration on Food Security in Africa (2003) 
contains the commitment of African States to allocate a minimum of 10 per cent of their 
national budgets to agricultural development.127  
</p>
<p>79. Men Engage Alliance is a global alliance of NGOs and United Nations agencies that 
encourages men&#8217;s and boys&#8217; participation to achieve gender equality. 
</p>
<p><i>  Household improvements 
</i></p>
<p>80. An organization of women farmers in Nepal established a local facility for the 
storage of approximately 80 varieties of rice. In India, the National Human Rights 
Commission decided to strengthen local administration in order to facilitate the availability 
of food grains, especially in remote and least-developed rural areas.128 
</p>
<p>81. In South Africa, the Solar Electric Light Fund was created in collaboration with 
rural women to establish micro-credit programmes to support the sale of solar home 
systems. A cooperative of rural women was organized in order to manage the loans and the 
maintenance of the system.129 
</p>
<p>82. In Kenya, Mali and Malawi, ceramic stoves were introduced to reduce the time 
women spend on collecting firewood. However, reports also show that women&#8217;s lack of 
</p>
<p>cash and their husbands&#8217; unwillingness to contribute to innovative systems of energy use 
hindered women&#8217;s access to such developments.130 
</p>
<p><i>  Financial services 
</i></p>
<p>83. In Bangladesh, Grameen Bank makes long-term loans for land and housing 
conditional on their registration in the women&#8217;s name, while BRAC Income Generation for 
Vulnerable Groups Development provides women with incentives to build savings for 
investment and protection against crises. 
</p>
<p>84. The Al Tadamun Microfinance Foundation in Egypt provides group-guaranteed 
microfinance exclusively for women. In December 2010, it had in excess of 103,600 active 
borrowers and a portfolio of US$ 14 million. 
</p>
<p>85. In Uzbekistan, the Women&#8217;s Committee supported by UN-Women developed a 
series of trainings through a network of self-help groups for women in rural areas to 
strengthen their capacity on how to access economic opportunities, develop business and 
money management skills and an understanding of credit systems. To complement this 
initiative, the Micro-Credit Bank together with the Government of Uzbekistan as a major 
shareholder provided micro-credits to the rural women&#8217;s self-help groups at a much lower 
annual interest rate than the standard rates. Since 2010 when the initiative was launched, 
almost 200 women have started business initiatives which enhanced their livelihood, self-
esteem and status as decision-makers in their villages.131 
</p>
<p>86. UN-Women runs a programme for strengthening the economic livelihood 
opportunities for low-income and HIV-positive women in Cambodia. It also raised a Fund 
for Gender Equality, which has provided small grants to almost 1,300 women to help them 
start a small business.

<p><i>  Information and communication services 
</i></p>
<p>87. In India, several village councils have computerized databases to improve the access 
of rural women to administrative data and information about government programmes and 
schemes.132 
</p>
<p>88. Ekgaon Technologies created a platform of mobile banking through short text 
messages that enabled rural women in Tamil Nadu, India to access banking information and 
services from national banks.133 A similar system was used in Ghana to provide access to 
health workers. As a result, the rate of maternal mortality decreased in the villages where 
the short text messaging system was implemented.134 
</p>
<p>89. A project led by an NGO in Ecuador has trained more than 300 women in rural areas 
on the use of computer-based technologies. This project has provided girl children with the 
possibility to access distance learning programmes and enhanced the capacity of women 
leaders to engage with public authorities by the submission of projects for sewerage, 
housing and drinking water.135 
</p>
<p><i>  Public services 
</i></p>
<p>90. In Tajikistan and Moldova, the delivery of public services has been reformed. The 
members of local administration come together in a &#8220;service hall&#8221; where they provide 
</p>
<p>services to the population on matters concerning access to education, health care, social 
protection, civic registration, passports, and land rights. The meetings between the 
population and the administration take place once a week. This system removes the 
bureaucratic burden frustrating the access of the population to public services.136 
</p>
<p><i>  Markets 
</i></p>
<p>91. To improve markets in the Solomon Islands, UN-Women developed a partnership to 
improve markets with Governments and organizations of market vendors in the Pacific 
region. The sites of markets enlarged with the construction of kitchens, toilets, showers and 
safe low-cost places for women and their children to sleep. The complex was 
complemented with a learning and handicraft centre where may learn new skills to diversify 
their trade and increase their income.137 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>While certain advances are noticeable, the interests, concerns and needs of 
rural women deserve heightened attention. Patterns of discrimination persist and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent women from realizing their rights. This study has emphasized that the legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework to remove these precise patterns of discrimination affecting rural women 
</b></p>
<p><b>exists and that States are bound to respect it. To do so, States have to actively address 
</b></p>
<p><b>de facto and de jure discrimination against rural women by employing a number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive strategies and pursuing good practices. The Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p><b>illustrated some of these in the present study. The Committee recommends that States, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in cooperation with international organizations and non-governmental organizations,
