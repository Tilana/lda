 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that everyone shall enjoy the human right to education, which is enshrined, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other 
pertinent international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, it is resolved that 
children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary

emphasizing the importance of realizing the right to education in attaining the Millennium 
Development Goals,

belonging to vulnerable groups, contributes to the eradication of poverty and of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, </p>

37 million of whom live in conflict-affected fragile States, are out of school, and that 774 million 
adults, 64 per cent of whom are women, still lack basic literacy skills, despite progress made in 
recent years towards achieving the goals of the Education for All initiative agreed upon at the 
World Education Forum, held in Dakar in April 2000, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that good governance and the rule of law will assist all States to promote and 
protect human rights, including the right to education, 
</p>

right to education, and the importance in this regard of national resource mobilization, as well as 
international cooperation,

and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of
