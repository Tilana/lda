<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 15/21 and 24/5, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association visited 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan from 19 to 27 January 2015, at the invitation of the Government. The purpose 
</p>
<p>of the visit was to assess the situation of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in 
</p>
<p>the country.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for accommodating his 
</p>
<p>requests for meetings and expresses sincere appreciation to all persons who took the time to 
</p>
<p>meet with him in a spirit of constructive dialogue. The Special Rapporteur commends the 
</p>
<p>Government for extending a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate holders 
</p>
<p>and for having accommodated the visit of six special rapporteurs since July 2009. He 
</p>
<p>considers it an expression of the Government&#8217;s willingness and commitment to work jointly 
</p>
<p>with the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council to strengthen the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of all human rights, including the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association. He takes this opportunity to thank the Government for responding in detail to 
</p>
<p>the communications he has sent so far, as well as to a letter he sent after his visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also expresses his gratitude to the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Resident Coordinator in Kazakhstan and to the Regional Office for Central Asia of 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), for its 
</p>
<p>excellent support prior to and during the visit. 
</p>
<p>4. While in Kazakhstan, the Special Rapporteur travelled to Astana, Almaty, Aktau and 
</p>
<p>Zhanaozen. He met with representatives from the executive, legislative and judicial 
</p>
<p>branches in Astana and with regional and local authorities in Almaty, Aktau and 
</p>
<p>Zhanaozen. He also met with representatives of the national human rights institution, 
</p>
<p>international organizations, the diplomatic community and civil society organizations, and 
</p>
<p>with survivors and victims of grievous human rights violations that occurred during the 
</p>
<p>Zhanaozen crisis of December 2011. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan for facilitating his visit with Vladimir Kozlov, the jailed leader of the public 
</p>
<p>association People&#8217;s Party Alga!, who is currently serving a jail term of seven and a half 
</p>
<p>years.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Historical and political background 
</b></p>
<p>5. Kazakhstan has been independent for nearly 24 years and has made considerable 
</p>
<p>economic progress during that time. The level of economic growth and infrastructural 
</p>
<p>development, including the construction of a new capital, has made Kazakhstan an 
</p>
<p>important player in the region and globally. This admirable economic progress was 
</p>
<p>achieved thanks to Kazakhstan&#8217;s abundant natural resources, a remarkable mobilization of 
</p>
<p>human resources and significant efforts to ensure stability in an ethnically and culturally 
</p>
<p>diverse society. Today, Kazakhstan has ambitious international objectives, including a bid 
</p>
<p>for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2017-2018 and a proposal 
</p>
<p>to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. The main goal of its national strategic plan, 
</p>
<p>Strategy Kazakhstan 2050, is for the country to join the top 30 developed countries by the 
</p>
<p>middle of the century. 
</p>
<p>6. Despite its apparent wealth and image as a prosperous and stable country, 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan faces a number of challenges. Socioeconomic inequalities remain and a number 
</p>
<p>of human rights, especially the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, 
</p>
<p>are not adequately enjoyed by all.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>7. Since independence, President Nazarbayev has maintained firm control over 
</p>
<p>political and economic affairs. He was elected as the first President of Kazakhstan in 1991 
</p>
<p>and has remained in power ever since, receiving 95.5 per cent of the votes with an 89.9 per 
</p>
<p>cent turnout in the 2011 presidential elections. On 25 February 2015, following an initiative 
</p>
<p>by the Council of the Assembly of People, supported by the Parliament, President 
</p>
<p>Nazarbayev announced that an early presidential election would take place on 26 April 
</p>
<p>2015, instead of in December 2016 as originally scheduled. This left very limited time for 
</p>
<p>the opposition to prepare. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur believes that Kazakhstan is at a crossroads. Its economic 
</p>
<p>progress since independence has been impressive but the lack of corresponding 
</p>
<p>advancements in the realm of other human rights renders this progress shaky. Although it 
</p>
<p>may seem paradoxical, the true measure of a country&#8217;s stability is its tolerance of peaceful 
</p>
<p>questioning of the established order, that is, allowing outlets for peaceful dissent and 
</p>
<p>political pluralism. Failure to create such outlets does not make the dissent go away; it only 
</p>
<p>bottles it up in such a way that it may fester and explode as something much more violent 
</p>
<p>than a street protest or reports of non-governmental organizations criticizing government 
</p>
<p>policy.  
</p>
<p>9. During the visit, government representatives repeatedly stressed that stability and 
</p>
<p>cohesion are integral aspects of Kazakh society, noting that the views of minorities &#8212; and 
</p>
<p>of the nation as a whole &#8212; are represented in the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. The 
</p>
<p>Government of Kazakhstan should be praised for its preservation of stability and cohesion 
</p>
<p>in a vast country composed of 140 ethnic and 17 religious groups. Nevertheless, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur found that stability was often misused to wrongfully curtail the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. He underlines that the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and the maintenance of peace and harmony are two sides of the 
</p>
<p>same coin and that are interrelated, mutually reinforcing and interdependent. He believes 
</p>
<p>that the free exercise of the rights to peaceful assembly and of association provides 
</p>
<p>authorities with unique insights into the challenges that people are facing. This is especially 
</p>
<p>important for a nation such as Kazakhstan, which is young, large and placed in a relatively 
</p>
<p>challenging and complex geopolitical context. There is no better way to understand the 
</p>
<p>needs of people and no better check and balance for authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>10. Kazakhstan has ratified many international human rights instruments, including the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
</p>
<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and its Optional Protocol, the International Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and, in 2015, the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities, all of which contain provisions pertinent to the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. Kazakhstan has 
</p>
<p>also ratified a number of International Labour Organization conventions, including the 
</p>
<p>Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 
</p>
<p>(No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98). 
</p>
<p>Given the relatively short existence of Kazakhstan as an independent country, the 
</p>
<p>commitment shown by the authorities to abide by international human rights law is 
</p>
<p>commendable. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association are guaranteed in the Constitution, which also recognizes 
</p>
<p>ideological and political diversity. He notes that the Constitution gives international treaties 
</p>
<p>priority over domestic laws and allows them to be directly implemented. In theory, this 
</p>
<p>allows courts to directly invoke, inter alia, articles 21 and 22 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights in its judgements. He notes positively that the Constitution 
</p>
<p>provides that the right to peaceful assembly may only be restricted by law in the interests of 
</p>
<p>State security, public order and protection of health, rights and freedoms of other persons, 
</p>
<p>which clearly suggests that freedom is the norm and limitations the exception, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>12. Despite these provisions, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that new laws have 
</p>
<p>been adopted since the Zhanaozen crisis of 2011, in which at least 16 people were killed 
</p>
<p>after government forces moved in on hundreds of oil workers protesting their conditions of 
</p>
<p>employment, and used to curb the right to freedom of association. He is also concerned 
</p>
<p>that, in the same period, participants in unsanctioned assemblies seem to have been 
</p>
<p>increasingly subjected to intimidation, fines, imprisonment and administrative sanctions.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>13. Before discussing the issue of freedom of association proper, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>would like to express serious concerns about an incident that occurred during his visit. 
</p>
<p>14. At the end of a meeting with members of civil society in Aktau on 24 January 2015, 
</p>
<p>unknown individuals sitting in the back of a vehicle parked directly facing the entrance of 
</p>
<p>the venue of the meeting were seen taking photographs of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s driver 
</p>
<p>and of civil society representatives leaving the building. The equipment used and the 
</p>
<p>manner in which the photographs were being taken left little doubt that the operation was 
</p>
<p>carried out by secret police surveillance with the aim of instilling fear among activists. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur approached the individuals and demanded to know who they 
</p>
<p>were and their purpose in taking the photographs, at which point they hurriedly drove off 
</p>
<p>without responding. The Special Rapporteur made a formal complaint to the Head of the 
</p>
<p>Mangystau Oblast Interior Department on the day of the incident. The next day, police 
</p>
<p>informed the Special Rapporteur that a suspect had been apprehended and presented a 
</p>
<p>purported confession from the person. The suspect, however, was not the same person that 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur had confronted in the parking lot.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur considers this incident to be a worrying episode illustrating 
</p>
<p>both a lack of respect vis-&#224;-vis those holding or perceived to be holding different views 
</p>
<p>from the Government, and a sense of impunity by some officials. 
</p>
<p>17. The issue of reprisals against those cooperating with United Nations bodies and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 24/24, is taken 
</p>
<p>extremely seriously by the Special Rapporteur. The incident in Aktau clearly illustrates that 
</p>
<p>much more needs to be done to protect human rights defenders in Kazakhstan, particularly 
</p>
<p>in the light of the country&#8217;s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. 
</p>
<p>An enabling environment for the development of civil society requires not only protection 
</p>
<p>against acts of harassment and intimidation, but also proactive efforts to bring perpetrators 
</p>
<p>of human rights violations to justice and positive measures to support those holding 
</p>
<p>dissenting or minority views and opinions.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes that no other concern directly related to the visit has 
</p>
<p>been brought to his attention since then, but he will continue to remain in touch with the 
</p>
<p>civil society activists he met and will remain firm in his response to these issues. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> A. Political parties 
</b></p>
<p>19. There is very limited space for the expression of dissenting political views in 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan. A web of policy, practice and perception contributes to a general environment 
</p>
<p>where engaging in political activities is difficult, discouraging and sometimes dangerous. 
</p>
<p>Dissent may be criminalized and critical political expression is often portrayed as 
</p>
<p>threatening the stability of the State.  
</p>
<p>20. Kazakhstan amended its 1996 Law on Political Parties in 2002 and 2009. While the 
</p>
<p>2009 Law contained some improvements over the previous version, including a decrease in 
</p>
<p>the number of members required to form a political party and the introduction of a 
</p>
<p>provision allowing State registration of a political party even where there are errors in the 
</p>
<p>party member lists, provided the errors do not affect the ultimate total number of party 
</p>
<p>members required for State registration. However, much more needs to be done to ensure 
</p>
<p>compliance with international standards.  
</p>
<p>21. The Law on Political Parties imposes onerous obligations prior to registration, 
</p>
<p>including high initial membership requirements that prevent small parties from forming and 
</p>
<p>extensive documentation that requires time and significant expense to collect. An initial 
</p>
<p>group of no fewer than 1,000 founding members representing two thirds of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>regions, a city with a national status and the capital, in total no fewer than 40,000 members, 
</p>
<p>are required to form a political party.  
</p>
<p>22. A monitoring team from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
</p>
<p>described the most recent parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan, which were held in 2012, 
</p>
<p>as not meeting the &#8220;fundamental principles of democratic elections&#8221;, citing notably the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;selective&#8221; deregistration of candidates and of a party list.1 Although the ruling party, Nur 
</p>
<p>Otan, and its predecessor, Otan, enjoys strong support from the population and has 
</p>
<p>achieved major economic development since 1991, it has over the past two decades rarely 
</p>
<p>left much room for dissenting or minority views. There are nine political parties, only three 
</p>
<p>of which are represented in the Parliament. None is in a position to play the role of a true 
</p>
<p>opposition party. For example, during the 2011 presidential elections, one candidate said 
</p>
<p>that he had voted in favour of President Nazarbayev. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned that the executive branch, through 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice, is responsible for registering political parties, since these entities 
</p>
<p>will ultimately compete with it for power. The Law on Political Parties allows for perpetual 
</p>
<p>extensions for the authorities to review a prospective party&#8217;s application and does not set 
</p>
<p>clear criteria to guide officials in charge of the registration process. While the authorities 
</p>
<p>told the Special Rapporteur that individuals may use the court system to challenge 
</p>
<p>registration decisions made by the Ministry, he observed that confidence in the 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary was low. An independent body in charge of registering and 
</p>
<p>regulating political parties is necessary to ensure transparency and accountability of State 
</p>
<p>institutions. 
</p>
<p>24. Grounds allowing for the suspension or dissolution of a political party are another 
</p>
<p>source of concern. In late December 2014, a court suspended the Communist Party, as the 
</p>
<p>competent authority found a discrepancy in the party&#8217;s member list. 
</p>
<p>25. On 1 January 2015, the new Criminal Code, the new Code on Administrative 
</p>
<p>Offences and the new Code of Criminal Procedure entered into force. While some revisions 
</p>
<p>represent a significant step forward towards strengthening of the rule of law in criminal 
</p>
<p>proceedings, a series of other provisions pose serious risks of criminalizing and penalizing 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See www.osce.org/odihr/elections/89401?download=true. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>legitimate activities of associations, including political parties. Of particular concern is 
</p>
<p>article 174 of the Criminal Code, on incitement of social, national, family, racial, class or 
</p>
<p>religious discord. The Code does not strictly define what is meant by &#8220;incitement of 
</p>
<p>discord&#8221;, which may leave the term open for arbitrary interpretation beyond the scope of 
</p>
<p>articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
</p>
<p>article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination. Such a provision already existed under the previous Criminal Code, but the 
</p>
<p>new provision increases the maximum penalty from 12 to 20 years in prison. In fact, this 
</p>
<p>vague provision can be used against any opposition party that seeks, for instance, to 
</p>
<p>mobilize workers, as inciting social discord against employers. 
</p>
<p>26. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with Vladimir Kozlov, the jailed leader 
</p>
<p>of Alga!, who is serving a jail term of seven and a half years after being convicted of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;inciting discord&#8221;. Mr. Kozlov was arrested in January 2012 after he publicly expressed 
</p>
<p>support for oil workers demonstrating in the city of Zhanaozen and denounced human 
</p>
<p>rights violations in the aftermath of the December 2011 crisis. Mr. Kozlov has been 
</p>
<p>involved in opposition political movements since 2000, when he joined the party 
</p>
<p>Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan, which was dissolved by a court order in January 2005, 
</p>
<p>disturbingly also on charges of political extremism, inciting social tension and threatening 
</p>
<p>national security.  
</p>
<p>27. At the time of his conviction, Mr. Kozlov was in a seven-year struggle to register 
</p>
<p>Alga!, the successor to Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan. The court judgement against 
</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov was subsequently used to ban Alga! &#8212; along with 34 non-State media outlets 
</p>
<p>&#8212; on the grounds that they were &#8220;extremist&#8221;. In fact, the only crime committed by those 
</p>
<p>outlets appears to have been reporting on the situation in Zhanaozen. 
</p>
<p>28. During Mr. Kozlov&#8217;s trial, an expert commissioned by the court found that 
</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov had incited social discord by allegedly distributing leaflets stating &#8220;Get up off 
</p>
<p>your knees, Kazakhs, throw the tyrant and the thief off your neck!&#8221;. The expert testified 
</p>
<p>that this act set the protesters against their employers and State authorities because the 
</p>
<p>information in the leaflet suggested that since in many Kazakh regions people lived in poor 
</p>
<p>conditions, they might rise up in support of the oil workers. Mr. Kozlov&#8217;s actions also 
</p>
<p>allegedly contributed to a systematic breakdown of labour negotiations between employers 
</p>
<p>and workers. Mr. Kozlov was presented as linked to opposition figure Mukhtar Ablyazov, 
</p>
<p>currently in pretrial detention in France on embezzlement charges.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned that Mr. Kozlov&#8217;s ordinary political 
</p>
<p>speech and association activities were deemed criminal incitement of social hatred. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov&#8217;s case &#8212; particularly the fact that his conviction portrayed his legitimate and 
</p>
<p>peaceful political activity as threatening the stability of the country &#8212; seems emblematic of 
</p>
<p>a more general trend to marginalize political leaders voicing dissent. This heavy-handed 
</p>
<p>approach to quashing political opposition is all the more surprising given that the 
</p>
<p>Government of Kazakhstan enjoys significant popular legitimacy and approval. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur believes that article 174 of the new Criminal Code has had a 
</p>
<p>powerful chilling effect on political activity and that it is also an ineffective and 
</p>
<p>counterproductive way of fighting actual extremism. Dissolving political groups or 
</p>
<p>prosecuting their representatives on the aforementioned vague grounds puts any opposition 
</p>
<p>political party or its members that are keen to compete against the ruling party at risk of 
</p>
<p>being the subject of such criminal offences as incitement to discord or &#8220;spreading false 
</p>
<p>information&#8221; or &#8220;defamation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. The limited space for the expression of opposition views is exacerbated by 
</p>
<p>opposition parties&#8217; limited access to the media, which is also subject to restrictions. Several 
</p>
<p>independent newspapers have been closed down in recent months, including the well-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>known newspaper <i>ADAM bol</i>, which covered political and human rights issues and was 
</p>
<p>shut down by a court order in December 2014. The order came after <i>ADAM bol</i> published 
</p>
<p>an interview with an opposition figure who called for military support to the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>army against separatists in Ukraine.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is mindful that Kazakhstan is a young, vast and diverse 
</p>
<p>country with unique challenges. However, he considers that its current approach to 
</p>
<p>regulating political parties &#8212; and political opposition in general &#8212; quashes dissent and 
</p>
<p>pluralism in a way that is harmful to development and stability in the long term. Twenty-
</p>
<p>four years after independence, it is time for the political system to fully embrace pluralism. 
</p>
<p>This will require extensive reforms, starting with a revamping of how political parties are 
</p>
<p>regulated, and a more tolerant approach towards the expression of dissent. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has no doubt, however, that Kazakhstan has the resources and human capital 
</p>
<p>necessary to become a beacon of development and democracy, not just in Central Asia, but 
</p>
<p>globally.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Trade unions 
</b></p>
<p>33. In June 2014, Kazakhstan adopted a new law on trade unions and gave the unions 
</p>
<p>one year to comply with the new rules. At the time of writing the present report, the law 
</p>
<p>had not yet been fully implemented.  
</p>
<p>34. Broadly speaking, the new law imposes mandatory affiliation of trade unions to 
</p>
<p>regional or sectorial federations. It denies trade unions the right to freely form and join 
</p>
<p>labour organizations of their choice. These new requirements fall short of international law, 
</p>
<p>which stipulates that the right not to belong to an association is a core component of 
</p>
<p>freedom of association. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the authorities revise the 
</p>
<p>new law on trade unions to bring it in line with international standards as highlighted by the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Office in its memorandum of technical comments on the draft law on 
</p>
<p>trade unions of Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>35. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that some trade unions had 
</p>
<p>been denied registration in previous years, including Zhannartu, which had reportedly been 
</p>
<p>denied registration eight times since 2010; the independent union of journalists, which had 
</p>
<p>reportedly been denied registration on technical grounds several times, most recently in 
</p>
<p>November 2014; and Zhezkazgan, which had been denied registration three times in recent 
</p>
<p>years. These organizations had reportedly yet to submit their documents to register under 
</p>
<p>the new law.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the right to strike is limited by various 
</p>
<p>preliminary mediation procedures that are mandatory before a strike can be deemed legal. 
</p>
<p>The Labour Code also bans strikes in certain sectors, including the railway, transport and 
</p>
<p>petroleum industries. It also entitles an employer to terminate employment contracts with 
</p>
<p>employees who participate in strikes that are declared illegal. The new Criminal Code also 
</p>
<p>created a new offence for &#8220;actions provoking continued participation in an illegal strike&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(art. 402). The Special Rapporteur views the legal framework regulating strikes as more 
</p>
<p>focused on limiting strikes than on facilitating the exercise of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association.  
</p>
<p>37. In May 2011, in a region known for its formidable exploitation of natural resources, 
</p>
<p>workers of three companies operating in the oil sector started labour strikes (see paras. 72-
</p>
<p>89 below). In August 2011, a few months after the start of the first strikes, Natalia 
</p>
<p>Sokolova, a union lawyer who defended the interests of oil strikers, was sentenced to six 
</p>
<p>years in prison for &#8220;inciting social discord&#8221; after she called for a change to the system for 
</p>
<p>calculating workers&#8217; salaries. The Special Rapporteur is baffled that such a vaguely worded </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>offence could be used against a union lawyer. Publicly speaking out about work conditions 
</p>
<p>is in fact a core responsibility of unions; public debate about the issue, likewise, is a fact of 
</p>
<p>life in a capitalist economy. Ms. Sokolova was released in March 2012, but the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned that her arrest and the arrest of other strike leaders contributed to 
</p>
<p>inflame social tensions, ultimately leading to the tragic events of December 2011. 
</p>
<p>38. In Strategy Kazakhstan 2050, President Nazarbayev highlighted that one of the most 
</p>
<p>serious challenges for Kazakhstan was that some &#8220;social groups have not joined the overall 
</p>
<p>modernization process&#8221;. Although the unemployment rate is said to be low in Kazakhstan, 
</p>
<p>wealth disparities among the regions remain high, despite the fact that some efforts to 
</p>
<p>address this are being made, for example, in the Zhanaozen region. Economic reforms are 
</p>
<p>important in this regard, but may not be sufficient to ease social tensions when they erupt. 
</p>
<p>Independent trade unions play a positive role in this regard as they can help the authorities 
</p>
<p>build bridges with the population to identify needs and challenges, as well as solutions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Public associations 
</b></p>
<p>39. The 1996 Law on Public Associations requires that all associations be registered 
</p>
<p>with the State. The Special Rapporteur recalls that unregistered associations are protected 
</p>
<p>by international law pertaining to freedom of association. Allowing the existence of 
</p>
<p>unregistered associations is all the more essential as article 489 of the new Code on 
</p>
<p>Administrative Offences criminalizes the management, participation in and financing of the 
</p>
<p>activities of unregistered public associations.  
</p>
<p>40. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of certain public associations, 
</p>
<p>such as Kok-Zhailau, an ecological group, and Amanat Aktau and Aktau Voice, which 
</p>
<p>aimed to support the families of the victims of the Zhanaozen crisis, but which had recently 
</p>
<p>been denied registration, owing to, according to the information provided by the 
</p>
<p>Government, the discrepancies in the submitted documents. He encourages the authorities 
</p>
<p>to proactively facilitate the formation of public associations, as they play a crucial role in 
</p>
<p>advancing human rights and development. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Constitution of Kazakhstan 
</p>
<p>prohibits the illegal interference of the State in the affairs of public associations, but he is 
</p>
<p>seriously concerned that the same constitutional article refers to the illegal interference of 
</p>
<p>public associations in the State&#8217;s affairs. The new Criminal Code also warns associations 
</p>
<p>from causing any illegal hindrance to the lawful activities of governmental bodies and from 
</p>
<p>being involved in acts leading to considerable harm to the rights and legitimate interests of 
</p>
<p>citizens or organizations or to the interests of the society (art. 403). The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>was not reassured by the fact that officials told him that this law only targeted political 
</p>
<p>parties. He believes that the wording of article 403 is too vague, leaving room for broad and 
</p>
<p>subjective interpretation. For example, it is not clear what constitutes &#8220;interference in the 
</p>
<p>activities of State bodies&#8221;, nor when interference would be considered &#8220;illegal&#8221;. He 
</p>
<p>strongly encourages the Government to revise the aforementioned provisions to ensure that 
</p>
<p>they do not adversely affect members of public associations. 
</p>
<p>42. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was inspired by the many human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and other members of civil society organizations he met and who are engaged in 
</p>
<p>critically important work to strengthen the rule of law in Kazakhstan. In this context, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is deeply troubled by the case of Zinaida Moukhortova, a former 
</p>
<p>member of the Bar Association, who has been repeatedly subjected to forced psychiatric 
</p>
<p>treatment over the past four years. He finds it deeply disturbing that Ms. Moukhortova has 
</p>
<p>been placed on numerous occasions in psychiatric detention after she urged the authorities 
</p>
<p>to investigate possible corruption practices. He is also seriously concerned that numerous 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders have decided to stop their human rights work after being arrested. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>He underscores that human rights defenders play a crucial role in any country&#8217;s realization 
</p>
<p>of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and he urges the authorities to take 
</p>
<p>prompt appropriate actions to respect and protect their rights.  
</p>
<p>43. In the new Criminal Code, individuals identified as leaders of public associations 
</p>
<p>may be subject to a separate category of offences with aggravated penalties. However, the 
</p>
<p>definition of &#8220;leader&#8221; is so vaguely worded that civil society representatives fear that any 
</p>
<p>member of a public association may be deemed a leader. The Special Rapporteur is unclear 
</p>
<p>as to why leaders of public associations should be more dangerous than other individuals or 
</p>
<p>why there must be stricter criminal punishments for them. He is unaware of any proven 
</p>
<p>correlation between one&#8217;s profession or position and criminality. Rather, this law appears 
</p>
<p>simply to be a way to instil fear in civil society leaders who consider criticizing the 
</p>
<p>Government or its policies. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to repeal any laws 
</p>
<p>that discriminate against individuals on the basis of their affiliation with an association 
</p>
<p>carrying out peaceful activities. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government&#8217;s creation of a Consultative 
</p>
<p>Advisory Body or Platform for Dialogue on Human Dimension with non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, working notably on recommendations to the Government and Parliament. 
</p>
<p>Organized under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the consultative advisory body is 
</p>
<p>composed of various types of organizations, including groups working on human rights 
</p>
<p>issues and groups that are known to be critical of the Government. Civil society&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>involvement in the State&#8217;s decision-making process is an important component of pluralism 
</p>
<p>and democracy and can only benefit Kazakhstan. The Government has reportedly adopted 
</p>
<p>168 of the recommendations of the body, which signals the opening of a space for dialogue. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government not only to adopt technical 
</p>
<p>recommendations but also to embrace those recommendations that address systemic 
</p>
<p>shortcomings. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that a new grant-making mechanism &#8212; which 
</p>
<p>is being promoted by the consultative advisory body and, at the time of drafting the present 
</p>
<p>report, is supported by the Minister for Culture and Sports &#8212; may fall short of international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. Article 6 of the draft law on the introduction of changes and 
</p>
<p>addenda to certain legislative acts of Kazakhstan pertinent to the activity of non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations proposes the establishment of an operator to allocate grants to 
</p>
<p>public associations and to monitor the implementation thereof&#8221;. The responsibility of 
</p>
<p>allocating all grants &#8212; public and private &#8212; to public associations may give the operator 
</p>
<p>the power to control the entire sector. The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the 
</p>
<p>draft law be limited to applications for State grants. State bodies should not be in a position 
</p>
<p>to allocate private, international or foreign funds to public associations. Such arrangements 
</p>
<p>create an unacceptable risk of subjective and arbitrary allocation of funds. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also recommends that the operator body be guaranteed independence, for 
</p>
<p>instance, by including representatives of civil society in its composition. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Religious associations 
</b></p>
<p>46. Religious pluralism is a distinct characteristic of Kazakh society, and both the State 
</p>
<p>and the country&#8217;s people should be justifiably proud of this inclusive tradition. However, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur remains concerned at numerous legal provisions that go too far in 
</p>
<p>limiting the right to freedom of association in a religious context. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>endorses the recommendations pertinent to his mandate put forward by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, who undertook an official visit to Kazakhstan 
</p>
<p>in 2014 (see A/HRC/28/66/Add.1). More specifically, the Special Rapporteur on the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association shares the concerns of the Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief about the compulsory re-registration 
</p>
<p>requirements stipulated in the 2011 Act on Religious Activities and Religious Associations. 
</p>
<p>He agrees that registration should not be mandatory and that unregistered communities 
</p>
<p>should be able to operate free from discrimination or intimidation.  
</p>
<p>47. Under the Act, religious groups are required to re-register within a specified time 
</p>
<p>frame (i.e. one year) in order to obtain the status of a registered religious association at the 
</p>
<p>national, regional or local levels. The registration of religious groups at the national level 
</p>
<p>requires membership of at least 5,000 individuals; registration at the regional level requires 
</p>
<p>500 members; and registration at the local level calls for a minimum of 50 members. Only 
</p>
<p>Sunni Muslims, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church have been 
</p>
<p>registered at the national level, while other communities have been recognized in particular 
</p>
<p>regional or local territories only. In the absence of registration, religious groups are 
</p>
<p>effectively banned from exercising any collective religious functions. Members, 
</p>
<p>meanwhile, may face administrative sanctions if they routinely practice their rituals, even in 
</p>
<p>private homes &#8212; a fact that government officials confirmed during the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. In order to ensure compliance with international standards, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommends that the authorities seek assistance from the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief, the Council of Europe Venice Commission and the Kazakh 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Council. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the formation of an advisory 
</p>
<p>group involving representatives of religious associations and government bodies to develop 
</p>
<p>proposals on making further improvements to the legislation. 
</p>
<p>48. Government officials told the Special Rapporteur that such strict regulation of 
</p>
<p>religious groups was necessary to protect society against extremism, highlighting that at 
</p>
<p>least 300 individuals from Kazakhstan had gone to fight for Islamic State in Iraq and the 
</p>
<p>Levant in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. The Special Rapporteur agrees that extremism 
</p>
<p>is a serious concern. However, he underscores that extremism is more likely to grow in 
</p>
<p>circumstances where there are vast socioeconomic disparities and little space for 
</p>
<p>individuals to express their grievances. Extremism most often appeals to those who are 
</p>
<p>desperate, and the Government should be cautious that its policies do not contribute to 
</p>
<p>fostering such desperation. Banning peaceful religious groups is likely to do just that.  
</p>
<p>49. Officials informed the Special Rapporteur that the Act on Religious Activities and 
</p>
<p>Religious Associations might be amended in the future, but that there was currently a need 
</p>
<p>for greater transparency from religious organizations. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
</p>
<p>criminal groups will always find ways to circumvent transparency requirements and that the 
</p>
<p>Act on Religious Activities and Religious Associations is unlikely to make a significant 
</p>
<p>contribution in limiting extremism. He also believes that extremist groups are best tackled 
</p>
<p>through the Criminal Code, not by a law on religious activities and religious organizations. 
</p>
<p>While combating criminal activities is one of the core functions of a State, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur warns against any counter-extremism and counter-terrorism measures that may 
</p>
<p>have an adverse impact on freedom of association.2  
</p>
<p>50. Finally, the Special Rapporteur is concerned at the requirement for individuals 
</p>
<p>carrying out religious functions with some degree of public visibility to register as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;missionaries&#8221;. Specifically, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Act on Religious 
</p>
<p>Activities and Religious Associations had had adverse effect on Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, who 
</p>
<p>until the adoption of the legislation had reportedly not experienced major difficulties in 
</p>
<p>enjoying their rights to freedom of association and of religion or belief. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur wishes to highlight the case of the representative of the Christian Centre of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism (A/61/267). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses in Kazakhstan, who is a Russian national living in Kazakhstan for 
</p>
<p>more than 10 years. In November 2013, he was charged with illegal missionary activity 
</p>
<p>after he participated in a weekly peaceful religious meeting of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has been informed about several other examples of individuals 
</p>
<p>subjected to severe fines and seizure of documentation for unregistered &#8220;missionary 
</p>
<p>activity&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>51. Officials told the Special Rapporteur that Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses do not always enjoy 
</p>
<p>the support of all segments of society. However, this can never be a justification for 
</p>
<p>limiting their rights under international law. The Special Rapporteur finds it contradictory 
</p>
<p>to depict them as being isolated from the society, while at the same time preventing them 
</p>
<p>from gathering and publicly speaking about their religious beliefs to relatives, friends or 
</p>
<p>neighbours. He emphasizes that it is the duty of State authorities to proactively protect all 
</p>
<p>individuals against any form of stigmatization or discrimination and to ensure that everyone 
</p>
<p>enjoys his or her rights and freedoms. He strongly encourages the authorities to meet with 
</p>
<p>representatives from Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and any other religious groups to discuss ways to 
</p>
<p>ensure they enjoy their rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Exercising the right to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>52. The right to peacefully assemble, hold meetings, rallies and demonstrations, street 
</p>
<p>processions and pickets is guaranteed by the Constitution. However, in practice, the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s approach to regulating assemblies renders that right meaningless. The 1995 
</p>
<p>Law on the Procedure for Organizing and Holding Peaceful Assemblies, Meetings, 
</p>
<p>Marches, Pickets and Demonstrations requires that representatives of labour collectives, 
</p>
<p>public associations or separate groups of citizens of Kazakhstan who reached the age of 18 
</p>
<p>seek prior permission from local authorities at least 10 days before the date of the 
</p>
<p>gathering. Those requirements do not comply with international standards, which provide 
</p>
<p>that no authorization should be required to assemble peacefully and that everyone has the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association (Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>15/21)<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p>53. Furthermore, the law provides that the <i>maslikhat</i> and <i>akhimat</i>, the local 
</p>
<p>representative and local executive authorities, respectively, have the power to designate 
</p>
<p>specific sites where authorized assemblies can be held. Designation of these sites, usually 
</p>
<p>located in remote areas, prevents organizers and participants from choosing venues they 
</p>
<p>consider the most appropriate to express their aspirations and grievances.  
</p>
<p>54. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited Sari Arka square, which is the only 
</p>
<p>site in Almaty where gatherings are allowed. The square is located about seven kilometres 
</p>
<p>from the city centre, thus depriving demonstrators from the opportunity to express their 
</p>
<p>views and opinions within sight and sound of their target audience, for example, 
</p>
<p>government officials or fellow citizens in the areas of town with the highest density of 
</p>
<p>people. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned that in a city of about 1.5 million 
</p>
<p>inhabitants, the only designated place for assemblies is slightly bigger than a football pitch 
</p>
<p>and is located in a relatively distant residential area. 
</p>
<p>55. In these conditions, it is not surprising that 324 out of 497 assemblies recorded 
</p>
<p>between 2012 and 2014 were deemed &#8220;unsanctioned&#8221;, according to figures provided by the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice. Figures provided by the Government also show a decrease in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>number of requests for holding assemblies over the past few years, especially in the field of 
</p>
<p>civil and political rights. Officials in Aktau reported that no requests for assemblies were 
</p>
<p>received in 2013 and 2014.  
</p>
<p>56. Proceeding with an unauthorized assembly can carry significant criminal 
</p>
<p>consequences. Article 400 of the new Criminal Code imposes penalties for participation in 
</p>
<p>&#8220;illegal&#8221; assemblies &#8220;resulting in serious harm to the rights and interests of citizens&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Although those penalties have been reduced under the new Criminal Code, they remain 
</p>
<p>disproportionately severe and can include the deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>57. The Criminal Code also forbids providing &#8220;assistance&#8221; to &#8220;illegal&#8221; assemblies, 
</p>
<p>including by &#8220;means of communication&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur believes that this 
</p>
<p>provision unduly limits the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and 
</p>
<p>expression, by potentially making it a crime to promote a protest event. Indeed, it appears 
</p>
<p>that the provision is aimed at preventing activists from using social media and other 
</p>
<p>communication tools to organize. For the same reasons, the Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned at amendments to the Law on Communications, adopted in April 2014, which 
</p>
<p>grants the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office the power to suspend the operation of a network, including 
</p>
<p>the Internet, without a court order. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, while the right to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly may be subject to certain limitations under international human rights law, such 
</p>
<p>limitations must be exceptions and that cannot undermine the essence of the right. In his 
</p>
<p>meetings with government officials, the Special Rapporteur found a repeated overemphasis 
</p>
<p>on restrictions rather than the rights themselves. In rationalizing the numerous restrictions 
</p>
<p>on assemblies, authorities frequently cited traffic issues and the need to protect &#8220;the rights 
</p>
<p>of others&#8221;. Government officials also told the Special Rapporteur that limitations to 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly were necessary in order to prevent massive unrest and cited the recent 
</p>
<p>events in Ukraine as an example. The Special Rapporteur finds this justification 
</p>
<p>unconvincing. The local political, economic and social context in Kazakhstan is vastly 
</p>
<p>different. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur believes this is a misconstruction of the concept of human 
</p>
<p>rights. Although certain restrictions are allowed under paragraph 4 of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 15/21, the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation 
</p>
<p>Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide a clear 
</p>
<p>framework for the authorized limits under international human rights law. Fundamentally, 
</p>
<p>the scope of a limitation referred to in the Covenant shall not be interpreted so as to 
</p>
<p>jeopardize the essence of the right concerned and shall be interpreted strictly and in favour 
</p>
<p>of the rights at issue (see E/CN.4/1985/4, annex, paras. 2-3). In this context, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur underlines that the right to peaceful assembly must not be subject to prior 
</p>
<p>permission from the authorities, but at best by a notification procedure whose rationale is to 
</p>
<p>ensure police protection to demonstrators and bystanders.  
</p>
<p>60. By specifying that authorized assemblies can only be held at specific designated 
</p>
<p>sites and following the grant of permission from the State, the Special Rapporteur believes 
</p>
<p>that the right to freedom of assembly is treated as a privilege or a favour rather than a right. 
</p>
<p>Although in limited circumstances, for a certain period of time, the right to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly may legitimately be restricted in certain locations, prohibiting assemblies in all 
</p>
<p>locations but one designated area violates international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>61. Indeed, in November 2014, the Human Rights Committee found that Kazakh law 
</p>
<p>had violated the right to peaceful assembly in the case of Bakhytzhan Toregozhina and 
</p>
<p>ruled that the Government was under the obligation to review its legislation, in particular 
</p>
<p>the Law on the Order of Organization and Conduct of Peaceful Assemblies, Meetings, 
</p>
<p>Processions, Pickets and Demonstrations (see CCPR/C/112/D/2137/2012, annex, para. 9). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Kazakhstan to promptly and 
</p>
<p>effectively implement this decision, and every other view from treaty bodies that form part 
</p>
<p>of the human rights machinery.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur echoes the findings of the Human Rights Committee and 
</p>
<p>notes that the Government has admitted on multiple occasions that the Law on Assemblies 
</p>
<p>falls short of international standards. In 2007, for example, the Human Rights Commission, 
</p>
<p>a consultative body under the President, concluded in its baseline report on human rights in 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan that the 1995 Law had failed to comply with international standards. Among 
</p>
<p>other things, it highlighted the fact that the law did not differentiate between participants in 
</p>
<p>a gathering and monitors or passers-by, often resulting in the arrest of the latter.  
</p>
<p>63. In 2010, on the occasion of the universal periodic review of Kazakhstan, the 
</p>
<p>authorities committed themselves to making efforts to speedily draft and implement the 
</p>
<p>new law on the right to assembly with fewer demands regarding prior registration and 
</p>
<p>fewer requirements (see A/HRC/14/10, para. 97). That laudable commitment was reiterated 
</p>
<p>in the framework of the 2014 universal periodic review of Kazakhstan, when authorities 
</p>
<p>announced that a policy framework for a new law on peaceful gatherings and rallies was 
</p>
<p>being drafted by the relevant State authorities with the participation of civil society (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WG.6/20/KAZ/1, para. 120). Ahead of the Special Rapporteur&#700;s visit, the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice had prepared a report stating that the Government had taken a decision to develop 
</p>
<p>a draft law on amendments to certain legislative acts on ensuring security during mass 
</p>
<p>sports, cultural entertainment and other public events.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by these developments, but believes that the 
</p>
<p>promised reforms need to be approached with a greater sense of urgency. He notes, for 
</p>
<p>example, that, during his visit, no one in the Government was able to provide an update on 
</p>
<p>the status of the amendments to the Law on Assemblies.  
</p>
<p>65. He fears that the heavy-handed regulation of peaceful dissent has contributed to a 
</p>
<p>general decline in open civic participation, as exemplified by the decrease in the number of 
</p>
<p>applications to hold an assembly. This creates an increased impression that underlying 
</p>
<p>discontent may fester and become ripe for exploitation by extremist ideologies. He recalls 
</p>
<p>that the right to freedom of peaceful assembly is also crucial because it gives people a 
</p>
<p>peaceful outlet to air their grievances. Indeed, for this reason, it is a critical guarantor of 
</p>
<p>social peace and cohesion.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur thus encourages the authorities to consider a complete 
</p>
<p>overhaul of its approach to regulating peaceful assemblies, starting by repealing the 
</p>
<p>requirement of prior authorization and by allowing assemblies to take place in areas other 
</p>
<p>than the designated &#8220;protest spaces&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that he is at the 
</p>
<p>disposal of the authorities for any assistance they may require in the drafting of a new law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Practice 
</b></p>
<p>67. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that dozens of individuals had 
</p>
<p>planned to stage peaceful assemblies from 24 to 27 January 2015 in 10 separate locations. 
</p>
<p>In nine cases, authorities did not allow participants to hold assemblies in the locations of 
</p>
<p>their choice; they were permitted to proceed only in authorized venues. Organizers of the 
</p>
<p>tenth assembly eventually decided not to hold it. The Special Rapporteur also received 
</p>
<p>reports that some participants of the planned protests had been subjected to &#8220;preventive 
</p>
<p>detention&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. On occasion, authorities&#8217; strict adherence to the law&#8217;s wide-ranging regulation of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies has led to preposterous situations. For instance, police have used force 
</p>
<p>on multiple occasions to break up &#8220;one-person protests&#8221; &#8211; often from the Antigeptil group, 
</p>
<p>an ecological movement. On 2 February 2015, a peaceful individual attempting to submit a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>petition in support of the closed <i>ADAM Bol</i> newspaper was arrested, reportedly for 
</p>
<p>breaching the Law on Assemblies. On 6 October 2013, a race organized at a local stadium 
</p>
<p>in Almaty by dozens of peaceful individuals under the slogan &#8220;Kazakhs for sport&#8221; was 
</p>
<p>broken up by police because the gathering had not been authorized. On 31 October 2013, a 
</p>
<p>Halloween costume party organized through social media by a group of 15 peaceful 
</p>
<p>students in Pavlodar was dispersed on the same grounds. On 5 March 2014, force was used 
</p>
<p>against young children and their parents peacefully demonstrating against forced evictions 
</p>
<p>in Astana. These are just a few of the examples that were brought to the attention of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. In all of the cases, the Special Rapporteur considers authorities&#8217; actions 
</p>
<p>violated international law and standards.  
</p>
<p>69. Although officials assured the Special Rapporteur that local authorities did not 
</p>
<p>discriminate against assemblies on the basis of their content or message, reports from civil 
</p>
<p>society indicate otherwise. Requests to hold assemblies reportedly receive different 
</p>
<p>treatment depending on their content; protests over potentially controversial issues are less 
</p>
<p>likely to be authorized. For instance, a peaceful demonstration in Astana against the 
</p>
<p>proposed deportation of opposition leader Mukhtar Ablyazov from France to Kazakhstan 
</p>
<p>was rapidly broken up by police on 2 September 2013. A month later, a protest calling on 
</p>
<p>French authorities to keep Mr. Ablyazov in prison until the official extradition request by 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan had been examined &#8212; a stance favoured by the authorities &#8212; took place 
</p>
<p>without any police interference.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the use of &#8220;preventive detention&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;preventive warning&#8221;. Government officials justified such measures by saying that they 
</p>
<p>were used as a public service to &#8220;inform&#8221; citizens about the law. However, in the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this is a form of intimidation. It is also a blatant violation of the right of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly, as well as the rights to security and liberty.  
</p>
<p>71. Despite numerous challenges in the area of the right to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly, the Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that violence and excessive use of 
</p>
<p>force at protests is rare in Kazakhstan, with the dramatic events of Zhanaozen standing out 
</p>
<p>as an obvious exception. For example, tear gas seems to have rarely &#8212; if ever &#8212; been used 
</p>
<p>during public assemblies in Kazakhstan. An official order, meanwhile, prohibits the 
</p>
<p>apprehension of assembly organizers at the place where an assembly is taking place to 
</p>
<p>prevent agitation, although repeated forcible removal of assembly participants into police 
</p>
<p>minivans was brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention.3 This seems to illustrate a high 
</p>
<p>degree of responsibility by all sides, which the authorities should build on to further widen 
</p>
<p>the democratic space. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Zhanaozen crisis 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur visited the city of Zhanaozen, which was the epicentre of a 
</p>
<p>seven-month-long strike by oil workers lasting from May to December 2011. On 
</p>
<p>16 December 2011, clashes between demonstrators and police resulted in numerous deaths 
</p>
<p>and casualties. Two official statements were issued in the weeks following the events. 
</p>
<p>According to the statement delivered by the Prosecutor General on 25 January 2012, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;64 persons received gunshot wounds, 14 individuals died &#8212; the deaths of two of them not 
</p>
<p>being related to the violence &#8212; and 35 policemen were wounded as a result of the clashes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>According to the second statement issued by the Prosecutor General, on 22 February 2012, 
</p>
<p>at least &#8220;12 individuals died of gunshot wounds, two persons died from the injuries they 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 See Minister of Internal Affairs order 665 of 6 December 2000. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>sustained, one person died from burns suffered during the pillage of the Sulpak trade centre 
</p>
<p>and one person died from shotgun wounds that was unrelated to the riots&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>73. The strike began in May 2011, a few weeks after the presidential elections, and was 
</p>
<p>led by oil and gas workers from Karazhanbasmunai JSC, Ozenmunaigas and Ersai Caspian 
</p>
<p>Contractor LLC. The workers demanded an increase in pay and a halt to company 
</p>
<p>interference in trade union activities. Within weeks of the start of the strike, local courts 
</p>
<p>declared the action illegal on the grounds that assemblies were being held at hazardous 
</p>
<p>facilities in violation of the law. Hundreds of strikers were dismissed for participating in 
</p>
<p>these &#8220;illegal&#8221; &#8212; although, it should be emphasized, entirely peaceful &#8212; assemblies as a 
</p>
<p>result. The strike continued, however, along with public assemblies in Zhanaozen&#8217;s main 
</p>
<p>square.  
</p>
<p>74. In December 2011, local authorities decided to organize independence day festivities 
</p>
<p>on the same square where workers had been demonstrating for several months. On 16 
</p>
<p>December 2011, which is when Kazakhstan celebrates its independence, altercations 
</p>
<p>between a group of demonstrators and festivalgoers erupted. Police reportedly intervened 
</p>
<p>and moved the strikers into a corner of the square, before turning back. Shortly thereafter, a 
</p>
<p>group of young men, some wearing oil company jackets, reportedly began to destroy some 
</p>
<p>equipment related to the independence day celebration. Several facilities were allegedly set 
</p>
<p>on fire.  
</p>
<p>75. In response, police began firing live ammunition into the crowd. In a video made 
</p>
<p>available on social media,4 police can be seen firing their weapons indiscriminately, hitting 
</p>
<p>unarmed demonstrators in the back and fleeing the square.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur discussed the Zhanaozen crisis with the Office of the 
</p>
<p>General Prosecutor, the relatives of those who had lost their loved ones and with numerous 
</p>
<p>workers who had been demonstrating on 16 December 2011. He was left with the distinct 
</p>
<p>and troubling impression that, more than three years after this tragic crisis, the wounds had 
</p>
<p>not healed.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its efforts to increase 
</p>
<p>resources in the region, which could help to mitigate some of the underlying reasons for the 
</p>
<p>2011 strikes. He notes that most of the workers who were on strike had been gainfully 
</p>
<p>employed at the time of the visit. He also notes that practically all those who were 
</p>
<p>convicted for mass unrest (see para. 84 below) have now been released on parole. However, 
</p>
<p>there is more that needs to be done.  
</p>
<p>78. One of the most important steps towards healing involves finding out what exactly 
</p>
<p>happened in Zhanaozen. To this day, there is still conflicting information about the events 
</p>
<p>of 16 December 2011 &#8212; in particular the actions of the workers, possible agents 
</p>
<p>provocateurs and police action. It is not clear who participated in the violence, what police 
</p>
<p>forces did to separate violent individuals from peaceful demonstrators and bystanders 
</p>
<p>commemorating independence day, what circumstances led police forces to resort to lethal 
</p>
<p>force and who ordered the police to use lethal force.  
</p>
<p>79. In the absence of a clear understanding of the sequence of events, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur joins the call of OHCHR for an independent international inquiry into the crisis. 
</p>
<p>Such an independent investigation would make it possible to comprehensively shed light on 
</p>
<p>the crisis, restore trust in the justice system and allow the victims to heal, including through 
</p>
<p>moral compensation.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>80. The inquiry should also include an investigation of what happened in the city of 
</p>
<p>Shetpe, located a few kilometres away from Zhanaozen, where clashes on 17 December 
</p>
<p>2011 between police, workers and residents led to the death of one person. Dozens of others 
</p>
<p>were wounded by gunfire. Workers and residents were reportedly demanding the 
</p>
<p>restoration of communications to Zhanaozen, as telecommunications had reportedly been 
</p>
<p>cut off and several websites blocked in the days following the clashes there. 
</p>
<p>81. Following the completion of the inquiry, the Government must hold individuals, 
</p>
<p>including officials, accountable for their actions in Zhanaozen. Although five police 
</p>
<p>officers have been convicted for abuse of power following the events of 16 December, none 
</p>
<p>of them have been convicted for killing protesters. In fact, the vast majority of the police 
</p>
<p>officers on duty that day continued to perform their duties.  
</p>
<p>82. Likewise, there has been a conspicuous absence of charges against high-level 
</p>
<p>officials involved in supervising the police response. This is troubling, as President 
</p>
<p>Nazarbayev said on 21 December 2011 that the workers&#8217; demands were legitimate.5 
</p>
<p>According to reports,6 prosecutors said at the trial against police officers that the police 
</p>
<p>should have used alternative methods to respond to the mass disturbances.  
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a special fund had been established by the 
</p>
<p>Oblast of Mangystau to compensate survivors of the Zhanaozen events. A number of those 
</p>
<p>who were injured in 2011, including bystanders, have not been able to find employment 
</p>
<p>since. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Kazakhstan to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides victims 
</p>
<p>with additional opportunities to seek redress. 
</p>
<p>84. A few days after the violence, civil society organizations reported that as many as 
</p>
<p>700 persons had been arrested. While the vast majority of them were released in the 
</p>
<p>following days, 37 oil workers were charged with various crimes, including &#8220;organizing 
</p>
<p>and participating in mass unrest&#8221;. Among them was strike leader Roza Tulataeva, who was 
</p>
<p>paroled in November 2014. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the steps taken 
</p>
<p>by the authorities to parole the convicted workers and to provide them with job 
</p>
<p>opportunities to ensure their social rehabilitation and reintegration. However, he is gravely 
</p>
<p>concerned that, during the trial, almost all of the 37 defendants fully or partially retracted 
</p>
<p>their testimonies after claiming that they had been physically and psychologically abused 
</p>
<p>by police in detention. The allegations of mistreatment included severe beatings, 
</p>
<p>suffocation and threats to harm family members, all with the apparent aim of coercing 
</p>
<p>testimony against themselves or others. In fact, most of the defendants who had pleaded 
</p>
<p>guilty later alleged torture or other mistreatment. On 20 December 2011, one of the 
</p>
<p>detainees, Bazarbai Kenzhebaev, who had been arrested four days earlier, died from 
</p>
<p>injuries apparently sustained in custody. 
</p>
<p>85. Many of the victims and survivors with whom the Special Rapporteur met in 
</p>
<p>Zhanaozen expressed concerns about risks of reprisals for meeting with him. Indeed, the 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned surveillance incident in Aktau occurred the day before a meeting with 
</p>
<p>sources to discuss the 2011 events in Zhanaozen. 
</p>
<p>86. The Government formed a task force to investigate allegations of torture and ill-
</p>
<p>treatment of those detained, but it was comprised of representatives from the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Interior and the General Prosecutor and thus lacked the independence necessary to conduct 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>a proper investigation. Indeed, the panel determined that no crimes had been committed 
</p>
<p>against the detainees and, as a result, no one has ever been prosecuted for the alleged 
</p>
<p>torture. Although officials repeated that the trial of workers had been carried out in a 
</p>
<p>transparent manner, this is not sufficient to meet international standards related to the right 
</p>
<p>to a fair trial, which require thorough, independent and impartial investigations into all 
</p>
<p>allegations of ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>87. The recent adoption by Kazakhstan of a zero-tolerance policy towards torture and 
</p>
<p>the implementation of a national preventive mechanism are commendable. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur urges the Government to implement them retroactively and to re-examine the 
</p>
<p>convictions of the Zhanaozen workers. This will ensure that their convictions were not 
</p>
<p>made on the basis of coerced evidence and that the alleged perpetrators are brought to 
</p>
<p>justice.  
</p>
<p>88. Separately, the Special Rapporteur is disturbed that most of those convicted in 
</p>
<p>Zhanaozen had been known to be the most active organizers during the 2011 strikes. They 
</p>
<p>were engaged in legitimate associational activity and should not be blamed for the crisis.  
</p>
<p>89. The tragic events in Zhanaozen had a profound negative impact on the perception of 
</p>
<p>peaceful protests in Kazakhstan, sparking a wave of legal reforms that seemed driven by the 
</p>
<p>overriding aim of prohibiting assemblies whenever possible. It is also crucial to change 
</p>
<p>public perception of freedom of peaceful assembly in general, and of Zhanaozen strikers in 
</p>
<p>particular. As demonstrators were on occasions depicted as criminals, alcoholics or drug 
</p>
<p>addicts by some media outlets, authorities have a significant role to play to protect those 
</p>
<p>exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association from any form of 
</p>
<p>stigmatization, intimidation, threats or defamation. In 2011, opportunities to engage in 
</p>
<p>dialogue between strikers, company leaders and State representatives were missed. It is 
</p>
<p>therefore crucial that the authorities restore trust and mutual understanding so as to avoid 
</p>
<p>repeating mistakes from the past. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that facilitating 
</p>
<p>protests can be challenging but urges the Government to meet these challenges head on, 
</p>
<p>with the same energy and effort that Kazakhstan has used to approach its economic 
</p>
<p>development since 1991. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, authorities repeatedly made reference to 
</p>
<p><b>the rule of law to justify restrictions to the enjoyment of freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and of association. However, in practice, the Special Rapporteur believes that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Gove</b>rnment&#8217;s policies seem more driven by an adherence to &#8220;rule by law&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the law is an expression of the peoples&#8217; will 
</p>
<p><b>and is therefore meant to serve the people. The rule of law implies that individuals are 
</b></p>
<p><b>free to enjoy their human rights without prior authorization from State authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>Otherwise, the rule of law principle may turn into an arbitrary &#8220;rule by law&#8221; norm, 
</p>
<p><b>which is likely to erode the essence of these rights. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Kazakhstan to pay attention not only to the technical requirements of 
</b></p>
<p><b>its human rights obligations, but also to the spirit of these obligations. Although the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are not absolute, the essence 
</b></p>
<p><b>of these rights cannot be jeopardized by State-imposed limitations that are neither 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate nor proportionate to the aim pursued. Restrictions must be strictly defined 
</b></p>
<p><b>and narrowly interpreted in order to comply with the international human rights law.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Specia</b>l Rapporteur is concerned that the State&#8217;s current approach to <b>the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association has had an adverse effect on 
</b></p>
<p><b>public discourse. Opposition or dissenting views are frequently seen as a source of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible instability, rather than as a means to strengthen the rule of law. Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>has come a long way since 1991. Focus has been put on economic reforms to empower 
</b></p>
<p><b>people, but the younger generation, who did not live through the harsh Soviet period, 
</b></p>
<p><b>appear to have greater aspirations. It is natural that they want to take ownership of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their society by participating in public affairs. Authorities pointed out that 
</b></p>
<p><b>Kazakhstan has enjoyed rapid economic development, which in times of financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficulties and geopolitical changes may risk leading to social turmoil. These are 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate concerns that can only be addressed by ensuring that laws are in 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with international human rights standards and widening the democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>space. An enabling environment for civil society is a priceless means to allow 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities to continue pursuing ongoing reform processes with greater support from 
</b></p>
<p><b>the population but also to build robust institutions with representative, responsive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable governance that can protect the society against tumult. Any change is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge. Reforms require some dose of political courage and will, but the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur is convinced that Kazakhstan is capable of advancing the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in a short period of time.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the authorities to disseminate the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report widely, so that it can serve as a springboard for a public dialogue on expanding 
</b></p>
<p><b>civic space. The plan of Kazakhstan to develop a human rights action plan until 2020 
</b></p>
<p><b>to implement the universal periodic r</b>eview&#8217;s recommendations<b>, taking into account 
</b></p>
<p><b>the view of civil society, should outline the necessary actions to be taken to bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>national laws and practices in line with the different recommendations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights mechanisms in a holistic manner. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Although the present report highlights some shortcomings regarding the rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reiterate that his review and recommendations are offered in a spirit of constructive 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue. Kazakhstan has made remarkable progress in the economic realm since 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence, and the Special Rapporteur firmly believes that it is capable of 
</b></p>
<p><b>replicating this progress in the field of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>of association. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that he remains at the disposal of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities in helping them achieve these goals and is willing to conduct a follow-up 
</b></p>
<p><b>mission and provide technical assistance in the drafting of new laws or amendments. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes</b> <b>the following general recommendations:</b> 
</p>
