(i)
The Directors of Yancoal Australia Limited have provided a letter of non-demand and guarantee dated
29 February 2016 confirming that:
- for the related party payable by Yancoal SCN Limited, that it will not make any demand for the
repayment of the related party payable balance of US$12,665,000 without giving 12 month's notice, and

- Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited ("Yanzhou") have provided a Letter of Financial Support
("Letter") to Yancoal Australia Limited. The Letter provides undertakings to Yancoal Australia Limited
that it will provide financial support, unless revoked by giving not less than 24 month's notice, for so long
as Yanzhou owns at least 51% of the shares of Yancoal Australia Limited. Yanzhou will provide ongoing
financial support to Yancoal Australia Limited to enable it to pay its debts as and when they fall due; and
- The Directors of Yanzhou have provided financial support in the form of a A$1.4 billion facility

components of the Company that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODM”) in
order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. Yancoal SCN Limited only has one
segment due to the limited activities surrounding the administration and management of the Subordinated Capital
Notes ("SCN"). These financial statements accurately represent the reports presented to the CODM. The
geographical location of this segment is Australia.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF YANCOAL SCN LIMITED 
 
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Yancoal SCN Limited, which comprises the 
statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes 
comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information and the directors’ 
declaration. 
 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report 
 
The directors of Yancoal SCN Limited are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that gives 
a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001, and for 
such control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the half-year financial report that 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We conducted 
our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial 
Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the basis of the 
procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the half-year financial 
report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view of Yancoal SCN 
Limited's financial position as at 30 June 2015 and its performance for the period ended on that date; and 
complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 
2001. As the auditor of Yancoal SCN Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements 
relevant to the audit of the annual financial report. 
 
A review of the half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial 
and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not 
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Independence 
 
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.

the half-year financial report of Yancoal SCN Limited is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including:
