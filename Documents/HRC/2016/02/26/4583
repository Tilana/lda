<p><b>  15/&#8230;  Draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenants on Human Rights, the ideal of free human beings enjoying 
freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby 
everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his or her 
civil and political rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>all previous resolutions on the issue of human rights and extreme 
poverty adopted by the General Assembly and the importance they attach to giving persons 
living in extreme poverty the wherewithal to organize and participate in all aspects of 
political, economic, social and cultural life, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights, as well as relevant Council resolutions, including resolutions 2/2 of 27 November 
2006, 7/27 of 28 March 2008 and 8/11 of 18 June 2008, in which it extended the mandate 
of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, as well as 
its resolution 12/19 of 2 October 2009, in which it invited the independent expert to submit 
a progress report presenting her recommendations on how to improve the draft guiding 
principles on extreme poverty and human rights to the Council at its fifteenth session,  
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i>, in this regard, the commitments made at relevant United Nations 
conferences and summits, including those made at the World Summit for Social 
Development, held in Copenhagen in 1995, at the Millennium Summit, at which Heads of 
State and Government committed themselves to eradicate extreme poverty and to halve, by 
2015, the proportion of the world&#8217;s people whose income is less than one dollar a day and 
of those suffer from hunger, and at the 2005 World Summit, and welcoming the 
conclusions of the summit on the Millennium Development Goals held in New York from 
20 to 22 September 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, 
regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and 
manifestations are particularly severe in developing countries,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the primary role of States in the fight against extreme poverty and in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, emphasizing the role of international 
cooperation in support of such efforts, and emphasizing also the need to enhance 
international cooperation to raise the capacities of States to eradicate extreme poverty and 
to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, 
interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to 
fight extreme poverty at the local, national and regional levels,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, annexed 
to resolution 2006/9 adopted by the Subcommission for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights on 24 August 2006,  </p>
<p>1.<i> Takes note with satisfaction </i>of the progress report of the independent expert 
on the question of human rights and extreme poverty on the draft guiding principles on 
extreme poverty and human rights;1 
</p>
<p>2.<i> Affirms </i>that the fight against extreme poverty must remain a high priority for 
the international community; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Invites </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights: 
</p>

draft guiding principles submitted by the independent expert of States, relevant United 
Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, United Nations treaty bodies, relevant 
special procedures, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, 
especially those working with people living in extreme poverty, and other relevant 
stakeholders;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To organize, within existing resources, in Geneva before June 2011, a two-
day consultation on the progress report on the draft guiding principles with the independent 
expert and relevant stakeholders, including representatives of States, development and 
human rights practitioners and organizations at the local, national, regional and 
international levels; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To prepare and to submit to the Council, no later than its nineteenth session,

</p>

High Commissioner, to pursue further work on the draft guiding principles on extreme 
poverty and human rights with a view to submitting a final draft of the revised guiding

decision on the way forward with a view to the adoption by 2012 of guiding principles on 
the rights of persons living in extreme poverty.
