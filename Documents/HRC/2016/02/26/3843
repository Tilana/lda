<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Singapore from 
21 to 28 April 2010. 
</p>
<p> Following his visit, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the peaceful coexistence 
of the diverse communities in Singapore is a remarkable achievement in itself.  
</p>
<p>Due to the historical legacy of communal tensions, the Government of Singapore is 
acutely aware of the threats posed by racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. In this regard, numerous measures have been taken to combat these scourges 
and promote social cohesion, religious tolerance and what is referred to as &#8220;racial 
harmony&#8221;. Yet, the legitimate goal of searching for racial harmony may have created some 
blind spots in the measures pursued by the Government and may in fact, and to a certain 
extent, have further marginalized certain ethnic minorities.  
</p>
<p>In this context, the Special Rapporteur addresses issues related to restrictions on 
freedom of expression and assembly, the significance of ethnic identity, the situation in the 
fields of housing, education, employment, as well as human rights issues concerning 
migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>itself, contained in the annex to the summary, is being circulated in the language of 
submission only.

</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates several recommendations. Among others, he 
recommends that the Government: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Remove legislative provisions which unduly restrict the rights to freedom of 
expression and assembly and which prevent individuals living in Singapore from 
holding open and fruitful public debate on matters related to ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Remove the indication of one&#8217;s ethnic background on identification documents, so 
as not to perpetuate ethnic categorization of Singaporeans and to lessen the 
significance of ethnic identity in one&#8217;s interactions with the State and within 
Singaporean society at large.    
</p>
<p>&#8226; Set up a national body, instead of ethnically based self-help groups, to coordinate 
efforts and provide people living in Singapore with complementary social services 
in an equal manner. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consider making small adjustments to the public educational system, for instance 
with special temporary programmes, in order to allow Malay students to catch up 
with their Chinese counterparts.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Review guidelines, policies and practices that may prevent members of ethnic 
minorities to be employed in institutions that should reflect the diversity of 
Singapore, such as the armed forces, the police and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Act swiftly to ensure the protection of migrant workers&#8217; human rights. In this 
regard, he recommends that the implementation of the Employment Act be 
enhanced and extended so as to cover domestic workers; that efforts be made to 
ensure the expeditious resolution of labour disputes; and that a minimum wage for 
migrant workers particularly vulnerable to exploitation be introduced. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Accede to international human rights instruments containing provisions reaffirming 
the fundamental human rights principles of non-discrimination and equality.

<p> II. General background ................................................................................................  7&#8211;<footnote name="1">5. While expressing his appreciation that a range of human rights are protected by the 
Constitution, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the fact that some human rights are 
granted to Singaporean citizens, but not to non-citizens residing on Singapore&#8217;s national 
territory. For instance, the above-mentioned article 12, paragraph 2, and article 16, 
paragraph 1, specifically refer to rights granted to Singaporean citizens only. In addition, 
article 14 on freedom of speech, assembly and association stipulates that &#8220;(a) every citizen 
of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression; (b) all citizens of Singapore 
have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms; and (c) all citizens of Singapore 
have the right to form associations&#8221;.

interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore&#8221; and that &#8220;the Government shall 
exercise its functions in such manner as to recognize the special position of the Malays, 
who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility 
of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, 
educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language&#8221;; and 
article 154 on impartial treatment of Government employees, which provides that &#8220;all 
persons of whatever race in the same grade of the service of the Government shall, subject 
to the terms and conditions of their employment, be treated impartially&#8221;.

<p>  A. International human rights instruments ..........................................................  11&#8211;<footnote name="1">3. Part IV of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, on fundamental liberties, 
contains provisions of particular relevance to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. These 
include article 12, which states that &#8220;all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the 
equal protection of the law&#8221; (paragraph 1) and that &#8220;except as expressly authorised by this 
Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground 
only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any 
office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating 
to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of 
any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment&#8221; (paragraph 2); and article 16, 
paragraph 1, which provides that &#8220;without prejudice to the generality of Article 12, there 
shall be no discrimination against any citizen of Singapore on the grounds only of religion, 
race, descent or place of birth: (a) in the administration of any educational institution 
maintained by a public authority, and, in particular, the admission of pupils or students or 
the payment of fees; or (b) in providing out of the funds of a public authority financial aid 
for the maintenance or education of pupils or students in any educational institution 
(whether or not maintained by a public authority and whether within or outside 
Singapore)&#8221;. In addition, other human rights relating to, inter alia, liberty of the person, 
slavery and forced labour, freedom of movement, freedom of speech, assembly and 
association and freedom of religion, are also guaranteed by the Constitution.

had taken numerous and commendable initiatives to prevent and address the manifold 
human rights violations and sometimes physical abuse suffered by unskilled and semi-
skilled migrant workers, including domestic workers. These include awareness-raising and 
education programmes both for employers and employees; the conduct of random 
interviews of domestic workers during their initial months of employment; the monitoring 
of employers who change domestic workers frequently; assistance from the Ministry of 
Manpower in resolving labour disputes through mediation; the imposing of sanctions on 
employers when workers&#8217; wages are unpaid; and the enhancement of penalties by one and a 
half times for offences committed by employers against their domestic workers.  </footnote>6 8

children, regardless of their backgrounds, to learn and play together. It has also been 
successful in preserving the languages of the main ethnic groups by allowing pupils to be 
taught both in English and in their mother tongue, i.e. Mandarin, Malay or Tamil. During 
his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed about various education policies and 
programmes fostering tolerance, understanding and respect among the youth. For instance, 
school curricula include topics on social cohesion and harmony; interschool partnerships 
are organized for schools that are rather homogenous so that pupils may experience the 
existing ethnic and religious diversity in Singapore; and classroom arrangements are 
monitored so as to avoid any ethnic congregation. In addition, the Racial Harmony Youth 
Ambassador Programme seeks to develop a dynamic generation of youths from different 
backgrounds who participate actively in the development of a cohesive community.9 To 
that effect, it appoints Racial Harmony Ambassadors, whose tasks are, inter alia, to spread 
the message of multi-ethnic harmony among their families and friends, and to organize 
multi-ethnic activities. Another initiative relates to the yearly celebration in schools of the

workers, it is nonetheless concerned with discrimination on the grounds of national or 
ethnic origin preventing individuals from enjoying, inter alia, just and favourable conditions 
of work, equal pay for equal work, as well as equality before the law. In this regard, the 
living and working conditions of migrant workers, in particular of the unskilled and semi-
skilled ones commonly referred to as &#8220;transient workers&#8221;, were frequently raised during the 
mission.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Singapore from 
21 to 28 April 2010.  
</p>
<p>2. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of the 
Government and members of the legislative and judicial branches, in order to obtain their 
views concerning racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in 
Singapore, the adequacy of the existing legal and institutional human rights framework and 
the programmes and policies adopted by the authorities to fight these problems. A list of 
official meetings held during the visit is contained in the appendix. 
</p>
<p>3. Apart from the agenda with the Government and State institutions, the Special 
Rapporteur also had meetings with representatives of civil society, including community 
members, academics, lawyers and other organizations and private individuals.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
Singapore for its full cooperation and openness in the preparation and conduct of his visit, 
including for the organization of a rich programme. The Government&#8217;s readiness to 
organize a last-minute visit to the Changi Prison was much appreciated. He also wishes to 
convey his deep appreciation to all civil society stakeholders who provided him with 
information and assistance throughout the visit. The Special Rapporteur was particularly 
honoured to be the first special procedures mandate holder invited to visit the country in 
nine years. He hopes that many more special procedures will follow after his visit. 
</p>
<p>5. In order to assess the main challenges that lie ahead in the fight against racism and 
xenophobia in Singapore, the Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the authorities 
some key concerns, including those expressed by civil society actors. In this regard, he 
aimed to better understand the Government&#8217;s responses to those challenges and, in addition, 
how it identified existing problems and devised solutions thereto. The conclusions and 
recommendations in the present report are based on these rich exchanges with Singapore-
based interlocutors and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s own analysis. He hopes that they will 
contribute to finding concrete ways and means of addressing the challenges raised in the 
present report in an effective and human rights-compliant manner.  
</p>
<p>6. The present report is structured as follows: in chapter II, the Special Rapporteur 
briefly refers to the general background. He then examines the legal and institutional 
human rights framework to combat racism in chapter III. In chapter IV, the Special 
Rapporteur addresses a number of key issues in the fight against racism, presenting the 
views shared with the Special Rapporteur both by government officials and civil society. 
Finally, conclusions and recommendations are presented in chapter V.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Geography and history 
</b></p>
<p>7. Singapore consists of one main island and about 60 small ones, covering a land area 
of 682.7 km2. It is located between Malaysia and Indonesia, being separated from them by 
the Straits of Johor and the Straits of Singapore, respectively.  
</p>
<p>8. In 1963, Singapore (formerly a British colony) joined the Federation of Malaya, 
Sarawak and Borneo to form Malaysia. In 1964, deadly communal riots erupted between 
the ethnic Chinese and ethnic Malays. Over thirty lives were lost and hundreds of people </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>injured during these riots, which were by far the worst and most prolonged in Singapore&#8217;s 
post-colonial history. Singapore eventually separated from Malaysia and became a fully 
independent and sovereign State in 1965.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Demographic and ethnic composition 
</b></p>
<p>9. In 2009, the total population (comprising Singapore residents and non-residents) 
was just below 5 million and the resident population (comprising Singapore citizens and 
permanent residents) was about 3.75 million.1 
</p>
<p>10. According to the Government of Singapore, the ethnic composition of the 
population is as follows: ethnic Chinese constitute the majority of the population with 74.2 
per cent; ethnic Malays represent 13.4 per cent; ethnic Indians represent 9.2 per cent; and 
other ethnic groups, including Eurasians, represent 3.2 per cent.2 According to the 2000 
Singapore census of the population, 85 per cent of Singapore residents professed to have 
some religious faith or spiritual belief: 43 per cent were Buddhists, 15 per cent were 
Muslims, 15 per cent were Christians, 9 per cent were Taoists and 4 per cent were Hindus.3 
During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was told that there is a significant conflation of 
ethnic origin and religion in Singapore. Indeed, almost all Buddhists and Taoists are 
Chinese, about 80 per cent of Muslims are Malays and almost all Hindus are Indians.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>11. At the international level, Singapore is a State party to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement 
of children in armed conflict. Singapore is however not a party to the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur would like to reaffirm that a solid and robust legal 
framework is crucial to counter racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance in the most effective manner. While he understands that the Government of 
Singapore wishes to ensure that it is in a position to fully implement the obligations 
contained in an international treaty before ratifying it, he nonetheless takes the view that 
Singapore should accede to international human rights instruments which enshrine the 
fundamental principles of non-discrimination and equality and which would help to ensure 
the domestic legislation&#8217;s conformity with international human rights law. These include 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the

<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on

All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.

<p><b> B. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>may be confined to citizens, human rights are, in principle, to be enjoyed by all persons. 
Differential treatment based on citizenship or immigration status therefore constitutes 
discrimination if the criteria for such differentiation are not applied pursuant to a legitimate 
aim, and are not proportional to the achievement of this aim.  
</p>
<p>17. Consequently the Special Rapporteur would like to recommend that the 
aforementioned constitutional provisions relating to equal protection, freedom of speech, 
assembly and association, as well as rights in respect of education be equally guaranteed to 
non-citizens. It is indeed of crucial importance in a country like Singapore, where non-
citizens represent a sizeable part of the population, that all individuals enjoy the same 
human rights without discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Stand-alone law dedicated to the prohibition of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>18. As mentioned above, the Constitution contains provisions referring to the human 
rights principles of equality and non-discrimination. In addition, Singapore has a number of 
domestic legislative provisions relating to racism and racial discrimination and there exist 
enhanced penalties for racially aggravated offences (see section 74 of Singapore&#8217;s penal 
code). However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that there exists no stand-alone law 
dedicated to the prohibition of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance in Singapore. When asked whether it would consider drafting such a law, the 
Government answered that existing provisions were sufficient to prevent and combat 
racism and discrimination and that a non-discrimination statute of a general nature might 
not be the best option for Singapore.  
</p>
<p>19. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to paragraph 68 of the 
Durban Programme of Action, which urges States &#8220;to adopt and implement, or strengthen, 
national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter 
racism and prohibit racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, whether 
direct or indirect, in all spheres of public life, in accordance with their obligations under the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination&#8221;. The 
Government should therefore consider enacting a stand-alone legislation prohibiting racial 
discrimination in all areas of life, including employment, education and health. The benefits 
of a stand-alone legislative act include specific reporting, reviewing and enforcement 
mechanisms, as well as specific funding, which usually allows for more effective policies 
against racism. The enactment of a stand-alone legislative act also clearly demonstrates the 
State&#8217;s political commitment in the fight against racism. Moreover, it allows enhanced 
visibility and accessibility of the law for all individuals, thereby enabling them to resort to 
the law more easily and more effectively.

</p>
<p>persons of that community or indirectly by giving advantage to persons of another 
community&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>21. Given its constitutional status, PCMR, which is chaired by the Chief Justice of 
Singapore, appears to be the highest organ within the Government mandated with the task 
of protecting the rights of members of ethnic minorities. However, as noted above, PCMR 
is not generally empowered to act on its own initiative. Indeed, with very few exceptions,4 
all Bills and subsidiary legislation must be referred to it by the Speaker of Parliament or the 
appropriate Minister. As such, the Special Rapporteur was surprised to learn that in 40 
years of existence, PCMR had never issued an adverse report on any particular legislation 
or public policy that may have affected the rights of members of ethnic minorities. 
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur noted a potential conflict of interest between the dual 
role of the Chief Justice as head of an independent judiciary, to which a case may be filed 
on measures that have an adverse impact on members of a particular ethnic group, and as 
Chairperson of PCMR, who may issue an adverse report on a particular legislation or public 
policy which amounts to a differentiating measure.   
</p>
<p>22. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the authorities to 
review the mandate conferred to PCMR, so that the latter may consider, on its own 
initiative, any legislation or public policy and their impact on the rights of members of 
ethnic minorities. Moreover, he would like to suggest that the authorities ensure that the 
Chairperson of PCMR is not faced with potential conflict of interests and that the 
independence of PCMR is ensured.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main challenges in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>23. Singapore is rightly proud of its richly diverse society, where individuals from a 
wide range of ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds manage to cohabit and interact 
with each other on a small portion of territory. Considering that violent communal riots 
occurred just a few decades ago, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the 
peaceful coexistence of the diverse communities is a remarkable achievement in itself.  
</p>
<p>24. The historical legacy of ethnic and religious tensions still casts a long shadow over 
the social and political life of Singapore today. To address this, the authorities have 
continuously and actively promoted social cohesion, religious tolerance and what they refer 
to as &#8220;racial harmony&#8221;,5 as fundamental pillars of the city State. They have done so through 
a number of commendable policies and measures emphasizing tolerance, understanding and 
respect among the diverse ethnic and religious groups living in Singapore. The wide range 
of organizations providing common space for people to dialogue and learn about the 
cultural traditions and practices of the main ethnic groups in Singapore testify to the 
recognition that social harmony must not be taken for granted and that continuous efforts 
are needed to preserve it. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was deeply impressed by 
the work achieved by, inter alia, the National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious 
Harmony, the National Integration Council, the People&#8217;s Association, OnePeople.sg, as 
well as the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur was very much impressed by the level of community engagement by the 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See art. 78, para. 7, of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.  
 5 &#8220;Racial harmony&#8221; is one of Singapore&#8217;s five shared values. The other four shared values are: nation 
</p>
<p>before community and society before self; family as the basic unit of society; community support and 
respect for the individual; consensus, not conflict.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>population in fostering understanding and maintaining social cohesion, which undoubtedly 
constitute essential elements of nation-building in a young country like Singapore.  
</p>
<p>25. The wide-ranging measures taken by the authorities to foster racial harmony, 
discourage intolerance and preserve political stability and prosperity are widely appreciated 
by all sectors of the society. They indeed demonstrate that the Government is committed to 
confronting these challenges in an open manner. Yet, various interlocutors pointed out that 
the legitimate goal of searching for racial harmony may have created some blind spots in 
the policies and measures pursued by the Government. The Special Rapporteur would like 
to highlight some of these concerns in the following sections.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Restrictions on freedoms of expression and assembly  
</b></p>
<p>26. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed that there exist several 
legislative provisions which deal with the promotion of feelings of &#8220;enmity&#8221;, &#8220;ill-will&#8221; or 
&#8220;hostility&#8221; between members of the different ethnic groups in Singapore. These legislative 
provisions include sections 298 and 298A of Singapore&#8217;s Penal Code, sections 3 and 4 of 
the Sedition Act, section 4 of the Undesirable Publications Act and section 7 of the Public 
Order Act.  
</p>
<p>27. For instance, according to section 298A of the Penal Code, &#8220;whoever (a) by words, 
either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, knowingly 
promotes or attempts to promote, on grounds of religion or race, disharmony or feelings of 
enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious or racial groups; or (b) commits any 
act which he knows is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different 
religious or racial groups and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity, 
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, 
or with both&#8221;. Section 4 of the Undesirable Publications Act states that &#8220;for the purposes of 
this Act, a publication is objectionable if, in the opinion of any controller, it &#8230; describes, 
depicts, expresses or otherwise deals with &#8230; (b) matters of race or religion in such a 
manner that the availability of the publication is likely to cause feelings of enmity, hatred, 
ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups&#8221;. Section 7 of the Public 
Order Act provides that the police may refuse to grant a permit for a public assembly or 
public procession if it has reasonable ground for apprehending that the proposed assembly 
or procession may &#8220;cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different 
groups in Singapore.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>28. It appears that the above-mentioned restrictions are aimed at framing and limiting 
any public debate or discourse on issues that are regarded as highly sensitive. Given 
Singapore&#8217;s historical legacy, the concerns of the authorities with regard to communal 
tensions are understandable. Yet, the Special Rapporteur takes the view that it is absolutely 
necessary in a free society that restrictions on public debate or discourse and the protection 
of racial harmony are not implemented at the detriment of human rights, such as freedom of 
expression and freedom of assembly. During his mission, many interlocutors assured the 
Special Rapporteur that the Singaporean society had evolved substantially from the days of 
the violent confrontations 45 years ago, and that it was now able to hold open public debate  </p>
<p>on a sensitive issue like ethnicity in a dispassionate and fruitful manner. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore believes that the time is ripe for the authorities to review any undue 
legislative restrictions that may exist in the statute books in order to allow all individuals 
living in Singapore to share their views on matters related to ethnicity, to identify potential 
issues of discomfort and above all, work together to find solutions.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Significance of ethnic identity 
</b></p>
<p>29. Despite the existence of various policies and institutions seeking to provide all 
ethnic groups with equal opportunities, it would appear that the significance of ethnic 
identity has not diminished. Some of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors said it has even 
increased in one&#8217;s interactions with the State and within the Singaporean society at large. 
Consequently, he notes that individuals find themselves classified into distinct categories 
defined along ethnic lines. As an illustration, the ethnic identity of all Singaporeans is 
indicated on their identification documents and is used in a variety of purposes, including 
the choice of mother tongue instruction in schools and the ethnic quotas in the field of 
public housing (see sections below on housing and education).     
</p>
<p>30. Another example of ethnic categorization relates to the existence of &#8220;self-help 
groups&#8221; funded by the Government along ethnic or religious lines. While the Special 
Rapporteur was informed by the Government that there were various national schemes and 
programmes providing help to communities, including financial assistance to the needy 
through, for example, the Community Care Endowment Fund, these self-help groups seem 
to play a critical role in the provision of complementary social services, in particular in the 
field of education. Thus, the Yayasan Mendaki is to assist members of the Malay 
community, the Chinese Development Assistance Council has been established for 
members of the Chinese community, the Singapore Indian Development Association for 
members of the Indian community, the Eurasian Association for members of the Eurasian 
community and the Association of Muslim Professionals for members of the Muslim 
community.  
</p>
<p>31. According to the Government, these self-help groups provide tailored responses to 
the needs of each community, because they draw on and mobilize deep-seated ethnic, 
linguistic and cultural loyalties. Yet, various interlocutors questioned the compatibility of 
these officially endorsed self-help groups with the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and 
multicultural ideals promoted by the Government. Besides fears about the emphasis put on 
ethnic differences, concerns have been expressed that the smaller organizations are actually 
unable to compete with the Chinese self-help group, owing to its substantially larger 
financial resource base.6 Hence, it is felt that a more effective strategy might be to have a 
national body, instead of ethnically-based ones, to co-ordinate efforts and provide 
assistance to all individuals living in Singapore in an equal manner.  
</p>
<p>32. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the self-help groups have 
occasionally pooled their resources to launch joint initiatives and that organizations such as 
OnePeople.sg provide valuable common space to all self-help groups, he nonetheless 
supports the idea of having a national body. In this regard, he takes the view that a national 
body would lessen the significance of ethnic identity in one&#8217;s interactions with the State 
and within Singaporean society at large. Such a body would also help remedy the 
challenges faced by individuals of mixed origins or those who do not belong to the main 
ethnic groups, who seem to have difficulty in relating to any of the existing self-help 
groups.  
</p>
<p>33. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed about the system of group 
representation constituencies (GRCs),7 which was introduced to &#8220;ensure the representation 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Self-help groups mainly rely on financial contributions by members of their respective communities. 
</p>
<p>Since the Chinese community is the largest in Singapore, the Chinese Development Assistance 
Council is therefore the one endowed with the most significant resources.    
</p>
<p> 7 Members of Parliament consist of elected, non-constituency and nominated Members. Most Members  </p>
<p>are elected to Parliament during a general election and represent either single member or group 
</p>
 

<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>in Parliament of Members from the Malay, Indian and other minority communities&#8221;, 
according to article 39A of the Constitution. The official and laudable rationale behind the 
1988 introduction of GRCs was to ensure that the needs, concerns and views of minority 
groups would not be ignored or neglected in an ethnically Chinese-dominant Singapore. 
Further, the authorities claimed that this measure would help counter the tendency of voters 
to vote along ethnic lines. Under the GRC scheme, voters therefore elect on a &#8220;one person, 
one vote&#8221; basis a team of Members of Parliament (rather than an individual Member of 
Parliament), of which there must be at least one minority candidate from a designated 
ethnic background. While the Special Rapporteur understands the well-intentioned rationale 
behind the GRC system, he was told that this scheme had actually institutionalized and 
entrenched the minority status of certain ethnic groups within Singaporean society. It was 
underlined that the system reinforced the views that members of minority groups were not 
electable on their own and that they needed to be part of a group of Members of Parliament 
to be able to get a seat in the Parliament of Singapore.   
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his concerns vis-&#224;-vis the above-
mentioned schemes. Indeed, he takes the view that they may tend to reinforce and 
perpetuate ethnic categorization, which in turn may lead to certain prejudices and negative 
stereotypes held against certain minority groups taking root. The Special Rapporteur 
believes that the benefits of a society that allows for more permeability between delimited 
ethnic categories and in which social interactions are not predetermined by ethnic identity 
cannot be overemphasized. In this context, he would like to suggest, as a starting point, that 
the identification documents should not indicate the ethnic background of individuals. 
While he was informed during his mission that this practice had been made more flexible to 
enable individuals of mixed origins to display several ethnic backgrounds, the Special 
Rapporteur nonetheless would like to emphasize that removing the ethnic background of 
individuals from identification documents would represent an important step in order to 
accord less significance to the ethnic identity in one&#8217;s interactions with the State and within 
Singaporean society at large.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Housing 
</b></p>
<p>35. In 1989, the Government introduced the Ethnic Integration Policy in order to prevent 
the formation of ethnic enclaves and, more generally, to promote racial harmony. Under 
this policy, each of the main ethnic groups, i.e. Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians, has 
a maximum quota of homes that may be rented or purchased by them in each public 
housing block and neighbourhood. Once the maximum quota has been reached for a 
particular ethnic group, no further sale or rental of apartments to members of that group 
will be allowed, unless the transaction is between members of the same ethnic group. 
Flexibility may be exercised vis-&#224;-vis mixed couples, so that they may choose if they want 
to be considered as pertaining to one ethnic group or the other. During his mission, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that a quota for permanent residents had been introduced 
in March 2010. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur was told by almost all his interlocutors that this policy had 
been generally successful in terms of social integration. Indeed, it allows the great majority 
of Singaporeans8 from diverse ethnic backgrounds to mix together. As a result, almost 
</p>
<p>  
representation constituencies (GRCs). Parties must field a team of five or six candidates in each GRC; 
the winning team is elected &#8220;en bloc&#8221; under a first-past-the-post system, as are individual Members of 
Parliament. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>every neighbourhood may be seen as a thumbnail representation of Singapore as a whole. 
Each precinct contains flats of different sizes so that households of different income and 
social profiles live together. Common spaces and shared facilities such as playgrounds or 
fitness corners enable all communities to regularly interact and to gain entrance into each 
other&#8217;s world of food, festivals or social customs. In particular, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
attention was drawn to the &#8220;void decks&#8221; situated on the ground floor of each public housing 
block. These shared open spaces, where weddings, funerals or group games frequently take 
place, were highlighted as representing an important element of multi-ethnic, multi-
religious and multicultural life in Singapore.  
</p>
<p>37. While the rationale and objectives of the Ethnic Integration Policy may be laudable, 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that its implementation had actually created new 
problems. For instance, it was alleged that the existing public housing quotas may prevent 
members of ethnic minorities from finding accommodation close to their families. 
Moreover, since this policy prevents individuals from selling their flats to members of other 
ethnic groups if the maximum quota for these ethnic groups is reached, ethnic minorities 
seem to encounter greater difficulties in reselling their apartments in the secondary market 
to members of their minority group. In this regard, several civil society interlocutors 
stressed the fact that, for ethnic minorities, the pool of potential buyers was smaller and 
therefore the selling price would be lower than if they were allowed to sell their properties 
to members of the ethnic Chinese group, for instance. In addition, some civil society 
interlocutors expressed their concerns that this policy based on ethnic grounds may 
contravene article 12, paragraph 2, of the Constitution with regard to the acquisition, 
holding or disposition of property (see para.  13 above). 
</p>
<p>38. Although the implementation of the Ethnic Integration Policy may already be of a 
rather complex nature, the Special Rapporteur would therefore like to suggest that more 
flexibility be allowed in its implementation, so that members of ethnic minorities may be 
able to find accommodation close to their families, for instance. Moreover, while there 
seems to be general agreement that this policy has benefited Singapore society as a whole, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the authorities to keep it under constant 
review, so as to take into account the evolving needs of the population living in Singapore.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Education 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day on 21 July to mark the anniversary of the 1964 communal riots. 
According to the Ministry of Education, this day serves to remind Singaporean pupils that 
promoting social cohesion and racial harmony requires constant effort. It is a day for 
schools to reflect on and celebrate the success of Singapore as a harmonious nation and 
society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur would like to commend the Government for these fruitful 
policies and programmes. He indeed takes the view that they have very much contributed to 
the peaceful coexistence of the diverse communities in Singapore and as such, constitute 
good practices that may be shared with other States.      
</p>
<p>41. According to Government officials, the principle of meritocracy, which is at the core 
of the public educational system and Singaporean society more generally, ensures that all 
children are offered equal opportunities. On the face of it, meritocracy appears to be a 
laudable and legitimate principle. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that where there 
are acknowledged historical inequalities, as is the case with Malay students, this principle 
may contribute to entrenching these inequalities, rather than to correcting them. Despite 
statistics showing that great progress has been made in the last decades, Malay students 
seem to always remain below national average. As an illustration, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed that since Singapore&#8217;s independence, only two Malay students had been 
granted the President&#8217;s Scholarship, which is awarded to the best students in the country. 
Moreover, although the proportion of Malay pupils with at least five O-level passes has 
increased from 46 per cent in 1998 to 59.4 per cent in 2007 and the proportion of a Malay 
Primary One cohort admitted to post-secondary education institutions has increased from 
62.6 per cent in 1998 to 83.5 per cent in 2007, the performance of their Chinese 
counterparts has consistently remained better over the years.10  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur was told during his mission that all communities adhered to 
the principle of meritocracy and that none would support the introduction of ethnic quotas. 
Yet, he would like to stress that Malay students who are persistently left behind may find it 
difficult to continue to adhere to the principle of meritocracy in the future. Indeed, if this 
principle is not perceived as benefiting all individuals living in Singapore in an equitable 
manner, members of the Malay community may well start to feel some resentment in the 
years or decades to come.  
</p>
<p>43. In addition to the above, the Special Rapporteur was informed that Special 
Assistance Plan (SAP) schools had been established in 1979 to provide an enriched 
teaching and learning environment for academically gifted students, who are destined to 
form the cultural elite of the country. He was also informed by the Ministry of Education 
that there exist equivalent programmes to nurture gifted Malay and Tamil students, albeit 
not in a whole-school setting. While English is the primary language of instruction in SAP 
schools and the latter appear to be open to all students, these schools are de facto restricted 
to Mandarin speakers. Indeed, the Special Rapporteur was told by various interlocutors that 
SAP schools seek to promote Mandarin as a tool for cultural transmission, but also for its 
economic advantage in terms of trade and investment in mainland China. This has led to 
some resentment among non-Mandarin speakers. Critics argue that these schools favouring 
Chinese language and culture are a visible symbol of the marginalization of ethnic 
minorities, and that they create the impression that there is a hierarchy of cultures in 
Singapore. In this context, critiques have also been expressed vis-&#224;-vis the fact that non-
Chinese students were not allowed to study Mandarin in schools. They are compelled to 
take courses in their mother tongue and must ask for special permission from the Ministry

</p>
<p>of Education before they can study Mandarin. This policy has been perceived by some 
interlocutors as denying access to the Mandarin language, which is regarded as an 
economically useful language. 
</p>
<p>44. Education is undoubtedly one of the most efficient tools to create a cohesive and 
tolerant society, in which all children may be taught how diverse ethnic and national groups 
can coexist peacefully. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the 
authorities to ensure that the educational interests of Malay students are protected and 
promoted, in accordance with article 152 of the Constitution and international human rights 
standards. While there can be no doubt that meritocracy guarantees equality of 
opportunities, special measures within clearly defined timelines may help to address 
historical inequalities. In this context, he would like to encourage the authorities to consider 
making small adjustments to the educational system, for instance with special temporary 
programmes allowing Malay students to catch up. He also would like to suggest that all 
special programmes subsidizing tuition fees for Malay students be supported directly by the 
Government, rather than through the Yayasan Mendaki self-help group. In this manner, the 
Government could reinforce the message that the persistent lagging behind of the Malay 
community in the field of education is not an issue to be addressed in isolation by the 
Malay community, but rather an issue that should be dealt with at the national level.  
</p>
<p>45. In addition to the above, the Special Rapporteur takes the view that in a society 
based on meritocracy, special schools for the most deserving students should be open to all, 
so that students from all communities may develop their skills in a non-discriminatory 
manner. On the question of the mother tongue taught at school, the Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that this is a complex issue and that there is therefore no ready-made solution 
to it. He appreciates the Government&#8217;s willingness to preserve the cultural features, 
including language, of each main ethnic group. However, he takes the view that the 
Government may consider ways of implementing its educational policy in a more flexible 
manner, so as to allow children to choose what language other than English they would like 
to take at school.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>46. During his official meetings, the Special Rapporteur was informed of the 
promotional approach taken to address problems of discrimination against job-seekers and 
workers from certain ethnic or religious backgrounds. In this regard, he welcomes the 
initiatives taken by the Ministry of Manpower and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair 
Employment Practices aimed at educating employers and employees about the principle of 
non-discrimination or at resolving labour issues related to discrimination through 
mediation. In particular, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the Tripartite 
Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, aimed at promoting merit-based employment 
practices and preventing discrimination at the workplace. These guidelines clearly state that 
&#8220;race should not be a criterion for the selection of job candidates as multiracialism is a 
fundamental principle in Singapore. Selection based on race is unacceptable and job 
advertisements should not feature statements like &#8216;Chinese preferred&#8217; or &#8216;Malay 
preferred&#8217;&#8221;.11 These guidelines also touch upon the issue of language requirements; for 
instance, they provide that &#8220;if a job entails proficiency in a particular language, employers 
should justify the need for the requirement. This would reduce ambiguity and minimise

<p>incidence of misunderstanding between the job seekers and the recruiting party&#8221;.12 Other 
fruitful initiatives include the organization of various workshops on how to, inter alia, 
handle grievances, create an inclusive workplace, manage diversity and understand 
assumptions.    
</p>
<p>47. According to information provided by the Tripartite Alliance, the promotional 
approach aimed at changing mindsets among employers, employees and the general public 
to adopt fair and equitable employment practices has had good results. For instance, 
whereas before 1999 the ethnic criterion was referred to in 34 per cent of job ads, there is 
almost no mention of it in job ads today. Likewise, the Tripartite Alliance argues that the 
language criteria used to be mentioned in 20 per cent of job ads before 2006 and that this 
percentage has now been reduced to 1 per cent.13 In addition, the media allegedly also 
examines the content of job advertisements and may refuse to publish them if they are not 
compliant with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices. 
</p>
<p>48. Notwithstanding these achievements, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn 
to the difficulties and negative stereotypes faced by members of the Indian and Malay 
communities in the field of employment. For instance, the Special Rapporteur received 
reports indicating that Indian individuals applying for professional positions had been 
dismissed because they were not regarded as being hard workers. He was also told that 
Malay individuals continue to be underrepresented in senior positions in critical institutions 
that should reflect the diversity of Singapore, such as the armed forces, the police and the 
judiciary. Perceived lack of loyalty from members of the Malay community would appear 
to explain why they remain unable to gain access to sensitive positions in these institutions. 
While guidelines, policies and practices leading to the underrepresentation of the Malay 
community in these institutions may have found some political legitimacy during the few 
years immediately following the independence of the country, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to encourage the authorities to urgently review all of them, so as not to 
perpetuate the views that Singaporean citizens of Malay background cannot be trusted. In a 
diverse society like Singapore, it is all the more important for the authorities to ensure 
sufficient representation of the ethnic minorities in all employment sectors. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to suggest that the authorities consider adopting legally 
binding provisions prohibiting discrimination of all kinds, including on the grounds of 
ethnic or national origin, in the field of employment. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Migrant workers  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Integrating recent migrants into Singaporean society  
</b></p>
<p>49. In order to satisfy the demands of a fast-growing economy and counter a declining 
birth rate and ageing population, the Government has supported a significant influx of 
foreign workers &#8211; both skilled and unskilled &#8211; over the last decades. These foreign workers, 
who represent today about one third of the workforce residing in Singapore, have 
undoubtedly contributed to the building and the prosperity of this young nation. Yet, their 
presence has also created challenges for the Singaporeans. The Special Rapporteur was told 
both by Government officials and civil society actors that the recent immigration of 
individuals coming mainly from China and India had led to some resentment in the

</p>
<p>Singaporean population. Indeed, these recent migrants had in some instances been 
perceived as taking away jobs from Singaporean citizens, threatening Singaporean families, 
affecting the fragile national demographic balance or raising security concerns when 
foreign workers&#8217; dormitories are built close to residential areas. In fact, whereas numerous 
interlocutors recognized that there were today fewer tensions between the so-called &#8220;old&#8221; 
communities (i.e., ethnic Chinese, ethnic Malays, ethnic Indians and others) residing in 
Singapore since independence, they also acknowledged that new challenges had surfaced in 
terms of interactions between the old and newly arrived communities.   
</p>
<p>50. There was also a perception among some civil society interlocutors that the 
Government seemed to favour migrant workers from certain countries, in particular from 
China. According to these interlocutors, the rationale behind this policy would be to 
maintain the ethnic Chinese population above the critical threshold of 75 per cent. In this 
context, the interlocutors would like the authorities to provide them with more information, 
so that the parameters used to design immigration policy, in particular when relating to 
employment, may be more open and transparent.   
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur believes that the concerns described above, if unaddressed 
in a timely and open manner by the Government, could alter the peaceful coexistence of the 
great variety of ethnic and national groups residing in the country. This could indeed lead to 
generalized resentment against foreigners in Singapore and thus to overt xenophobic 
attitudes. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to support the work undertaken 
by the National Integration Council (NIC), set up in 2009, which seeks to promote and 
foster social integration among Singaporeans and new immigrants. To that effect, NIC 
encourages collaborative social integration efforts among the people, the public and the 
private sectors, through various initiatives at schools, workplaces, in the media and at the 
community level. According to some civil society interlocutors, however, NIC would 
mainly focus its work on the social integration of skilled migrant workers and would 
therefore not pay sufficient attention to those who were unskilled or semi-skilled, who often 
live in isolation from the rest of the Singaporean society. The Special Rapporteur therefore 
would like to encourage NIC to include unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers &#8211; who 
sometimes stay for several years &#8211; in their programmes, so that they may also enjoy the 
benefits of social integration into Singaporean society.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Enhancing the living and working conditions of unskilled and semi-skilled migrant 
workers, including domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>54. Yet unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers continue to face a number of 
difficulties. These include the abuses by labour-recruitment agencies in Singapore and in 
the countries of origin; the sponsorship system, which places migrant workers in a highly 
dependent relationship with their employer and severely limits labour mobility; unpaid 
salaries; unilateral cancellations of work permits by their employers; poor and unhygienic 
living conditions; or denial of medical insurance by their employers contrary to official 
policy. Concerns relating to migrant workers being trafficked into the country were also 
raised by some civil society representatives. 
</p>
<p>55. Migrant domestic workers, who constitute about one fifth of the migrant 
workforce,14 also face a number of additional difficulties due to their exclusion from the 
Employment Act and to their isolated working environment. For instance, migrant domestic 
workers are not always accorded a day of rest per week; in practice they are not always 
granted annual or medical leave; they are automatically deported if found pregnant and are 
prohibited from marrying Singaporean men. Migrant domestic workers may also be 
prevented from leaving the house, due to the employer&#8217;s fear of losing the S$ 5,000 
compulsory security bond, which seeks to ensure that the employers repatriate their work-
permit holders once the term of employment ends.  
</p>
<p>56. While the Special Rapporteur received assurances from relevant authorities that 
these issues are under review, he would like to strongly urge the Government to act swiftly 
to ensure the protection of migrant workers&#8217; human rights, as this is one area where the 
situation is dire. In this regard, he particularly welcomes the fact that the enforcement of a 
standard contract offering enhanced protection to migrant domestic workers is currently 
under review by the Ministry of Manpower. The Special Rapporteur also would like to 
suggest that the Government extend and enhance the effective implementation of the 
Employment Act; that efforts be undertaken to ensure that labour disputes are resolved 
expeditiously through accessible and effective mechanisms; and that a minimum wage for 
unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers particularly vulnerable to exploitation, such as 
construction and domestic workers, be introduced.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Countering ethnic stereotypes concerning migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Government has, to a large extent, determined the employment areas in which 
members of certain foreign communities can work. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed that for each sector of employment, there exists a list of &#8220;approved source 
countries or territories&#8221; from which employers may hire foreign workers. For instance, 
domestic workers may originate from Indonesia, Myanmar or the Philippines, but not from 
China; the construction sector may hire migrant workers only from Bangladesh, China, 
India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and a few other Asian countries; and service sector 
companies may recruit workers from China; Hong Kong, China; Macao, China; Malaysia; 
the Republic of Korea; and Taiwan Province of China. This policy of approved source 
countries or territories implemented by the Ministry of Manpower has raised concerns 
among civil society actors. They argue that this policy may entrench ethnic stereotypes 
within Singaporean society by associating certain low-skilled professions with certain 
nationalities and that this may taint the rest of the employment system. For instance, 
women from Indonesia and the Philippines would in most cases be perceived as being 
domestic workers. The Special Rapporteur therefore would like to suggest that the 
authorities consider reviewing their policy concerning the list of approved source countries 
</p>
<p>  
 14 It is roughly estimated that one in seven households in Singapore employs a foreign domestic worker 
</p>
<p>whose tasks are to cook, clean, tidy and take care of the children and the elderly.  </p>

<p>or territories, so as to prevent and address the negative stereotypes applied to certain ethnic 
or national groups which are associated with unskilled or low-skilled professions.  
</p>
<p>58. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received reports concerning ethnic or national 
bias in salaries. As such, it appears that the principle of meritocracy would not apply to 
domestic workers and that, as a consequence, a maid from the Philippines would earn more 
than a maid from Indonesia, for instance. While these economic differences between 
national or ethnic groups do not stem from a deliberate governmental policy, some civil 
society interlocutors were nonetheless of the view that this economic differentiation was 
backed up by a range of prejudices and stereotypes affecting particular ethnic or national 
groups among unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers.  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Singapore is rightly proud of its richly diverse society, in which individuals 
from a wide range of backgrounds manage to cohabit and interact with each other on 
a small territory. Considering that violent communal riots occurred just a few decades 
ago, the peaceful coexistence of the diverse communities in Singapore is a remarkable 
achievement in itself.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Due to the historical legacy of communal tensions, the Government of 
Singapore is acutely aware of the threats posed by racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. In this regard, the authorities have endeavoured 
to establish laws, policies and institutions that seek to actively combat these scourges 
and to continuously promote social cohesion, religious tolerance and what they refer 
to as &#8220;racial harmony&#8221;. The numerous measures taken by the authorities to preserve 
political stability and foster understanding among the diverse ethnic and religious 
groups living in Singapore testify to the recognition that social harmony must not be 
taken for granted and that continuous efforts are needed to preserve it. As such, these 
measures are widely appreciated by all sectors of the society.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Yet, the Special Rapporteur notes that the legitimate goal of searching for 
racial harmony may have created some blind spots in the measures pursued by the 
Government and may in fact, and to a certain extent, have further marginalized some 
ethnic minorities. Even if there is no institutionalized racial discrimination in 
Singapore, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the marginalization of ethnic 
minorities must be acknowledged and acted upon in order to safeguard the stability, 
sustainability and prosperity of Singapore. In this regard, he would like to make the 
following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On restrictions to freedom of expression and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government review undue 
legislative restrictions on public debate or discourse related to matters of ethnicity. 
Given Singapore&#8217;s historical legacy, the Special Rapporteur understands that matters 
related to ethnicity may be regarded as highly sensitive. Yet the protection of racial 
harmony should not be implemented at the detriment of human rights, such as 
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. The Special Rapporteur therefore 
recommends that the Government remove legislative provisions preventing all 
individuals living in Singapore from holding open public debate on matters related to 
ethnicity, so that they may share their views, identify potential issues of discomfort 
and above all, work together to find solutions. </b></p>

<p><b>  On the significance of ethnic identity 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Despite the existence of various policies and institutions seeking to provide all 
ethnic groups with equal opportunities, it appears that Singaporeans find themselves 
classified into distinct categories defined along ethnic lines. As such, strong emphasis 
is put on the significance of ethnic identity, which is indicated on Singaporeans&#8217; 
identification documents.   
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The establishment of officially endorsed self-help groups providing 
complementary social services to the main ethnic groups in Singapore also testifies to 
the significance of ethnic identity. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that 
these self-help groups may provide tailored and effective responses to the needs of 
each community, he nonetheless recommends that the Government consider setting 
up a national body, instead of ethnically-based ones, to coordinate efforts and provide 
people living in Singapore with assistance in an equal manner. Such a national body 
would lessen the significance of ethnic identity in one&#8217;s interactions with the State and 
within Singaporean society at large and also help remedy the challenges faced by 
individuals of mixed origins or those who do not belong to the main ethnic groups, 
who seem to have difficulty in relating to any of the existing self-help groups. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Although the Special Rapporteur understands the well-intentioned rationale 
behind the system of group representation constituencies, which aims to ensure that 
the needs of minorities are not neglected in an ethnically Chinese-dominant 
Singapore, he takes the view that this system has actually institutionalized and 
entrenched the minority status of certain ethnic groups within Singaporean society. 
Further, it reinforces the views that members of ethnic minorities may sit in 
Parliament only if they belong to a larger group of Members of Parliament.</b>   
</p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the self-help groups and group 
representation constituency schemes may tend to reinforce and perpetuate ethnic 
categorization, which in turn may lead to prejudices and negative stereotypes held 
against certain ethnic minorities taking root. Taking into account the fact that a 
society may only benefit from social interactions that are not predetermined by ethnic 
identity, the Special Rapporteur recommends as a starting point that ethnic identity 
be removed from Singaporeans&#8217; identification documents. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On housing 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Ethnic Integration Policy, aimed at preventing the formation of ethnic 
enclaves, has been generally successful in terms of social integration. However, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government implement it in a more flexible 
manner, to ensure that members of ethnic minorities are not disadvantaged vis-&#224;-vis 
ethnic Chinese individuals when seeking an accommodation close to their families or 
when trying to sell their accommodation in the secondary housing market.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On education 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The principle of meritocracy, which is at the core of the public educational 
system and of Singaporean society more generally, ensures that all children are 
offered equal opportunities. However, where there are acknowledged historical 
inequalities &#8211; as is the case with Malay students who consistently remain below their 
Chinese counterparts &#8211; meritocracy may contribute to entrenching these inequalities, 
rather than to correcting them. The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that 
the Government consider making small adjustments to the educational system, for 
instance with special temporary programmes allowing Malay students to catch up. He 
also recommends that the programmes subsidizing tuition fees for Malay students be </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>supported directly at national level, rather than through the Yayasan Mendaki self-
help group.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>In addition, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Special Assistance Plan 
schools be open to all, including to non-Mandarin native speakers, so that 
academically gifted students from all communities may have the opportunity to 
develop their skills in an environment that seeks to nurture the best talents of the 
country.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On employment 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The promotional approach taken by the Ministry of Manpower and the 
Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices to address problems of 
discrimination against job-seekers and workers from certain ethnic or religious 
backgrounds appears to have had good results. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the authorities adopt a firmer approach through legally binding 
provisions prohibiting discrimination of all kinds, including on the grounds of ethnic 
or national origin, in the field of employment.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In a diverse society like Singapore, it is essential to ensure sufficient 
representation of the ethnic minorities in all employment sectors. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore recommends that the Government urgently review all 
guidelines, policies and practices which may prevent members of ethnic minorities to 
be employed in institutions that should reflect the diversity of Singapore, such as the 
armed forces, the police and the judiciary.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The significant influx of foreign workers supported by the Government to 
satisfy the demands of a fast-growing economy and counter a declining birth rate and 
ageing population has significantly contributed to the building of the country. Yet, it 
has also created some resentment by the population, which at times perceives these 
migrant workers as taking away jobs from Singaporean citizens, threatening 
Singaporean families, affecting the fragile national demographic balance or raising 
security concerns. The Special Rapporteur recommends that these concerns be 
addressed in a timely and open manner by the Government, so as to prevent 
generalized resentment against foreigners, which could lead to overt xenophobic 
attitudes. In this regard, he recommends that the National Integration Council treat 
the social integration of unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers &#8211; who often live in 
isolation from Singaporean society &#8211; as a priority.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>While numerous and commendable initiatives have been taken to prevent and 
address the manifold human rights violations and sometimes physical abuse suffered 
by unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers, their situation remains dire. 
Difficulties faced by these migrant workers include the sponsorship system, which 
places them in a highly dependent relationship with their employers; unpaid salaries; 
unilateral cancellations of work permits by their employers; poor and unhygienic 
living conditions; or denial of medical insurance by their employers. The Special 
Rapporteur strongly urges the Government to act swiftly to ensure the protection of 
migrant workers&#8217; human rights. In this regard, he recommends that the Government 
enhance the effective implementation of the Employment Act and extend it to cover 
domestic workers; that efforts be undertaken to ensure the expeditious resolution of 
labour disputes through accessible and effective mechanisms; and that a minimum 
wage for migrant workers particularly vulnerable to exploitation, such as 
construction and domestic workers, be introduced.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the authorities consider 
reviewing their policy concerning the list of &#8220;approved source countries or 
territories&#8221;, so as to prevent and address the negative stereotypes applied to certain 
ethnic or national groups, which can be associated with unskilled or low-skilled 
professions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the legal and institutional human rights framework  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>While the Special Rapporteur understands that the Government wishes to be in 
a position to fully implement the obligations contained in an international treaty 
before ratifying it, he nonetheless urges it to accede to international human rights 
instruments that contain provisions reaffirming the fundamental human rights 
principles of non-discrimination and equality. These include the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In the light of general recommendation No. 30 (2004) on non-citizens of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the constitutional provisions restricting certain human rights to 
Singaporean citizens &#8211; including the right to non-discrimination on the ground of 
religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any 
employment under a public authority, the rights in respect to education and the 
freedom of speech, assembly and association &#8211; be revised to extend equal human 
rights protection to all individuals residing in Singapore, including non-citizens.   
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>While taking into account that the principles of equality and non-
discrimination are included in various domestic legislative acts, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government adopt a stand-alone law dedicated to 
the prohibition of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
Such legislation would clearly demonstrate Singapore&#8217;s political commitment in the 
fight against racism and allow for enhanced visibility and accessibility of the law for 
all individuals, thereby enabling them to resort to the relevant provisions more easily 
and more effectively.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>In order to strengthen the existing institutional human rights framework, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government review the mandate of the 
Presidential Council for Minority Rights, so that the latter may act on its own 
initiative. This Council should be empowered to consider and report on matters 
affecting the rights of members of ethnic minorities, without having to wait for the 
Speaker of Parliament or an appropriate Minister to refer such matters to it. 
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the authorities take all necessary 
measures to guarantee the independence of this Council, including by ensuring that its 
Chairperson may not be faced with potential conflicts of interest.  </b></p>
