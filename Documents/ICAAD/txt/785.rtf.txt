3.      
The Supreme Court Rules (1999) at p 327 state as follows

'General- the requirement to give particulars reflects the overriding principle that the litigation between the parties, and particularly the trial, should be conducted fairly, openly, without surprises and, as far as possible, so as to minimize costs (a view approved by Edund-Davies L. J in Astovlanis Compania Naviera SA v Linard [1972] 2 Q B 611;91972] 2 All E.R 647. (emphasis is added) 

The function of particulars is accordingly

(1)     
To inform the other side of the nature of the case that they have to meet as distinguished from the mode in which that case is to be proved (per Lindley L.J. in in Duke v Wisden (1897)77 L.T67 at 68.per buckley L.J in Young & Co v Scottish Union co (1907) 24 T.L R 73 at 74; Aga Khan v Time Publishing Co [1924] 1 K. B. 675 at 679):

(2)     
To prevent the other side from being taken by surprise at the trial(per Cotton L. H., in Spedding v Fitzpatrick (1888) 38 Ch. D 410 at 413; Thomson v Birkley 91882) 31 W.R 230)

(3)

(4)     
To limit the generality of the pleadings(per Thesiger L. J. Saunders v Jones (1877) 7 Ch. D 435)or of the claim or the evidence (Milbank v Milbank [1900] 1 Ch. 376 at p 385

(5)     
To limit an define the issues to be tired and as to which discovery is required (Yokshire Provident Life Assurance Co v Gilbert[1895] 2 QB 148 per Vaughan Williams J. H in Milbank v Milbank [1900] 1 Ch.385

(6)     
To tie the hands of the party so that he cannot without leave go into any matters not included (per Brett J. J. in Philipps v Philipps (1878) 4 Q.B.D 127 at 133; woolley v Broad [1892] 2 QB 317) But if the opponent omits to ask for particulars, evidence may be given which supports any material allegation in the pleadings (Dean of Chester Smlting Corp[1902] W.N. 5;Hewson v Cleeve [1904] 2 Ir. R 536).' (emphasis is added)

4.      
Where the information asked for is clearly necessary to enable the applicant properly prepare for the trial, on in other respects the application is a proper one, the information must be given, even though it discloses some party of the evidence on which the other party proposes to rely at the trial Marriaott v chamberlanin [1886] 17 Q B D 154 p 16
