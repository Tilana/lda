</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/9, requested the Secretary-General and the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;to submit to the 
Council, prior to its seventh session, a joint progress report, from within the regular budget of the 
United Nations, on public information activities in the field of human rights, including activities 
being undertaken throughout the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, by the United Nations system, internationally and at the national level, and, particularly, 
by the field presences of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/9, the Council also encourages the Department of Public Information of 
the Secretariat and OHCHR &#8220;to continue to support, within their respective responsibilities and 
in consultation with States, the development of national capacities for human rights education 
and public information, inter alia by involving national human rights institutions  and 
non-governmental organizations, and to launch, within the framework of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights sixtieth anniversary activities, specific initiatives for widening 
public information in the field of human rights&#8221;. The Secretary-General submitted a 
comprehensive biannual report (A/HRC/4/106) to the fourth session of the Human Rights 
Council, which addressed the issue of public information activities in the field of human rights, 
including the World Public Information Campaign on Human Rights until the end of 2006. 
This report complements it with activities and information in 2007. 
</p>
<p>3. The coordination of the United Nations education and public information programmes in 
the field of human rights was specifically mentioned in General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 
20 December 1993, as part of the mandate of the post of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>4. On 10 December 2007, a year-long United Nations system-wide human rights advocacy 
campaign, an initiative of the Secretary-General and coordinated by OHCHR, was launched to 
commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR 60). 
</p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has repeatedly stressed the importance she 
attaches to the implementation of activities for increasing awareness of human rights among the 
general public. To meet this objective she stressed in her Strategic Management Plan 2006-2007 
the need to enhance the Office&#8217;s communication capacity. Since then, a Communications Section 
composed of three units - the Media Unit, the Editorial and Publications Unit, and the Web and 
Audiovisual Unit - has been established and manages communications and public information 
strategies and activities of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. PUBLIC INFORMATION ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Publications programme 
</b></p>
<p>6. The goal of the publications programme of OHCHR is to raise awareness of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and to publicize ways of promoting and protecting them worldwide. Another 
aim is to encourage debate on human rights issues under discussion in United Nations bodies. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. Since the last report of the Secretary-General, the Office distributed more 
than 120,000 copies of human rights publications in addition to the 2,000 copies of each 
publication which are regularly distributed by the Distribution Section at the United Nations 
Office at Geneva through the mailing list established jointly by OHCHR and the Distribution 
Section. OHCHR also increased the number of publications, making most of them available on 
its website to enhance their dissemination. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Fact Sheets 
</b></p>
<p>8. OHCHR Fact Sheets provide information on a wide range of human rights subjects. 
By researching and focusing on an issue, a Fact Sheet helps readers understand human rights and 
related topics, and the international machinery that has been established to promote and protect 
them. 
</p>
<p>9. In 2007, Fact Sheet No. 24/Rev.1, <i>The International Convention on Migrant Workers and 
its Committee</i>, was issued in Arabic; No. 30, <i>The United Nations Human Rights treaty system: 
An introduction to the core human rights treaties and the treaty bodies</i>, was issued in Arabic and 
Spanish. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Training and educational material 
</b></p>
<p>10. The OHCHR training and educational material consists of handbooks and manuals 
intended to raise awareness of international human rights standards. It is directed at audiences 
that are able to influence the human rights situation in their countries. These publications also 
serve as practical tools for organizations that provide human rights education to professional 
groups (e.g. police, prison officials, judges, parliamentarians, human rights monitors, election 
monitors and social workers) and educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>11. In 2007, the following items of the Professional Training Series were published: No. 13, 
<i>Human Rights - Handbook for Parliamentarians</i>, was published in Arabic and Spanish, jointly 
with the Inter-Parliamentary Union; No. 14, <i>From Exclusion to Equality: Realizing the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities</i>, was published in English, jointly with the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
and the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs. 
</p>
<p>12. The human rights education series consists of publications aimed at supporting 
general human rights education efforts. It includes information on the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education, a study on human rights education and human rights treaties, and a 
practical book to support human rights education in schools. In 2007, No. 4/Rev.1, <i>ABC: 
Teaching Human Rights - Practical activities for primary and secondary schools</i>, was issued in 
Chinese; No. 5, <i>Plan of Action for the first phase of the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education</i>, was published jointly with UNESCO, in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and 
Spanish. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Special-issue papers 
</b></p>
<p>13. Special issue papers explore selected subjects in greater depth. Several issue papers were 
published in 2007: <i>International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights - 2006 
Consolidated Version</i> (published jointly with UNAIDS, in French); <i>Frequently asked questions </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>on a human rights-based approach to development cooperation</i> (in Russian); <i>Assessing the 
effectiveness of national human rights institutions</i> (jointly with the International Council on 
Human Rights Policy in Arabic); <i>Principles and Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to 
Poverty Reduction Strategies</i> (in Arabic and Chinese, Web-based); <i>Rule-of-law tools for 
post-conflict States: Monitoring legal systems</i> (in Spanish); <i>Handbook on Housing and Property 
Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons: Implementing the &#8220;Pinheiro Principles&#8221;</i> 
(jointly with various United Nations agencies in English); <i>The Rights of Non-citizens </i>(in 
Chinese, English and Russian); <i>Dimensions of Racism</i> (jointly with UNESCO in French and 
Spanish); <i>Human Rights and World Trade Agreements</i> (in Spanish); <i>Good Governance Practices 
for the Protection of Human Rights</i> (in English); <i>Handbook on HIV and Human Rights on 
National Human Rights Institutions</i> (jointly with UNAIDS in English). 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Reference material 
</b></p>
<p>14. Reference material gives researchers and human rights law practitioners access to key 
human rights instruments and other essential information. The material includes jurisprudence 
from human rights treaty bodies. The following titles were published in 2007: <i>Selected Decisions 
of the Human Rights Committee under the Optional Protocol (vol. VI)</i>, in Spanish; <i>Selected 
Decisions of the Human Rights Committee under the Optional Protocol (vol. VII)</i>, in Russian; 
<i>Selected Decisions of the Human Rights Committee under the Optional Protocol (vol. VIII)</i>, 
in English; <i>Core International Human Rights Treaties</i>, in English, Arabic and French; <i>New Core 
International Human Rights Treaties</i>, in English and Spanish; <i>Legislative History of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> (jointly with Save the Children), in English. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Promotional material 
</b></p>
<p>15. The purpose of this material is to inform the general public about United Nations human 
rights work. &#8220;The United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery&#8221; is 
now available in Spanish. The &#8220;<i>Plan of Action for the first phase of the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education</i>&#8221;, a leaflet published jointly with UNESCO, was issued in English, 
French and Spanish. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Use of electronic technology 
</b></p>
<p>16. In 2007, OHCHR redesigned its external website to present OHCHR and human rights 
information with a more user-friendly approach. During the redesign, a new structure was 
approved by senior management and implemented. Content for new entry pages and homepage 
sections and new visual elements were also developed. 
</p>
<p>17. In January 2007, OHCHR decided to implement the new website using a Content 
Management system (CMS) and selected Microsoft Share Point 2007 to be used as that platform. 
</p>
<p>18. Given the large amount of material on the OHCHR website, its contents are being moved 
to the new structure through different phases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. The launch of the new OHCHR website coincided with the launch of a year-long advocacy 
campaign to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. With the implementation of the new website, the average number of pages viewed every 
day has reached 80,000. 
</p>
<p>20. The use of the new CMS will also facilitate the design of new web pages in accordance 
with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendations regarding access by disabled 
people, and the design of a template to be used by field offices to develop their own local 
websites which will still have the &#8220;look-and-feel&#8221; of the main site and whose content can also be 
in the local language. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Media liaison 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Office has continued to strengthen its capacity to communicate the human rights 
message through the media. OHCHR staff responsible for media liaison brief the international 
press regularly on the activities of the Office and on the human rights programme in general. The 
media liaison staff participate in elaborating the communication strategy of OHCHR; accompany 
the High Commissioner in her field visits; draft press statements and background notes; organize 
media events for the High Commissioner; assist the special procedures mechanisms and the 
treaty bodies with their media liaison needs; and help draft and place opinion pieces and other 
articles in major international publications. 
</p><p>22. The Communication Section assisted in the placement of nine opinion articles by the 
High Commissioner. Thematic information kits were developed and distributed for use of the 
media and partners on the human rights issues of Indigenous Peoples (in English) and UDHR 60 
(in all official languages). In the reporting period the Unit worked with the United Nations 
Information Service (UNIS), Geneva and the Treaties and Council Branch of OHCHR on 
two seminars to train journalists from around the world on the work of the Office in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Public outreach programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Briefings 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Communications Section regularly organizes briefings for students, diplomats, 
journalists, public officials, academics, professors and NGOs. It also provides speakers for 
human rights briefings organized by UNIS Geneva. Seventy-seven briefings were delivered by 
OHCHR staff to more than 1,900 participants in 2007 on a variety of issues and in different 
languages. A general OHCHR PowerPoint presentation was developed as an introduction to be 
used by speakers in briefings. 
</p>
<p>24. In 2007, the Communications Section also coordinated and organized the Human Rights 
programme section of the forty-fifth Graduate Study Programme, organized annually by 
UNIS Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Public information materials 
</b></p>
<p>25. In the course of 2007, the Communications Section produced a series of public 
information materials such as electronic and print brochures distributed to partners, including </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, academia, the media, 
OHCHR field presences, United Nations bodies and the general public. These materials included 
a brochure on racism and discrimination as obstacles to development on the occasion of the 
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; a flyer on the online 
Human Rights and Business Learning Tool to promote an e-learning course on the occasion of 
the Global Compact Leaders Summit held in July 2007 in Geneva; and a brochure in English, 
French, Russian and Spanish to promote the OHCHR Indigenous Fellowship Programme 
brochure among indigenous communities. A generic information kit on OHCHR is also being 
prepared. 
</p>
<p>26. The Communications Section provides and manages content in OHCHR&#8217;s home page. It 
has also created a new section called &#8220;Human face of human rights&#8221; with human-interest stories, 
and developed the content for the new &#8220;About us&#8221; section. 
</p>
<p>27. The Communications Section drafts statements and forewords by the High Commissioner 
on the occasion of particular international days and commemorations, and for publications 
respectively; prepares statements for the Secretary-General in conjunction with the 
Department of Public Information (DPI) on human rights issues; and, drafts background notes 
and fact sheets. 
</p>
<p>28. A photo library is being developed and photographic material is being produced to enhance 
OHCHR&#8217;s audiovisual capacity. A short video on OHCHR was produced. OHCHR&#8217;s 
Communications Section works in collaboration with the United Nations system to produce 
video news releases about the Office&#8217;s activities and the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Exhibitions and events 
</b></p>
<p>29. A three-week exhibition of paintings by artists from the Mexican School of Down Art 
was organized at Palais Wilson. The exhibition, inaugurated by the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on 21 March 2007, was organized in collaboration with the Permanent Mission of 
Mexico in Geneva to mark the World Down Syndrome Day and the signing of the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocols. 
</p>
<p>30. A ceremony to unveil a bust outside Palais Wilson, in memory of the late 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and the 21 colleagues who lost 
their lives in the bombing of United Nations headquarters in Iraq on 19 August 2003, was 
organized on 28 June 2007. A brochure on the bust was produced, and later sent to families of 
the victims. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Human Rights Day and the launch of the year-long campaign to 
commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration 
                                         of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>31. A United Nations system-wide human rights advocacy campaign for the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR 60) is the focus of OHCHR 
outreach efforts for 2007 and 2008. The campaign, an initiative of the Secretary-General and 
coordinated by OHCHR, involves United Nations agencies, departments and funds, and other </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international and local partners commemorating UDHR 60 by advocating specific areas of 
human rights that are most pertinent to their work under the overarching message: &#8220;Dignity and 
justice for all of us&#8221;. 
32. The initiative of the Secretary-General has been endorsed by the Chief Executives Board 
and a UDHR 60 task force under the United Nations Communications Group (UNCG), set up by 
the Communications Section of OHCHR, facilitates the coordination of system-wide outreach 
activities throughout the anniversary year. The goal of the campaign is to provide civil society, 
national institutions, educators and a wide range of audiences with guidance, ideas and materials 
on the campaign. Since September 2007, the Communications Section has issued a monthly 
newsletter entitled <i>Info60</i>, with this purpose. 
33. A number of public information materials were produced by the Communications Section 
for Human Rights Day 2007 and for the launch of the UDHR 60 campaign; i.e., an information 
kit in six official languages, a statement by the High Commissioner, a web page, two posters and 
a UDHR 60 commemorative logo. The emblem is available with text in Arabic, Chinese, 
English, French, Russian and Spanish, and will be widely used from 10 December 2007 to 
31 December 2008. A Christmas card and a 2008 calendar on UDHR 60 were also produced 
with the assistance of the office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>34. The Communications Section also worked together with DPI to develop a special-edition 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights booklet, and an electronic A4-size Universal 
Declaration. Briefings on UDHR 60 were also given to civil society organizations and other 
partners. 
</p>
<p><b>Human Rights Day 2007 
</b></p>
<p>35. Exhibitions, debates, film screenings, seminars, marches and other events were among the 
activities held on 10 December 2007 across the world to mark Human Rights Day and to launch 
the year-long campaign leading up to the UDHR 60 on 10 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>36. The Secretary-General launched the year-long campaign at the OHCHR Regional Office in 
Bangkok, where he inaugurated a Human Rights Day exhibition. An official event was held in 
Geneva, which coincided with the first day of the resumed sixth session of the Human Rights 
Council. The Secretary-General (via video message), the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Louise Arbour, representatives of Member States, human rights experts and civil society 
representatives all spoke on the launch and the importance of the Universal Declaration. 
</p>
<p>37. OHCHR field presences celebrated Human Rights Day and launched the campaign in 
unique ways and styles. In Beirut, a commemorative event organized by the Regional Office of 
OHCHR saw 400 participants marking Human Rights Day and the launch of the UDHR 60 
campaign with a film screening and a musical performance. In Nepal, a Human Rights Day 
message was broadcast via Radio Nepal countrywide. In Mexico, the OHCHR office hosted an 
event at which its 2007 publications were presented. In Bogot&#225;, an event was organized to 
present the UDHR 60 campaign with the participation of some 450 people. A group of children 
handed out red and yellow roses representing the colours of the UDHR 60 logo. Banners, 
stickers, a calendar and an agenda were produced for the event. A 5-minute video featuring </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>women explaining the significance of the Declaration was shown. The event closed with a rock 
music show. In Bucaramanga, Cali and Medell&#237;n, Colombia, OHCHR offices launched the 
campaign with art events. 
</p>
<p>38. Exhibitions, film screenings, musical performances, seminars, panel debates, and other 
official events at which the United Nations system participated were organized in Ethiopia, 
France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Montenegro, Portugal, 
Somalia, Spain, Timor-Leste and Turkey. 
</p>
<p><b>UDHR 60 commemorative activities planned for 2008 
</b></p>
<p>39. The year-long UDHR 60 commemoration is intended to be as inclusive as possible. It will 
encompass the United Nations family, the public and private sectors, media, educators, schools, 
artists and other representatives of civil society throughout the world. Activities 
for the commemoration are already being planned by many of these partners. Some 
United Nations-affiliated projects planned for 2008 are as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Internationally renowned directors film human rights: OHCHR has collaborated with 
the NGO Art for the World, Dorje Films and the European Commission on a series of 
short films specially made for the UDHR 60. Award winning film-makers from 
different regions will direct 15 to 20 short films on human rights, which will be shown 
back to back as one medium-length feature in various locations throughout 2008, and 
will premier at the Rome Film Festival. The films will be distributed as public service 
announcements (PSAs) in cinemas and on television networks worldwide; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Book based on human rights films: A book on the short films specially made for the 
UDHR 60 will be launched and available for sale a month before the film presentation; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The sixty-first annual DPI/NGO conference in Paris: The United Nations Department of 
Public Information (DPI) is preparing for the conference, which will be hosted for the 
first time outside New York, at UNESCO headquarters, from 3 to 5 September 2008. 
&#8220;A celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8221; is the theme of the 
conference; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Interactive dialogues on human rights in New York: The Permanent Mission of 
Switzerland in New York, in collaboration with OHCHR and the NGO Committee on 
Human Rights, is organizing a series of interactive dialogues on human rights from 
October 2007 to December 2008. Speakers will discuss new challenges and approaches 
to human rights in the context of improving synergy between the United Nations in 
New York, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Member States, United Nations 
agencies and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Internship programme 
</b></p>
<p>40. OHCHR offered internships to 111 graduate and undergraduate students to enable them to 
gain first-hand knowledge of United Nations actions and procedures in the field of human rights. 
Internships are awarded without financial commitment of any kind on the part of OHCHR or 
other United Nations bodies. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INFORMATION 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Department of Public Information (DPI) publicized the work of the United Nations in 
the field of human rights using the various tools of communication and information 
dissemination at its disposal. New technologies have accelerated the dissemination of 
information through electronic means. In support of the Plan of Action of the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s Office, the Department continued its close working relationship with OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Activities of the Department of Public Information 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Department continued to cover the human rights-related work of the 
intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations, including the General Assembly, the Human 
Rights Council and the human rights treaty bodies. It applied a multimedia approach to 
information dissemination, with information materials distributed to the media through press 
conferences, press briefings and other media outreach activities, on the United Nations website, 
in radio and television programmes, at exhibits, special events and in connection with activities 
with educational and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and through services for visitors 
as well as responses to inquiries from the general public. Information materials were produced in 
the six official languages of the United Nations and disseminated worldwide, including through 
the network of United Nations Information Centres and Services and United Nations regional 
offices. Many materials were also adapted in local languages. 
</p>
<p>43. The main activities undertaken by the Department from January to December 2007 are 
summarized below. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Media products and coverage 
</b></p>
<p>44. Human rights remained a key theme on the Department&#8217;s UN News Centre portal 
(www.un.org/news), one of the most heavily visited areas on the United Nations website. Stories 
by the associated UN News Service covering all major United Nations activities, events and 
issues related to human rights appeared regularly on the news portal in all official languages and, 
in addition, were distributed to more than 50,000 subscribers to the UN News Centre&#8217;s e-mail 
news alerts service (English and French). Further expanding the reach of this coverage, 
human rights-related stories from the UN News Centre received heightened visibility on search 
engines and were continuously republished on an increasing number of websites, including those 
of media outlets, popular news aggregator sites as well as NGOs and educational institutions. 
With the expanding use of the UN News Centre&#8217;s RSS (Real Simple Syndication) feeds, its 
human rights-related stories also received ever-wider circulation in non-traditional online outlets, 
such as web logs (blogs) and personal pages. 
</p>
<p>45. The United Nations webcast team has been providing live and on-demand webcast 
coverage of all sessions of the Human Rights Council, since its inception in 
June 2006. Furthermore, the webcast team has developed a comprehensive website 
(www.un.org/webcast/unhrc) where all Council sessions are available and at which they have 
been updated on a continuous basis. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. The Department&#8217;s Meetings Coverage Section in New York issued, during the reporting 
period, a total of 284 releases - 146 in English and 138 in French - including summaries of 
meetings and press conferences of intergovernmental human rights bodies as well as statements 
and messages by the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>47. United Nations Television covered various aspects of human rights and related issues in its 
current affairs, broadcast news magazine programme and its live and webcast footage of 
intergovernmental bodies and press conferences held at Headquarters. United Nations Television 
also provided regular coverage through Unifeed (www.un.org/unifeed/), its six-day-a-week 
satellite transmission service. During the reporting period, five &#8220;UN in Action&#8221; stories and 
12 items in the &#8220;21st Century&#8221; programmes were on issues related to human rights. 
</p>
<p>48. United Nations Radio extensively covered the work of the Human Rights Council in its 
news bulletins and current affairs magazines in the official and non-official languages. 
United Nations Radio produced news and features on a broad range of related subjects, with 
special programmes for the start of UDHR 60 on 10 December. 
</p>
<p>49. For the first anniversary of the Human Rights Council, a fact sheet on the Council&#8217;s 
activities during its first year was issued and disseminated to the press in Geneva and made 
available at United Nations Headquarters, as well as posted on the Council website and sent with 
guidance to the United Nations Information Centres (UNICs). 
</p>

Department&#8217;s focal point provided communications support in the form of arranging interviews 
with CBC Radio, CNN International, BBC World TV and Reuters on subjects including 
Myanmar, the International Criminal Court, the Sudan, and the High Commissioner&#8217;s visit to the 
Great Lakes region in Africa. 
</p>
<p>51. In 2007, seven press conferences were arranged for human rights special rapporteurs 
during their presentations to the Third Committee of the General Assembly and at other times

</p>
<p><b>2.  Human Rights Day 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Department designed the website for Human Rights Day 2007 
(www.un.org/events/humanrights/2007/) and for the sixtieth anniversary year in all six official 
languages, translated public information materials prepared by OHCHR into all official 
languages, and disseminated them to target audiences electronically and through the 
network of UNICs. An op-ed piece by the High Commissioner on the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights was placed in <i>Le Monde</i> (France), the <i>Buenos Aires Herald</i> (Argentina) and 
<i>Folha de S. Paulo</i> (Brazil) in December 2007. Media analysis of articles published on the 
occasion of Human Rights Day 2007 is still ongoing. More than 40 articles have been identified 
thus far, the majority of which include portions of both the message of the High Commissioner 
and the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>53. A cartoon exhibit highlighting UDHR 60 entitled &#8220;Sketching human rights&#8221; was launched 
in the visitors&#8217; lobby at United Nations Headquarters on Human Rights Day 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>54. On the UN News Centre website, special attention was devoted to the coverage of Human 
Rights Day, with a range of news stories highlighting United Nations commemorative events and 
activities in different parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>55. The Department&#8217;s booklet containing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(DPI/876/Rev.3) continues to be in demand. It was updated in 2007 with new forewords by the 
Secretary-General as well as the High Commissioner, and reprinted in all six official languages. 
A special sixtieth anniversary edition (DPI/876/Rev.4) was prepared and printed in all six 
official languages. Also designed for use during the anniversary year were a two-page, 
easy-to-print version in all six languages as well as a template for local language versions and a 
CD-ROM collection of historical photographs and artwork to be used by UNICs. A brochure 
outlining ideas to celebrate the anniversary year, to be shared with civil society, business, 
governments and academia, was also published. 
</p>
<p>56. In early 2007, judging was completed for the Human Rights Day essay contest in 
partnership with OHCHR organized in 2006 and hosted by the Department&#8217;s CyberSchoolBus 
Unit. Prizes and certificates were compiled and award ceremonies and presentations were held 
by the United Nations Information Service in Bangkok, and the UNICs in Accra, Cairo, 
Islamabad, Kathmandu, Moscow and Nairobi. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Publications 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Department&#8217;s Academic Initiative Section produced an issue of <i>UN Chronicle</i> on the 
theme of racism and racial discrimination titled &#8220;The solidarity of peoples&#8221;, containing 
26 articles on the present state of the international debate on racism and racial discrimination. 
The contributors analysed present and past forms of social exclusion, affected groups and 
populations, and the multiple dimensions of racial discrimination and related forms of 
intolerance, among a myriad of related issues. The magazine featured an important essay by the 
High Commissioner, &#8220;Looking beyond Durban: the significance of racial discrimination on the 
international human rights agenda&#8221;, and an overview of the role of the United Nations in fighting 
racism and racial discrimination over the past six decades, based on the historical records of the 
<i>Yearbook of the United Nations</i>. Also featured are special contributions to the <i>UN Chronicle</i> to 
mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade. 
</p>
<p>58. A special issue of the <i>UN Chronicle</i> on the theme of human rights is planned for mid-2008 
and will be an in-depth look at this top priority of the United Nations through the lens of 
high-profile personalities at the national, regional and international levels, human rights experts, 
NGOs and senior United Nations officials. 
</p>
<p>59. A major part of the <i>Yearbook of the United Nations</i> is devoted to covering in a 
comprehensive manner the activities of the former Commission on Human Rights and the 
current Human Rights Council and its subsidiary organs, the work of the Office of the 
High Commissioner, as well as that of all human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>60. <i>Africa Renewal</i>, a quarterly magazine produced by the Department in English and  
French, carried more than 35 articles on human rights issues in Africa during the reporting 
period. The articles covered a wide-range of topics in the areas of media freedom, women&#8217;s 
rights and the rights of children. Major articles looked at the impact of rape on women in the war </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the rights of Africa&#8217;s indigenous peoples. The

200th anniversary of the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade, the International Day for the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, World Press Freedom Day and Human Rights Day. 
</p>
<p>62. The Department has begun planning for the sixty-first Annual DPI/NGO Conference in 
commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. DPI 
has invited UNESCO, the Government of France and OHCHR to be co-organizers of the event, 
which is expected to be held in Paris in September 2008. 
</p>
<p>63. During the reporting period, the Department&#8217;s Public Relations Section 
organized 33 in-house briefings with a total attendance of 1,027 participants and two outside 
speaking engagements with a total attendance of 260 participants on the subject of human rights. 
</p><p>64. The Department&#8217;s Public Inquiries Unit and CyberSchoolBus Unit host an annual 
multimedia human rights conference for students drawn from the United States and around the 
world. The conference seeks to promote awareness and to prompt action among student leaders 
about human rights in general. The 2007 Student Conference focused on recognizing the rights 
of indigenous peoples. In addition to producing the background document and developing the 
conference website, the CyberSchoolBus Unit added a new feature on its site - live video chats. 
The Public Inquiries Unit responded to 24,331 e-mails, petitions, walk-in enquiries, letters and 
telephone calls specifically on human rights. 
</p>
<p>65. The CyberSchoolBus Unit also launched its first WebQuest on a human rights topic: the 
use of child soldiers. WebQuest is an educational tool which seeks to build knowledge and then 
offers options to test this knowledge through the online presentation of study resources and 
ready-made quizzes. The WebQuest on child soldiers includes an examination of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol, and looks at the involvement of children in 
armed conflict. In November, the Unit also launched an additional site on the Convention to 
highlight its eighteenth anniversary, which includes a new curriculum on the Convention, along 
with a multimedia slide show developed in partnership with Magnum Photos. This launch was 
accompanied by a live video chat with a representative of UNICEF who spoke about the 
Convention with teachers and students. 
</p>
<p>66. The Department&#8217;s Dag Hammarskjold Library has begun work on a web page that will 
highlight the early documents that led up to the adoption of the resolution containing the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. These will include the documents of the 
Nuclear Committee, the Drafting Committee and the first session of the Commission on 
Human Rights, and Third Committee of the General Assembly documents. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Information support on indigenous issues 
</b></p>
<p>67. Communications support was provided for the sixth session of the United Nations 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) in May, including development of a 
comprehensive press kit using a new masthead; guidance to UNICs; organization of four press 
conferences; media monitoring; and the arrangement of more than 20 interviews. Highlights of 
the media coverage for the session included: significant coverage of the opening press 
conference, most of which reproduced material from the press kit, including 75 placements of an 
Associated Press article (in <i>The Guardian</i>, the<i> International Herald Tribune</i> and at 
www.Aljazeera.net, among others); approximately 15 articles in English and Spanish on the 
closing session; and approximately 40 Spanish articles throughout the session. 
</p>
<p>68. During the negotiations leading up to the adoption by the General Assembly 
on 13 September 2007 of resolution 61/295 containing the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Department worked closely with the Office of the President of 
the General Assembly and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to conduct media 
outreach, including arranging interviews and background briefings. After its adoption, the 
Department worked to publicize the Declaration and its significance resulting in a large number 
of interviews and print articles. 
</p>

United Nations, included a briefing on human rights provided by the New York Office of the 
High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>71. DPI&#8217;s Outreach Division organized several exhibits at United Nations Headquarters 
covering a wide-range of human rights issues such as racism, slavery, genocide, gender equality, 
education for girls and the rights of women. Exhibits were also developed for World Press 
Freedom Day, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, and on the subject of human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>72. The Department&#8217;s Holocaust Programme and the United Nations Outreach Programme 
maintain a comprehensive gateway website with links to resources and educational materials on 
the Holocaust, human rights and the prevention of genocide. Holocaust and genocide scholars 
from Australia, China, France, Ghana, Israel and the United States of America have drafted 
position papers on the issues that can lead to genocide, including intolerance, human rights 
abuses, hatred, racism, bigotry and prejudice. The Holocaust Programme organized three 
seminars at United Nations Headquarters on the topic of Holocaust awareness, genocide 
prevention and combating hatred. Three week-long seminars were held in Washington, D.C., 
Jerusalem and Paris to better equip UNIC information officers to implement the Holocaust 
Remembrance mandate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. As part of the General Assembly-mandated programme, &#8220;Lessons from Rwanda: 
The United Nations and the prevention of genocide&#8221;, the Department launched an exhibit at 
United Nations Headquarters in April. The exhibit travelled to locations in Burkina Faso, 
Canada, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania. Information kits 
and posters were produced in English, French and Kinyarwanda. Several workshops and 
conferences were held in Accra, Brazzaville and Bujumbura on such topics as the role of media 
in preventing genocide, peacebuilding and sexual violence. A photo project, &#8220;Visions of 
Rwanda&#8221;, was undertaken in November with both genocide survivors and perpetrators in 
Rwanda. Photographs from the project are expected to be disseminated widely in 2008. Work on 
related UNTV and UN Radio productions is ongoing, and a website in six official languages was 
launched in mid-December.

<p><b>B. Activities of the United Nations Information 
Services and Information Centres 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Media products and coverage 
</b></p>
<p>75. Of the 1,025 press releases issued by United Nations Information Service (UNIS) in 
Geneva from January through October, 708 - or roughly 70 per cent - were directly on human 
rights themes. These included meeting summaries of the sessions of human rights treaty bodies 
or the Human Rights Council, statements by the High Commissioner and special procedures, or 
releases providing information about upcoming missions of human rights bodies, such as field 
missions of special procedures and human rights working groups. 
</p>
<p>76. In addition, UNIS Geneva has dedicated an information officer to work closely with the 
President of the Human Rights Council, and to serve as a liaison between OHCHR, the Council 
and the Information Service. UNIS press officers also finalize all press releases and statements 
issued by OHCHR, the High Commissioner and the special procedures. Council sessions always 
include a series of press briefings, organized by the service, by the Council President and 
human rights mandate-holders and, where possible, the service provides Headquarters with 
highlights or summary transcripts of these briefings. During the reporting period, 26 press 
briefings were held on human rights subjects, including briefings by the High Commissioner 
and Special Rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>77. The Radio and Television Section in Geneva continued to provide extensive radio, 
television and photo coverage of meetings of the Human Rights Council, human rights-related 
press conferences and the human rights treaty bodies meeting in Geneva. It also filmed and/or 
taped interviews with key players in the field of human rights. Recently, the Section produced </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>radio and television interviews with the High Commissioner on the situations in Myanmar and in 
Pakistan. It also compiled archival video selections on themes such as the Human Rights Council 
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for use in various documentaries. During this 
period, the section continued to provide production and transmission facilities and other 
assistance to broadcasting companies and journalists covering human rights issues. It also 
supplied television pictures and assisted with the narration of a video on the Office of the

</p>
<p><b>2.  Human Rights Day 
</b></p>
<p>82. In connection with Human Rights Day 2007, the United Nations Regional Information 
Centre (UNRIC) in Brussels organized conferences in Portugal together with the Pro Dignitate 
Foundation, the Portuguese Youth Institute and a school in Cascais, launching a series of events 
to mark UDHR 60. In Athens, UNRIC organized conferences with the Greek National 
Committee for Human Rights and a human rights foundation as well as a press conference to 
launch the anniversary year. In Rome, UNRIC supported a &#8220;Cartooning for human rights&#8221; event, 
at which the Italian version of &#8220;Everything you always wanted to know about the UN&#8221; was </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>launched. The publication, produced by the Government of Italy with UNRIC support, will be 
distributed to more than 10,000 educational institutions. Together with journalists, government 
officials and NGOs, UNRIC participated in a panel organized by the German Institute for 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>83. To mark UDHR 60, UNRIC started a public information campaign entitled &#8220;Know your 
rights 2008&#8221;, in cooperation with UNIS Geneva and UNIS Vienna. Central to the campaign is a 
website (www.KnowYourRights2008.org) launched simultaneously in several European capitals 
on 10 December 2007. The website is a marketplace of ideas, projects and initiatives in text, 
audio and video formats that can be uploaded and downloaded so that people across Europe can 
post their projects and see what others are doing to mark the sixtieth anniversary. The aim of the 
campaign is to make human rights and, in particular, the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration 
accessible to the general public in an interactive and participatory manner. The website is 
sponsored by France, Italy and Switzerland; other European countries are expected to join this 
initiative soon. 
</p>
<p>84. UNIS Vienna participated in a human rights symposium co-organized by the 
United Nations Association of Austria and the Centre for Legal Studies, which was 
held at the Austrian Parliament. The symposium attracted around 200 participants, including 
Members of Parliament, members of the diplomatic corps, and NGO/CSO representatives. The 
event launched the year-long celebrations to mark UDHR 60 in 2008, as well as the 
fifteenth anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna in 1993. 
UNIS Vienna also issued a press release and created a &#8220;human rights corner&#8221; on its website 
which features information, relevant links and materials. 
</p>
<p>85. A wide-range of activities were carried out by UNICs: UNIC Prague co-hosted a workshop

Human Rights Department dedicated to the recently adopted &#8220;Framework for cooperation 
between OHCHR and the Russian Federation for 2007 and beyond&#8221;. In Argentina, a day of 
workshops on human rights education was organized by UNIC Buenos Aires, with resources and 
ideas for the 2008 academic year offered to educators. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Publications 
</b></p>
<p>86. Articles on human rights have been written or adapted for UNRIC&#8217;s monthly magazine and 
also placed on its 13-language website for Western Europe, which also contains a variety of 
human rights-related information materials. UNRIC produced and updated backgrounders on 
topics including genocide and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>87. A range of information products, such as regular newsletters, TV and radio productions, 
press kit materials and websites, often produced by UNICs in local languages, also serve as 
vehicles for raising awareness of human rights issues within their regions. Specific examples 
from the range of materials produced during this reporting period include: production of a 
resource CD on the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade 
(UNIC Port of Spain), adapting information materials of the press kit prepared by Headquarters </p>
