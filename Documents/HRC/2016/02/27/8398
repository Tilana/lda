<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent held its tenth session 
from 28 March to 1 April 2011 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>2. The Chief of the Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) opened the 
session.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group elected Mirjana Najchevska as its Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report reflects the general course of the debate.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p>5. During its tenth session, the Working Group held nine public meetings and one 
private meeting. It was attended by the members Mirjana Najchevska,  Maya Sahli, Linos-
Alexander Sicilianos, Monorama Biswas and  Verene Shepherd, as well as by observers 
from 41 Member States and one non-Member State, 18 non-governmental organizations, 
three international organizations, two intergovernmental organizations, six invited 
panellists and a keynote speaker.1<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>6. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights delivered the opening 
address. She welcomed the decision of the Working Group to focus its tenth session on the 
International Year for People of African Descent and reiterated the pivotal role of the 
Working Group in achieving the objectives of the Year. She stressed that one of the most 
important goals of the Year was to raise awareness of the continuing problems facing 
people of African descent, especially those stemming from racism and racial 
discrimination. The High Commissioner noted that the Year was also an opportunity to 
recognize and celebrate the many contributions that Afro-descendents had made to the 
societies in which they live.  
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner reported that, in preparation for the International Year, 
OHCHR had drawn up a framework for action to combat discrimination against people of 
African descent providing a conceptual structure for the current activities of OHCHR 
regarding people of African descent, as well as the initiatives that would be carried out to 
mark the Year. She stressed that the framework set in motion an ongoing, coordinated 
programme designed to produce concrete results and strengthen her Office&#8217;s leadership in 
combating discrimination against people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>8. The High Commissioner stated that OHCHR had organized and serviced thematic 
panel discussions at the sixteenth session of the Human Rights Council and at the seventy-
eighth session of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. She also 
reported that people of African descent was made the theme of the commemoration in 2011 
of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. She stressed that a 
number of other activities would follow throughout the year, including cultural side events 
</p>
<p>  
<b> </b>1<b> </b>All working papers submitted by the experts and participants are available from the secretariat and on 
</p>
<p>the website of the Office of the High Commissioner at 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/racism/groups/african/4african.htm. </p>


<p>during the sessions of the Human Rights Council and the creation of a fellowship 
programme for young people of African descent to come to Geneva and learn about human 
rights and how the different United Nations human rights mechanisms work. The High 
Commissioner highlighted that, in planning these activities, OHCHR had adopted the theme 
of &#8220;Recognition, justice and development&#8221; proposed by the Working Group for the Year.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>9. During the 1st meeting, on 28 March, the experts of the Working Group elected  
Mirjana Najchevska as Chairperson-Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>10. In accepting the role of Chairperson, Ms. Najchevska pointed out that great 
achievements had been made in 2001 at the World Conference against Racism, where 
States recognized, inter alia, that people of African descent had suffered greatly from 
racism and racial discrimination and committed to taking measures to address this situation. 
She stated that the International Year for People of African Descent provided States and 
other stakeholders with a unique opportunity to manifest their commitment further, in the 
form of activities, programmes and other actions that combat discrimination against people 
of African descent and address the other daily challenges that they face.  
</p>
<p>11. The Chairperson noted with appreciation that the slogan &#8220;People of African descent: 
recognition, justice and development&#8221; adopted by the Working Group as its &#8220;mantra&#8221; for 
the International Year during its previous session had also been adopted by OHCHR and 
that it was already being used as a leading title for announcing the Year and activities 
related to it by some non-governmental organizations and forums. She invited all other 
actors to do the same, stressing that real and positive change in the lives of people of 
African descent could be achieved if actions to combat discrimination against this 
vulnerable group were consolidated around these three important ideas. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chairperson stated that, in its discussions during the session, the Working 
Group would seek to clarify the situation of people of African descent and arrive at 
recommendations for action addressing the continuing challenges.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>13. At the 1st meeting, the Chairperson presented the agenda and programme of work 
and suggested that they be modified in order to accommodate the keynote address being 
made on the third day instead of the first, and that the order of discussion on two topics be 
reversed so as to accommodate a presentation to be made via a video link from Panama. 
The revised agenda and programme of work, as orally amended by the Chairperson, were 
adopted accordingly. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Keynote address under agenda item 5 
</b></p>
<p>14. Professor Sir Hilary Beckles was invited to give the keynote address at the tenth 
session of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Beckles provided an historical overview of slavery and the transatlantic slave 
trade. He emphasized that it was essential to place the present and the future in the context 
of historical past, as they were all interlinked. For centuries, Africa had been at the centre of 
mineral resources interests; nowadays, even countries that had not been involved in slavery 
and the slave trade had been trying to gain access to such mineral resources.  </p>


<p>16. Mr. Beckles also referred to the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban in 2001. In this 
regard, he highlighted the refusal of Western countries to address the issue of reparations.  
</p>
<p>17. The keynote speaker pointed out that the denial of historic truth was unacceptable 
and that many families of victims of the slave trade, in different countries, continued to face 
the consequences of this crime. The reason why Haiti continued to be one of the poorest 
countries in the world was mainly due to the fact that it was forced to pay reparations to 
France following its independence.  
</p>
<p>18. The speaker noted that slavery and the slave trade had a dreadful impact on national 
health care, education and infrastructure, and that they led to massive illiteracy and poverty. 
Nowadays, the same countries that suffered from slavery were very often defined as &#8220;failed 
States&#8221; and considered a threat to democracy and security as a lack of rule of law and 
democracy provided a fertile ground for terrorism.  
</p>
<p>19. In response to the keynote address, a representative of civil society suggested that 
the Human Rights Council should recognize, in a resolution, the importance of the Haitian, 
French and American revolutions as contributions to the development of human rights. 
These events could also be acknowledged in the context of the tenth anniversary of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>20. A delegate emphasized that remedies were linked to the acknowledgment of 
responsibilities and that issuing statements of regret for the past by some States did not 
necessarily mean an apology and an acknowledgment of their responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>21. Mr. Sicilianos pointed out that reparations had to be in a credible form. It was 
difficult to calculate such human suffering in financial terms. He noted that historical 
monuments were important forms of reparations, because they demonstrated that States 
accepted responsibility for their acts of the past, which in general terms improved dialogue 
among States. Symbolic acts and the adoption of measures guaranteeing non-repetition of 
such tragedies were also essential. 
</p>
<p>22. In response, Mr. Beckles noted that the concept of aid empowered the giver, whose 
act was triggered by sympathy. He emphasized that the nature of reparations is completely 
different as it is an act of justice, returning what was taken from the countries and the 
victims. Reparations were not about confrontation. It is a healing process and a step 
towards the future.  
</p>
<p>23. Mr. Beckles pointed out that special measures should not be confused with 
reparations. He noted that, while special measures were implemented at the national level 
by a Government towards its own population, reparations addressed international 
responsibilities and were made at the international level.  
</p>
<p>24. The keynote speaker emphasized that reparations should be in the form of financial 
redress. Legal practitioners already addressed issues and practices relating to reparations for 
victims of the Holocaust; this could be a good starting point for transferring knowledge and 
applying it to the victims of slavery and the slave trade. He suggested that an international, 
intergovernmental reparation agency be established so that individual countries did not 
have to bear individually the financial burden. Another possibility was to create reparation 
agencies or committees at the regional level, for example one in the Caribbean, one in 
Africa one, and so on,  which could negotiate on behalf of their respective communities. He 
also suggested establishing a reparation fund at the international level, which would finance 
specific projects addressing the consequences of slavery and the slave trade, such as 
research on health and assistance for health care and education.  
</p>
<p>25. The speaker also highlighted the existence of academic racism, which led to the 
perpetuation of racist philosophies. He pointed out that it was important to reflect historical </p>


<p>facts correctly in school curricula. Moreover, he encouraged States where slavery and the 
slave trade took place to build museums to preserve the past and give visibility to historical 
acts that would facilitate the reparation process. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of deliberations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Briefings by members of the Working Group under agenda item 6 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Participation in the Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>26. Ms. Sahli provided an overview of the third session of the Forum on Minority 
Issues, where the focus was put on effective participation of minorities in economic 
activities. She commended the work of the independent expert on minority issues, Gay 
McDougall, who had guided the Forum. The participants, of whom there were more than 
500, included representatives of Governments, treaty bodies, United Nations specialized 
agencies, regional intergovernmental bodies and civil society. Ms. Sahli stressed that, 
importantly, the participants included representatives of minority communities from all 
regions of the world. 
</p>
<p>27. The speaker reported that the continuing challenges and problems pertaining to the 
effective participation of minorities in economic life and their full access to justice, health 
care and education had been discussed thoroughly by United Nations specialized agencies 
and civil society. Economic exclusion was a cause, a manifestation and a consequence of 
discrimination against persons belonging to minorities, many of which had historically been 
excluded from full and effective participation in economic life in both the developed and 
the developing world.  
</p>
<p>28. The speaker called on all stakeholders, including Member States, specialized 
institutions and civil society, to take further action to give more visibility to minorities, 
notably to women and children, who remained largely marginalized. Ms. Sahli also stressed 
the need to incorporate the multicultural aspect of societies in the national Constitution. 
</p>
<p>29. The speaker added that the debate on people of African descent was particularly 
fruitful, and reiterated the importance of special measures and the inclusion of people of 
African descent in economic activities as an effective means to combat the discrimination 
they faced. Ms. Sahli reaffirmed the need for Member States to ratify all relevant 
international legislation pertaining to minorities.  
</p>
<p>30. It was noted that, despite their growing number, people of African descent remained 
invisible in Europe and that more action was needed to address this issue. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Visit to Washington, D.C. by the Chairperson 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Chairperson provided an overview of her visit to Washington, D.C. in 
September 2010, where she met with representatives of the Organization of American 
States (OAS), the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and civil society 
organizations with a view to promoting activities for the International Year. 
</p>
<p>32. The Chairperson announced that the Director of the Department of International 
Law of OAS had briefed her on the activities of the Organization with regard to people of 
African descent, including the draft inter-American convention against racism and all forms 
of discrimination and intolerance, emphasizing that the issue of Afro-descendents remained 
crucial for OAS, but that more still needed to be achieved. The Director had confirmed that 
regional conferences would be held by the Department in 2011, and invited the Working 
Group to participate.  </p>


<p>33. The Chairperson also reported that a representative of the World Bank had given an 
overview of relevant activities pertaining to people of African descent carried out by the 
Bank, such as income-generating projects and a project assisting the national censuses that 
had been conducted in the Americas in 2010. The representative had suggested that any 
conferences held in the context of the International Year would benefit from preparatory 
videoconferences involving non-governmental organizations, as this would generate greater 
interest in the main conference itself.  
</p>
<p>34.  A representative of the Inter-American Development Bank had provided an 
overview of the work of the Bank pertaining to Afro-descendents and the projects that it 
was funding, including one examining race and the collection of data in the context of the 
many censuses conducted in the region in 2010. Another initiative was the creation of an 
inventory of projects relating to people of African descent that had been funded by the 
Bank over the years. This initiative would involve a public meeting in Washington, D.C. 
The Chairperson stated that the Bank was also considering developing a project with 
Prolead, a fund within the Bank that promotes the leadership of women, for women of 
African descent. Ms. Morrison suggested that the  Bank could carry out such a project in 
partnership with OHCHR as a side event to the session of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>35. The two meetings held with non-governmental organizations revealed that there was 
a dearth of knowledge about the 2011 International Year for People of African Descent 
among American non-governmental organizations. For most, the visit by the Chairperson 
was the first time they had heard about the Year. It was agreed that information on the Year 
would be sent to the non-governmental organizations so that they could raise awareness 
about it with other non-governmental organizations with which they had contact. 
</p>
<p>36. The Chairperson stressed that all institutions and non-governmental organizations 
had demonstrated great interest in the work of the Working Group and in engaging actively 
in activities to mark the International Year. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation in the Human Rights Day event in New York 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Chairperson briefed attendees on her participation in the launching of the 
International Year for People of African Descent, which was held in December 2010 in 
New York. The Year had been launched by the Secretary-General  and by the Assistant 
Secretary-General for Human Rights on the occasion of Human Rights Day, on 10 
December. 
</p>
<p>38. The Chairperson expressed her disappointment, which was echoed by a number of 
experts and delegates in the room, at the weak interest shown by Member States in the 
event launched by the Secretary-General, where few delegations were present. She also 
stressed that the theme of &#8220;Recognition, justice and development&#8221; proposed by the Working 
Group had not been endorsed but only welcomed by the General Assembly. Several 
participants commented that significant financial means would be required to implement 
activities within the framework of the International Year, and that this would be an 
indication of the political will of States with regard to the Year. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Discussion under item 7 on Durban + 10 on developments regarding 
people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Chairperson gave a presentation on the achievements of the 2001 World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. 
She stressed that at no other conference had racially motivated colonialism and slavery 
been examined in such detail, and recalled that never before had these practices been 
condemned as crimes against humanity in such clear terms. </p>


<p>40. The Chairperson pointed out that, despite the controversies that had tainted it, the 
conference became the starting point of a far-reaching process whereby States were able to 
come together to reaffirm their commitment to prevent, combat and eradicate all forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>41. The Chairperson stressed that both the 2001 Durban Conference and the 2009 
Review Conference had contributed to a greater degree of attention being paid to new 
challenges of racism and related intolerance, including the discrimination facing people of 
African descent as a group. The conference had expressly acknowledged that 
discriminatory, xenophobic and racist practices were particularly used against people of 
African descent, that generations of Africans had been oppressed by racism, colonialism 
and slavery, and that many still suffered from the consequences. The countries in the 
southern hemisphere used the 2001 and 2009 conferences to introduce their collective 
experience of injustice to the international human rights debate. 
</p>
<p>42. The Chairperson also reported that, while the Durban agenda had triggered new 
initiatives and action, racism, discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance 
persisted in most developed democratic States, particularly against people of African 
descent. She referred to a recent survey conducted by the European Union Agency for 
Fundamental Rights, which concluded that Roma and people of African descent were at the 
top of 10 groups with the highest rates of discrimination, and that thousands of cases of 
racist crime and discrimination remained invisible because they were not reported.  
</p>
<p>43. The Chairperson noted that neither the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action nor the Outcome Document referred to the term &#8220;Afrophobia&#8221; and called for its 
introduction. 
</p>
<p>44. One State observer thanked the Chairperson for her presentation, and commented 
that a comparison of Roma with people of African descent in the presentation was 
problematic. The Chairperson replied that it was not to compare roots of discrimination 
against Roma with those of people of African descent, but rather to show similarities in the 
situation of the two groups in Europe. It was important to note that there were many 
programmes for Roma, but none for people of African descent. Therefore, an important role 
of the Working Group was to raise awareness of the issue of people of African descent to 
the same level as the issue of Roma. 
</p>
<p>45. A member of the Working Group, Maya Sahli, stated in her presentation that the 
main achievement of the Durban World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance was that it recognized slavery as a crime against 
humanity and emphasized the importance of social, economic and political perspectives in 
order to understand contemporary manifestations of racism and all forms of exclusion in the 
areas of health care, housing and education. While progress had been made by States since 
the Conference, including through constitutional reform and the adoption of new legislation 
to combat racism, many countries still lacked the political will to tackle racial 
discrimination efficiently.  
</p>
<p>46. Ms. Sahli reiterated the crucial importance of collecting disaggregated data to 
address the structural discrimination faced by people of African origin. She called for the 
international community to cooperate to ensure that the rights of this vulnerable group are 
protected and that they are made more visible. She stressed that the Durban Conference had 
been a starting point and that the Working Group would continue to be actively involved in 
the protection of the rights of people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>47. A representative from a State asked the member to explain more specifically what 
she thought would be the role of the Working Group in the future process. Ms. Sahli replied 
that the Working Group was a bridge between the United Nations and the international </p>


<p>community that encouraged both to take long-term action in favour of people of African 
descent and to strengthen cooperation among different actors. 
</p>
<p>48. Following the presentations, Ms. Shepherd noted that the country visits of the 
Working Group permitted efficient monitoring of the implementation of the Durban 
Programme of Action. Mr. Sicilianos stated that, despite the controversies, it ought to be 
noted that many States had ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination since 2001, thus showing a greater interest in the fight 
against racism. Several panellists and representatives from non-governmental organizations 
stressed that, while the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was opening a door 
for people of African descent, more needed to be done to make it more effective.  
</p>
<p>49. One civil society observer noted that one of the difficulties that the Durban process 
faced was the lack of political will to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action. The observer also noted that reparation and compensation were important issues, 
but only a few States, such as Belgium, had made any reparations for people of African 
descent. The observer added that European States should acknowledge that they had 
benefited from the hard labour of the ancestors of people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>50. One observer from a non-governmental organization pointed out that the rising 
number of suicides among immigrants, regardless of their legal status, was not always 
recorded and thus not included in statistics. She also mentioned that immigrants from 
Africa in Europe often had higher qualification than locals, but their qualifications were 
often not recognized and nationals were preferred in the job market. Action was also 
needed on the issues of access to housing and medical treatment, including language 
support. 
</p>
<p>51. A representative from a non-governmental organization reported that the 
constitutional reform that followed the Durban Conference in Ecuador helped bring more 
visibility to Afro-Ecuadorians and enabled them to participate actively in policy discussion. 
The importance of reparations, notably the return of ancestral lands, was also noted.  
</p>
<p>52. Diego Moreno of the OAS Department of International Law provided an overview 
of what had been achieved over the past 10 years, since the World Conference against 
Racism, regarding the fight against discrimination affecting people of African descent in 
Latin America. There were 170 to 200 million Afro-descendants in the region, and OAS 
was mainstreaming the issue of people of African descent in order to make the group more 
visible and to ensure their inclusion in all sectors of society. Activities of OAS included the 
organization of conferences, the drafting of manuals for technical cooperation, the holding 
of capacity-building workshops and the drafting of various legal documents relating to 
people of African descent, including summaries of good practices and public policies.  
</p>
<p>53. Mr. Moreno also mentioned a project aimed at disseminating standards of protection 
for people of African descent that identified 19 protection standards, including rights to 
participation, identity, education and religion. He pointed out that OAS had established a 
working group in charge of the drafting of the Inter-American convention against racism 
and racial discrimination, which prohibits 28 grounds of discrimination and indicates 
factors of discrimination. The Organization was currently increasing its partnerships with 
various United Nations bodies, including with the Working Group and the Anti-
Discrimination Section of OHCHR in order to achieve the full inclusion of people of 
African descent in all sectors of society.  
</p>
<p>54. An expert and an observer from civil society commented that the focus on people of 
African descent in the region tended to exclude Caribbean countries, despite their 
significant Afro-descendant population, and suggested that there should be activities 
devoted to these groups in the Caribbean.  </p>


<p>55. Mr. Paixao stated that, although racism was criminalized in Brazil, this was not the 
case in other countries in the Americas. He raised the question of whether a normative 
benchmark established by OAS concerning racism should reflect this high watermark or be 
lower so as to be more readily attainable by the rest of the American States. 
</p>
<p>56. A representative from a State stated that his country was fully committed to 
contribute to the full recognition of people of African descent, and had been undertaking 
several activities, including the production of publications on people of African descent, 
awareness-raising campaigns led by students, the promotion of self-identification of people 
of African descent throughout the country, and the inclusion of the Afro-descendant 
variable in the national census. 
</p>
<p>57. Mr. Wareham of the International Secretariat of the December 12th Movement 
provided an extensive overview of the perspective of several non-governmental 
organizations on the legacy of the World Conference against Racism in 2001 and on the 
actions undertaken by civil society organizations since then to maintain the focus on the 
fight against racism and racial discrimination. In his presentation, Mr. Wareham stressed 
that racism was rooted in economics and that, as a consequence, people of African descent 
remained largely excluded from development.  
</p>
<p>58. Mr. Wareham stressed again the importance of reparation as a healing process to 
address the wrongs of the past. He also called for a decade for people of African descent, 
with the theme of &#8220;recognition, justice and development&#8221; and with Haiti at the forefront. He 
suggested the creation of a permanent forum for people of African descent, and appealed 
for funds to be allocated to ensure the participation of grass-roots non-governmental 
organizations in all United Nations meetings related to the fight against racism affecting 
people of African descent. Mr. Wareham also called for extensive mobilization to ensure 
that all Member States were involved at the highest levels in the high-level segment that 
would commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action. 
</p>
<p>59. The discussions following Mr. Wareham&#8217;s presentation focused on the pivotal role 
of reparations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Thematic discussion under item 8 on the situation of people of African 
descent 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Overview of the current situation facing people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>60. Mr. Linos-Alexander Sicilianos made a presentation on the current situation of 
people of African descent, and focused on the work of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination in that area. He stressed that the issue of people of African descent 
was on the agenda of the review of periodic reports from States and in the 
recommendations of the Committee that followed the examination of the reports. In this 
context, the Committee reported that the enjoyment by people of African descent of their 
economic, social and cultural rights remained disproportionately lower than for most other 
sectors of society, and referred more specifically to the higher unemployment rate of young 
people of African origin in Europe. 
</p>
<p>61. Mr. Sicilianos pointed out that the discrimination faced by people of African descent 
was based on their race and on the colour of their skin, and that people of African descent 
were subject to systematic racial profiling and anti-terrorism measures. He highlighted the 
difficult situation endured by women of African descent, who are often victims of multiple 
forms of discrimination. </p>


<p>62. Mr. Sicilianos emphasized that people of African descent remained invisible in 
many countries, especially in Europe, and reiterated, inter alia, the importance of 
disaggregated data as a tool to address the marginalization of people of African descent. He 
stressed in that regard that the lack of data had to be resolved in order to measure and assess 
the vulnerability of this group and to advocate for special measures that would counter de 
facto inequalities. He specified that such data should be anonymous, as some people of 
African descent do not want to appear as belonging to this specific group, precisely because 
of the stigma attached to it. 
</p>
<p>63. The speaker stated that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
systematically solicited disaggregated data from States, but that some countries were 
reluctant to collect such data because of privacy issues. Mr. Sicilianos also referred to the 
discrimination against people of African descent in the field of the administration of the 
criminal justice system, as well as in relation to the effective enjoyment of political rights 
and participation in the conduct of public affairs. 
</p>
<p>64. Following Mr. Sicilianos&#8217; presentation, Murillo Martinez, member of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, stated that the situation of people of African 
descent was receiving increasing attention from the Committee. He pointed out that during 
its upcoming session, the Committee would discuss a draft general recommendation on 
people of African descent and called for the experts of the Working Group to contribute to 
it. 
</p>
<p>65. Experts and panellists reiterated the importance of harmonizing the already existing 
statistical data and strongly reaffirmed that States had to gather disaggregated data in order 
to be able to monitor efficiently the situation of people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, Githu Muigai, was invited by the Working Group as an 
expert panellist to make a presentation on the current situation of people of African descent. 
According to the Special Rapporteur, the issue of racial discrimination against this group 
was a permanent item of consideration in the activities of his mandate. He reported that the 
issue had been the focus of a number of his visits to countries and of several reports on, 
inter alia, structural discrimination, racism and poverty, the need for ethnically 
disaggregated data and statistics, the importance of the Millennium Development Goals and 
the impact of historical imbalances on the full enjoyment of human rights of certain 
vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>67. In his presentation, the Special Rapporteur focused on the poverty and socio-
economic marginalization that people of African descent face daily, as well as on the 
multiple forms of discrimination faced by women and girls of African descent. He 
emphasized the crucial role played by education and economic empowerment in changing 
attitudes.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur also stressed the need for further cooperation and discussion 
between the different United Nations human rights mechanisms in order to better identify 
issues of concern faced by this vulnerable group and to exchange best practices aimed at 
protecting the rights of people of African descent at the national, regional and international 
levels. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Discussion on positive action to combat discrimination against people of African 
descent 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Chairperson provided an overview of the current situation of people of African 
descent through a reflection on positive action. She stressed that, despite the general 
agreement that discrimination towards people of African descent persisted, there was 
systematic denial of the uniqueness of the discrimination towards this specific group, which </p>


<p>remained invisible in most societies. Ms. Najchevska pointed out the need to abandon the 
view that fighting discrimination by reacting post facto is the only approach, and called 
instead for the shifting of the focus from a mostly negative approach towards a positive 
one, that is, enabling equality. She stressed that cumulative and historical disadvantages 
made it difficult for members of a disadvantaged group ever to attain equal rights and to 
achieve legal redress, and argued that an approach based on equality would create a 
responsibility for Governments to build institutions and to develop policies that would 
prevent discrimination through specific tools aimed at enabling the equal enjoyment of 
rights and freedoms. She reiterated the need to implement a systematic approach in the 
promotion and implementation of positive action based on the use of compensatory, 
corrective and redistributive methods. She added that international mechanisms should play 
a leading role in enabling special measures directed at people of African descent, referring 
to the already existing developments in the cases of indigenous peoples and ethnic 
minorities. Ms. Najchevska insisted that people of African descent should be recognized as 
a group exposed to a unique form of discrimination, and called for the identification of 
measures designed to address the specific inequity traps that people of African descent were 
caught in. She reiterated her call for the establishment of a decade for people of African 
descent. 
</p>
<p>70. Commenting on the Chairperson&#8217;s presentation, Mr. Paixao noted that positive 
action measures needed to be broader and inclusive in order to ensure that minorities 
benefited from better living conditions. Ms. Sahli noted that the three approaches 
introduced in the presentation &#8211; compensatory, corrective and redistributive &#8211; should be 
used cumulatively rather than alternatively.  
</p>
<p>71. A member of the Working Group, Monorama Biswas, gave a presentation on the 
perspective of the Working Group on positive action. She stressed that minorities, 
particularly people of African descent, found it harder to have access to decent employment 
and that too many of them encountered discrimination at least once at work. In order to 
overcome this structural discrimination, Ms. Biswas called on States to put in place national 
action plans that would include special measures, such as legislative, executive, 
administrative, budgetary and regulatory instruments, at every level of the State apparatus. 
They should also develop plans, policies, programmes and preferential regimes in areas 
such as employment, housing, education, culture and participation in public life for 
disadvantaged groups, devised and implemented on the basis of such instruments. She 
added that States should include special measures in their legal systems, whether through 
general legislation or legislation directed to specific sectors, as well as through plans, 
programmes and other policy initiatives at national, regional and local levels. Referring to 
the model in North America, the member pointed out that, despite the controversy that 
tainted it, affirmative action had produced a legacy of tangible successes, including a 
revolution in recruiting and hiring, and had helped to redress the country&#8217;s long history of 
racial discrimination. She stressed that rethinking affirmative action in terms of structural 
inequality, exclusionary institutional practices, trans-generational disadvantages and even 
unconscious biases were effective ways to engage people, individual Governments and the 
international community on the issue. 
</p>
<p>72. Following the presentation, discussions were held on the issues of self-identification 
in censuses and the ever-growing problem of discrimination faced by African migrants in 
Europe, including in the area of employment.  
</p>
<p>73. Ms. Biswas noted that it was for each country to take into consideration the 
difference between vulnerable groups and to take appropriate and specific measures to 
tackle discrimination efficiently. She stressed that the Working Group could contribute 
through collecting data and country visits.  </p>


<p>74. Ms. Sahli also mentioned the importance of identifying a common platform for 
people of African descent to convince States to revise legislation and constitutions in order 
to establish appropriate measures of affirmative action. 
</p>
<p>75. Pastor Murillo, a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, made a presentation on affirmative action and special measures. He 
emphasized the progress made in North America and in Europe owing to awareness-raising 
and positive action measures, as well as the temporary nature of affirmative action and a 
need for a continuous follow-up system on the application and results of these measures. 
This included the obligation of States parties to the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination to provide information in their periodic 
review about special measures taken. While measures of affirmative action were sometimes 
criticized for being &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; and violating the right to equality, Mr. Murillo 
stated that the use of the term &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; should be avoided since it causes 
conceptual confusion. Contrary to opinions against affirmative action measures, he stated, 
they ensure representation of minorities and neutralize prejudices. Quotas were a suitable 
way to foster fairness. States needed to endorse affirmative action but very often lacked the 
political will to do so. 
</p>
<p>76. Mr. Sicilianos commented that there is a question as to whether preferential 
treatment of a vulnerable group should be stopped when equality is achieved. He also noted 
that further discussion might be necessary on the conceptual framework of &#8216;affirmative 
action measures&#8217;.  
</p>
<p>77. One observer from a non-governmental organization noted the particular importance 
of affirmative action in the area of education, stressing that education was the most 
appropriate means to combat rampant discrimination against people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>78. Mr. Murillo pointed out that there was consistent and coherent jurisprudence as well 
as general recommendations and guidelines from the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination pertaining to affirmative action that should be referred to and relied 
upon.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Discussion on the lack of knowledge of the culture, history and traditions of people of 
African descent 
</b></p>
<p>79. Ms. Shepherd made a presentation on the lack of knowledge of the culture, history 
and traditions of people of African descent, by themselves and others, and gave a detailed 
overview of the obstacles to the creation of Afro-centric societies in the Commonwealth 
Caribbean. She began by emphasizing that many people of African descent and of other 
origins were quite aware of the culture of Africa and maintained strong cultural connections 
with Africa, including in the areas of dance, language, religion, dress, hairstyles and 
cuisine, as well as through tangible sites of memory. She also pointed out that the teaching 
of African history in many educational institutions had resulted in a feeling of pride and 
dignity across the African diaspora. Ms. Shepherd explained, however, that despite great 
resistance to the elimination of African culture and tradition by the West, Afro-centricity 
had not permeated all sections of Caribbean societies, essentially because of the history of 
slavery and colonialism. She explained that colonial authorities tried actively to suppress all 
manifestations of African culture, and the remaining signs that could not be erased, such as 
speech patterns and skin colour, were incorporated into Creole society but were marked as 
inferior. 
</p>
<p>80. Ms. Shepherd pointed out that the persistence of colonial influences in Caribbean 
societies was an obstacle to an Afro-centric vision of their political, economic and 
education systems, despite great and continuing efforts to resist. Similarly, racism and the 
lack of respect for the culture, history and traditions of people of African descent in many </p>


<p>developed countries constituted major reasons for the feeling of marginalization of people 
of African and Caribbean ancestry, who are not aware of their heritage, given that it was 
not reflected in school curricula. 
</p>
<p>81. Following Ms. Shepherd&#8217;s presentation, participants took the floor to stress the 
crucial importance of teaching the history of people of African descent as well as the need 
for a large-scale review of history books to incorporate the contributions that Africans and 
people of African descent had made to all sectors of society. 
</p>
<p>82. An observer stressed the need to develop African-centred models in justice, 
education and legislative systems to address past wrongs, and referred to the establishment 
of indigenous courts in Canada as models for dispute resolution systems that are inclusive, 
respectful and designed by indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>83. Marcelo Paixao from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro presented a study 
related to item 8 (c) regarding the lack of knowledge of the culture, history and traditions of 
people of African descent, by themselves and others. The study highlighted results from 
national censuses conducted in several Latin American countries. Mr. Paixao pointed out 
that, in the 2000 census, nine countries had included a question on ethnicity or race, by 
which respondents were asked if they identified themselves as being of African descent 
through one of four main categories: ancestry; culture (including ethnic group, population 
group or nationality); phenotypic traits (skin colour, race); or feeling of belonging (without 
mentioning ethnic group or race). 
</p>
<p>84. Mr. Paixao pointed out that the formulation of questions on ethnicity and race in 
national censuses, household surveys and other data collection may influence the respective 
replies, reliability of collected data and consequently the visibility of people of African 
descent. In this regard, he also noted that it was important to know whether questions 
devised to determine ethnic and racial variables addressed the population as a whole or just 
a specific group.  
</p>
<p>85. Mr. Paixao emphasized that the collection of data, the development of public 
policies, the implementation of affirmative action and self-identification were all 
interrelated. He noted that almost all Latin American countries would have a question on 
people of African descent in their next national census.  
</p>
<p>86. Mr. Paixao stated that statistical data were essential for the creation of the nation-
State. Such data were closely linked to the recognition of groups, the identification of 
challenges they faced, and public policies. In this regard, he encouraged all States to 
introduce racial/ethnical variables in national censuses and other data-collection initiatives 
as this was a prerequisite to improve conditions for these population groups.  
</p>
<p>87. Mr. Sicilianos commented that data on ethnic characteristics was sensitive 
information. He emphasized that it was essential that these kinds of questions were asked in 
an anonymous manner. He also noted that data should be disaggregated by sex, age or on 
other grounds, thus allowing decision makers to identify multiple forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>88. A representative of an international organization pointed out that it was important to 
design and implement rights-based public policies. 
</p>
<p>89. Mr. Paixao stated that it was essential to ensure funds for statistical studies and 
analysis to be carried out. He noted that this kind of data consolidated democracies and 
countered the invisibility of groups and the perpetuation of their problems. In this vein, he 
pointed out that the mortality rate for people of African descents in Brazil was higher, 
including maternal mortality.  
</p>
<p>90. Mr. Paixao highlighted the key role of the United Nations in ensuring data collection 
and analysis. Data were needed to monitor progress, produce new social consensus and </p>


<p>overcome inequality. He stated that proper data collection enhanced democracy because it 
allowed people to say what they think and to be counted in the way they want. The speaker 
also noted the importance of the analysis and interpretation of data, follow-up activities to 
data collection and the development of strategies, in accordance with collected data.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Discussion on the contribution made by people of African descent to global 
development 
</b></p>
<p>91. Alma Jenkins, from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund Regional Office in Panama, 
gave a presentation on the contribution made by young people of African descent to the 
fight against racism and racial discrimination in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</p>
<p>92. In her presentation, Ms. Jenkins spoke about several activities undertaken by Latin 
American and Caribbean Afro-descendant youth groups to follow up on the World 
Conference against Racism. Such initiatives included the involvement of Afro-descendant 
youths in the preparation of shadow reports to the United Nations monitoring bodies, 
participation in the drafting of bills against racism, the monitoring of mass media and 
involvement in census data to guarantee a better visibility of people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>93. Ms. Jenkins stressed that several Afro-descendant Youth summits had been 
organized in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure that the situation of young people 
of African descent was made visible. It was noted that the next summit of young Afro-
descendants leaders would be held in Costa Rica in June 2011 and that OHCHR had been 
invited to participate in it. 
</p>
<p>94. The speaker made a number of recommendations that the efforts made by young 
people of African descent be supported by measures to enhance their inclusion in all aspect 
of public life. Such measures included the reinforcement of their capacity to engage 
actively in policy dialogue, the promotion of affirmative action in universities and academic 
institutions, the mapping of programmes and policies specifically designed for young 
people of African descent and support for intergenerational dialogue between leaders.  
</p>
<p>95. One expert noted that further efforts should be made to monitor the media and to 
protest against the racist stereotypes they often conveyed. The importance of creating a 
forum where young people of African descent could express their views and make 
contributions was also noted. 
</p>
<p>96. Ms. Sahli, made a presentation regarding the contribution made by people of African 
descent to global development. She highlighted the importance of multiculturalism and 
pointed out the need to enhance the mobilization of the diaspora in order to influence social 
and economic policies. The diaspora had reached political maturity in the United States of 
America, but not in Europe. The underrepresentation of people of African descent in 
decision-making bodies, including political structures, was linked to their invisibility. She 
noted the important role played by the media and international networks. In order to 
increase the visibility of the contributions of people of African descent, information must 
be collected and widely disseminated. Most of the available information focuses on 
contributions to sport, music and films, but not on many other areas. The potential of 
people of African descent had to be boosted further by States. 
</p>
<p>97. With regard to migration, Ms. Sahli pointed out that both countries of residence and 
countries of origin had a key role to play. She noted the significant impact of remittances on 
African economies and the fact that this can also reduce poverty in countries of origin. 
Education and access to technology could enhance the efficiency of networks at various 
levels. She emphasized the key role of mass media in changing stereotypes and attitudes.  </p>


<p>98. Verene Shepherd emphasized the importance of the intellectual contributions of 
people of African descent, such as in various books by distinguished scholars, philosophers, 
experts on human rights and Nobel prize laureates. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Discussion under item 9 on the draft conclusions and recommendations 
made at the tenth session 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Chairperson opened the 8th meeting on 1 April with a presentation of the draft 
conclusions and recommendations. She invited the other experts and observers to formulate 
comments. A representative of a State asked about the nature of disaggregated data, as 
referred to in the conclusions and recommendations, and commented on the difficulty of 
collecting such data in those countries where it was State policy not to distinguish between 
different racial groups. A representative from a non-governmental organization commented 
that any recommendation referring to reparations for victims of the slavery and the slave 
trade should identify who exactly was owed reparations. A representative of a State 
commented that the issue of reparations would best be studied separately and that it would 
be extremely difficult to calculate any reparations for slavery and the slave trade.  
</p>
<p>100. A representative of a non-governmental organization suggested that the conclusions 
and recommendations should include a reference to combating denial of the slave trade. 
Several observers commented on the use of the term &#8220;Afrophobia&#8221;, some suggesting that its 
meaning was unclear and others that it did not add value to the current discourse on the 
rights of people of African descent. Others were very much in favour of its use. A 
representative from a regional group commented that reparations for the transatlantic slave 
trade was a divisive issue that had jeopardized the 2001 Conference and that recognizing 
that the slave trade was a crime against humanity did not imply that the issue of reparations 
for people of African descent was a human rights issue. The representative asked for 
clarification concerning the nature of the &#8220;special mechanism&#8221; to reopen the discussion on 
reparations referred to in the recommendations. Another representative of a State 
commented that the issue of reparations was presented in a balanced way in the document 
and did not prejudge future discussions on the subject.  
</p>
<p>101. A representative from a regional group stated that positive and affirmative action 
measures that targeted one specific group could be problematic and that judgements from 
the European Court of Justice had highlighted the difficulty of combining the promotion of 
equal treatment with affirmative action in favour of one group of individuals. In reference 
to the conclusion of the Working Group noting the absence from the session of many 
Western and a significant number of Caribbean countries, the same regional group 
representative commented that a representative of its regional group had been present 
throughout the session. 
</p>
<p>102. A representative from a non-governmental organization commented that the theme 
proposed by the Working Group for the International Year for People of African Descent, 
&#8220;Recognition, justice and development&#8221;, had enjoyed wide acceptance from civil society, 
many Member States and OHCHR. A representative from another non-governmental 
organization commented that there was a connection between the legacy of the slave trade 
and the situation of migrants from Africa, adding that relevant conventions on the rights of 
migrants were not being fully complied with. A representative from a regional group 
commented that a reference to migrants and asylum-seekers in the conclusions and 
recommendations was not relevant, because there was no evidence that people of African 
descent were disproportionately affected. A representative of a non-governmental 
organization stated that the conclusions and recommendations should include reference to 
the right of African descendents to physical space to recreate their culture and the right to 
territorial sovereignty of Afro-descendents. It was further suggested by the representative of </p>


<p>another non-governmental organization that the recommendations should include a call for 
a fund to be created for the development of people of African descent in the Americas.  
</p>
<p>103. A representative of a non-governmental organization proposed that the conclusions 
should include an expression of regret that few States had taken the initiative to launch or 
conduct activities to highlight the International Year for People of African Descent. The 
representative also suggested the inclusion of a recommendation urging States to take 
action in this regard during the remainder of the Year. Another non-governmental 
organization recommended that OHCHR should establish a special fund to facilitate the 
participation of civil society in the meetings of the Working Group. The representative also 
suggested that there should be a recommendation addressing the issue of traditional lands 
and the forced displacement of people of African descent. A representative of a State 
stressed the importance of learning from the experiences of the Forum on Indigenous 
Peoples and ensuring the collaboration of the Working Group with other mechanisms. A 
representative from a regional group commented that structural discrimination was a vague 
term that did not add value compared with the concepts of multiple discrimination or direct 
and indirect discrimination. In reference to the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation 
concerning the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to be 
held in September 2011, the same representative stated that the Working Group was not in 
a position to decide on the modalities of a high-level meeting of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>104. Following the discussion, the amended conclusions and recommendations were 
adopted at the 9th meeting by the Working Group. Several participants, including 
representatives of Member States and civil society, made statements in support of the 
Working Group, praised the quality of the presentations made during the week and 
congratulated the Chairperson for her stewardship of the session. The Chairperson then 
made her closing statement and closed the tenth session.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Working Group is concerned that, despite wide acceptance by States, the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and especially the provisions relating 
to people of African descent, is not being implemented effectively as envisaged because 
of lack of political will and commitment by States.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Working Group reiterates its call to all Governments to demonstrate the 
required political will for and commitment to the effective implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular concerning the 
provisions relating to people of African descent. In this context, the Working Group 
welcomes the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on 22 September 2011 and 
recognizes the importance of the meeting being allocated the time needed for the 
involvement of Heads of State and Government to make their contributions 
encouraging the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Working Group underlines the importance of States enhancing the 
visibility of people of African descent, and discrimination against them, especially 
through the collection and use of credible and comparable disaggregated data.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Working Group reaffirms that the slave trade and slavery are crimes 
against humanity and should always have been so, especially the transatlantic slave 
trade (Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, paragraph 13). The Working </b></p>


<p><b>Group recognizes that reparation for the transatlantic slave trade and slavery is a 
human rights issue that must be addressed adequately.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Mindful of the factual circumstances and standard of living of many people of 
African descent, the Working Group emphasizes the need for positive and affirmative 
action in order to contribute to the achievement of equal enjoyment of their rights.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Working Group underscores the importance of collecting disaggregated 
data to enable recognition of people of African descent as a minority and/or 
vulnerable group within societies, as appropriate. The Working Group also underlines 
the importance of recognizing the fact that people of African descent, where they 
consider themselves a minority group, should be covered by international instruments 
on minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Working Group recognizes the fact that respect for diversity and 
multiculturalism is a means to intensify the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. In this regard, the Working Group underlines the 
importance of education in fighting stereotypes and prejudices against people of 
African descent, and encourages the promotion of greater knowledge of and respect 
for diverse heritages and cultures.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Working Group notes the absence from its tenth session of many Western 
and a significant number of Caribbean countries. The Working Group believes that 
their presence would enhance and enrich the discussion on the improvement of the 
conditions of people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Working Group underlines the need for the criminalization of racism and 
racial discrimination, in accordance with article 4 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Working Group concludes that the 
deleterious effects of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery can still be found in 
racist attitudes towards, and the conditions of existence of, people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The Working Group notes that insufficient attention has been paid to the 
contributions of people of African descent to world development.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Working Group is concerned by information received during its tenth 
session regarding treatment and deportation disproportionately affecting migrants, 
asylum-seekers and refugees of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The Working Group recognizes the efforts that have been made by regional 
and international organizations with regard to people of African descent in the 
context of the Durban process, and stresses the importance of collaborating, when 
appropriate, and continuing to strengthen its relations with these organizations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The Working Group urges States and specialized agencies of the United 
Nations, as appropriate, to implement, as a priority, the provisions pertaining to 
people of African descent in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference, as well as the present and 
previous recommendations of the Working Group. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Working Group recommends that OHCHR include, in the database on 
practices to combat racial discrimination that it is currently developing, a section 
devoted to the situation of people of African descent.  
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Working Group reiterates its call to the United Nations to introduce the 
use of the term &#8220;Afrophobia&#8221; in its work in order to highlight the special and unique </b></p>


<p><b>discrimination faced by people of African descent, since analogous terms are used to 
address the stigmatization and prejudice against ethnic, religious and other 
vulnerable groups.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The Working Group calls on States to recognize the continuing consequences of 
the transatlantic slave trade and slavery on people of African descent and the historic 
disadvantage and marginalization of this group, and to develop comprehensive 
affirmative action programmes, as appropriate, to reduce the high rate of poverty, 
unemployment, underemployment and underrepresentation among African 
descendants.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>The Working Group calls upon the United Nations to establish a special 
mechanism that would reopen the discussion on reparations for slavery and the 
transatlantic slave trade, and study the adequate forms of such reparations.  
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Working Group calls on States to engage in comprehensive reform of their 
education systems, including human rights education and training, with a view to 
addressing stereotypes and prejudices against people of African descent. The Working 
Group recommends that the themes of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery be 
adequately covered in history text books. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Working Group urges States to recognize the unique situation of African-
descendant youth and to implement targeted opportunities and specific measures that 
promote and advance the development of leadership and active participation in all 
sectors of society. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Working Group recommends that OHCHR strengthen its coordination 
with the relevant structures of regional organizations dealing with people of African 
descent.  
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>The Working Group calls upon States Members of the United Nations to 
investigate information regarding the treatment and deportation disproportionately 
affecting migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees of African descent, and to reconsider 
their respective policies, as appropriate.  
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The Working Group strongly recommends that the international community 
declare an international decade for people of African descent to make the challenges 
they face more visible, to identify solutions and to engage in a sustained campaign to 
eradicate structural discrimination against people of African descent. The theme 
proposed by the Working Group for the International Year, and which was widely 
accepted in the international community, should be adopted as the theme of the 
decade, namely &#8220;People of African descent: recognition, justice and development&#8221;. </b></p>


<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Agenda 
</b></p>
