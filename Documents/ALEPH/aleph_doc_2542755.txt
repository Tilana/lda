Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust
CHESAPEAKE GRANITE WASH TRUST ANNOUNCES
DISTRIBUTION OF $0.5079 PER COMMON UNIT
AUSTIN, TEXAS, NOVEMBER 6, 2014 — Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (NYSE:CHKR) (the “Trust”) today
announced that its common unit distribution for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 (which primarily relates to
production attributable to the Trust’s royalty interests from June 1, 2014 through August 31, 2014) will be $0.5079 per
common unit.  The distribution will be paid on December 1, 2014 to all common unitholders of record at the close of
business on November 19, 2014.
During the three-month production period ended August 31, 2014, sales volumes and realized natural gas and natural
gas liquids prices were both lower than initial Trust estimates.  This resulted in quarterly income available for
distribution of $0.3809 per unit, which is $0.3091 below the applicable subordination threshold of $0.6900.  For this
distribution, all of the quarterly income available for distribution will be used to make a distribution per common unit of
$0.5079 and the Trust will not pay a subordinated unit distribution for the quarter.
The following table provides sales volumes, realized prices received and revenue attributable to the Trust’s royalty
interests, expenses of the Trust and distributable income available to unitholders for the production period from
June 1, 2014 through August 31, 2014.

Due to the timing of the payment of production proceeds to the Trust, quarterly distributions generally include royalties
attributable to sales of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas for three months, including the first two months of the
quarter just ended and the last month of the prior quarter.
The Trust was formed by Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) (“Chesapeake”) in June 2011 and owns
royalty interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Colony Granite Wash play in Washita County,
Oklahoma. The Trust is entitled to receive proceeds from the sale of production attributable to the royalty interests.
As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the amount of Trust
revenues and the quarterly distributions to Trust unitholders will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the
timing of initial sales from the development wells drilled by Chesapeake in which the Trust receives an interest, the
sales volume of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas attributable to the Trust’s royalty interests and the prices
received for such sales, amounts realized and paid under the Trust’s hedging arrangements and the amount of the
Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors.
For additional information regarding the Trust and its results of operations and financial condition, please refer to the
Trust’s SEC filings.
