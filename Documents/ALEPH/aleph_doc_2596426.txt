OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
During the period, the Group has continued its principal activities in Alaska.  A summary of significant activities is below: 
 
Overview of Project Icewine – Alaska 
In November 2014, the Company entered into a binding agreement with Burgundy Xploration (BEX) to acquire a significant 
working interest (87.5%, reducing to 78% on spud of the first well on the project) in a large acreage position on a multiple 
objective, liquids rich exploration opportunity onshore Alaska, North America, referred to as Project Icewine. In November 
2015, the gross acreage position was expanded by 172,937 acres (formal award finalised in June 2016) to 271,119 contiguous 
acres  (210,250  acres  net  to  the  Company).  The  Project  is  located  on  an  all  year  operational  access  road  with  both 
conventional  and  unconventional  oil  potential.  The  primary  term  for  the  State  leases  is  10  years  with  no  mandatory 
relinquishment and a low 16.5% royalty. 
 
The  HRZ  liquids-rich  resource  play  has  been  successfully  evaluated  based  on  core  obtained  in  the  recently  completed 
(December  2015)  Icewine  #1  exploration  well,  marking  the  completion  of  Phase  I  of  Project  Icewine.  Phase  II  has  now 
commenced, with planning for a horizontal multi-stage stimulated well that will be flow tested, Icewine#2H, currently underway.
Figure 1: Project Icewine Location
Cautionary Statement: The estimated quantities of petroleum that may be potentially recovered by the application of a future 
development project relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates have both an associated risk of discovery and 
a risk of development. Further exploration, appraisal and evaluation are required to determine the existence of a significant 
quantity of potentially movable hydrocarbons.

HALF-YEAR REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
 
 
 
Generous exploration incentives are provided by the State of Alaska with up to 35% of exploration expenditure refundable in 
cash for 2H2016 and CY2017 activity on the North Slope. 
 
The primary objective is an untested, unconventional liquids-rich shale play in a prolific source rock, the HRZ shale (Brookian 
Sequence), that co-sourced the largest oil field in North America; the giant Prudhoe Bay Oil Field Complex. Internal modelling 
and  analysis  indicates  that  Project  Icewine  is  located  in  a  high  liquids  vapour  phase  sweetspot  analogous  to  those 
encountered in other Tier 1 shale plays e.g. the Eagle Ford, Texas.  
 
Conventional play potential can be found at Project Icewine within the same Brookian petroleum system and shallow to the 
HRZ shale and includes high porosity channel and deep water turbiditic sands. The Brookian conventional play is proven on 
the  North  Slope;  the  USGS  (2013)  estimate  the  remaining  oil  potential  to  be  2.1  billion  barrels  just  within  the  Brookian 
sequence. Additional conventional potential exists in the deeper Kuparuk sands and the Ivashuk Formation. 
 
Drilling in 2012, on the adjacent acreage to the north, confirmed that the HRZ shales, along with the underlying Kingak & 
Shublik shales, were all within the oil window which is extremely encouraging for the unconventional potential at Project 
Icewine. In addition, a conventional oil discovery was reported in the Kuparuk sandstones.  
 
A  Prospective  Resources  Report  by  DeGolyer  and  MacNaughton,  was  commissioned  by  88  Energy  to  evaluate  the 
unconventional resource potential of Project Icewine in February 2016 and was released to the market on 6th April 2016. 
 
Recent Developments during the Financial Period 
 
Phase 1: Evaluation of Core and Log Data - Complete  
During the half year, the Company announced that analysis of core and log data from the Icewine#1 well had resulted in 
mitigation of the main “Achilles’ Heels” of the project. In summary, the following was demonstrated: 
  Brittleness was shown to be analogous to existing successful Marcellus and Haynesville shale plays; 
 
  Elevated pore pressure materially above hydrostatic gradient; 
  Excellent matrix permeability - substantially higher than the Eagle Ford; and 
  Outstanding porosity by comparison to other successful shale plays, including Eagle Ford.  
Post these highly positive results, the Joint Venture initiated planning and permitting for a follow up well, Icewine#2H, which 
is scheduled for spud in 1Q2017 and will include a flow test. 
 
Acquisition of Additional 172,000 Acres Finalised 
The Award documentation for the 63 tracts of land bid on in the North Slope licensing round (November, 2014) was submitted 
by 88 Energy’s Joint Venture partner Burgundy Xploration LLC (‘Burgundy’) for processing by the State of Alaska. During 
processing of the Award survey work undertaken by the State led to an amendment in the acres to be awarded from 90,720 
acres (originally bid on) to 89,542 acres.  
 
Icewine#2H Design and Permitting On Track for 1Q2017 Drilling 
Design for the follow up well Icewine#2H is nearing its final stages with fine tuning of stimulation parameters and landing 
zone selection. Permitting of the well, proposed to be drilled from the same location as Icewine#1, is also proceeding as per 
the planned schedule. The well remains on track for commencement of drilling in 1Q2017, with production testing to occur 
post drilling and stimulation operations. 
 
Upgrade to Independent and Internal Prospective Resource Assessment 
On the 6th April, 2016, the Company announced a 293% increase in the prospective recoverable resource ascribed to the 
HRZ shale horizon. The independent estimate, compiled by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, attributed 1.4 billion barrels of oil 
equivalent to the HRZ on a mean recoverable prospective basis, assuming that 42% of the acreage would be productive in 
a  success  case  scenario.  The  estimated  change  of  geologic  success  was  increased  from  40%  to  60%.  An  internal 
assessment  of  the  resource  potential  resulted  in  an  estimate  of  2.6  billion  barrels  of  recoverable  liquids,  on  a  mean 
prospective recoverable basis. The variance in resource estimates is based on different assumptions, which are detailed in 
the announcement.

HALF-YEAR REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
 
 
 
Cautionary Statement: The estimated quantities of petroleum that may be potentially recovered by the application of a future 
development project relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates have both an associated risk of discovery and 
a risk of development. Further exploration, appraisal and evaluation are required to determine the existence of a significant 
quantity of potentially movable hydrocarbons. 
 
Internal Modelling Suggests Compelling Success Case Break Even Oil Price 
While substantial de-risking of the subsurface has occurred through finalisation of the Phase I Evaluation, the decision to 
proceed with further exploration and development in the current oil price environment required a more detailed analysis of 
the economic potential of the project, under various scenarios. 
 
Encouragingly, internal modelling of various well performance and cost scenarios, set against the backdrop of the Alaskan 
fiscal regime, indicated that the breakeven oil price for the P50 well performance and Mid Case Cost scenario is US$39 per 
barrel. The range of outcomes from the best to worst case was US$27 to US$68 per barrel break even oil price. It should be 
noted that this is an internal estimate and there is no guarantee that a successful flow test will occur with the drilling of 
Icewine#2H. For more detail, refer to the Investor Presentation released to ASX on 17th June 2016. 
 
2D Seismic Acquisition Complete 
Acquisition of 662 line kilometres of 2D seismic, using a vibroseis source, was completed on 6th May 2016. This data was 
complemented by the purchase of a further 108 line kilometres of 2D seismic, extracted from a 3D seismic shoot completed 
in 2015, using a dynamite source. The objective of the 2D seismic is twofold: to reduce risk associated with presence of 
localised faults in the vicinity of Icewine#2H; and to quantify conventional potential on the acreage. Results from processing 
and interpretation of this data are expected to be released in 3Q2016. 
 
Financial
For the period ended 30 June 2016 the Company recorded a loss of $8.06 million (30 June 2015: $2.80 million loss).
No dividends were paid or declared by the Company during the period.
The cash balance as at 30 June 2016 was $20.05 million (31 December 2015: $9.60 million).
In May 2016, the Company completed an oversubscribed placement to raise $25 million (before costs) through the issue of 
715 million shares at $0.031 & $0.043 per share (average 3.5c). Funds raised have been used to fund continued exploration 
of Project Icewine. 
 
During the previous period, the Company entered into a conditional agreement and executed a non-binding Letter of Intent 
with Bank of America to provide a US$50m funding facility pursuant to which Bank of America could approve, in its sole 
discretion,  funding  for  specific  projects.  Bank  of  America’s  lending  commitment  was  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions 
including those related to due diligence which were completed in the previous financial year. During the current financial 
period drawdowns of this facility have continued, ensuring the Company is fully funded for the drilling of its Icewine exploration 
well #1 and recently acquired 2D seismic.
Future Strategy
Project Icewine continues to be the primary exploration focus for the Company and near term endeavours are currently 
geared towards achieving the following objectives:
 

Finalise design of the planned Icewine#2H well, scheduled for spud in 1Q2017; 
Finalise permitting for Icewine#2H;

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
1.  CORPORATE INFORMATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2016 were authorised for issue 
in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 19 August 2016.
88 Energy Limited is a for-profit, limited company incorporated and domiciled in Australia whose shares are publicly 
traded. The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries (the Company) are oil and gas exploration with a 
portfolio of exploration interests in Alaska.
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a)  Basis of Preparation
The half year financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is a general purpose financial report prepared in 
accordance with requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134: Interim 
Financial Reporting.
The half year financial report has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for available for sale assets, which 
have  been  measured  at  fair  value.    Unless  otherwise  noted,  the  carrying  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  as 
disclosed in the half year financial report approximates their fair value. The company is domiciled in Australia and all 
amounts are presented in Australian dollars, unless otherwise noted.
For the purpose of preparing the half year financial report, the half-year has been treated as a discrete reporting period.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the half year financial report are consistent with those followed in 
the preparation of the Company’s annual financial report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The  half  year  financial  report  does  not  include  all  the  information  and  disclosures  required  in  the  annual  financial 
statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 2015, 
together with any public announcements made during the period.
(b)  Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In the half year ended 30 June 2016, the directors have adopted all new and revised Standards and Interpretations 
issued by the AASB that are relevant to its operations and effective from 1 January 2016.
It  has  been  determined  by  the  directors  that  there  is  no  material  impact  of  the  new  and  revised  Standards  and 
Interpretations on the company and, therefore, no change is necessary to Group accounting policies.
(c)  Exploration and evaluation expenditure and the recognition of assets
The accounting policy adopted by the Group is as follows:
(i)
Pre-licence costs
Pre-licence costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
(ii)
Licence and property acquisition costs
Exploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalised in exploration and evaluation expenditure.
(d)  Exploration and evaluation expenditure and the recognition of assets (continued)
Licence and property acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under 
way or firmly planned, or that it has been determined, or work is underway to determine that the discovery is economically 
viable  based  on  a  range  of  technical  and  commercial  considerations  and  sufficient  progress  is  being  made  on 
establishing plans and timing.
If no future activity is planned or the licence has been relinquished or has expired, the carrying value of the licence and 
property acquisition costs are written off through profit or loss. Upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval 
for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and gas properties.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
(iii)
Exploration and evaluation costs
The Company previously accounted for acquisition, exploration and evaluation expenditure relating to an area of interest 
by carrying forward that expenditure where rights to tenure of the area of interest are current.
During the financial year ended 31 December 2015 the Company assessed its choice of accounting policy for exploration 
and evaluation activities and determined that a change in accounting policy was appropriate for new projects going 
forward, which included its projects in Alaska.
The Company now accounts for exploration and evaluation activities as follows: 
Acquisition costs - Exploration and evaluation costs arising from acquisitions are carried forward where exploration 
and evaluation activities have not, at balance date, reached a stage to allow a reasonable assessment of economically 
recoverable reserves.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure - Costs arising from on-going exploration and evaluation activities are assessed 
on a project basis.
Project Icewine: Exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with this project is capitalised to the Statement of 
Financial Position in accordance with AASB 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. These costs are 
only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area 
or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of 
economically recoverable reserves. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against 
profit in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made. This accounting policy choice differs from that 
presented in the comparative half year financial statements as the directors have re-assessed this accounting policy and 
determined this current accounting policy to reflect a more meaningful position of the project.
There are currently no other active projects.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT
To the members of 88 Energy Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of 88 Energy Limited, which comprises
the  consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes comprising a
statement of accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of
the consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the half-year’s end or
from time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether,
on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe
that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving
a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 its performance
for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim
Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of 88 Energy Limited, ASRE
2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual
financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which
has been given to the directors of 88 Energy Limited, would be in the same terms if given to the
directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us
believe that the half-year financial report of 88 Energy Limited is not in accordance with the
Corporations Act 2001 including:
(a) giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
(b) complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and Corporations
Regulations 2001
