 <p></p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the Tehran Declaration and Programme of Action on Human Rights

</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the entry into force on 18 March 2007 of the Convention on the Protection and 
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, adopted by the General Conference of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, on 20 October 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance of the promotion of the cultural rights of everyone and of respect 
for different cultural identities,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all should be based on a profound understanding of the 
variety of problems existing in different societies, on full respect for their economic, social and 
cultural realities and on the full realization and recognition of the universality of all human rights 
and the principles of freedom, justice, equality and non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that cultural diversity is a cherished asset for the advancement and 
welfare of humanity at large and should be valued, enjoyed, genuinely accepted and embraced as 
a permanent feature which enriches our societies, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, 
Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, adopted on 14 November 1970 by the 
General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and 
the Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects, adopted on 24 June 1995 by the 
International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, 
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the importance attached by the countries of origin to the return of cultural 
property which is of fundamental spiritual and cultural value to them, so that they may constitute 
collections representative of their cultural heritage, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern</i> about the illicit traffic of cultural property and its damage to the 
cultural heritage of nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its determination</i> to prevent and mitigate cultural homogenization in the 
context of globalization, through increased intercultural exchange guided by the promotion and 
protection of cultural diversity, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, which are 
universal, indivisible and interdependent; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reiterates</i> that everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the 
</p>
<p>community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also reiterates</i> that everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material 
interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he/she is the author; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> that each culture has a dignity and value which deserve recognition, 
respect and preservation, and expresses its conviction that all cultures share a common set of 
universal values and in their rich variety and diversity, and in the reciprocal influences that they 
exert on one another, they all form part of the common heritage belonging to all humankind; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes</i> that States have the primary responsibility for the promotion of the full 
enjoyment of cultural rights by everyone and for the enhancement of respect for different 
cultural identities; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that cultural cooperation shall contribute to the establishment of stable, 
long-term relations between peoples, which should be subjected as little as possible to the strains 
which may arise in international life; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recognizes</i> that the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of cultural rights 
by everyone and the respect for different cultural identities are vital elements for the protection 
of cultural diversity in the context of the ongoing process of globalization; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms </i>that all peoples have the right of self-determination, by virtue of which 
they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural 
development; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of cultural cooperation for all peoples and all nations, 
which should share with one another their knowledge and skills, and that international 
cooperation, while promoting the enrichment of all cultures through its beneficent action, should 
respect the distinctive character of each; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Emphasizes</i> that cultural cooperation is especially concerned with the moral and 
intellectual education of young people in a spirit of friendship, international understanding and 
peace and should foster awareness among States of the need to stimulate talent and promote the 
training of the rising generations in the most varied sectors; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that the promotion and protection of cultural diversity imply a 
commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international law and 
advances the application and the enjoyment of cultural rights by everyone; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also recognizes</i> that broad dissemination of ideas and knowledge, based on the freest 
exchange and discussion, is essential to creative activity, the pursuit of truth and the 
development of the personality of everyone and the identity of all peoples; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Further recognizes</i> that the promotion of the cultural rights of everyone, of respect 
</p>
<p>for the distinct cultural identities of peoples and of protection of the cultural diversity of 
humanity advances the implementation and enjoyment of all human rights by all; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Stresses </i>that, in the face of current imbalances in flows and exchanges of cultural 
goods and services at the global level, it is necessary to reinforce international cooperation and 
solidarity aimed at enabling all countries, especially developing countries and countries in 
transition, to establish cultural industries that are viable and competitive at national and 
international levels; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 15. <i>Underlines</i> that market forces alone cannot guarantee the preservation and promotion 
of cultural diversity, which is the key to sustainable human development, and from this 
perspective recognizes that the pre-eminence of public policy, in partnership with the private 
sector and civil society, must be reaffirmed; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Calls upon</i> States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to take 
appropriate measures and action for the implementation of the present resolution; 
</p>

on the promotion of the enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for different 
cultural identities (E/CN.4/2006/40); 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Expresses its appreciation</i> to States and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations that responded to or participated in the consultations held pursuant to Commission 
on Human Rights resolutions 2002/26 of 22 April 2002, 2003/26 of 22 April 2003, 2004/20 
of 16 April 2004 and 2005/20 of 14 April 2005; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the establishment of a thematic procedure on the promotion of the 
enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for different cultural identities should 
not develop a new monitoring mechanism, and that the appointment of an independent expert in 
the field of cultural rights could assist the implementation of the present resolution, taking into 
account the work already done in this field by other bodies, organs and organizations of the 
United Nations system; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Acknowledges</i> that the process of review, rationalization and improvement of 
mandates represents momentum towards the establishment of an independent expert on the 
promotion of the enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for different cultural 
identities, and to this end requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
consult States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on the content and scope 
of the mandate of the independent expert, the basis of which would be the comprehensive 
implementation of the present resolution, and to report on the results of those consultations to 
the Council at its ninth session (to be held in September 2008); </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 21. <i>Underlines</i> that it is important to avoid overlapping with the activities of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other bodies and 
organizations of the United Nations system when establishing the mandate of the independent 
expert and to bear in mind the significance of encouraging synergy between all actors dealing 
with cultural rights and the issue of cultural diversity; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter at its ninth session under the same 
agenda item.
