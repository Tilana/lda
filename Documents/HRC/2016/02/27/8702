<p><b>  Status of implementation of the compilation of recommendations of the

</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i>*** 
 In its resolution 11/10, the Human Rights Council requested the independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan to ensure effective follow-up and to foster the 
implementation of the remaining short- and medium-term recommendations identified in 
the first report of the Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6) through an open and constructive 
dialogue with the Government of the Sudan, taking into account the final report of the 
Group of Experts (A/HRC/6/19) and the replies of the Government thereon, and to include 
information in this regard in his report submitted to the Council at its fourteenth session. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert has followed up the effective implementation of the 
recommendations through dialogue with the Government of the Sudan. He has assessed the 
measures taken by the Government to implement the recommendations compiled by the 
Group of Experts and provides the Council with a description and analysis of the status of 
implementation as detailed as possible. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
 ** The summary of the present report is circulated in all official languages. The report itself, annexed to 
</p>
<p>the summary, is circulated in the language of submission only. The appendix to the report is 
circulated as received. 
</p>
<p> *** At the time of writing, the independent expert had not received any response from the Government 
and was therefore required to base the present report exclusively on the information available at that 
time. 
</p>
<p> United Nations A/HRC/14/41/Add.1

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.10-13655 
</p>
<p> On the basis of information received, the independent expert concludes that the 
Government has taken significant steps towards the implementation of some 
recommendations, including the passage of key legislations, such as the Child Act and the 
Press and Printed Materials Act. The Government has also made considerable progress in 
collaborating with the United Nations and other stakeholders in the implementation of 
sustainable programmes to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate former child combatants. 
Nevertheless, the independent expert notes that a significant number of the 
recommendations have not been implemented in spite of the fact that the time frame for 
implementation elapsed more than a year ago. The independent expert also notes that, while 
initial steps have been taken by the Government with regard to certain recommendations, 
they have not had a sufficient impact on the ground. The independent expert reiterates that 
the ultimate measure of the Government&#8217;s implementation of the recommendations 
compiled by the Group has to be concrete improvement in the human rights situation in 
Darfur. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert encourages the Government of the Sudan to take all 
necessary measures to implement the recommendations compiled by the Group of Experts 
on Darfur without further delay, in a more constructive engagement with the Council, the 
United Nations system in general and the international community. He would like to thank 
the Government of Switzerland for their generosity in providing funds for United Nations 
technical assistance required towards this end. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert recommends that the Council continue its process of review, 
in accordance with the indicators for assessing implementation developed by the Group of 
Experts, until such time as there is full implementation of all recommendations. In 
recognition of the fact that the time frame for implementation of the short- and medium-
term recommendations elapsed on 20 June 2008, and despite the Government&#8217;s efforts 
towards a process of cooperative engagement to foster the effective implementation of 
recommendations, key recommendations are yet to be implemented. The Council may also 
wish to consider what further action is required to concretely protect and promote the 
human rights of people in the Darfur region of the Sudan.

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-13655 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council adopted, without a vote, on 30 March 2007, resolution 
4/8 on the follow-up to its decision S-4/101. In its resolution 4/8, the Council decided to 
convene a group of seven mandate holders to ensure the effective follow-up and to foster 
the implementation of the resolutions and recommendations on Darfur adopted by the 
Council, the Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations human rights 
institutions, as well as to promote the implementation of relevant recommendations of other 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan in 
this regard, to safeguard the consistency of these recommendations and to contribute to the 
monitoring of the human rights situation on the ground. The group of experts was presided 
over by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, and 
comprised the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/34, the Council requested the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Sudan to ensure effective follow-up and to foster the implementation 
of the remaining short- and medium-term recommendations identified in the first report of 
the Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6) through an open and constructive dialogue with the 
Government of the Sudan, taking into account the final report of the Group of Experts 
(A/HRC/6/19) and the replies of the Government thereon, and to include information in this 
regard in her report to the Council at its ninth session. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 7/16, the Council urged the Government of the Sudan to continue 
and intensify its efforts to implement the recommendations identified by the Group of 
Experts, in accordance with the specified time frames and indicators. The Council invited relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, including the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, to continue to provide support and technical 
assistance to the Sudan for the implementation of the recommendations of the Group of 
Experts, and called upon donors to continue to provide financial and technical assistance 
and required equipment for the improvement of human rights in the Sudan and to continue 
to provide support for the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 11/10, in which the Council 
created the mandate of the independent expert and requested him to assume the mandate 
and responsibilities set out by the Council in its resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 7/16 and 9/17, 
including following up and fostering the implementation of the remaining 
recommendations of the Group of Experts through open and constructive dialogue, and to 
include information thereon in his report. The present report only reflects information 
received from the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) 
and other sources, including the United Nations Advanced Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), 
and United Nations agencies, bodies and programmes with operational competence in 
Darfur. The Government of the Sudan did not provide any information on its activities to 
implement the recommendations of the Group of Experts. 
</p>
<p>5. Using the indicators contained in the annex to the Group&#8217;s report submitted to the 
Council (A/HRC/5/6), the independent expert provides an assessment of the Government&#8217;s 
activities in implementing the recommendations to be achieved in the short- and medium-
term, as well as the degree of impact reported on the ground in Darfur. Accordingly, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13655 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>present report focuses on developments in Darfur from the adoption of Council resolution 
11/10, in June 2009, to April 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>6. The independent expert continued to follow the methodology used by the Group of 
Experts in its work: 
</p>
<p> (a) To cooperate and work in a transparent manner with the Government of the 
Sudan and other relevant partners of the international community; 
</p>
<p> (b) To identify obstacles to the implementation of previous recommendations;  
 (c) To differentiate short-term from medium-term recommendations with a view 
to assisting the Government of the Sudan to implement fully the recommendations 
identified and to keep the victims of past and ongoing human rights violations of human 
rights and humanitarian law in central focus, with the aim of reducing such violations in the 
future.  
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert analyses information received from UNAMID, UNMIS, 
United Nations agencies and other organizations that are operational in Darfur, with a view 
to identifying whether and to what extent any tangible impact on the ground is being 
reported. This methodology permits the independent expert to conclude, in relation to each 
recommendation, whether (a) it was fully implemented (i.e., all recommended activities 
were carried out and, as a result, the situation on the ground has been reported to have 
improved accordingly); (b) significant activities have been undertaken and a tangible 
impact has been reported from the ground; (c) significant activities have been undertaken 
but little or no practical impact has been reported; (d) initial steps towards implementation 
have been taken; or (e) there was no implementation at all. This report summarizes the 
findings of the independent expert, and sets out detailed information received from other 
sources, as well as the independent expert&#8217;s assessment for each of the recommendations 
contained in the Group&#8217;s first report to the Council (A/HCR/5/6).  
</p><p>8. The independent expert summarizes the present status of implementation for each of 
the four main clusters of recommendations identified, namely: (a) human rights protection; 
(b) humanitarian access, including protection of humanitarian workers from harassment and 
attacks, and facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced; (c) accountability and 
justice; and (d) monitoring of implementation of recommendations. The report ends with 
the independent expert&#8217;s main conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>9. The independent expert sought to ensure, as far as possible, that the information was 
based on first-hand observations, careful verification and, wherever appropriate, inter-
agency corroboration. The independent expert is grateful to all those who submitted 
information on the current status of implementation of recommendations according to the 
time frame and indicators specified by the Group of Experts on Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Status of implementation of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection of the human rights of civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of the civilian population, including internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>10. Regarding the protection of the civilian population, the Group of Experts had 
proposed that the Government of the Sudan  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13655 
</p>
<p>issue and enforce clear orders to the armed forces and any militias under 
Government&#8217;s control that it is prohibited to make civilians or civilian objects 
(including cultivated land and livestock) the target of attacks or to launch 
indiscriminate attacks (including burning of villages and aerial bombardments); that 
such attacks can amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, that suspects, 
including bearers of command responsibility, will be investigated and brought to 
justice, and that any immunities would be waived (recommendation 1.1.1).  
</p>
<p>11. In spite of the improvement in the security situation in Darfur, military activities 
continued during the reporting period. However, compared to previous years, very few 
aerial bombardments and indiscriminate attacks on civilians were documented. United 
Nations sources indicated that, in September 2009, fighting broke out between Government 
and Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) forces over territory in Korma, North 
Darfur, and between two Government security forces in Yarra, South Darfur. Both clashes 
resulted in civilian casualties, mass displacement of civilians and the destruction of civilian 
properties. In Mawu, North Darfur, reports were received of airstrikes and ground attacks 
by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), which appeared to be indiscriminate, failing to 
distinguish between military and civilian targets. A UNAMID assessment mission reported 
the dropping of bombs on villages. Reported fighting between the SAF and SLA/AW 
forces in eastern Jebel Marra in February 2010 also resulted in the displacement of an 
estimated 2,000 households (recommendation 1.1.1). 
12. With regard to controlling and disarming the militia and to controlling and 
downsizing the Popular Defence Forces (PDF), the Border Intelligence Guard<i>,</i> the Central 
Reserve Police, the Popular Police and the Nomadic Police, no formal plan was publicly 
issued to control and disarm the militia. However, on 1 April 2010, the Government of the 
Sudan concluded a discharge exercise of 900 former combatants in Nyala, South Darfur. 
Those discharged included 560 members of the signatories of the Declaration of 
Commitment to the Darfur Peace Agreement and 340 personnel associated with the SAF 
and its affiliates. UNAMID provided technical assistance and logistical support for the 
exercise, including security and transport. The ongoing exercise is part of the Government&#8217;s 
plan to discharge 5,000 former combatants affiliated with the above-mentioned signatories. 
The lack of an agreed policy framework on the ongoing exercise remains a challenge. In 
spite of the effort made by the Government, reports indicate that the militia, the PDF, the 
Border Intelligence Guards and the Central Reserve Police continue to commit violations 
and no effective measures have been taken to fully disarm them (recommendation 1.1.2). 
13. Despite some action taken by the Government to prevent and protect the civilian 
population against attacks (recommendation 1.1.3), civilians continued to be attacked by all 
parties to the conflict, including by non-signatories to the Darfur Peace Agreement, 
Chadian armed opposition groups, and unknown armed elements. Inter-tribal clashes, 
particularly in South Darfur, continued to claim a large number of civilian casualties. In 
March 2010 alone, clashes between the Misseriya and Reizeigat tribes, both of Arab 
descent, claimed more than a 100 lives and an unknown number of displacements, the 
highest number of casualties in one month since UNAMID has been in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government has not made any new effort to send regular patrols to protect 
vulnerable populations. UNAMID conducts regular patrols to most camps for internally 
displaced persons in Darfur. In some areas in West and South Darfur, UNAMID provides 
patrols around the clock, seven days a week, where needed. There have been no joint 
patrols carried out between UNAMID and Sudanese forces (recommendation 1.1.5).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Protection of women against violence 
</b></p>
<p>15. With regard to the recommendation that it publicly acknowledge and condemn 
violence against women, the State Government of West Darfur publicly denounced and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13655 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>condemned violence against women on the occasion of the celebration of &#8220;16 days of 
activism against sexual violence&#8221; in Fora Baranga, in December 2009. While significant 
progress has been made towards the protection of women, acts of sexual violence, 
particularly against internally displaced women and girls, continue to be of concern. In 
2009, UNAMID recorded 101 reported cases of sexual violence (49 in North Darfur, 25 in 
South Darfur, and 27 in West Darfur). The majority of the victims were internally displaced 
girls and women. The incidents took place inside and outside camps for internally displaced 
persons. These numbers notwithstanding, there is general acknowledgement among 
stakeholders that reported cases of sexual violence have decreased. This might be because 
of the Government&#8217;s failure to combat impunity, which has resulted in victims failing or 
refusing to file complaints when attacked. Many victims continue to report their lack of 
trust in the police. UNAMID reports that the police very often fail to take appropriate 
action in sexual violence cases unless the alleged perpetrator is named by the victim. The 
problem has been further compounded by the fear of stigma associated with rape, the lack 
of police presence in many remote areas in Darfur, reporting fatigue among victims, who 
rarely benefit from any remedial action by the authorities, and the overall weakness of the 
justice system to hold perpetrators accountable (recommendation 1.2.2).  
</p><p>16. Significant progress was made in the implementation of State committee workplans. 
Through the assistance of the technical cooperation project funded by the Government of 
Switzerland, UNAMID provided training sessions and supported the State committees to 
finalize their workplans. This training has enhanced the State committees&#8217; involvement in 
cases of sexual and gender-based violence through coordination with relevant stakeholders, 
including with police investigators, prosecutors and medical and rape counselling personnel 
(recommendations 1.2.4 and 1.2.6). Significant progress was made in the deployment of 
female police in Darfur during the reporting period. In North Darfur, the Government 
reported the training and deployment of more than 100 female police officers. In South 
Darfur, however, the deployment of female police officers has been slow. Only one female 
was observed by UNAMID to be working with the family and child protection unit. The 
presence of women police officers above the rank of lieutenant is extremely limited and, in 
this regard, further recruitment is needed (recommendation 1.2.7). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Child Act 2009 was passed by the National Assembly on 29 December 2009. 
The new law contains a number of constructive provisions, including the definition of a 
child as anyone who has not reached the age of 18 years and the revocation of &#8220;signs of 
maturity&#8221; as a criterion for defining a child. The Act also raises the age of criminal 
responsibility from 7 to 12 years, makes child exploitation and abuse a criminal offence, 
and establishes a comprehensive juvenile justice system; however, it does not criminalize 
female genital mutilation (recommendation 1.3.2). 
</p><p>18. Much progress was made in the work of the child disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration programmes. The national commission responsible for the programmes has 
established core standards for the release of children, family reunification and reintegration 
of children. Monitoring and evaluation tools in line with the integrated standards and the 
Paris Principles have also been established. Accordingly, a programme for child 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration was initiated in Darfur by the relevant North 
Sudan commission with the support of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund based on an 
operational plan developed with six armed groups, which were signatories to the Darfur 
Peace Agreement. They include the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) Free Will, the SLA/Abu 
Ghasim/Mother Wing, the Justine and Equality Movement (JEM) Peace Wing, the 
SLA/Mini Minnawi, the SLA/Peace Wing and the Popular Force for Rights and 
Democracy. To date, a list of over 2,000 names of children has been submitted by the 
groups. With participation of all stakeholders, to date 387 children from SLA Free Will and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13655 
</p>
<p>SLA Mother Wing have been disarmed, demobilized and registered for the reintegration 
programme. The association of children with armed groups, including pro-government 
militias, remains nonetheless a major concern. Given the scale of alleged association of 
children with the various armed groups, there is need for the availability of sufficient funds 
in support of the rehabilitation and reintegration of released children (recommendation 
1.3.3).  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Protection against summary executions, arbitrary detention, disappearances and 
torture 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Government has not issued new instructions that summary executions, arbitrary 
detention, enforced or involuntary disappearances and torture are illegal and will not be 
tolerated, and that they can amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity<i>.</i> Cases of 
arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of civilians documented by UNAMID during the 
reporting period continue to show that the National Intelligence and Security Service 
(NISS) and the Sudanese Military Intelligence are the main governmental authorities most 
responsible for the violations in Darfur. Detainees are often held without being informed of 
the reason for their arrest, and sometimes detained without charge for prolonged periods 
and not brought before a judicial authority. In some instances, detainees are held 
incommunicado and subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment.  
20. The 1997 Emergency and Public Safety Act continues to apply in Darfur, where a 
state of emergency remains in existence. The law grants wide discretionary powers of arrest 
and detention to the State governors of Darfur without any effective judicial review. In 
North Darfur, 16 people suspected of involvement in the murder of a local community 
leader from the Abou Shok camp for internally displaced persons near El Fasher were 
arrested and detained for more than five months under the Emergency Act without access to 
lawyers and without being brought before a judicial authority. Six of the detainees remain 
in detention and have not been charged with an offence more than eight months since their 
arrest (recommendations 1.4.1 and 1.4.2). 
21. UNAMID Human Rights continues to be denied unfettered access to detention 
centres and prisons, including the NISS, Military Intelligence and police detention centres. 
Access to detainees, particularly those held under the emergency law, was extremely 
difficult. In some instances, limited access was granted on a case-by-case basis, depending 
on the rapport between human rights monitors and prison officials. United Nations human 
rights monitors still have no access to places of detention in Khartoum, which is of concern 
for Darfur-related detainees transferred to the capital (either for trial or interrogation). On 
20 December 2009, the National Assembly of the Government of National Unity passed a 
bill repealing the 1999 National Security Forces Act and reforming the NISS. Under the 
new bill, which the President has not yet assented to, the NISS has powers of arrest and 
detention for a period of 30 days without any prosecutorial approval or judicial order. The 
new law also grants NISS personnel immunity against criminal prosecution and civil 
liability (recommendations 1.4.3 and 1.4.4).  
22. The Convention against Torture has not been ratified by the Sudan (recommendation 
1.4.5).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Protection of witnesses and victims 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Government has not taken adequate measures to ensure that human rights 
monitors have full and unimpeded access to witnesses and victims of human rights 
violations, and that victims and witnesses are not subject to reprisals or harassment for 
cooperating with human rights monitors. In addition, no concrete information was provided 
by the Government on measures taken to protect witnesses and victims against violence, 
reprisals and harassment by third parties. On the contrary, the freedom of movement of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13655 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>human rights monitors and their access to victims and witnesses were impeded by 
numerous restrictions imposed by Government officials and by armed movements. In 
places like South Darfur, State officials denied access to some places, claiming that they 
had to be informed in advance of UNAMID movements. Access to certain internally 
displaced camps was also occasionally denied to UNAMID by Government officials. In 
addition, the access of human rights monitors to victims and witnesses continues to be 
affected by the increasing incidence of carjacking and banditry targeting United Nations 
personnel and assets. 
</p>
<p>24. On 8 June 2009, the National Assembly passed the Press and Printed Materials Act, 
which provides that no restrictions should be imposed on press publications unless 
prescribed by law to protect national security, public order and health. It also provides for 
the right of access to information in accordance with the law and also prohibits the 
confiscation and closing down of newspapers. It sets up a national press council in which 
journalists form the majority of members. In September 2009, the President of the Republic 
issued a decree lifting pre-censorship of the print media. Despite these improvements, 
concerns remain about the extensive powers conferred on the press supervisory body 
(recommendation 1.6.2). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of humanitarian workers from harassment and attack 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the reporting period, attacks were persistently made against humanitarian 
workers and UNAMID staff, incidents of abduction of international aid workers and armed 
ambushes against UNAMID peacekeepers were also witnessed. A total of 111 United 
Nations vehicles were carjacked in 2009. These incidents underscore the extremely difficult 
and volatile conditions in which UNAMID and other actors on the ground are carrying out 
their respective mandates. UNAMID personnel were also targeted by direct attacks on five 
occasions, resulting in the death of six peacekeepers. 
</p>
<p>26. In Kutum, North Darfur, two female staff members of international non-
governmental organizations were abducted by unidentified gunmen in July 2009, then 
released in mid-October. In August 2009, two UNAMID international civilian staff 
members were abducted from their residence in Zalingei, West Darfur, by unidentified 
gunmen. The two were held in captivity for more than 100 days until their release in 
December 2009. An international employee of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross was released on 18 March 2010 after being abducted in El Geneina and held in 
captivity for a total of 147 days. On 15 April 2010, four peacekeepers were forcefully taken 
from outside their team site in Nyala, South Darfur, by unidentified armed men. The four 
were released unharmed on 26 April.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced 
</b></p>
<p>27. In the aftermath of the expulsion on 4 March 2009 of 13 non-governmental 
organizations from Darfur, the Government took positive steps towards facilitating 
humanitarian assistance in Darfur, including by publicly welcoming the remaining and 
certain new non-governmental organizations to work in the region. In August 2009, a high-
level committee on humanitarian affairs, comprising senior Sudanese officials, 
representatives of the diplomatic community, the United Nations, regional and non-
governmental organizations endorsed the creation of a mechanism to verify the voluntary 
return of internally displaced persons in accordance with international humanitarian 
principles. Humanitarian access in Darfur was uneven during the reporting period. Access 
to urban areas outside the State capitals improved thanks to the presence of UNAMID team 
sites, while access to other areas, such as Jebel Marra and Jebel Moon, in West Darfur, and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-13655 
</p>
<p>Kass, in South Darfur, were restricted owing to renewed fighting between Government and 
rebel forces and intertribal clashes. 
</p>
<p>28. On 15 November 2009, the North Darfur State Joint Committee was launched as a 
branch of the National High-Level Committee. All three Darfur States are required to 
establish joint State committees to ensure efficiency in the delivery of humanitarian 
assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability and justice 
</b>29. The judicial response to serious human rights abuses remained weak during the 
reporting period. To date, the Government has failed to bring to justice those responsible 
for the law enforcement operation in Kalma, near Nyala, South Darfur, in August 2008, 
which resulted in the death of 33 internally displaced persons.<b> </b>Yet again, no one has been 
charged for the numerous carjackings and attacks on humanitarians that have occurred in 
Darfur since the beginning of 2008. In South Darfur, where intertribal fighting accounted 
for most of the civilian deaths in 2009, no criminal investigation is known to have been 
initiated for the killing of civilians and other human rights violations committed in the 
context of those events. The Special Prosecutor<b> </b>appointed by the Government to investigate 
crimes committed in Darfur since 2003 and thereafter is yet to lay charges against anyone 
as a result of his investigations. On a positive note, on 9 June 2009, two people, including a 
member of the PDF, were charged and tried in an El Geneina court in West Darfur for 
robbing and shooting an aid worker. 
</p>
<p>30. Immunities continue to exist for law enforcement and security agents under various 
laws, including the Police and Armed Forces Acts. The new NISS bill, which was passed 
by the National Legislature in December 2009, grants NISS personnel immunity from 
criminal prosecution and civil liability that can only be lifted by the Director of the Service 
(recommendation 3.2). 
</p><p>31. The Government of the Sudan has not cooperated with the International Criminal 
Court in investigating and prosecuting international crimes committed in Darfur. Indeed, 
new amendments introduced to the Criminal Procedure Act included a provision that 
prohibits the institution of criminal proceedings against any Sudanese national for any act 
that may constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, 
crimes against humanity and genocide, except &#8220;before the Sudanese police, general 
prosecution and the judiciary&#8221; (recommendation 3.3). 
32. In the reporting period, the Government made considerable progress in legal reform 
to ensure the harmonization of national laws in accordance with the Interim National 
Constitution and with the country&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law. New 
laws, such as the Child Act 2009 and the Press and Printed Materials 2009, were also 
passed; however, the reform of other laws, such as the NISS bill and the Criminal 
Procedure Act, failed to meet international human rights standards (recommendation 3.5). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Monitoring implementation of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>33. Human Rights forums were held in Khartoum and Darfur, on 2 and 9 February 2010 
respectively, to engage the Government in constructive dialogue on human rights. Both 
forums were attended by representatives of the Government, the United Nations, non-
governmental organizations, members of the diplomatic community and the independent 
expert. Given its composition and terms of reference, as noted by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 11/10, the forum serves as a useful mechanism for the exchange of 
information and dialogue on human rights concerns. </p>

</b></p>
<p>34. Human rights monitors continued to be denied unfettered access to detention 
facilities and were not allowed to interview victims and witnesses in private. Monitors were 
also not granted full access to police records. In spite of the passage of the National Human 
Rights Commission Act in April 2009, the Commission is not operational because the 
Government is yet to initiate a process to nominate and select its members 
(recommendations 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.7). 
</p><p>35. The Government did not extend a standing invitation to special procedures during 
the reporting period; however, it approved the request of the independent expert to visit the 
Sudan and provided full support and assistance to the expert&#8217;s mission in January 2010. The 
Government also welcomed and fully facilitated the visit to the Sudan of a four-member 
delegation from the African Commission on Peoples and Human Rights in late October 
2009. The delegation, inter alia, followed up on the Commission&#8217;s 2004 fact-finding report 
on the human rights and humanitarian situation in Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>36.<b> The Government of the Sudan has taken some steps to implement the 
recommendations of the Group of Experts on Darfur. Nonetheless, the independent 
expert notes that a significant number of the recommendations still remain without 
implementation in spite of the fact that the time frame for implementation elapsed 
more than a year ago. He also notes that, while initial steps have been taken by the 
Government with regard to some recommendations, they have not had a sufficient 
impact on the ground. The Government needs to take additional measures to improve 
the human rights situation on the ground in Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p>37.<b> The independent expert notes that the Government has not provided any 
information on its activities to implement the recommendations of the Group of 
Experts within the reporting period. 
</b></p>
<p>38.<b> The information provided on the human rights situation from UNAMID, 
United Nations agencies, bodies and programmes with operational competence in 
Darfur and other relevant sources reflects a situation that requires further action 
from the Government. 
</b></p>
<p>39.<b> In particular, the independent expert assesses the status of implementation of 
the recommendations contained in the report of the Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6, 
annex) as follows (see also the appendix): 
 (a) Full implementation (i.e. all recommended activities were carried out to 
lay the framework for improving the situation on the ground): recommendations 
1.2.1, 1.2.6, 1.3.1 and 4.1; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Significant activities undertaken and implementation in process: 
recommendations 1.1.4, 1.2.4, 1.2.7, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.6.2, 3.4, 4.4 and 4.6; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Some activities undertaken or reported, but little or no tangible impact 
reported on the ground: recommendations 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.5, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.5, 
1.2.8, 1.4.4, 1.5.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.4, 2.2.1 and 4.7; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Initial steps towards implementation undertaken: recommendations 
2.2.2, 3.1, 3.5, 4.2 and 4.3; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) No implementation at all, which has direct bearing on concretely 
improving the human rights situation on the ground: recommendations 1.2.9, 1.4.1, 
1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.5, 1.6.1, 2.1.3, 2.2.3, 3.2, 3.3, 4.5 and 4.8. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-13655 
</p>
<p>40.<b> The independent expert, while acknowledging the activities undertaken by the 
Government of the Sudan, is concerned that reports received from the ground clearly 
indicate that, with very few exceptions, these efforts still have not yet led to an 
improvement in the situation of human rights in Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> The independent expert acknowledges that full implementation of certain 
recommendations may be complex and that tangible impact could take time, 
especially where recommended activities have been undertaken only recently. He 
notes that, in certain specific instances, the feasibility of full implementation could 
have been affected by the absence of sufficient resources and technical assistance; 
however, several recommendations on protection against summary execution, 
arbitrary detention and torture, which were prioritized as short-term and could have 
been implemented within a short-term time frame (as they did not require lengthy 
administrative processes or additional resources) have not yet been implemented. The 
independent expert reiterates that the lack of resources cannot justify any act of 
violence against the civilian population or the lack of action to prevent such acts. 
</b></p>
<p>42.<b> The independent expert recalls the consensus of the Human Rights Council, 
welcoming the initial measures taken by the Government to implement the 
recommendations of the Group of Experts on Darfur and to address human rights 
concerns, but noting that a number of recommendations had not yet been 
implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>43.<b> The independent expert recommends that the Council continue the process of 
reviewing the implementation of recommendations until such time as there is full 
implementation, or at least significant activities, and tangible impact has been 
reported from the ground. In recognition of the fact that the time frame for 
implementation of the short- and medium-term recommendations elapsed on 20 June 
2008 and the Government of the Sudan still needs to effectively implement the 
majority of recommendations requested by the Council, the Council could ask the 
Government why it has been unable to implement the recommendations, and also 
consider what further action is required to concretely protect the human rights of 
people in the Darfur region of the Sudan. The transparent engagement and 
cooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the Council and other relevant 
partners of the international community will play an important role in the protection 
and promotion of human rights on the ground. It will also help to identify obstacles to 
the implementation of previous recommendations. The Council may also wish to 
consider what further practical action is required to protect the human rights of 
people in Darfur. </b></p>

cultivated land and livestock) the target of attacks or to launch indiscriminate attacks 
(including burning of villages and aerial bombardments); that such attacks can amount to

<p>Air and land attacks against civilians 
</p>
<p>On 29 September 2009, GoS forces launched an air 
offensive in the area of Mawu, North Darfur. According to 
reports, two GoS Antonov planes dropped several bombs 
on the western part of Mawu. Following the bombings, 
SAF soldiers accompanied by armed militias riding in 
land cruiser vehicles entered the village and started 
shooting. Eye-witnesses reported looting and burning of 
houses and the local market. An UNAMID assessment 
team visited the area on 8 October and documented the 
destruction of more than 30 houses, including a UN 
agency office, a health clinic belonging to an INGO and 
two water wells. 
</p>
<p>Some activities were 
undertaken but little or no 
impact has been reported 
from the ground. 
</p>
<p>In South Darfur, several houses in Chawa village were 
reportedly burned when members of the Sudan Armed 
Forces (SAF) attacked the village on 11 October 2009 in 
an apparent retaliation for an earlier ambush on a 
Government police convoy by unknown armed men. 
Exact number of casualties could not be confirmed. 
</p>
<p>

<p>UNAMID documented serious human rights violations 
within the context of clashes between members of the 
Popular Defense Forces (PDF) and members of the Border 
Intelligence Guards (BIG) in Yarra, and surrounding

<p>villages (Sayiengo, Amar Jadid, and Dogi), 40 km north of 
Nyala South Darfur. The fighting broke out on 15 
September 2009 following the arrest of a PDF member by 
BIG soldiers. The fighting reportedly resulted in the 
displacement of the civilian population and killing of 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>In Korma, North Darfur, UNAMID received information 
on an SAF attack on SLA/AW controlled areas in Western 
Korma. On 7 September 2009 GoS forces in collaboration 
with militia groups attacked the positions of SLA/AW in 
the area. UNAMID could not confirm the exact number of 
casualties as it was denied access to the area by the 
Government due to the intensity of the fighting. However, 
it is believed that at least five people including civilians 
were killed in the fighting. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In South Darfur, Government aerial bombardment of 
SLA/Abdul Wahid controlled areas in East Jebel Marra, 
including Kidingir, Kara, Deribat, Fena, Kutur, Alaradeb 
and Alashara at the beginning of January 2010 reportedly 
led to displacement and killing of civilians. Exact figures 
could not be confirmed due to UNAMID&#8217;s limited access 
to the area. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In 2007, the Government adopted the Armed Forces Act 
which penalizes violations of international humanitarian 
and human rights law. Amendments to the Criminal act 
adopted in May 2009 also made new provisions on war 
crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Start to implement, in cooperation with the UN and AMIS, a plan to control and 
disarm the militia. Action should also be taken to control and downsize security forces such 
as the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), Border Intelligence Guard, Central Reserve Police, 
Popular Police or Nomadic Police. Ensure that members of these institutions are vetted to 
exclude members who have committed serious human rights violations and bring them to

<p>On 1 April 2010, the Government concluded a discharge 
exercise of 900 former combatants in Nyala (South 
Darfur). Those discharged included 560 members of the 
signatories of the Declaration of Commitment (DoC) to the 
Darfur Peace Agreement and 340 personnel associated

</p>
<p>protect populations under attack 
</p>
<p>Despite some action taken by the Government to prevent 
and protect the civilian population against attacks in areas 
under its control, civilians in some parts of Darfur 
continue to remain unprotected. A significant number of 
attacks against civilians continued to be perpetuated by 
non-signatories to the Darfur Peace Agreement, Chadian 
Armed Opposition Groups, and unknown armed elements. 
Throughout 2009, IDP camps (all mostly in Government 
controlled areas) remained in a highly insecure state with 
incidents of night shootings routinely reported by camp 
residents and several fatalities inside the camps. In 
addition several cases of sexual and gender-based violence 
(SGBV) were also documented. From November 2009 
through April 2010, UNAMID recorded more than 60 
incidents of attacks on IDPs inside the camps. 
</p>
<p>Some activities were 
undertaken but little or no 
impact has been reported 
from the ground. 
</p>
<p>On intertribal clashes, although the Government initiated 
reconciliation measures among feuding tribes, there were 
more clashes between tribes especially in South Darfur. 
From August 2009 to March 2010, more than 288 deaths 
were recorded in tribal-related clashes: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Shangil Tobayi, North Darfur, ongoing fighting 
between members of the Birgid and Zaghawa tribes 
from September to October 2009 resulted in more 
than 20 civilian deaths, among them women and 
children 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the Kass locality of South Darfur, dozens of 
people were killed when fighting broke out on 20 
and 25 March 2010 between the Rezeigat Abala and 
the Misseriya Baggarat Arab tribes 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Al Ban Jadid, north of Nyala, over 50 civilians 
were killed and dozens wounded in renewed clashes 
between two nomad tribes, the Rezeigat and Al-
Saada tribes 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Military offensives by Government forces, clashes among 
rebel factions and intertribal clashes continued to cause 
mass displacements of civilians in Darfur. During the 
reporting period UNAMID recorded six waves of 
displacements of civilians totalling more than 13,000 
people which were the result of some of the following 
incidents:

sexual violence are still reported in the camps. 
Women and girls from the camps continued to be 
attacked and assaulted when they ventured outside.

<p>The Government claims to have established 150

<p>Acts of sexual violence, particularly against internally 
displaced women and girls continue to occur in 
Darfur. In 2009, UNAMID recorded 101 reported 
cases of sexual violence (49 in North Darfur, 25 in 
South Darfur and 27 in West Darfur). The majority of 
the victims were internally displaced girls and 
women. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Of the several cases of SGBV documented by 
UNAMID in 2009, only 7 cases have successfully 
been prosecuted. UNAMID recorded 9 incidents 
where police acted upon a SGBV report and 17 cases 
where police failed to act even though they were 
presented with all the facts. Below are few examples: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Examples of police action  
</p>
<p>In Kabkabiya, North Darfur, police arrested two 
military personnel accused of raping two 16-year-old 
girls on 15 May 2009. The police reported that the 
two have been placed in military detention, pending 
the arrival of a judge to start judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In Zalingei, West Darfur two Government police 
officers accused of raping a 50-year-old IDP woman 
on 31 October 2009 have been dismissed from the 
police service and are awaiting trial in a civilian 
court. The alleged perpetrators were arrested on 1 
November, and found guilty by a police court on 3 
November. On 5 November, relatives of the suspects 
submitted a request for their retrial in an ordinary 
court. The suspects were released on bail and are 
reportedly awaiting trial in a civilian court.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Examples of police&#8217;s inaction  
</p>
<p>In Mornei, West Darfur, UNAMID investigated a 
case in which two members of the Central Reserve 
Police accused of raping two girls, ages 13 and 15, on 
18 July 2009, were released from jail on the orders of 
the Mornei police commander. The police 
commander informed UNAMID that the men were 
released because the girls consented to the 
intercourse. Further, the commander stated that the 
victims Form 8 indicated that they were not virgins at 
the time of the incident. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In El Geneina, West Darfur, police have failed to 
arrest one of its members accused of raping an 11-
year-old girl on 11 September 2009. On 3 November, 
UNAMID was in court to monitor proceedings at the 
El Geneina Special Court where the case is being 
tried. The hearing was adjourned due to the failure of

<p>There continues to exist a great deal of mistrust 
between IDPs and Sudanese security forces. In some 
camps including Otash and Alsalaam, in South 
Darfur, the police are stationed in the camp, and make 
regular patrols within the camps, but lack the capacity 
to investigate cases in and outside the camps. In other 
camps like Kalma in South Darfur and Hamidiya and 
Hassa Hissa in Zalingei, West Darfur, GoS forces are 
not allowed inside the camps.

UNAMID, attacks on UNAMID convoys in 
Government-controlled areas and restriction on the
