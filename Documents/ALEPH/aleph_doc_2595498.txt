Financial and Operating Report
FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid operating and financial performance for the first half of 2016,
continuing to execute on its strategy 
to improve cash flows and returns on a sustainable basis and to develop optionality within the
business. The results show improved 
earnings and free cash flow given strong ongoing focus on cost and capital discipline, and the
rising gold price.
“We will continue to push hard to improve operational and cost performance, as well as our
overall balance sheet flexibility,
regardless of the gold price environment,” Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan
said. “Our focus remains to improve 
margins and grow cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis.”
Production was 1.745Moz at a total cash cost of $706/oz for the six months to 30 June 2016,
compared to 1.878Moz at $726/oz in the 
first six months of 2015, from continuing operations. The decrease in production from continuing
operations was led by weaker 
production from Kibali and a planned decrease in head grades at Tropicana, as noted earlier in
the year. AISC improved by $13/oz 
over the first half of last year, decreasing from $924/oz to $911/oz. The improvement in AISC
reflects continued cost discipline 
throughout the group, weaker currencies and lower capital expenditure. Our portfolio of assets
continued to deliver strong and 
consistent performance as a whole.
Free cash flow of $108m was recorded for the half year, more than triple the $31m for the first half
of 2015, resulting in 3 
consecutive quarters of free cash flow generation. Free cash flow was affected by negative
working capital movements which will 
unwind in the second half of the year, specifically $28m from the sale of metal from Argentina
which was delayed until the week 
immediately following half year.
This overall improvement in free cash flow, however, was driven by continued efforts to contain
costs and improve efficiencies, weaker 
currencies in key operating jurisdictions, $33m in interest savings, and a 1% higher gold price
received.
Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by $37m, or 7%, from $513m in the six months
ended 30 June 2015 to $476m in the 
six months ended 30 June 2016, reflecting a 7% drop in production from continuing operations
and negative working capital 
movements, which included timing of gold shipments from Argentina, and movements in VAT
receivables in South Africa.
AHE were $159m, or 39 cents per share, compared with $61m, or 15 cents, in the first half of
2015. Net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders during the first half of 2016 was $52m compared with a net loss from continuing
operations of $23m a year earlier. During 
the six months ended 30 June 2016, AngloGold Ashanti settled foreign denominated debt
resulting in a recycling of historic foreign 
exchange losses of $60m from the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve to the Income
Statement. This was added back for headline 
earnings. In addition, the effective tax rate reduced from 113% to 46% as the tax charges
decreased from $115m in the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to $51m in the six months ended 30 June 2016. This was largely due to the
currency impact on the translation of 
the deferred tax balance in South America.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA)
decreased by 12m, or 2% from $793m in the 
six month period ended 30 June 2015 to $781m in the six months ended 30 June 2016. The
lower production year-on-year was largely 
offset by cost improvements over the same period. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA at
the end of June 2016 was 1.44 times, 
compared with the 1.47 times recorded at the end March 2016, and 1.95 times at the end of June
2015, highlighting the success of 
AngloGold Ashanti’s continued efforts to deleverage and sustain improvements in cash flow.
Net debt fell by 32% to $2.098bn, from $3.076bn at the end of June 2015, mainly as a result of
the proceeds received on the sale 
of Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) for $819m which was concluded last year, as well as
continued strong cost management, which 
saw improvements across most cost areas.
The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising $1.0bn available on the US
dollar revolving credit facility (RCF) at 
the end of June 2016, A$190m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately
R3.2bn available from the South African 
RCF and other facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $470m as at the end of June 2016.
This strong liquidity position allowed AngloGold Ashanti to draw down $330m from the US dollar
RCF at the end of July to partially fund 
the redemption of the $503m outstanding in 8.5% bonds due in 2020. The remainder was funded
by cash on hand. The redemption 
was executed on 1 August 2016 at a predetermined price of 106.375 cents on the dollar, thereby
eliminating the company’s highest-
cost debt, and reducing both interest payments and the concentration of debt maturities in 2020,
improving free cash flow and 
introducing additional balance-sheet flexibility by reducing the company’s hardened debt levels.
This will reduce interest charges by 
$40m on an annualised basis.
The South African operations reported a 3% drop in production year-on-year to 486,000oz,
alongside a 13% improvement in 
AISC which declined to $958/oz, from $1,098/oz in the same period last year. Mponeng delivered
the standout performance in the
region, with a 25% increase in production and a 28% decrease in AISC year-on-year. However,
whilst the weaker rand benefitted 
costs, production continued to be hampered by increased safety-related stoppages which have
become a feature of the country’s 
underground mining industry. The frequent and unpredictable nature of Section 54 stoppages
and mass compliance audits by the 
Department of Mineral Resources has created an element of risk to production levels from the
region, given the resultant downtime and 
production ramp-up periods.
The International operations delivered production of 1.259Moz at an AISC of $873/oz, compared
with 1.378Moz at an AISC of 
$840/oz in the same period last year. These mines, all outside South Africa, accounted for 72%
of AngloGold Ashanti’s total 
production, and benefited from weaker currencies in Argentina, Australia and Brazil. There were
especially strong cost performances 
from Sunrise Dam and Cerro Vanguardia, which posted significant efficiency gains during the
first half of 2016. As indicated at the 
beginning of the year, production was lower in accordance with the plans at Geita and Tropicana,
whilst Kibali continued to face 
challenges encountered in mining and processing different ore types, and the first attempt during
the first quarter to test the transition to 
a sulphide processing circuit.

July 2016 Interim report - www.AngloGoldAshanti.com
Capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities) was $318m for the six months ended 30
June 2016 compared to $426m 
(including discontinued operations) in the same period last year. This reduction was partially due
to favourable exchange rate 
movements, impediments in reaching investment targets caused by ongoing safety stoppages in
South Africa, and the cessation of 
work on the underground decline access at Obuasi in Ghana. It is expected that capital
expenditure will increase in the second half of 
the year in line with past trends.

SAFETY UPDATE
The all injury frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 8.03 per
million hours worked in the first half,
from 7.51 in the same period last year, a 7% regression mainly due to the South Africa region,
while the International operations 
recorded AIFR at 2.19, a 31% improvement from 3.17 reported last year. Regrettably, there were
three fatalities in this period, a fall of 
ground fatal in TauTona and two fatalities which occurred in seismic events at the Savuka
section of TauTona, with the largest 
measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale.
In South Africa, work on the execution of the Safe Production Strategy which focuses on
improving skills, behaviour and 
attitude, planning work and protecting workers from risk continues. As a result, Moab Khotsong
managed to achieve one million fatality 
free shifts on 10 May 2016, Mponeng achieved one million fatality free shifts during the first
quarter of the year, whilst Kopanang 
achieved one million fatality free shifts on 14 June 2016 as well as one-year fatality-free on 1 July
2016.
The safe management of mobile equipment remains a key focus area across the International
operations, especially in the Continental 
Africa region. Training programmes aimed at improving competence of equipment operators and
supervisors are being implemented to 
reduce the risks associated with mobile equipment. High potential incident audits are conducted
regularly to mitigate safety challenges 
across the group, which include fall of ground and heavy mobile equipment incidents.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
The South African operations produced 486,000oz at a total cash cost of $809/oz for the six
months ended 30 June 2016 compared 
to 500,000oz at a total cash cost of $894/oz in the same period last year. Safety stoppages
resulted in approximately 44,085oz of lost 
production, given the downtime and resultant ramp-up period. Costs benefitted from the weaker
exchange rate despite these lower 
production volumes, inflationary pressures on labour and power, and the court-ordered re-
instatement of the 542 employees dismissed 
in 2013.
At West Wits, production was 214,000oz at a total cash cost of $786/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2016 compared to 
207,000oz at a total cash cost of $910/oz in the same period last year. Production was affected
by the fall-of-ground incident in 
January at TauTona, and a seismic-related fatal accident at the Savuka section of the same mine
in April. Both incidents led to 
prolonged stoppages, impacting negatively on production and development. Work is underway to
revise the production plan to further 
improve access to working areas. This was more than offset by the strong production
performance from Mponeng, which showed 
recovery from the safety- related production interruptions encountered in the six months ended 30
June 2015. Mponeng was one of 
the lowest cost producers for the South African region in the first half of 2016 at a total cash cost
of $692/oz reflecting an 
improvement of 25% year-on-year.
Vaal River production was 173,000oz at a total cash cost of $843/oz for the six months ended
June 2016, compared to 191,000oz at a 
total cash cost of $861/oz in the same period last year. Production was negatively impacted by
safety-related stoppages, with Moab 
Khotsong most affected.

July 2016 Interim report - www.AngloGoldAshanti.com
Production at Surface Operations was 93,000oz at a total cash cost of $797/oz for the six months
ended 30 June 2016, compared to 
97,000oz at a total cash cost of $925/oz in the same period last year. The most significant impact
on production was a decline in 
yield from the reclamation of the lower grade Tailings Storage Facilities at the West Wits section.
The Vaal River section saw 
improved grades from the success of the screening initiative to upgrade the Kopanang marginal
ore dumps. Production at Mine 
Waste Solutions improved as a result of an improved reclamation strategy and from the
commissioning of the East Pump Station in 
the third quarter of 2015. The flotation plant was recommissioned in June and it is expected that
the Uranium plant will be fully 
operational during the third quarter of this year, which is expected to result in improved gold and
uranium recovery.
In the Continental Africa region, production was 620,000oz at a total cash cost of $690/oz for
the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared to 719,000oz at a total cash cost of $675/oz in the same period last year. Costs were
impacted by overall low production 
volumes, despite strong ongoing cost control. Production was affected by the planned lower
production from Geita, a 
disappointing performance from Kibali, and the cessation of tailings retreatment at Obuasi.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kibali’s production was 114,000oz at a total cash
cost of $802/oz for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared to 148,000oz at a total cash cost of $588/oz in the same period
last year. The lower production was 
due to lower throughput, recovery and grade while the operation manages the complexity of
several different surface and 
underground ore types. Ahead of commissioning of the shaft in the second half of 2017 and an
increase in the proportion of sulphide 
ore, a plant trial was undertaken on 100% sulphide. The trial highlighted a number of areas
where improvements will be 
needed including fine grinding and sulphide concentrate leaching. To provide improved flexibility
two high -grade satellite pits are 
being developed in the current year and in 2017. Development of the underground mine is
progressing on schedule with shaft 
equipping completed, and off- shaft development and integration with the decline system in
progress.
In Ghana, Iduapriem’s production increased 13% to 99,000oz at a total cash cost of $931/oz for
the six months ended 30 June 2016, 
compared to 88,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,037/oz in the same period last year. The
production improvement was driven by a 6%
higher recovered grade as well as a 6% increase in tonnage treated as a result of improved plant
utilisation compared to the 
same period last year when throughput was impacted by an extensive plant shutdown. Total
cash costs consequently decreased 
mainly a s a result of higher production together with the once-off benefit of a reversal of
contractor mining costs for the settlement of 
historical claims with the previous mining contractor.
At Obuasi, the first half of 2016 has been dominated by the incursion of illegal miners onto the
operating area. Despite extensive 
engagements with the authorities at all levels to re-establish law and order, illegal miners
continue to occupy the lease area. The mine 
has been placed on care and maintenance, with only essential dewatering, ventilation and water
treatment activities being underta 
ken. Meanwhile, future options for recommencing operations continue to be evaluated.
At Siguiri in Guinea, production was 126,000oz at a total cash cost of $706/oz for the six months
ended 30 June 2016 compared 
to 132,000oz at a total cash cost of $837/oz in the same period last year. Production was lower
due to a planned 7% decrease 
in recovered grade, partly compensated by a 2% increase in tonnage throughput given the
increased plant availability. Total cash costs 
were lower as a result of weaker currency exchange rates, lower fuel prices, a once-off benefit of
a reversal of the contractor 
mining costs for the settlement of historical claims with the previous mining contractor, and
favourable ore stockpile movements.
In Mali, Morila’s production was 13,000oz at a total cash cost of $965/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2016 compared to 
35,000oz at a total cash cost of $569/oz in the same period last year. Production decreased as
the operation transitions to end -of- 
life, treating marginal and tailings grade.
At Sadiola, production was 36,000oz at a total cash cost of $826/oz for the six months ended 30
June 2016 compared to 36,000oz at 
a total cash cost of $840/oz in the same period last year. Production was maintained, while total
cash cost decreased due to lower 
fuel prices and good cost management.
In Tanzania, Geita produced 229,000oz at a total cash cost of $496/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2016 compared to 
250,000oz at a total cash cost of $487/oz in the same period last year. Production decreased as
a result of a planned 11% 
reduction in recovered grade from mining lower grade ore in the Nyankanga pit compared to the
same period last year. This was 
partly compensated for by a 3% increase in plant throughput as a result of consistent plant
operations. The focus for Geita over the 
next few quarters will be toward improving mining efficiencies in the new underground
development and step-up productivity to planned 
levels.
In the Americas, production was 388,000oz at a total cash cost of $549/oz for the six months
ended 30 June 2016 compared 
to 377,000oz at a total cash cost of $632/oz in the same period last year. The AISC at $816/oz
compared to $849/oz this period last 
year, were due to good cost controls, weaker exchange rates, and higher by-product sales in
Argentina, partially tempered by high 
inflation, particularly in Brazil.
In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia produced 136,000oz at a total cash cost of $543/oz for the six
months ended 30 June 2016 
compared to 135,000oz at a total cash cost of $641/oz in the same period last year. Total cash
costs were 15% lower than in the same 
period last year, helped by the local currency devaluation and a 35% increase in by-product
sales of silver. These were partially offset 
by inflationary pressures which included initial salary increases following a wage settlement
reached in February. It is expected 
that a second round of negotiations will take place early in the second half of the year.
Unfavourable stockpile movements resulted 
from lower tonnes mined during a short, unprocedural strike in January. Free cash flow for the six
months ended 30 June 2016 was 
negatively impacted due to a delay in the receipt of cash from gold and silver sales of $28m.
In Brazil, production was 252,000oz at a total cash cost of $545/oz for the six months ended 30
June 2016 compared to 242,000oz a 
total cash cost of $627/oz in the same period last year. AISC were $857/oz compared to $816/oz
for same period last year. The lower 
costs reflect higher capital expenditure partially offset by higher gold sold, lower operating
expenditure and favourable exchange rates 
in the current period.
At AngloGold Ashanti Mineração, production was 188,000oz at a total cash cost of $531/oz for
the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared to 181,000oz at a total cash cost of $598/oz in the same period last year. Production
increased due to higher tonnage at 
both the Cuiabá and Córrego do Sítio complexes together with higher grades from the latter. The
improvement was due to increased 
developed reserves at the beginning of the year at Cuiabá, in addition to better operational
performance at both the mine and plant 
in the Córrego do Sítio complex. Production at the Cuiabá complex was slightly affected, where
access to higher grade areas -
5
July 2016 Interim report - www.AngloGoldAshanti.com
some as high as 20g/t - was delayed due to geotechnical issues. However, changes in the
mining plan have already been made and it
is expected that production will improve in the second half of the year. Total cash costs were 11%
lower compared to same period last 
year mainly due to higher production, continued cost saving initiatives and the weaker currency,
partially offset by higher inflation.
At Serra Grande production was 64,000oz at a total cash cost at $584/oz
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to
61,000oz at a total cash cost of $714/oz in the same period last year. Production increased as a
result of higher recovered grade and
tonnage treated, reflecting operational improvements in the plant. Total cash costs were 18%
lower due to higher gold produced, cost
saving initiatives from labour
and primary development credits
, and local currency devaluation, partially impacted by higher inflationary
impacts including power costs. Drilling ahead of our retreat mining development has revealed
areas in the Minas III ore body where 
mineralised material extends significantly further than anticipated. This will result in a longer-
than-anticipated development period, 
compensated for with additional ounces in the production profile. We are working on improving
this outcome in future by looki ng at 
augmenting existing exploration budgets.
In Australia, production was 251,000oz at a total cash cost of $806/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2016 compared to 
282,000oz at a total cash cost of $703/oz in the same period last year. Production was down
despite better mill throughput due to
lower grades at both operations. A plant optimisation and upgrade project at Tropicana to lift
throughput to 7.5 Mtpa is expected to be
completed by the end of September.
Production at Sunrise Dam was 113,000oz at a total cash cost of $858/oz for the six months
ended 30 June 2016 compared 
to 115,000oz at a total cash cost of $958/oz in the same period last year. Production was
impacted by lower grades and marginally 
lower metallurgical recovery, despite a 6% increase in mill throughput. Total cash costs
decreased with the impact of lower grades 
more than offset by favourable ore stockpile movements together with good cost controls. The
efficiencies were derived from 
reduced mining, processing and maintenance costs and reduced underground mining costs,
whereby the cost per tonne mined was 
11% lower than in the same period last year when there was a higher ore stock drawdown. Ore
production at Sunrise Dam has now 
increased to an annualised rate of 2.8 Mt, almost doubling underground volumes since 2012, and
continuing to displace mill-feed 
from low-grade stockpiles with higher-grade underground material.
At Tropicana, production was 137,000oz at a total cash cost of $704/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2016, compared to 
167,000oz at a total cash cost of $476/oz in the same period last year. Production was lower due
to the planned end to grade 
streaming in December 2015, which meant the head grade was 27% lower in the first half of
2016 compared to the corresponding 
period in 2015. Total cash costs increased compared to the same period last year, primarily due
to lower production and inventory 
movement, with 19% more ore mined. The plant optimisation project remains on schedule for
completion in September and the plant 
achieved a record throughput rate of 7.28 Mtpa in May and June. The Long Island Study, which
has been considering innovative, low 
cost approaches to mining the depth extensions of the Tropicana mineralised system, has
advanced, supported by extensive 
drilling. An updated Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimate is expected at the end of the
year and the study is expected to be 
completed in the first half of 2017.
PERSONNEL
A number of key personnel changes have been made across our operations. These changes
highlight the strength and depth of our 
internal talent pool, an area on which we have spent considerable time, expertise and resources
over the past several years. These 
changes are also consistent with our commitment to timeous succession planning in all roles
across the business.
Ludwig Eybers, who has been with the company for five years, and has led the remarkable
turnaround of our Continental Africa 
portfolio since 2013, has been appointed Deputy Chief Operating Officer: International. Ludwig,
who has had extensive experience 
working across a number of international jurisdictions over a 20-year career, has overseen an
increase in productivity for the 
Continental Africa region, along with an improvement in safety. He will work closely with Ron
Largent on budgeting and business 
planning, as well as on the execution of Operational Excellence initiatives.
Ludwig replaces Helcio Guerra, who has decided, for personal reasons, to take early retirement
at the end of December, after a 
distinguished mining career of almost four decades, the past eight years of which were spent with
AngloGold Ashanti. Helcio was 
most recently the Deputy COO: International following his position as Senior Vice President:
Americas. Helcio has been a key 
member of our operational management team and contributed to the transformation of the
International Portfolio over the past three 
years in particular. He has mentored a world-class team in Argentina and Brazil, and leaves
behind a suite of assets with an exciting 
range of future options for AngloGold Ashanti. We wish him all the best in his well-deserved
retirement.
Sicelo Ntuli, who has for the past three years led the turnaround of the Iduapriem mine in Ghana,
where costs have decreased, will 
replace Ludwig as Senior Vice President: Continental Africa. Sicelo, a mining engineer, has
extensive operating experience across 
the group’s open pit and deep underground assets, as well as in business planning and strategy
roles over his career for more than 
20 years spent with AngloGold Ashanti. He will work closely with Ludwig as he transitions into
his new role. (Sicelo will be replaced 
at Iduapriem by Jasper Musadaidzwa, currently the operations manager at Siguiri Mine).
Lowe Billingsley, Vice President of Planning and Strategy, in the International business unit, will
assume the role of Senior Vice 
President: Americas. In his most recent post he had oversight of strategy implementation and
long-range planning for the Americas 
portfolio. Lowe is a trained geologist who has also held several important posts during his 26
years with the company, including 
General Manager of the Cripple Creek & Victor Mine during its successful mine-life extension
project. He will work closely with Helcio 
as he transitions into his new role.
Moses Madondo, general manager of the Moab Khotsong mine, will assume a broader suite of
responsibilities as he assumes his 
new role of Senior Vice President of the Vaal River Region in South Africa. Moses, a mining
engineer who has extensive experience 
spanning strategy, planning and operations, will continue to work closely with Chris Sheppard,
COO: South Africa, and his executive 
management team in South Africa, as they continue their work to safely improve productivity in
the region.
UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS
At Mponeng, in Phase 1: 126 level, the implementation of the secondary support strategy
continued to produce positive results 
during the second quarter. The ore handling infrastructure at 126 level, which includes the
sinking of reef and waste silos, remains 
ahead of schedule. This project is scheduled for completion in July 2018.
6
July 2016 Interim report - www.AngloGoldAshanti.com
In Phase 2, critical execution activities continued, including the construction of the surface
substation which was completed during 
the second quarter, which is now awaiting commissioning from Eskom, along with the
continuation of equipping the ice pipe and 
other associated activities. The balance of Phase 2 is scheduled to commence in January 2018
and a pre-feasibility is being 
conducted on the Carbon Leader ore body extension.
At Kibali, remedial work on the Ambarau hydro power station was completed, following the river
flood event in November 2015. 
Construction is back on track, and commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2016. Early works
have commenced on the third hydro-
power station at Azambi.
At Siguiri, AngloGold Ashanti plans to invest about $115m over a little over two years to add a
hard-rock plant to the current 
processing infrastructure, providing the ability to develop the significant sulphide-ore potential
that exists on the current concession. 
during the first half of the year the company reached an agreement with the Government of
Guinea on the Convention de Base, a 
legal and fiscal framework covering the life of the project. The accord will now progress through
the mandatory legal and 
parliamentary ratification processes.
At Sadiola, AngloGold Ashanti and joint-venture partner IAMGOLD Corporation are completing a
final optimisation of the Sadiola 
Sulphides Project, ahead of an investment decision later this year. The project, to add sulphide-
ore processing capability to the plant,
was suspended in 2013 after the precipitous decline in the gold price that year. Whilst the
technical and financial aspects of the 
optimised project look promising, it is important that the Government of Mali – itself an owner of a
18% stake in the mine – provide 
assurances around the renewal of the construction and operating permits, power agreement and
fiscal terms relating to the project, 
as previously negotiated, before an investment commitment can be made. The early timing of
these assurances and renewals from 
the Government are especially important in order for the upgraded plant to be fully operational
before all existing sources of oxide ore 
are depleted. The project aims to significantly extend the life of the project, with increased
production and lower operating costs from 
the current levels. 
Colombia remains an area of long-term focus for us, particularly given its attractive and under-
explored geological potential, AngloGold 
Ashanti’s first-mover advantage in the country and its significant exploration success to date.
Whilst bearing in mind that we remain in 
an environment in which financial resources are constrained, we have committed to completing
the update of the pre-feasibility studies 
for the Gramalote and La Colosa projects by the end of next year. We anticipate that the
successful completion of these studies will 
enable the declaration of reserves to take place.
Technology and Innovation update
1. Reef Boring
1.1 Small range:
Commisioning of the Sandvik/Cubex machine commenced at Savuka Mine earlier in the quarter
with operational readiness having 
been the key focus during this period. Training of operators will continue during the third quarter
with the first cycle of operational test 
results expected soon thereafter. 
1.2 Medium Range:
With a blue print cycle time of 72 hours/hole, the 3 MK III machines in the Carbon Leader site at
TauTona mine have drilled a total of 
16 holes during the quarter. Overall performace for the quarter has improved to just over 82
hours/hole as opposed to the previous 
quarters performance of 96 hours/hole. As is the case with the MK IV machine, machine
availability/reliability is an issue, but is 
receiving attention. As planned, an additional MK III machine was successfully commissioned in
the VCR site during the quarter.
The MK IV machine has for the second consecutive quarter performed at just above the 92
hour/hole mark. Key issues affecting the 
performance remain rock handling and more importantly machine availability where dedicated
resources have been deployed to 
assist in resolving these issues.
All sites were affected by mine wide safety stoppages as well as a geotechnical incidence
resulting in the total number of holes
completed being lower than planned for the quarter.
2. Ore body Knowledge and Exploration
The first prototype drill rig was delivered to TauTona mine during the quarter and after a number
of surface commisioning challenges 
were resolved, was moved into position at the drill site late in the second quarter. Underground
commissioning will commence early 
in the third quarter, upon which our first prototype machine tests will commence focussing on
deflection optimisation trials.
3. Ultra High Strength Backfill (UHSB)
Construction of the surface solution plant at TauTona mine is still ongoing and on schedule.
Site development for the permanent UHSB plant at Savuka mine has been delayed due to safety
stoppages. However, in the interim 
period, the temporary plant has been used to fill all the drilled holes allowing testing of the small
range reef boring machine to 
continue.
Designs for the TauTona Below 120 (B120) plant has been finalised. The tendering process will
commence in quarter three and 
construction is planned to commence in the fourth quarter.
GREENFIELDS
During the first half of the year, Greenfields exploration activities were undertaken in Australia,
Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, 
USA, Guinea and Tanzania. The Greenfields exploration team completed 1,219m of diamond
drilling in Colombia and 14,016m of 
aircore drilling in Australia. Total expenditure for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was $10m. 
7
July 2016 Interim report - www.AngloGoldAshanti.com
In Australia, at the Tropicana Mine there was a formal hand-over to the mine-based team of the
accountability for all tenements within 
60kms of the mine. Further to the south in the Tropicana joint-venture on the Oak Dam tenement,
the Greenfields team continued 
to work with the traditional owners to determine where access for exploration would be allowed.
In the Laverton District, aircore 
drilling was completed over priority targets with 91 holes drilled for a total of 5,742m. At the
Strawbridge Project (100% AngloGold 
Ashanti) the field work comprised geological mapping, surface soil geochemical sampling and
first pass aircore drilling. A total of 
778 soil samples and 197 aircore holes for 8,274m were completed over priority target areas.
In Colombia, drilling was completed at the Guintar project (100% AngloGold Ashanti) situated
40km west of Medellin. Three holes 
for 1,219m were completed in the first half of the year. Final compilation and review
recommended that no further work is required. 
Work has now shifted to the Margaritas project area 2kms to the south where mapping, rock and
soil geochemistry has been 
completed. Reconnaissance work was conducted in other locations within Antioquia province in
the mid-Cauca belt.
Generative exploration occurred in Brazil, Argentina, USA, Guinea and Tanzania. In a
significant development, the Greenfields 
exploration team signed a new farm-in and joint-venture agreement with Luna Gold to explore
approximately 2,000km
2
tenement
package located in the Maranhão state of Brazil. In Tanzania the Meia license applications (850
km
2
) in the Lake Victoria
Greenstone Belt of Tanzania are pending and should be granted in the third quarter. The first
phase of exploration was completed at 
the Niandan license in Guinea (100km
2
, 90km from Siguiri) and 491 surface samples were collected. Early stage work is progressing
in Argentina and the USA.
BROWNFIELDS
During the first half of the year, Brownfields exploration activities were undertaken across the
globe. Brownfields exploration, 
including equity accounted joint-ventures, completed 285,877m of diamond drilling at a total
expenditure for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 of which $27m was capitalised and $33m was expensed.
South Africa: The mother hole of borehole UD59 successfully intersected a 1.82m thick VCR
reef at 3,888m below surface on 
11 April. Borehole UD60 reached 3,345m (284m drilled during the half) and continued to
experience in-hole complications. 
Borehole UD58A completed piloting to a depth of 3,027m. The final establishment of the ultra-
deep derrick has been completed and 
drilling commenced.
Tanzania: At Geita, drilling activities included infill drilling at Nyankanga Cut 9 (Block 5 UG),
Nyankanga Cut 8, Star & Comet Cut 
3, Geita Hill East Cut 2, and Mineral Resource delineation drilling at Star & Comet UG and Geita
Hill East UG. A total of 10,372m 
was drilled, comprising 4,392m reverse circulation (RC) and 5,980m diamond drilling (DD).
Guinea: At Siguri, a total of 29,415m was drilled. Exploration drilling included infill and
reconnaissance drilling at Bidini North, 
Bidini South, Soloni, Kalamagna PB2, Seguelen PB2, Seguelen satellite pit, Silakoro, Kami
‘starter pit’, Balato NE and sterilisation 
drilling at Boukaria. Additionally, exploration supported the drilling of 12,893m allocated to
Advance Grade Control within the Kami 
starter pit.
Ghana: At Iduapriem, on the Bankyem/Block 1E target, the remaining trenches from 2015
exploration were sampled early in the first 
quarter. A total of 1,597m drilling was completed over the target, comprising 421m RC and
1,176m DD. At Block 4S, 2,456m drilling 
was completed, including 501m RC and 1,955m DD, with some encouraging assay results
returned. Within the southern area at Block 
7&8, a total of 796m were drilled during the quarter with some encouraging results. The
programme is ongoing.
Democratic Republic of the Congo: At Kibali, exploration focused on Kombokolo, the
Agbarabo-Rhino-Pakaka corridor, Tete 
Bakangwe, Sessenge SW and the KCD super pit. The forecast production shortfall has resulted
in an emphasis on projects 
with potential to deliver oxide ounces to the plant in the relatively short term. Regional targets
explored include Aindi Watsa, 
Memekazi Ridge and Zambula. A total of 7,953m was drilled near mine and 3,519m was drilled
on regional targets. 
Republic of Mali – At Sadiola and Yatela, RC drilling totaling 11,716m was completed during
the first half of the year. Drilling 
focused on Sadiola North/FN (4,624m), FE2S (5,454m) and FE1W (1,638m).
In Argentina, drilling commenced at Cerro Vanguardia during Q2 after a delayed start with most
of the drilling meters completed at the 
nearby Claudia joint-venture. During the second quarter 4,174m were drilled in total, including
3,618m at the Claudia joint-venture.
In Brazil, exploration continued at the Cuiabá, Lamego and Córrego di Sítio production centers
for AGABM with 61,221m drilled during 
the quarter from the combined surface and underground drilling programmes.
At Serra Grande, 36,295m were drilled as part of the exploration and Mineral Resource
conversion programmes. Surface exploration 
continued as preparation to establish drilling targets.
In Colombia, the Gramalote joint-venture completed 1,279m of drilling to support site and
infrastructure investigations as well as infill 
drilling to better define the saprolite horizon. At La Colosa, 1,453m were drilled as the site
investigation geotechnical drilling continued. 
The Quebradona JV programme did not complete drilling during the half year and was focused
on study work.
In Australia, at Sunrise Dam drilling targeted Vogue South, Vogue Deeps, north extensions to
Cosmo and Cosmo East, Carey Shear, 
Below Carey high grade zone and Ulu Steeps for a total of 28,758m.
At Tropicana, a 100m x 100m exploration drilling programme continues to test the along-strike
and down dip extensions of the
Tropicana gold system to provide data for the Long Island Mining Study. Infill drilling was also
carried out on the Havana South high 
grade zone identified during the June quarter. A total of 16,670m of RC and 34,695m of DD
drilling was completed in the first half of 
2016. A Mineral Resource model update is in progress.
A new regional exploration group was set-up based at Tropicana to manage the TJV exploration
tenements (excluding the mine 
lease). In the first half of the year, regional exploration consisted of drilling and a ground-based
geophysical survey. Aircore, RC and 
DD totalled 13,360m.
The regional dataset review and a large amount of regional structural re-interpretation work to aid
targeting has been completed with a
number of areas identified as being potentially prospective. A large number of these will be
systematically targeted.

OBUASI UPDATE
In early February 2016, following the incursion of hundreds of illegal miners inside the fenced
area of the Obuasi mine site, AngloGold 
Ashanti Ghana was forced to declare force majeure and, in the interests of safety, withdrew all
employees performing non-essential 
functions. Until then, work had been underway to investigate the viability of investing in the
redevelopment of the mine as a modern, 
productive and long-life mining operation.
Since then, the remaining employees have been performing critical services related to the
operation of underground water pumping, 
environmental and potable water treatment, provision of medical services, and maintenance of
facilities that provide power and water 
to employees’ homes and surrounding communities.
In its declaration of force majeure, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana explained that the current situation
is precluding it from fulfilling certain 
conditions of its Amended Programme of Mining Operations, which was agreed with the
government in November 2014. In particular, 
the presence of illegal miners on the mine’s operational footprint, in its underground tunnels and
in areas which host key infrastructure 
at the mine is impacting directly on the company’s ability to continue to perform even the most
essential services.
Given inaction by the authorities with respect to bringing an end to the invasion and illegal
occupation of the site, illegal mining has 
continued to grow since the initial invasion and the miners are now estimated to number several
thousand who work on the site on any 
given day. Whilst there has been no impact on AngloGold Ashanti’s production and all-in
sustaining costs as the site was not forecast 
to be in production for at least this year, the damage to the site infrastructure and ore body will
have a direct impact on the mine’s 
future viability.
AngloGold Ashanti Ghana filed a Request for Arbitration against the Government of Ghana with
the International Centre for Settlement 
of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on 8 April 2016. The case was registered on 2 May 2016. ICSID
is an international arbitration 
institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., which facilitates dispute resolution between
international investors and host states. The 
relevant authorities’ in Ghana, including the Attorney General, have been duly notified of the
commencement of proceedings.
On 3 June 2016, the company also asked ICSID to make an urgent order compelling the
Government of Ghana to use its authority to,
among other things, reinstate military security and restore law and order to the Obuasi Mine for
the protection of AngloGold Ashanti 
Ghana’s personnel and the preservation of AngloGold Ashanti Ghana’s assets. 
Discussions are ongoing with Ghanaian authorities in respect of their request to our local
subsidiary, made after the end of the second
quarter, to post an additional bond of $150m by 31 August 2016 in respect of its environmental
obligations at Obuasi Mine. The present 
value of these obligations has already been provided for in the financial statements.
MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates as
disclosed in the 2015 Ore Reserve
and Mineral Resource report.
OUTLOOK
The production guidance provided to the market for the 2016 full year remains unchanged. Gold
production for the year is estimated
to be between 3.6Moz to 3.8Moz. Estimated total cash costs are expected to remain between
$680/oz and $720/oz whilst AISC are 
expected to remain between $900/oz and $960/oz at average exchange rates of ZAR14.97/$,
BRL3.51/$, $0.74/A$ and AP15.10/$, 
and Brent Crude Oil at $42/bl average for the year. Capital expenditure for the full year is still
expected to be between $790m and 
$850m.
Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions, power disruptions or
changes to asset portfolio and/or
operating mines. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse
effects on our future results. Outlook data 
is forward-looking information which is further discussed on the front cover of this document.

the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our
review. We conducted our 
review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, Review
of Interim Financial 
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. This standard requires us to
conclude whether anything has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not
prepared in all material respects in 
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to
comply with relevant ethical 
requirements.
A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance
engagement. We perform 
procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity,
as appropriate, and applying 
analytical procedures and evaluating the evidence obtained.
The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those
performed in an audit 
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion on these 
financial statements.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying condensed 
consolidated financial statements of the company for the six months ended 30 June 2016 are not
prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard, IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting as issued by the 
IASB, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee
and Financial Reporting 
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements
of the Companies Act of South 
Africa.

Liquidity and capital resources
To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is
dependent on existing cash 
resources, cash generated from operations and borrowing facilities.
Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions
from operations may be subject to 
foreign investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange
available in offshore countries. In 
addition, distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.
The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar
undertakings. To the extent that 
external borrowings are required, the group’s covenant performance indicates that existing
financing facilities will be available to 
meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near
future, the group believes that 
sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

Financial risk management activities
Borrowings 
The $1.25bn bonds are carried at fair value. The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and
their fair values are their closing 
market values at the reporting date which results in the difference noted in the table below. The
interest rate on the remaining 
borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis and accordingly the carrying amount is
considered to approximate the fair 
value.

Derivatives 
The fair value of derivatives is estimated based on ruling market prices, volatilities, interest rates
and credit risk and includes all 
derivatives carried in the statement of financial position.
Embedded derivatives are included as derivatives on the statement of financial position.
The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments:
Level 1:
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:
inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly 
(as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3:
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

On 28 June 2016, AngloGold Ashanti (“AGA”) announced that its wholly owned subsidiary,
AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc 
(“AGAH”), is compelling the surrender following the notice to buy back the remaining principal
amount of its outstanding 8.5% 
high-yield bonds that mature in May 2020, as part of its strategy to reduce debt and lower finance
charges. On 1 August 2016, 
the remaining portion of the notes were settled for a total consideration of $503m consisting of a
$471m principal payment, a 
surrender premium of $30m and interest of $2m.
On 24 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AngloGold
Ashanti Holdings plc, was offering 
to buy back up to $810m in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8.5% high-yield bonds
that mature in 2020, as part of its 
strategy to reduce debt and lower interest payment. On 25 September 2015, 62.34% of the notes
were settled for a total 
consideration of $850m consisting of a $779m principal payment, a tender premium, being the
difference between the par value of 
the bond and the redemption price of $58m and interest of US$13m. Included in the tender
premium on the $1.25bn bond (note 
5) was a realised fair value loss of $11.5m being the difference between the fair value on
redemption date and the redemption 
price.
Environmental obligations
Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to
close our operations and 
rehabilitate the lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence
AngloGold Ashanti is required in 
some circumstances to provide either reclamations bonds issued by third party entities, establish
independent trust funds or 
provide guarantees issued by the operation, to the respective environmental protection agency or
such other government 
department with responsibility for environmental oversight in the respective country to cover the
potential environmental 
rehabilitation obligation in specified amounts.
In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation
although in some cases we are 
required to potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has
been completed.
In South Africa we have established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.33bn and guarantees
of ZAR 1.37bn issued by 
various banks, for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 1.4bn. In Australia, since 2014,
we have paid into a Mine 
Rehabilitation Fund an amount of AUD $1m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD
$95.3m. At Iduapriem we have 
provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $9.7m with a further bond guarantee
amounting to $33.9m issued by 
Ecobank Ghana Limited (expired on 31
st
May 2016 but renewal process is underway) for a current carrying value of the liability of
$43.8m. At Obuasi we have provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $20.1m with a
further bank guarantee amounting 
to $30m issued by Nedbank Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $218.1m. In
some circumstances we may be 
required to post further bonds in due course which will have a consequential income statement
charge for the fees charged by the 
providers of the reclamation bonds.

Litigation claims
(1)
Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in
Mankayi vs. AngloGold Ashanti, 
the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation for
Occupational Injuries and Diseases 
Act, 1993 does not cover an “employee” who qualifies for compensation in respect of
“compensable diseases” under the 
Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act, 1973 (ODMWA). This judgement allows such
qualifying employee to pursue 
a civil claim for damages against the employer. Following the Constitutional Court decision,
AngloGold Ashanti has been 
subject to numerous claims relating to silicosis and other Occupational Lung Diseases (OLD),
including several potential 
class actions and individual claims.
In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields Limited,
Harmony Gold Mining Company 
Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited formed an industry working group on OLD to address issues
relating to compensation and 
medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The
working group now also includes 
African Rainbow Minerals (ARM). The companies believe that fairness and sustainability are
crucial elements of any solution 
and have embarked on an extensive engagement process with all stakeholders to work together
to design and implement a 
comprehensive solution that is both fair to past, present and future gold mining employees, and
also sustainable for the 
sector.
The companies are among respondent companies in a number of lawsuits related to OLD. The
companies do not believe 
that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and they are defending these. They do,
however, believe that they 
should work together to seek a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue. 
The companies active in gold mining have been working for many years to try to eliminate the
incidence of OLD. These 
efforts continue. 
These legal proceedings are being defended, and the status of the proceedings are set forth
below
.
AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa,
ARM, Gold Fields Limited, 
Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, DRDGold Limited, Randgold and Exploration
Company Limited, and Sibanye Gold 
Limited, were served with a consolidated class action application on 21 August 2013. On 13
May, 2016, the South Gauteng 
High Court of South Africa ruled in favour of the applicants and found that there were sufficient
common issues to certify two 
industry-wide classes: a Silicosis Class and a Tuberculosis Class, each of which cover current
and former underground 
mineworkers who worked in South African mines from 12 March, 1965 and who have contracted
the respective diseases (or 
the dependents of mineworkers who died of those diseases). The High Court ordered a two-
stage process in the class 
action. The first stage is to resolve common issues and allow the individuals to opt out. The
second stage will allow the 
individuals to opt in to the class to make their claims against the respondent mining companies.
The High Court also decided 
that claims for general damages (i.e., pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life) will be
transferable to the estate or 
executor of any deceased mineworker who dies after the date of filing of the certification
application. On 3 June 2016, 
AngloGold Ashanti, together with certain of the other mining companies, filed an application with
the High Court for leave to 
appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Arguments in the application for leave to appeal were
heard on 23 June 2016. On 24 
June 2016, leave to appeal was (i) granted in respect of the issue of the transferability of
deceased mineworkers' claims for 
general damages but (ii) denied in respect of all other orders of the High Court. On 15 July 2016
AngloGold Ashanti, along 
with several other respondent companies, filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Appeal for
leave to appeal such other 
orders of the High Court.
It is possible that additional class actions and/or individual claims relating to silicosis and/or other
OLD will be filed against 
AngloGold Ashanti in the future. AngloGold Ashanti will defend all current and subsequently filed
claims on their merits. 
Should AngloGold Ashanti be unsuccessful in defending any such claims, or in otherwise
favourably resolving perceived 
deficiencies in the national occupational disease compensation framework that were identified in
the earlier decision by the 
Constitutional Court, such matters would have an adverse effect on its financial position, which
could be material. Given the 
inherent legal and factual uncertainties with respect to the pending claims and other claims not
yet filed against the company, 
no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation. 
(2)
Litigation -
On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and
Building Contractors
Limited’s (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement
and diamond drilling 
agreement at Obuasi mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and
concluded a separation 
agreement on 8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a writ issued by
MBC claiming a total of 
$97m. In December 2015, the proceedings were stayed in the High Court pending arbitration. In
February 2016, MBC 
submitted the matter to arbitration.
22
July 2016 Interim report - www.AngloGoldAshanti.com
(3)
Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in
which the plaintiffs allege that 
they were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been
adversely affected by 
emission and/or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or
historical operations of the 
Pompora Treatment Plant (PTP), which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs’ alleged
injuries include respiratory 
infections, skin diseases and certain cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their
application for directions, 
but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for
want of prosecution. On 
24 February 2014, executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA),
sued AGAG by themselves 
and on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed
above, as well as economic 
hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter is set for hearing in October
2016. In view of the limitation 
of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made
for AGAG’s obligation in 
either matter.
(4)
Mill contractor claims - On 3 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti and Newmont concluded the sale
of the Cripple Creek & Victor 
mine in Colorado to Newmont. As part of the negotiated transaction, the parties agreed to a
cost/recovery sharing 
arrangement relative to cost claims asserted for or against CC&V based on work performed by
contractors during the design 
and manufacture of the High Grade Mill. Under the agreement, AngloGold Ashanti has the right
to manage any negotiation, 
settlement, or legal proceedings associated with each cost claim. The total value of the cost
claims asserted against CC&V, 
by two contractors, is $20m. On 1 April 2016, CC&V was added as a defendant to a lawsuit in the
U.S. District Court 
(Colorado) between one of the contractors and a subcontractor, and the cost claims are being
litigated there. Separately, 
CC&V has cost claims against the mill design contractor. These claims are proceeding in
arbitration.
With reference to items (1) - (4) above, provisions have been raised where the amount of the
potential claim or settlement 
can be reasonably estimated.
Tax claims
(5)
Other tax disputes - In November 2007, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral
(DNPM), a Brazilian federal mining 
authority, issued a tax assessment against AngloGold Ashanti Brazil Mineração Ltda (AABM) in
the amount of
$14m
(2015: $11m) relating to the calculation and payment by AABM of the financial contribution on
mining exploitation (CFEM) in 
the period from 1991 to 2006. The matter has been dormant since 2007. AngloGold Ashanti
Limited’s subsidiaries in Brazil 
are involved in various other disputes with tax authorities. These disputes involve federal tax
assessments including income 
tax, royalties, social contributions and annual property tax. The amount involved is approximately
$14m (2015: $11m). 
Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.
(6) VAT disputes - Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (MSG) received a tax assessment in October
2003 from the State of Minas
Gerais related to VAT on gold bullion transfers. The tax administrators rejected the company’s
appeals against the 
assessment. The company is now appealing the dismissal of the case to the State of Minas
Gerais. The assessment is 
approximately $13m (2015: $11m).
(7) Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice
from the Colombian Tax Office
(DIAN) that it disagreed with the company’s tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011
income tax returns. On 
23 October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that
an estimated additional tax
of $22m (2015: $20m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for
the additional taxes are 
expected to be $119m (2015: $108m). The company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax
legislation incorrectly. AGAC 
subsequently challenged the DIAN’s ruling by filing lawsuits in March 2015 and April 2015
before the Administrative Tribunal 
of Cundinamarca (trial court for tax litigation). On 8 July 2016, the tribunal held an initial
procedural hearing on the 2010 tax 
dispute.
(8) Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the
Argentina Tax Authority
(AFIP) requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of about $7m (2015:
$8m) relating to the non-
deduction of tax losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the
financial derivatives could not 
be considered as hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains
derived from the same kind of 
hedging contracts. Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further
$22m (2015: $24m). CVSA and 
AFIP have corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of
the opinion that the taxes are 
not payable, the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial
derivatives. CVSA filed an 
appeal with the Tax Court on 19 June 2015.
Other
(9) Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes
at certain of its operations,
which have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous
scientific, technical and legal 
studies have been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to
find sustainable 
remediation solutions. The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and
it has been demonstrated 
that Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to
improvements in some instances. 
Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have
not yet proven, that the use 
of phyto-technologies can address the soil and groundwater contamination. Subject to the
completion of trials and the 
technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the
obligation.
(10) Deep groundwater pollution -
The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep
groundwater in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by
AngloGold Ashanti since 1999 
to understand this potential risk. In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining
operations, any proposed 
solution needs to be a combined one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a
result, the Mineral and 
Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies
develop a Regional Mine 
Closure Strategy to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the
limitation of current information for 
the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

expectation that AngloGold 
Ashanti can maintain core credit metrics at the higher end of their intermediate category.

Forward-looking
statements
Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including,
without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry, 
expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in
costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, 
growth prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate,
including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of 
commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and production projects and
the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold 
Ashanti’s liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and
consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental
health 
and safety issues, are forward-looking statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s operations,
economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts 
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold
Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated 
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.
Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have
been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-
looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political
and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the 
regulatory environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals,
fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending or future litigation 
proceedings, and business and operational risk management. For a discussion of such risk
factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual reports on Form 20-F filed with the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors are not necessarily all of the important
factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also
have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to 
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no
obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to
reflect 
events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events,
except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-
looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are
qualified by the cautionary statements herein.
