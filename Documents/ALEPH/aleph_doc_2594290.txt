YPF SOCIEDAD ANONIMA AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND COMPARATIVE INFORMATION
(amounts expressed in millions of Argentine Pesos, except shares and per share amounts expressed in Argentine Pesos, and as otherwise indicated – Note
1.b)
1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.a) Basis of preparation
The condensed interim consolidated financial statements of YPF S.A. (hereinafter “YPF” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (hereinafter and all together,
the “Group”) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, are presented in accordance with International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) No. 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”. The adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”) was determined by the Technical Resolution No. 26 (ordered text) issued by Argentine Federation of Professional Councils in Economic Sciences
(“FACPCE”) and the Regulations of the Argentine Securities Commission (“CNV”).
Also, some additional information required by the Law 19,550 of Argentine Corporations and its amendments and/or regulations of the CNV was included.
Such information was included in the Notes to the mentioned condensed interim consolidated financial statements only to comply with regulatory
requirements.
These condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group as
of December 31, 2015 (“the annual consolidated financial statements”) prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These condensed interim consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors’ meeting and authorized to be issued on August 4,
2016.
These condensed interim consolidated financial statements corresponding to the six-month period ended on June 30, 2016 are unaudited. Management
believes they include all necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of each period on a consistent basis with the annual consolidated financial
statements. Income for the six-month period ended on June 30, 2016 does not necessarily reflect the proportion of the Group’s full-year income.
1.b) Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in the
preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements, except for the valuation policy for Income Tax detailed in Note 7.i). The most significant
accounting policies are described in Note 1.b) to such annual consolidated financial statements.
Functional and reporting currency
As mentioned in Note 1.b.1 to the annual consolidated financial statements, YPF has defined the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. In addition, according
to General Resolution No. 562 of the CNV, YPF shall submit its financial statements in Argentine Pesos.
Table of Contents
1.c) Accounting Estimates and Judgments
7
The preparation of financial statements at a certain date requires Management to make estimates and assessments affecting the amount of assets and
liabilities recorded, contingent assets and liabilities disclosed at such date, as well as income and expenses recorded during the period. Actual future results
might differ from the estimates and assessments made as of the date of preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
In preparing these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, significant estimates and judgments made by Management in applying the Group’s
accounting policies and the main sources of uncertainty were the same as those applied by the Group in the preparation of the annual consolidated financial
statements, which are disclosed in Note 1.c) Accounting Estimates and Judgments to those financial statements.
1.d) Comparative information
Amounts and other information corresponding to the year ended on December 31, 2015 and to the six-month period ended on June 30, 2015 are an integral
part of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements and are intended to be read only in relation to these financial statements. Certain
reclassifications have been made in order to present amounts comparatively with the current period.
2.
SEASONALITY OF OPERATIONS
Historically, the Group’s results have been subject to seasonal fluctuations during the year, particularly as a result of the increase in natural gas sales during
the winter. After the 2002 devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and as a consequence of the natural gas price freeze imposed by the Argentine government,
the use of natural gas has been diversified, generating an increase in demand throughout the entire year. However, sales of natural gas are still typically
higher in the winter to the residential sector of the Argentine domestic market, which has lower prices than other sectors of the Argentine market.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the “Additional Injection Stimulus Program” regulation (see Note 11.d) to the annual consolidated financial statements),
gas producing companies were invited to file with the Ministry of Energy and Mining (“MINEM”) before June 30th, 2013 projects to increase natural gas
injection, in order to receive an increased price of US$ 7.50/MMBTU for all additional natural gas injected. These projects shall comply with the minimum
requirements established in the aforementioned Program, and will be subject to approval by the MINEM, including a maximum term of five years, renewable
at the request of the beneficiary, upon decision of the MINEM. If the beneficiary company does not reach the committed production increase in a given month,
it will have to make up for such volumes not produced. The natural gas pricing program was incorporated into the Hydrocarbons Law, as modified by Law
No. 27,007.
In view of the foregoing, seasonality of the Group operations is not significant.
3.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, there have been no significant acquisitions or disposals.
On May 13, 2016, the companies Y-GEN Eléctrica S.R.L. (“Y-GEN”) and Y-GEN Eléctrica II S.R.L. (“Y-GEN II”) were created for the purpose of tendering in
the competitive bidding established by Resolution No. 21/2016 of the Ministry of Energy and Mining (“MINEM”), for the new generation of energy and thermal
power which, if awarded, would result in the execution with CAMMESA of a sale agreement of the energy offered during a term of 5 to 10 years, according to
the offer, with a dollar price. The created companies submitted bids for construction projects of new thermal generation plants in Loma Campana (Añelo,
Province of Neuquén) and in Central El Bracho (Province of Tucumán), which were ultimately awarded.
In both companies, 66.67% of the capital stock is held by the subsidiary YPF Energía Eléctrica S.A. (“Managing Shareholder”) and the remaining 33.33% is
held by Guayama PR Holdings (“Non Managing Shareholder”) of the General Electric Group. Under the agreement signed, shareholders are required to
supply during the current fiscal year and the next two years, the necessary funds as capital contributions. In addition, there is a service agreement between
both companies and YPF Energía Eléctrica S.A. whereby YPF Energía Eléctrica S.A., in its capacity as “Managing Shareholder”, has the responsibility,
among other things, to perform certain management jobs of the companies.

The Group has followed the guidelines of IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements” and has concluded that it has joint control over Y-GEN I and Y-GEN
II. Accordingly, it has applied IFRS 11, “Joint Arrangements”, defining such companies as joint ventures, and has measured them by the equity method in
accordance with IAS 28 “Investments in associates and joint ventures”.
Some of the main facts considered were: (i) Contractually, both shareholders exercise joint control over each of the companies, whereby decisions on the
relevant activities thereof are made jointly and must be unanimous, there being no power of one party (shareholder) over the other in relation to the
investment, irrespective of their different holding percentages; and (ii) There is no power, as defined in IFRS 10, of one party to the detriment of the other
party, whether in connection with the voting rights for the appointment of Directors or personnel (whether key or not), in the management of the company to
obtain self-benefit or to unilaterally change the variable yields of investments, or, ultimately, to unilaterally direct any of the decisions related to relevant
activities.
Finally, as of the date of issuance of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, the said companies had not made any relevant transactions
other than the execution of the agreements for the organization thereof.
The expected power to be installed is 108MW for Y-GEN (Central Loma Campana, Neuquén) and 270MW for Y-GEN II (Central El Bracho, Tucumán), with
the power plants’ construction commencement dates being August and July 2016, respectively, and the estimated commencement of the electricity
operations and generation being November 2017 and January 2018, respectively.
4.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
4.a) Financial Risks
The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk,
liquidity risk and capital risk. The Group maintains an organizational structure and systems that allow for the identification, measurement and control of the
risks to which it is exposed.
The condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures on financial risk management; therefore, they
should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements.
There have been no changes in the risk management or risk management policies applied by the Group since the last year end.
4.b) Fair value measurements
Fair value measurements are described in Note 5 to the annual consolidated financial statements.
Between December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, there have been no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances affecting the fair value
of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, either measured at fair value or amortized cost. In addition, no transfer has occurred among the different
hierarchies used to determine the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments.

In connection with the Maxus Entities’ Filing with the Bankruptcy Court on June 17, 2016, as described in detail in Note 11, the Company’s Management
believes that this is an event that requires reconsideration of whether consolidation of such entities continues to be appropriate. In making this analysis, the
Company has followed the guidelines set forth in IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements” in order to reconsider whether it will keep control over the
activities of the Maxus Entities. This analysis was supplemented by the criteria established in U.S. ASC 810 published by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, whose principles are consistent with previously mentioned IFRS 10, but which deal in more detail with issues related to the consolidation
of entities that enter into a specific reorganization process under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
In general, when a company files a petition under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy Code, shareholders lose the power to make decisions that have a
significant impact in the economic performance of the entities’ business, as this power is typically transferred to the Bankruptcy Court approval.
The filing of the Chapter 11 petitions by the Maxus Entities under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code has relevant effects on the rights to which YPF
Holdings, Inc., is entitled in its capacity as shareholder of those entities, because Creditors substitute the Shareholders in their legal capacity to file derivative
suits against Directors on behalf of the entities on the grounds of non-performance of their fiduciary duties, as Creditors must be the primary beneficiaries of
any increase in the value of said entities. However, it should be noted that YPF Holdings, Inc. retains its right to appoint the Debtors’ Directors through
Shareholders’ Meetings, unless the Bankruptcy Court orders otherwise.
In addition, the filing made before the Bankruptcy Court also has effects on the duties and liabilities of the Board of Directors and the Management of Maxus
Entities. Each of the Maxus Entities has become a “Debtor-in-Possession”, whereby, according to the Bankruptcy Code, they retain possession of their
property, and, subject to certain limitations, are authorized to carry on their normal course of business, unless the Bankruptcy Court otherwise orders.
However, during the term of the reorganization process, the Debtors’ Board of Directors does not have absolute discretion, for any transaction “outside the
ordinary course of business” of the Debtors, such as the sale of a significant asset, the expansion of a line of business involving the use of large amounts (or
the commitment to do so) or the execution of loans or other kind of financing, shall be subject to the Bankruptcy Court’s approval.
Accordingly, as a result of the filing made under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, YPF Holdings, Inc. cannot unilaterally make decisions that would
significantly affect the Maxus Debtors’ business or economic performance. Indeed, the Maxus Debtors should seek Bankruptcy Court approval for seemingly
ordinary course business activities if such activities could have a significant effect on the Maxus Debtors’ operations or their stakeholders.

Taking into account the foregoing, the Company’s Management believes that YPF Holdings, Inc., despite keeping 100% of the equity interest in the Maxus
Entities, no longer has the capacity to use its power over said entities to significantly influence their relevant activities, a necessary condition set forth by
IFRS 10 to establish the existence of a controlling financial interest and, therefore, has proceeded to the deconsolidation of the investments in Maxus Entities
as of June 17, 2016.
According to ASC 810, this loss of control may involve a gain or loss for the parent company, as the parent company will have to remeasure its non-
controlling interest at its fair value after the deconsolidation of the assets and liabilities of the entities. For this calculation it has also been taken into account
the liabilities related to the reorganization process incurred as described in Note 11. Thus, the Group has recorded a gain of 1,528 disclosed in “Other
operating income, net”.
As a result of the deconsolidation, the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2016 is not comparable to that issued as of
December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the following balances of assets and liabilities were consolidated in relation to the Maxus Entities:

The effects on the condensed interim consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the condensed interim consolidated statements of cash flow as
of June 30, 2016, by including the income and the cash flow, respectively, for the 169-day period until June 17, 2016 during which YPF kept control, are not
significant when compared to the respective financial statements issued as of June 30, 2015.

The Group participates in joint operations and other agreements which give the Group a contractually established percentage of the rights to the assets and
obligations governed by the contracts. Interests in such joint operations have been consolidated line by line on the basis of the mentioned interest over the
assets, liabilities, income and expenses related to each contract. Interests in joint operations have been calculated based upon the latest available financial
statements as of the end of each year, taking into consideration significant subsequent events and transactions as well as available management
information.

payment so long as it occurs before the end of the present fiscal year. On June 9, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company decided to pay a dividend of
2.26 per share, for an amount of 889, which was made available to shareholders on July 7, 2016.

PROVISIONS FOR PENDING LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND ENVIROMENTAL LIABILITES
Provisions for pending lawsuits, claims and environmental liabilities are described in Note 10 to the annual consolidated financial statements.
As of June 30, 2016, the Group has accrued pending lawsuits, claims and contingencies which are probable and can be reasonably estimated, amounting to
9,534.
In relation to environmental obligations, and in addition to the hydrocarbon wells abandonment legal obligations for 32,776, as of June 30, 2016, the Group

estimated, based on the Group’s existing remediation program.
Developments during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, concerning the most significant pending lawsuits and contingencies are described below.
•
With respect to the AES Uruguaiana Emprendimientos S.A. (“AESU”) and Transportadora Gas del Mercosur S.A. (“TGM”) arbitration proceedings and
the writ of nullity filed on February 2, 2016 by AESU and Companhía do Gas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (“SULGAS”), on February 23, 2016, the
Court of Appeals denied the motion “in limine”. AESU and SULGAS filed a motion before the Supreme Court against this denial, which was
communicated to YPF on March 31, 2016. On the same date, the Court of Appeals rejected the motion to appeal before the Supreme Court filed by
TGM on February 2, 2016.
On April 26, 2016, Division IV of the Court of Appeals denied the motion filed by AESU and SULGAS and passed a new resolution declaring the nullity and
ineffectiveness of all proceedings filed by the parties until then and by the Arbitration Tribunal regarding the “second stage” of the Arbitration, on the basis
that they lacked legal grounds. In turn, the resolution recalls the legal order arising from Section 34, subsection 5, paragraph b, of the Argentine Civil and
Commercial Code of Procedures (“CPCCN”), advising the Arbitration Tribunal that it may not issue any resolution regarding the second stage of the
arbitration, including a final award on damages, and also advising AESU, SULGAS and TGM that any of their respective acts to that end or any act of the
Arbitration Tribunal that might involve them, in violation of the above referred judgment, shall be evaluated by such Court Division in the exercise of the
powers vested on it by the CPCCN as process manager (section 45 and related sections). In addition, this Division ordered to notify the Arbitration Tribunal
and the International Arbitration Secretary’s Office for the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”), advising them that the Arbitration Tribunal is not in a
position to issue an award in accordance with applicable law.
This resolution was communicated by YPF to the Arbitration Tribunal, the parties and the ICC. On the same date but following this notification, YPF was
given notice of the damages arbitration award issued by a majority of the Arbitration Tribunal, whereby the Company was ordered to pay damages of
US$185 million to AESU, for the early termination of the gas export contract in 2009, and on account of the delivery or pay penalty, and of US$ 319 million to
TGM on account of the principal invoices amount, irrevocable contributions and damages for the early termination of the transportation contract.
On May, 2, 2016, YPF filed with the ICC and the Arbitration Tribunal the relevant writ of nullity against the said arbitration award. On the same date, it also
filed a writ of nullity before Division IV of the Federal Contentious Administrative Tribunal, and in an auxiliary manner filed a reconsideration motion from
denial of appeal.
On May 4, 2016, the Arbitration Tribunal passed a resolution resolving that it would refrain from issuing a decision regarding the writ of nullity filed by YPF.
Considering this resolution a dismissal of the writ of nullity, on May 5, 2016, YPF filed before Division IV of the Federal Contentious Administrative Tribunal a
motion for reconsideration against the decision rendered by the Arbitration Tribunal to deny the writ of nullity filed by the Company.
On May 5, 2016, AESU filed in the jurisdiction of New York, South District an action for the acknowledgment and enforcement of the Partial Liability Award
issued in 2013. As of the date hereof, YPF has neither been given notice nor has it received the Final Award on Damages.
•
In connection with the complaint filed by “Users and consumers’ association” against YPF, the Company filed an appeal against the relevant
judgment, which was admitted with staying effect. Plaintiff also filed an appeal against the judgment and both parties filed their respective appellate
briefs, which were

answered. On April 4, 2016, the file was raised to the Court of Appeals. The updated judgement amount as of the date of these consolidated condensed
interim financial statements amounts to approximately 544 plus legal costs.

As to the administrative environmental issues related to the lower 8 miles of the Passaic River, affecting Maxus Energy Corporation (“Maxus”) and
Tierra Solutions, Inc. (“TS”) (companies deconsolidated on June 17, 2016 – see Note 7.c)) on March 4, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) issued the Record of Decision (“ROD”) for the lower 8.3 miles of the Passaic River, which is a part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund
Site - Essex and Hudson Counties, New Jersey. The ROD selects the so-called Alternative 3 as the remedy for the removal of contaminated
sediments with an estimated cost of US$1,382 million (net present value at a 7% rate).
The ROD requires the removal of 3.5 million cubic yards of sediment from the lower 8.3 miles of the Passaic River by bank-to-bank dredging, to a depth of
approximately 5 to 30 feet in the federal navigation channel from mile 0 to mile 1.7, and approximately 2.5 feet in the remaining areas of the lower 8.3 miles of
the Passaic River. A two-foot thick cap will be installed over the dredged areas. Contaminated segments will be transported to disposal sites outside the
state. The EPA estimates the whole project will take approximately 11 years, including one year for negotiations among potentially responsible parties, three
to four years for project design and six years for its implementation.
On March 31, 2016, the EPA notified all potentially responsible parties, including Occidental Chemical Corporation (“OCC”), of the liabilities relating to the
8.3 miles area of the Passaic River relating to the ROD. In the same notice the EPA stated that it expected OCC (against whom Maxus is litigating a dispute
over indemnity) to prepare the remediation plan design and that it would send a second letter with an administrative proposal to this end, which was received
by counsel to OCC, Maxus and TS on April 26, 2016.
As of June 17, 2016, OCC, Maxus and TS were holding discussions with EPA to define their participation in a potential negotiation aimed at taking part in
the design of EPA’s proposed remediation plan, taking into account that the ROD has identified over one hundred potentially responsible parties and eight
contaminants of concern, many of which have not been generated at the Lister Site. As of such date Maxus was evaluating the situation resulting from the
issuance of the ROD by the EPA, as well as its subsequent associated letters.
•
In connection with the Passaic River litigation, in which the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) holds with YPF, YPF
Holdings Inc. and other subsidiaries (including Maxus, a company that was deconsolidated on June 17, 2016 – See Note 7.c)), with respect to the
contamination of the lower Passaic River with dioxin and other hazardous substances discharged by the Newark plant, the parties appealed the
recommendations of the Special Judge to Judge Furnari (presiding Judge of the legal proceedings) on February 16, 2016, who, nevertheless, adopted
the Special Masters, recommendations in their entirety. In addition, having been completed discovery of all relevant evidence, the acting Judge issued
Case Management Order XXVIII, which sets forth, among other procedural deadlines, June 20, 2016 as the date for the commencement of the trial.
On April 25, 2016, all the parties moved to request permission to file interlocutory appeals and a stay of the litigation during the appellate proceedings.
Maxus filed a motion requesting permission to appeal the ruling granting summary judgment to OCC against Maxus, which held that Maxus is liable under
the stock purchase and sale agreement for all obligations under, or arising from, the Lister Site, even if attributable to OCC’s own acts. YPF filed a motion
requesting permission to appeal the ruling denying its motion for summary judgment seeking a decision indicating that OCC may not use allegedly
fraudulent transfers which are prescribed as a basis for its alter ego claims against YPF. OCC filed only one motion, appealing the ruling that granted to
Repsol the motion for summary judgment, whereby all claims against Repsol were dismissed. OCC did not appeal the rulings that (a) denied OCC’s motion
to file additional cross claims; (b) denied OCC’s motion for a declaratory judgment regarding future costs; and (c) denied OCC’s motion for summary
judgment seeking a dismissal of Repsol’s Spill Act contribution claim against OCC (all of the foregoing without prejudice to reserving the right to file post-trial
motions of appeal on these issues).

However, all litigation against Maxus has been stayed upon Maxus’ filing under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which is explained below.
•
On June 17, 2016, voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code were filed with the Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware of the
United States (hereafter, the “Bankruptcy Court”) by (a) Maxus Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries Maxus International Energy Company, Maxus
(US) Exploration Company and Gateway Coal Company; and (b) Tierra Solutions Inc. (all of them hereafter referred to as the “Maxus Entities” or
“Debtors”, subsidiaries of YPF Holdings, Inc.).
The Debtor’s businesses are divided into three areas: (a) management of interests related to the exploitation of hydrocarbons carried out by Maxus and its
subsidiaries; (b) management of remediation activities carried out by Tierra Solutions Inc.; and (c) management of benefits of former employees who are
currently retired.
In this framework, Debtors have entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with YPF S.A., jointly with its subsidiaries YPF Holdings Inc., CLH Holdings
Inc., YPF International S.A. and YPF Services USA Corp (jointly, “YPF Entities”) to settle all Debtors’ claims against YPF Entities, including any alter ego
claims which, in YPF Entities’ opinion, have no merits.
The Agreement provides: i) the granting of a loan by YPF Holdings for an amount of US$ 63.1 million (“DIP Loan”) to finance Debtors’ activities during the
estimated term of the reorganization procedure in order that, ultimately, the reorganization procedure under Chapter 11 might allow them to restructure their
operations in a sustainable manner; ii) a payment of US$ 130 million to Maxus Entities (“Settlement Payment”) for all potential claims that the Debtors might
have against YPF Entities.
The first hearing corresponding to the filing under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Filing”) took place on June 20, 2016. At that hearing, the
Bankruptcy Court approved, among other things, the Debtors’ motions to continue, as “Debtors-in-Possession”, to maintain their day-to-day operations,
including the Debtors’ use of the system for fund management and payment of salaries and benefits to retired employees. The case is pending before United
States Bankruptcy Judge Christopher S. Sontchi.
Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, effective as of the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 petitions with the Bankruptcy Court, most
decisions, as well as the issues related to creditors’ claims and actions for the collection of their claims that arose prior to the filing date are automatically
stayed (among others, those corresponding to claims against Maxus Entities at the local court of New Jersey related to the Passaic River litigation – see
Note 11 to these consolidated condensed interim financial statements and also Note 11 to the annual consolidated financial statements).
12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, CONTINGENT ASSETS, CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, MAIN REGULATIONS AND OTHERS
Contingent liabilities, contingent assets, contractual commitments, main regulations and others are described in Note 11 to the annual consolidated financial
statements.
Developments during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 concerning the above are detailed below.
a) Contingent Liabilities
•
•
In connection with the complaint filed by Petersen Energía Inversora, S.A.U and Petersen Energía, S.A.U., on July 20, 2016, a hearing was held at the
Court, at which the parties made their arguments regarding the motion to dismiss, answering the questions asked by the Judge. The Court is expected
to soon issue a resolution with respect to the motions to dismiss.
In connection with Resolution No. 17/2012, issued by the Secretariat of the Interior of the ex-Federal Ministry of Economy and Public Finance, which
ordered YPF, Shell Compañía Argentina de Petróleo S.A. and Esso Petrolera Argentina S.R.L. to supply jet fuel for the domestic and international air
transport at a price net of taxes not to exceed 2.7% of the price net of taxes of Super gasoline (not Premium) offered at their respective service stations
closest to the relevant airport, maintaining the current fuel supply logistics

in its ordinary and usual supply quantities, finally, in December 2015, the Argentine Supreme Court (“CSJN”) ruled sustaining the appeal filed by the
Federal Government. Thus, the CSJN confirmed the jurisdiction of the Secretariat of Commerce to issue administrative precautionary measures under
Section 35 of Law No. 25,156. In addition, it ordered that the records of the case be returned “to the original court so that the person concerned” may
issue a new ruling on the basis of the decision. As a result, the Federal Court must issue a new ruling on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of Resolution
17/2012 on the basis of the additional grounds previously alleged by YPF regarding the substance of this issue.
b) Contingent Assets
•
Cerro Divisadero:
Concerning the fire that damaged the facilities of the Crude Oil Treatment Plant of Cerro Divisadero in Mendoza, as of December 31, 2015 the claim
settlement proceedings were concluded, with the final settlement amount agreed at US$ 122 million, of which US$ 45 million was related to property
damage and US$ 77 million was related to production losses, for which a US$ 60 million advance had already been received as of such date. During the six-
month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company received the second and final payment of US$ 62 million.
c) Contractual commitments
•
Agreements for project investments
•
With respect to the Investment Project Agreement executed by and between the Company and subsidiaries of Chevron Corporation with the
objective of the joint exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons in the province of Neuquén, in the Loma Campana area, during the six-month
period ended June 30, 2016, the Company and Compañía de Hidrocarburo No Convencional S.R.L. (“CHNC”) have completed transactions,
including mainly the purchases of gas and crude oil by YPF for 2,779. These transactions were completed under general and regulatory market
conditions. The net balance payable to CHNC as of June 30, 2016 amounts to 1,128.
•
Concerning the acquisition by Pampa Energía S.A. (“PEPASA”) of the whole capital stock of Petrobras Participaciones S.L., which holds 67.2%
of the capital and votes of Petrobras Energía S.A. (“PESA”), YPF and PEPASA have entered into an agreement subject to certain conditions
precedent whereby, upon formalization of the acquisition of the controlling interest in PESA by PEPASA, the latter shall assign to YPF
participations in the exploitation concessions of two areas located in the Neuquén Basin with production and high development potential of gas
(of the tight and shale type), to be operated by YPF, according to the following percentages: (i) 33.33% interest in Río Neuquén Area, located in
the Province of Neuquén and in the Province of Río Negro; and (ii) 80% interest in the Aguada de la Arena Area in the Province of Neuquén.
In order to give effect to this agreement, PEPASA and YPF have signed the Financing and Interest Acquisition Framework Agreement and a Loan
Agreement whereby YPF, on July 25, 2016, granted PEPASA a secured loan for the indirect acquisition of the aforementioned areas in the amount of US$
140 million, equal to the acquisition cost of the mentioned interests. Upon the approval of the aforementioned interest assignment by PESA’s Board of
Directors, the mentioned loan may be used for the payment of YPF’s acquisition of the interests in concession and joint operations with; (i) PESA and an
affiliate of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. for the Río Neuquén Area, and (ii) Petrouruguay S.A. for the Aguada de la Arena Area.

Natural gas regulatory requirements - Producers and Distribution Companies
Temporary Agreement with Natural Gas Network Distribution Companies
On February 24, 2016, within the framework of the process for renegotiating public services contracts provided by Law No. 25,561 and supplementary
regulations, Metrogas entered into a Temporary Agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Mining (“MINEM”) and the Ministry of Economy and Public
Finance whereby a provisional tariff regime was established for the collection of higher revenues than those collected under the Temporary Agreement of
2014 and ENARGAS Resolution No. I/2407/2012 issued on November 27, 2012.
Table of Contents
31
The new Temporary Agreement, which is not subject to ratification by the Federal Executive, establishes an interim tariff regime effective from April 1, 2016,
consisting of the readjustment of tariffs, taking into account the guidelines necessary to maintain service continuity and common criteria with the other
distribution licensees, and considering tariff regulations, including changes in the gas price at the Transportation System Entry Points (“TSEPs”).
Furthermore, the Temporary Agreement provides that, between its execution date and December 31, 2016, the parties shall reach an agreement relating to
the method, time frames and timing of the execution of the Memorandum of Agreement for Comprehensive Contractual Renegotiations.
The Temporary Agreement also provides that it will incorporate any transfer that results from changes in tax regulations that remain outstanding, except for
the income tax, and imposes a mandatory investment plan on Metrogas for an amount of 715.
On April 1, 2016 the MINEM issued the following Resolutions:
(1)
Resolution No. 28/2016 passed by the MINEM, which, among other things:
•
•
•
•
Sets the new prices for natural gas at the Transportation System Entry Points (“TSEPs”), broken up by basin and user category, and provides
discounts to those Residential Users reducing their consumption by fifteen percent (15%) or more as compared to the same period of the
previous year, taking effect for consumption starting from April 1, 2016.
Sets the new Propane Gas Prices for Undiluted Propane Gas distribution, as well as provides discounts to those Residential Users recording a
savings in their consumption equal to or higher than fifteen percent (15%) compared to the same period of the previous year.
Instructs the ENARGAS to adapt the Registry of Persons Exempt from the Argentine Government Policy of Subsidy Reallocation through which
ENARGAS adopts for Residential Users the Eligibility Criteria to benefit from a “Social Tariff”, with a one hundred percent (100%) discount on
the Natural Gas price or the Propane Gas price consumed by such users. On May 6, 2016, the Registry of Persons Exempt from the Argentine
Government Policy of Subsidy Reallocation was modified by ENARGAS Resolution No. 3,784/2016.
Revokes resolutions passed by the former ex-Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services under Section 6 of Executive Order
No. 2,067/2008 and Section 7 of Resolution No. 1,451/2008, related to the assessment of tariff charges, to which end it instructs ENARGAS to
take the necessary measures to cease applying those charges in the bills issued to users.
(2)
Resolution No. 31 of the MINEM instructs ENARGAS to implement the procedure for the Comprehensive Tariff Review established in the
Memorandum of Agreement for Comprehensive Contractual Renegotiations entered into with Licensees within the framework of Law No.
25,561, its amendments and complementary rules, to be executed within a maximum term of one year as from March 29, 2016. It further
established the application of a provisional tariff.
(3)
Resolution No. 34/2016 passed by the MINEM, which, among other things:
•
•
Sets the new prices at TSEPs for natural gas supply to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations, taking into effect consumption from April 1.
Provides that from May 1, natural gas for CNG supply stations must be acquired by distributors.
Table of Contents
On April 4, 2016, ENARGAS Resolution No. 3726/2016 was published in the Argentine Official Gazette whereby:
32
•
•
•
A new tariff scheme applicable to Metrogas users was approved, effective from April 1, 2016, in line with the provisions of Resolution No.
28/2016 issued by the MINEM.
Additionally, new tariffs are established for residential users recording a saving in their consumption equal to or higher than fifteen percent (15%)
compared to the same period of the previous year and for users registered with the registry established under ENARGAS Resolution No. I-
2,905/2015 as amended by section 5 of Resolution No. 28/2016 issued by the MINEM (social tariff).
It orders Metrogas to:
i.
ii.
iii.
No longer include the amounts derived from the charge imposed by Executive Decree No. 2,067/2008;
Instrument the collection of bills which are issued bi-monthly as a monthly payment obligation, establishing to such end two monthly
payments, each equal to 50% of the total amount of the bi-monthly bill, with a thirty-day period between each other;
Not to make dividend distributions without previously evidencing before the ENARGAS full compliance with the Mandatory Investment
Plan.
Subsequently, on June 1, 2016, the MINEM published Resolution No. 89 whereby:
•
•
The ENARGAS is required to elaborate a procedure modifying and supplementing the provisions of ENARGAS Resolutions No. 716/1998 and
1,410/2010, and setting forth the daily operating conditions of the Transportation and Distribution Systems.
It establishes the volumes the Distribution Companies may request to supply the priority demand and sets forth that if natural gas is contracted
with a Producer for such purpose, the request of natural gas from such producer will be reduced under Resolution No. 1,410/2010 to the extent
of the volume contracted.
Pursuant to this Resolution, on June 5, 2016 ENARGAS Resolution No. I/3833 was issued, whereby the “Supplementary Procedure for Gas Requests,
Confirmations and Control” was established.
On June 7, 2016, MINEM Resolution No. 99 was issued, under which:
•
The ENARGAS, in exercise of its powers, is required to establish the necessary measures so that during 2016, the amounts before taxes of bills
issued by providers of the gas distribution public service in all the territory, to be paid by Residential users (category R and its subcategories)
and users of the Small General Service category with full service (subcategories P1, P2 and P3, and equivalent categories in the undiluted
propane gas distribution service), for consumption made from April 1, 2016, shall not exceed by more than 400% and 500%, respectively, the
final amount, before taxes, that should have been invoiced for such consumptions, if the tariffs effective as of March 31, 2016 had been applied
to the same user and for the volume consumed in the new billing period.
On June 8, 2016, ENARGAS, through Resolution No. 3,843/2016, regulated these limits until December 31, 2016. According to Resolution No. 99/2016 of
the MINEM, any differences arising from the final amount resulting from the application of the relevant limit and the tariff schemes applicable as of that date
shall be determined during 2016 as a discount on the prices to be billed by natural gas Producers to Distribution Companies.
Table of Contents
On July 12, 2016, the MINEM, through Resolution No. 129/2016:
33
•
Amended Resolution No. 99/2016 and instructed ENARGAS to take the necessary steps in order that during 2016, the aggregate amount, after
taxes, of the bills issued by Gas Distribution Companies to be paid by Residential users (category R and its subcategories), Small General
Service category (with full service) and equivalent categories in the undiluted propane network distribution service for consumptions made as of
April 1, 2016, do not exceed by more than 400% and 500%, respectively, the final amount, after tax, of the bill issued to the same user, for the
same billing period of the previous year, i.e. the amount billed should not exceed an amount equivalent to 5 or 6 times, respectively, the final
amount of the bill issued to the same user for the same billing period of the previous year.
•
Instructed ENARGAS to take the necessary steps to complete, before December 31, 2016, the comprehensive Tariff Review process (referred to
in Section 1 of Resolution No. 31 dated March 29, 2016). The public hearing for such Tariff Review process shall be held before October 31,
2016.
As a result of the Temporary Agreement with Natural Gas Distribution Companies and the tariff schemes issued accordingly, there has been, throughout the
Argentine territory a large number of legal actions (motions for protection of constitutional rights, precautionary measures, etc.) against the tariff scheme in
force. Among them is the Center of Studies for the Promotion of Equality and Solidarity (“CEPIS”) case, whereby on April 7, 2016, CEPIS (a Civil Association
registered with the Provincial Registrar of Legal Persons) filed a motion for protection of constitutional rights seeking a decree of nullity of Resolutions
No. 28/2016 and 31/2016 of the MINEM. The first instance court rejected the motion and ordered the Federal Government – MINEM to call a public hearing in
order to validate Resolutions No. 28/2016 and 31/2016.
On July 7, 2016, and as a result of the appeals filed by the parties, Division II of the Federal Court of Appeals of La Plata determined the nullity of
Resolutions No. 28/2016 and 31/2016 of the Federal Ministry of Energy and Mining, whereby the tariff regime in the whole country went back to the one in
force before the issuance of both resolutions. The decision was appealed by the MINEM on July 12, 2016 to the Supreme Court, which will be in charge of
deciding the issue.
Although Metrogas is not a party to the CEPIS Case and resolution dated July 7, 2016 says nothing about the tariff schemes approved by the ENARGAS, on
July 27, 2016, the ENARGAS informed, through Note No. 6877 that, as a result of the decision in the CEPIS Case and until the appeal filed by the MINEM to
the Supreme Court is not solved, it is not feasible to apply the ENARGAS Resolutions related to tariff increases, including, among others, Resolutions No.
3,726/2016 and 3,843/2016. Accordingly, Metrogas has estimated revenues from sales of gas and from the transportation and distribution service, as well as
the costs of gas supply and transportation as of June 30, 2016, by applying the tariffs in force as of March 31, 2016.
However, Metrogas anticipates an agreement with the Argentine Government concerning the guidelines contained in the Annex to the 2016 Temporary
Agreement related to the methods, time periods and timelines of the execution of the Memorandum of Agreement for Comprehensive Contractual
Renegotiations, so as to facilitate the restructuring of the economic-financial standing.
In turn, in connection with ENARGAS Resolution No. 1,410/2010, approving a “Procedure for Gas Requests, Confirmations and Controls”, which had been
appealed by YPF, on December 9, 2015, the ENARGAS rejected YPF’s challenge to such resolution. YPF is evaluating the course of action that it will
follow.

Natural Gas New Projects Stimulus Program
34
On May 18, 2016, MINEM Resolution No. 74/2016 created the “Natural Gas New Projects Stimulus Program” in order to foster natural gas production for
those companies submitting new natural gas projects, provided they are not beneficiaries of the “Natural Gas Additional Injection Stimulus Program” or the
“Natural Gas Injection Stimulus for Companies with Reduced Injection”, respectively created by Resolutions No. 1/2013 and 60/2013 of the former Strategic
Planning and Coordination Commission of the Hydrocarbon Investments Nation Plan.
The submission of new projects, which must be approved by the Hydrocarbon Resources Secretariat, may obtain a stimulus price of 7.50 US$/MMBTU.
The “Natural Gas Injection Stimulus for Companies without Injection”, created by Resolution No. 185/2015 of the former Strategic Planning and Coordination
Commission of the Hydrocarbon Investments Nation Plan has been abolished, but any projects submitted under such program which are pending approval
must be evaluated under the “Natural Gas New Projects Program”.
The “Natural Gas New Projects Program” shall be effective as from the publication of the relevant resolution in the Official Gazette (May 18, 2016) until
December 31, 2018.
Following this Resolution, no new projects may be submitted under the natural gas production incentive Program known as “Gas Plus”, created by
Resolution No. 24/2008 of the former ex-Energy Secretariat of the ex-Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, as amended.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any projects approved under said Program shall remain in full force according to the terms of their respective approvals.
The requirements to be fulfilled by gas to be involved in a new natural gas project are the following: a) it must come from an exploitation concession granted
as a result of a discovery reported after the effective date of Resolution No. 1/2013 of the former Strategic Planning and Coordination Commission of the
Hydrocarbon Investments Nation Plan; or b) come from an exploitation concession of areas classified as “Tight Gas” or “Shale Gas”, or c) belong to
companies without natural gas injection registers which acquire an interest in areas belonging to companies registered in the “Natural Gas Additional
Injection Stimulus Program” or the “Natural Gas Injection Stimulus for Companies with Reduced Injection”, respectively created by Resolutions No. 1/2013
and 60/2013 of the former Strategic Planning and Coordination Commission of the Hydrocarbon Investments Nation Plan, but which, during the period in
which the selling company shall have calculated its Basic Injection, the Total Injection coming from the areas in question shall have been null, including the
acquisition of entire areas.
On May 20, 2016, Executive Order No. 704/2016 was issued, which converted into pesos the debt under the Natural Gas Additional Injection Stimulus
Program, the Natural Gas Injection Stimulus for Companies with Reduced Injection and those derived from the Agreement for the Supply of Propane Gas for
