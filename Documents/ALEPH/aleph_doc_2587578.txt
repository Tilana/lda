Report of independent registered
public accounting firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Vale S.A.
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Vale S.A. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2012, and the related condensed consolidated
statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows and of changes in stockholders’ equity, for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011
and for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011. This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of
applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011,
and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows and of stockholders’ equity for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated
February 15, 2012, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

All majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have both share and management control are consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Subsidiaries
over which control is achieved through other means, such as stockholders agreement, are also consolidated even if we hold less than 51% of voting capital. Our variable interest entities in
which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures are accounted under the equity method (Note 10).
We evaluate the carrying value of our equity investments in relation to publicly quoted market prices when available. If the quoted market price is lower than book value, and such decline is
considered other than temporary, we write-down our equity investments to the level of the quoted market value.
We define joint ventures as businesses in which we and a small group of other partners each participate actively in the overall entity management, based on a stockholders agreement. We
define affiliates as businesses in which we participate as a noncontrolling interest but with significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee.
Our participation in hydroelectric projects in Brazil is made via consortium contracts under which we have undivided interests in the assets, and are liable for our proportionate share of
liabilities and expenses, which are based on our proportionate share of power output.  We do not have joint liability for any obligations. No separate legal or tax status is granted to consortia
under the Brazilian law. Accordingly, we recognize our proportionate share of costs and our undivided interest in assets relating to hydroelectric projects.

Our condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011 and six-month ended June 30, 2012 and 2011,
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“USGAAP”), which differ in certain respects from the accounting practices adopted in
Brazil (“BRGAAP”), and the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”), which are the basis for our annual
statutory financial statements, are unaudited. However, in our opinion, these condensed consolidated financial statements includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. The results of operations for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012, and March 31, 2012 and the Six-
month period ended June 30, 2012, are not necessarily indicative of the actual results expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2012.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statement should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011,
prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to use estimates to account for certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Our condensed consolidated
financial statements therefore include various estimates concerning the selection of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, impairment, provisions necessary for contingent liabilities,
fair values assigned to assets and liabilities acquired and assumed in business combinations, income tax uncertainties, employee post-retirement benefits and other similar evaluations.
Actual results may vary from our estimates.
The Brazilian real is the parent Company’s functional currency. We have selected the US dollar as our reporting currency.
All assets and liabilities have been translated into US dollars at the closing rate of exchange at each balance sheet date (or, if unavailable, the first available exchange rate).  All statement of
income accounts have been translated to US dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods. Capital accounts are recorded at historical exchange rates.
Translation gains and losses are recorded in the Cumulative Translation Adjustments account (“CTA”) in stockholders’ equity.
The results of operations and financial position of our entities that have a functional currency other than the US dollar have been translated into US dollars and adjustments to translate those
statements into US dollars are recorded in the CTA in stockholders’ equity.
The exchange rates used to translate the assets and liabilities of the Brazilian operations at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, were R$1.9893 and R$1.8683, respectively.
4                                         Accounting pronouncements
Newly issued accounting pronouncements
The Company understands that the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not effective as of and for the year ending December 31, 2012, are not expected to be relevant for its
consolidated financial statements.

5                                         Major acquisitions and Disposals
a)                        Fertilizer Business
In 2010, through our wholly owned subsidiary Mineração Naque S.A. (“Naque”), we acquired 78.92% of the total capital (being 99.83% the of voting capital) of Vale Fertilizantes S.A. and
100% of the total capital of Vale Fosfatados. In 2011 and beginning of 2012, we concluded several transactions including a public offer to acquire the free floating of Vale Fertilizantes and its
delisting which resulted in the current ownership of 100% of the total capital of this subsidiary.
The purchase consideration of the business combination effected in 2010, when control was obtained, amounted to US$5,795. The purchase price allocation exercise was concluded in 2011
and generated a deferred tax liability on the fair value adjustments, determined based on the temporary differences between the accounting basis of those assets and liabilities at fair  values
and their tax basis represented by the historical carrying values at the acquired entity. According to current Brazilian tax regulations, goodwill generated in connection with a business
combination as well as the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are only tax deductible post a legal merger between the acquirer and the acquiree.
In June 2012, we have decided to legally merge Naque and Vale Fertilizantes. As a result, the carrying amounts of acquired assets and liabilities accounted for at Naque’s consolidated
financial statements, represented by their amortized fair values from acquisition date, became their tax basis.
Therefore, upon concluding the merger, there are no longer differences between tax basis and carrying amounts of the net assets acquired, and consequently there is no longer deferred tax
liability amount to be recognized. The outstanding balance of the initially recognized deferred tax liability (accounted for in connection with the purchase accounting) totaling US$ 1,236 was
entirely recycled through P&L for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, in connection with the legal merger of Vale Fertilizantes into Naque.
In addition, Naque was then renamed as Vale Fertilizantes.
b)                        Sale of coal
In June 2012, we have concluded the sale of our thermal coal operations in Colombia to CPC S.A.S., an affiliate of Colombian Natural Resources S.A.S. (“CNR”), a privately held company,
which includes future compromises around of US$ 121.
The thermal coal operations in Colombia constitute a fully-integrated mine-railway-port system consisting of a coal mine and a coal deposit; a coal port facility; and an equity participation in a
railway connecting the coal mines to the port.
The loss on this transaction, of US$355 was recorded in the income statement in the line “Gain (Loss) on sale of assets”
c)                        Acquisition of EBM shares
Continuing the process of optimization its corporate structure, during 2Q12 Vale acquired additional 10.46% of Empreendimentos Brasileiros de Mineração S. A. (EBM), whose main asset is
the participation in Minerações Brasileiras Reunidas S. A., which owns mines sites Itabirito, Vargem Grande and Paraopeba. As a result of the acquisition, we increased our share of the
capital of EBM to 96.7% and of MBR to 98.3%, and the amount of US$62 are recognized as a result from operations with non-controlling interest in “Stockholders Equity”.

The increase in cash equivalents during the 2012, is mainly related to the notes issued during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 (note 12).

Stockholders
Each holder of common and preferred class A stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters brought before stockholders’ meetings, except for the election of the Board of
Directors, which is restricted to the holders of common stock. The Brazilian Government holds twelve preferred special shares which confer permanent veto rights over certain matters.
Both common and preferred stockholders are entitled to receive a mandatory minimum dividend of 25% of annual adjusted net income under Brazilian GAAP, once declared at the annual
stockholders’ meeting. In the case of preferred stockholders, this dividend cannot be less than 6% of the preferred capital as stated in the statutory accounting records or, if greater, 3% of
the Brazilian GAAP equity value per share.
In April 2012, the Board of Directors approved the payment of interest on capital in the amount of US$ 3 billion, corresponding to US$ 0.588547644 per outstanding share, common or
preferred shares, of Vale issuance.
In November 2011, as part of the share buy-back program approved in June 2011, we concluded the acquisition of 39,536,080 common shares, at an average price of US$ 26.25 per share,
and 81,451,900 preferred shares, at an average price of US$ 24.09 per share (including shares of each class in the form of American Depositary Receipts), for a total aggregate purchase
price of US$ 3.0 billion.
Mandatorily convertible
In June 2012, the notes series VALE and VALE.P-2012 were converted into ADS and represent an aggregate of 15,839,592 common shares and 40,241,968 preferred class A shares
respectively. The Conversion was made using 56,081,560 treasury stocks held by the Company. The difference between the conversion amount and the book value of the treasury stocks of
US$ (251) was accounted for in additional paid-in capital in the stockholder’s equity.
In May 2012, Vale paid additional remuneration to holders of those mandatorily convertible notes, in the amount of US$ 1.463648 and US$ 1.692869 per note, respectively.

Under the terms of the long-term incentive compensation plan, the participants, restricted to certain executives, may elect to allocate part of their annual bonus to the plan. The allocation is
applied to purchase preferred shares of Vale, through a predefined financial institution, at market conditions and with no benefit provided by Vale.
The shares purchased by each executive are unrestricted and may, at the participant’s discretion, be sold at any time. However if, the shares are held for a three-year period and the
executive is continually employed by Vale during that period.  The participant then becomes entitled to receive from Vale a cash payment equivalent to the total amount of shares held, based
on the market rates, the total shares linked to the plan at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, are 4,879,815 and 3,012,538, respectively.
Additionally, as a long-term incentive certain eligible executives have the opportunity to receive at the end of the triennial cycle, a certain number of shares at market rates, based on an
evaluation of their career and performance factors measured as an indicator of total return to stockholders.
We account for the compensation cost provided to our executives under this long-term incentive compensation plan, following the requirements for Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Liabilities are measured at each reporting date at fair value, based on market rates. Compensation costs incurred are recognized, over the defined three-year vesting period. At
June 30, 2012, December 31, 2011, we recognized a liability of US$66, US$109, respectively.
16           Commitments and contingencies
In regards to the construction and installation of our nickel and cobalt processing plant in New Caledonia, we have provided significant guarantees in respect of our financing arrangements
which are outlined below.
In connection with the Girardin Act tax - advantaged lease financing arrangement sponsored by the French government, we provided guarantees to BNP Paribas for the benefit of the tax
investors regarding certain payments due from VNC, associated with the Girardin Act lease financing. We also committed that assets associated with the Girardin Act lease financing would
be substantially complete by December 31, 2011. In light of the delay in the start-up of the VNC processing facilities, we proposed an extension to the previously agreed substantial
completion date of December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The French Government and tax investors have formally agreed to this extension. We believe the likelihood of the guarantee
being called upon to be remote.
Sumic Nickel Netherlands B.V. (“Sumic”), a 21% stockholder of VNC, has a put option to sell to us 25%, 50%, or 100% of the shares they own of VNC if the defined cost of the initial nickel
cobalt development project, as measured by funding provided to VNC, in natural currencies and converted to U.S. dollars at specified rates of exchange, in the form of Girardin Act lease
financing, shareholder loans and equity contributions by shareholders to VNC, exceeded $4.6 billion and an agreement cannot be reached on how to proceed with the project. On May 27,
2010 the threshold was reached. The put option discussion and decision period was extended to July 31, 2012. In light of the delay in ramping up the Project, we are currently in discussions
with Sumic pertaining to a further extension of the put option.

In addition, in the course of our operations we have provided letters of credit and guarantees in the amount of $743 million that are associated with items such as environment reclamation,
asset retirement obligation commitments, insurance, electricity commitments, post-retirement benefits, community service commitments and import and export duties.
We and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal actions in the normal course of business. Based on the advice of our legal counsel, management believes that the amounts
recognized are sufficient to cover probable losses in connection with such actions.
The provision for contingencies and the related judicial deposits is as follows:

Labor and social security related actions principally comprise claims by Brazilian current and former employees for (i) payment of time spent travelling from their residences to the work-place,
(ii) additional health and safety related payments and (iii) various other matters, often in connection with disputes about the amount of indemnities paid upon dismissal and the one-third extra
holiday pay.
Civil actions principally relate to claims made against us by contractors in Brazil in connection with losses alleged to have been incurred by them as a result of various past Government
economic plans, during which full inflation indexation of contracts was not permitted, as well as for accidents and land appropriation disputes.
Tax related actions principally comprise challenges initiated by us, on certain taxes on revenues and uncertain tax positions. We continue to vigorously pursue our interests in all these
actions but recognize that we probably will incur some losses in the final instance, for which we have made provisions.
Judicial deposits are made by us following court requirements in order to be entitled to either initiate or continue a legal action. These amounts are released to us upon receipt of a final
favorable outcome from the legal action, and in the case of an unfavorable outcome, the deposits are transferred to the prevailing party.
Contingencies settled during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011, totaled US$ 27, US$ 13 and US$ 130, respectively. Provisions recognized in
the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011, totaled US$ 224, US$ 99 and US$ 176, respectively, classified as other operating expenses.
In addition to the contingencies for which we have made provisions, we are defendants in claims where in our opinion, and based on the advice of our legal counsel, the likelihood of loss is
reasonably possible but not probable, in the total amount of US$ 21,318 at June 30, 2012, and for which no provision has been made (December 31, 2011 — US$22,449). The primary
reasonably possible tax contingencies refers to tax assessments against us regarding the payment of Income Tax and Social Contribution calculated based on the equity method in foreign
subsidiaries.
At the time of our privatization in 1997, the Company issued debentures to its then-existing stockholders, including the Brazilian Government. The terms of these debentures were set to
ensure that the pre-privatization stockholders, including the Brazilian Government, would participate in possible future financial benefits that could be obtained from exploiting certain mineral
resources.
A total of 388,559,056 Debentures were issued at a par value of R$ 0.01 (one cent), whose value will be restated in accordance with the variation in the General Market Price Index (IGP-M),
as set forth in the Issue Deed. As at June 30, 2012 the total amount of these debentures was US$ 1,410 (US$ 1,336 in December 31, 2011).
The debenture holders have the right to receive premiums, paid semiannually, equivalent to a percentage of net revenues from specific mine resources as set forth in the indenture.
In April 2012 we paid remuneration on these debentures of US$ 6.

Asset retirement obligations
We use various judgments and assumptions when measuring our asset retirement obligations.
Changes in circumstances, law or technology may affect our cash flow estimates and we periodically review the amounts accrued and adjust them as necessary. Our accruals do not reflect
unasserted claims because we are currently not aware of any such issues. Also the amounts provided are not reduced by any potential recoveries under cost sharing, insurance or
indemnification arrangements because such recoveries are considered uncertain.
The changes in the provisions for asset retirement obligations are as follows:

18           Fair value disclosure of financial assets and liabilities
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, through Accounting Standards Codification and Accounting Standards Updates, defines fair value and sets out a framework for measuring fair
value, which refers to valuation concepts and practices and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements.
a)             Measurements
The pronouncements define fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset, or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  In determining fair value, the Company uses various methods including market, income
and cost approaches.  Based on these approaches, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions
about risk and or the inherent risks in the inputs to the valuation technique.
22
Table of Contents
These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs.  The Company utilizes techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs.  Under this standard, those inputs used to measure the fair value are required to be classified on three levels. Based on the characteristics of the inputs used
in valuation techniques the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the
information used to determine fair values.  Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed as follows:
Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices on an active, liquid and visible market for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date;
Level 2 - Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities on active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the term of the asset
or liability;
Level 3 - Assets and liabilities, for which quoted prices do not exist, or those prices or valuation techniques are supported by little or no market activity, unobservable or illiquid. At this point,
fair market valuation becomes highly subjective.
b)             Measurements on a recurring basis
The description of the valuation methodologies used for recurring assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2012 and
December 31, 2011 are summarized below:
·              Available-for-sale securities
They are securities that are not classified either as held-for-trading or as held-to-maturity for strategic reasons and have readily available market prices. We evaluate the carrying value of
some of our investments in relation to publicly quoted market prices when available.  When there is no market value, we use inputs other than quoted prices.
·              Derivatives
The market approach is used to estimate the fair value of the swaps discounting their cash flows using the interest rate of the currency they are denominated in. It is also used for the
commodities contracts, since the fair value is computed by using forward curves for each commodity.
·              Debentures
The fair value is measured by the market approach method, and the reference price is available on the secondary market.
The tables below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as follows:

c)             Measurements on a non-recurring basis
The Company also has assets under certain conditions that are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets include goodwill and assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in business combinations. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, we have not recognized any impairment for those items.
d)             Financial Instruments
Long-term debt
The valuation method used to estimate the fair value of our debt is the market approach for the contracts that are quoted on the secondary market, such as bonds and debentures. The fair
value of both fixed and floating rate debt is determined by discounting future cash flows of Libor and Vale’s bonds curves (income approach).
Time deposits
The method used is the income approach, through the prices available on the active market. The fair value is close to the carrying amount due to the short-term maturities of the instruments.
Our long-term debt is reported at amortized cost, and the income of time deposits is accrued monthly according to the contract rate. The estimated fair value measurement is disclosed as
follows:

Perpetual Notes (b)

Risk management policy
Vale considers that the effective management of risks is a key objective to support its growth strategy, strategic planning and financial flexibility. Therefore, Vale has developed its risk
management strategy in order to provide an integrated approach of the risks the Company is exposed to. To do that, Vale evaluates not only the impact of market risk factors in the business
results (market risk), but also the risk arising from third party obligations with Vale (credit risk), those inherent to inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events
(operational risk), those arising from liquidity risk, among others.
The Board of Directors established the corporate risk management policy in order to support the growth strategy, strategic planning and business continuity of the Company, strengthening its
capital structure and asset management, ensure flexibility and consistency on the financial management and strengthen corporate governance practices.
The corporate risk management policy determines that Vale measures and monitors its corporate risk on a consolidated approach in order to guarantee that the overall risk level of the
Company remains aligned with the guidelines defined by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board.
The Executive Risk Management Committee, created by the Board of Directors, is responsible for supporting the Executive Board in the risk analysis and for issuing opinion regarding the
Company’s risk management. It’s also responsible for the supervision and revision of the principles and instruments of corporate risk management.
The Executive Board is responsible for the approval of the policy deployment into norms, rules and responsibilities and for reporting to the Board of Directors about such procedures.
The risk management norms and instructions complement the corporate risk management policy and define practices, processes, controls, roles and responsibilities in the Company
regarding risk management.
The Company may, when necessary, allocate specific risk limits to management activities that need them, including but not limited to, market risk limit, corporate and sovereign credit limit,
in accordance with the acceptable corporate risk limit.
Market Risk Management
Vale is exposed to the behavior of various market risk factors that can impact its cash flow. The assessment of this potential impact arising from the volatility of risk factors and their
correlations is performed periodically to support the decision making process and the growth strategy of the Company, ensure its financial flexibility and monitor the volatility of future cash
flows.
When necessary, market risk mitigation strategies are evaluated and implemented in line with these objectives. Some strategies may incorporate financial instruments, including derivatives.
The portfolios of the financial instruments are monitored on a monthly basis, enabling financial results surveillance and its impact on cash flow, and ensuring strategies adherence to the
proposed objectives.
Considering the nature of Vale’s business and operations, the main market risk factors which the Company is exposed to are:
· Interest rates;
· Foreign exchange and;
· Product prices and input costs
Foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk
Vale’s cash flows are exposed to volatility of several currencies. While most of the product prices are indexed to US dollars, most of the costs, disbursements and investments are indexed to
currencies other than the US dollar, namely the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar.
Derivative instruments may be used to reduce Vale’s potential cash flow volatility arising from its currency mismatch.
Table of Contents
32
For hedging revenues, costs, expenses and investment cash flows, the main risk mitigation strategies used are currency forward transactions and swaps.
Vale implemented hedge transactions to protect its cash flow against the market risks that arises from its debt obligations — mainly currency volatility. We use swap transactions to convert
debt linked to Brazilian real into US dollar that have similar - or sometimes shorter - settlement dates than the final maturity of the debt instruments. Their notional amounts are similar to the
principal and interest payments, subjected to liquidity market conditions.
Swaps with shorter settlement dates are renegotiated through time so that their final maturity matches - or becomes closer - to the debts` final maturity. At each settlement date, the results of
the swap transactions partially offset the impact of the foreign exchange rate in Vale’s obligations, contributing to stabilize the cash disbursements in US dollar.
In the event of an appreciation (depreciation) of the Brazilian real against the US dollar, the negative (positive) impact on Brazilian real denominated debt obligations (interest and/or principal
payment) measured in US dollars will be partially offset by a positive (negative) effect from a swap transaction, regardless of the US dollar / Brazilian real exchange rate in the payment date.
The same rationale applies to debt denominated in other currencies and their respective swaps.
Vale is also exposed to interest rate risks on loans and financings. Its floating rate debt consists mainly of loans including export pre-payments, commercial banks and multilateral
organizations loans. In general, the US dollar floating rate debt is subject to changes in the LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate in US dollar). To mitigate the impact of the interest rate
volatility on its cash flows, Vale considers the natural hedges resulting from the correlation of commodities prices and US dollar floating rates. If such natural hedges are not present, Vale
may search for the same effect by using financial instruments.
Product price and Input Cost risk
Vale is also exposed to several market risks associated with commodities prices volatility. In line with the risk management policy, risk mitigation strategies involving commodities can also
be used to adjust its risk profile and reduce the volatility of cash flow. In these cases, the mitigation strategies used are primarily forward transactions, futures contracts or zero-cost collars.
Embedded derivatives
The cash flow of the Company is also exposed to market risks associated with contracts that contain embedded derivatives or behave as derivatives. The derivatives may be embedded in,
but are not limited to, commercial contracts, purchase agreements, leases, bonds, insurance policies and loans.
Vale’s wholly-owned subsidiary Vale Canada limited has nickel concentrate and raw materials purchase agreements, in which there are provisions based on the movement of nickel and
copper prices. These provisions are considered embedded derivatives.

Table of Contents
Hedge Accounting
Under the Standard Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities, all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded in
the balance sheet at fair value and the gain or loss in fair value is included in current earnings, unless if qualified as hedge accounting. A derivative must be designated in a hedging
relationship in order to qualify for hedge accounting. These requirements include a determination of what portions of hedges are deemed to be effective versus ineffective. In general, a
hedging relationship is effective when a change in the fair value of the derivative is offset by an equal and opposite change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item. In accordance with
these requirements, effectiveness tests are performed in order to assess effectiveness and quantify ineffectiveness for all designated hedges.
At June 30, 2012, Vale had outstanding positions designated as cash flow hedge. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable
to a particular risk, such as a forecasted purchase or sale. If a derivative is designated as cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in
other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. However, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives designated as
hedges is recognized in earnings. If a portion of a derivative contract is excluded for purposes of effectiveness testing, the value of such excluded portion is included in earnings.
