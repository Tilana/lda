<B>Item 1.01 Entry Into Material Definitive Agreements </B></P>
<P align="justify">
On July 2, 2014, Golden Queen Mining Co., Inc. (the &ldquo;Subsidiary&rdquo;), 
the wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd. (&ldquo;Golden 
Queen&rdquo;), issued a senior secured promissory note (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) 
to Leucadia
National Corporation (&ldquo;Leucadia&rdquo;) and Auvergne, LLC 
(&ldquo;Auvergne&rdquo;, and together with Leucadia, the &ldquo;Lenders&rdquo;),
with Golden Queen as guarantor, in respect of an advance of an aggregate of 
US&#36;10,000,000
(US&#36;6,500,000 from Leucadia and US&#36;3,500,000 from Auvergne) (the 
&ldquo;Loan&rdquo;) to the Subsidiary by the Lenders. Auvergne is controlled by 
members of the Clay family, a shareholder group which collectively owns 
approximately 27% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Golden Queen. Thomas Clay, a member of the Clay
family, serves on Golden Queen&rsquo;s board of directors.  Leucadia controls 
Gauss Holdings LLC, which together with Auvergne are members of Gauss LLC, a 
party to an
agreement to form a joint venture with the Subsidiary (the &ldquo;Joint 
Venture&rdquo;) as reported by Golden Queen on the Form 8-K filed on June 12, 
2014. </P>
<P align="justify">
The Loan is secured and senior to existing debt and proceeds will be used to 
advance the development of Golden Queen&rsquo;s Soledad Mountain Project. The 
maturity date of the Loan will be the earlier of: (a) the closing date (the 
&ldquo;Joint
Venture Closing&rdquo;) of the Joint Venture transaction and (b) September 30, 
2014.  If the Joint Venture Closing occurs later than September 30, 2014, then 
the maturity date can be extended to December 1, 2014 by paying a 
US&#36;1,000,000
extension fee, which extension fee will not be payable if the Joint Venture 
Closing occurs before the extended maturity date.</P>
<P align="justify">
The repayment of the Loan, accrued interest and extension fee, if any, will be 
funded from the proceeds of the Joint Venture upon the Joint Venture Closing. 
The Loan will bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, with interest 
calculated monthly
at the end of each month and accrued interest payable at the end of each month 
in arrears or when the unpaid principal amount is due and payable. At the option
of the Subsidiary, payment of interest due in whole or in part on any date on 
which
interest is due may be capitalized, with such accrued interest being added to 
the principal amount of the Loan. After the occurrence and during the 
continuation of an event of default, interest on the Loan will accrue at a rate 
of 12.0% per annum
and the unpaid principal balance of the Note, together with accrued but unpaid 
interest, shall become immediately due and payable. An event of default under 
the Note includes any of the following: failure to pay principal or interest 
when due,
breach of any representation or warranty in the Note, commencement of 
dissolution or liquidation proceedings against Golden Queen or the Subsidiary, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of Golden Queen or the Subsidiary, or failure of Golden
Queen or the
Subsidiary to comply with any material term of the Note. The Loan may be prepaid
in whole but not in part at any time or from time to time without penalty or 
premium.</P>
<P align="justify">
The Note contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including
a prohibition on the incurrence of further indebtedness other than certain 
existing indebtedness between the Subsidiary and Golden Queen and indebtedness 
incurred in
connection with development of Golden Queen&rsquo;s Soledad Mountain Project. As
security for the Loan, the Lenders have a security interest in the 
Subsidiary&rsquo;s property, including accounts, equipment, inventory, 
intellectual property and
other personal property. Pursuant to the Note, Golden Queen has guaranteed the 
Subsidiary&rsquo;s repayment obligations under the Note. As security interest 
for Golden Queen&rsquo;s obligations as a guarantor, the Note creates a security
interest in
all shares of the Subsidiary&rsquo;s stock held by Golden Queen, and Golden 
Queen is prohibited from creating any liens on such shares, provided, however, 
that Golden Queen may complete the corporate restructuring contemplated in the 
Joint Venture
transaction. </P>
<P align="justify">
No finder&rsquo;s fee or commission will be paid in connection with the Loan. 
</P>
<P align="justify">
In connection with the Loan, on July 2, 2014, Golden Queen, the Subsidiary,
Leucadia, Auvergne, Clay family member Harris Clay and a trust controlled by the
Clay family (the &ldquo;Clay Trust&rdquo;) entered into a subordination 
agreement (the
&ldquo;Subordination Agreement&rdquo;) pursuant to which Harris Clay and the 
Clay Trust agreed to subordinate debt and guarantor obligations owed to them by 
the Subsidiary (the &#147;Subordinated
Debt&#148;). In accordance with the Subordination Agreement, the obligations of 
the
Subsidiary under the Note are senior to the Subordinated Debt. The subordination
of the Subordinated Debt will continue until the payment in full of all amounts
owed by the Subsidiary under the Note. </P>
