<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/13, decided to preserve the Social 
Forum as a vital space for dialogue between the representatives of Member States, civil 
society, including grass-roots organizations and intergovernmental organizations on issues 
linked with the promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by all. Consequently, the 
Social Forum met twice - in 2008 and 2009.1 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with resolution 13/17 of the Council, the 2010 Social Forum was held 
in Geneva from 4 to 6 October 2010. The President of the Council appointed, in September 
2010, Laura Dupuy Lasserre, Permanent Representative of Uruguay to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva, as the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 2010 Social Forum.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report contains a summary of discussions held at the 2010 Social 
Forum, as well as its conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the Social Forum 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the 2010 Social Forum, and the President of the 
Human Rights Council followed with opening remarks.2 In his statement, the President 
emphasized that climate change had far-reaching implications on the enjoyment of human 
rights, especially for vulnerable groups, and noted the importance of looking at the human 
rights perspectives and applying a human rights-based approach when identifying and 
implementing measures and actions to address the adverse impacts of climate change.  
</p>
<p>5. On behalf of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), Anders Kompass, Director of the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation 
Division, delivered welcome remarks. He stressed the need to<b> </b>bring the human rights 
dimension of climate change to the centre of the climate change debate and the importance 
of ensuring that any reference to human rights included in an agreed outcome text of the 
sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change be consistent with the obligations contained in international human rights 
instruments.  
</p>
<p>6. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then addressed the Forum and reaffirmed that various 
human rights, including those related to safe drinking water, health, housing, land, 
livelihood, employment and development, were undermined as a direct or indirect effect of 
climate change circumstances. She regretted that there had been little or no presence of 
human rights considerations in the actual climate change discussions, including in the 
context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The 
Chairperson-Rapporteur underlined the important task ahead in formulating a human rights 
input to those discussions. She also referred to national efforts in Uruguay, highlighting the 
intersectoral and participatory national system of response to climate change and integral 
plan of action. 
</p>
<p>7. The Council, in its resolution 13/17, had requested that the discussions of the 2010 
Social Forum focus on the adverse effects of climate change on the full enjoyment of human 
rights, including the right to life and economic, social and cultural rights; measures and 
actions to address the impact of climate change on the full enjoyment of human rights at the 
</p>
<p>

<p>OHCHR website at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/presentations2010.htm. </p>


<p>local, national, regional and international levels, including on most vulnerable groups, 
particularly women and children; and international assistance and cooperation in addressing 
the human rights related impact of climate change. Accordingly, the programme of work3 
was prepared under the guidance of the Chairperson-Rapporteur, taking into account the 
input received from Member States and other relevant stakeholders. The 2010 Social Forum 
held interactive debate involving 20 expert presentations on six different thematic panels 
and 10 micro-documentaries on issues relating to the theme under focus. 
</p>
<p>8. In addition to the provisional agenda (A/HRC/SF/2010/1; see annex I) and the 
programme of work mentioned above, the 2010 Social Forum had before it the background 
report (A/HRC/SF/2010/2) submitted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights pursuant to paragraph 7 of Council resolution 13/17 and the study prepared by 
OHCHR on the relationship between human rights and climate change (A/HRC/10/61). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Setting the scene: the adverse effects of climate change on the full 
enjoyment of human rights, including the right to life and economic, 
social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights and climate change 
</b></p>
<p>9. Craig Mokhiber, Officer-in-Charge of the Research and Right to Development 
Division of OHCHR, presented the background report of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (A/HRC/SF/2010/2) submitted at the request of the Human Rights Council 
as a contribution for the dialogues and debates during the Forum. The report summarized 
the contributions received from Member States and relevant stakeholders, and provided 
information on the activities undertaken by United Nations human rights mechanisms in 
addressing the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights. In the context of 
the theme under consideration by the Forum, he also introduced the findings of the OHCHR 
study on climate change and human rights (A/HRC/10/61), which was prepared in response 
to a request by the Human Rights Council. He expressed hope that the OHCHR background 
report and study would provide a useful platform for constructive deliberations and lead to 
innovative recommendations by the Social Forum to the Council, with respect to 
reaffirming the relationship between human rights and climate change. 
</p>
<p>10. Liusha Zahir, the Deputy Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United 
Nations in Geneva, referred to the Male&#8217; Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global 
Climate Change adopted by Small Island Developing States in November 2007, and noted 
that there was currently no doubt that climate change had a range of implications, both 
direct and indirect, for the full enjoyment of human rights. Although the question of 
whether climate change constituted a violation of human rights had largely been avoided by 
States, a number of developing countries had argued that responsibility for climate change-
related harms could be established on the basis of both historical responsibility for global 
warming, and on the basis of the failure of many developed countries to abide by their 
international mitigation commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change. She recalled that the question of States&#8217; human rights obligations at the 
national and international levels pertaining to climate change generated the most discussion 
during the June 2009 Human Rights Council debate, and expressed the opinion that that 
question would remain the main point of discussion.

<p>11. Stephen Humphreys, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, 
identified five causes for concern, namely that: (a) climate change was not being effectively 
addressed; (b) even before climate change was taken into account economic, social and 
cultural rights were not being adequately addressed; (c) climate change would exacerbate 
these rights failures; (d) the space for development had been largely used up; and finally, (e) 
there were complex and insidious linkages between all these phenomena, connecting 
economic growth, rising emissions and excessive energy use, on one hand, and poverty, 
vulnerability to climate change and food and water scarcity, on the other. He emphasized an 
apparent paradox in that the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights required 
development, that development fuelled climate change, and that climate change would in 
turn worsen human rights. Having queried whether a dedicated human rights special 
procedure would be a good idea, Mr. Humphreys proposed engaging with climate change 
law and policy in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change as there were numerous principles which could be mobilized to human rights ends, 
such as the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the elaboration of 
adaptation strategies and the principle of technology transfer. He argued that the right to 
development should be rethought: what kind of right do humans have to development, and 
how should it be distributed.  
</p>
<p>12. Yves Lador, of Earthjustice, emphasized the well accepted human rights dimension 
to climate change, and that discussions should move beyond that to how to deal with the 
adverse effects. Legal cases brought before regional mechanisms such as the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights, the work of United Nations human rights 
machinery (e.g. special procedures on housing, food, health, and extreme poverty, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the universal periodic review) and of 
international development and humanitarian organizations, including on migration, food and 
drought, were essential in providing affected individuals and those working in that field 
with better tools and understanding of the consequences of climate change. He also 
highlighted that the national and international responsibilities could not be separated, and 
that international responsibility was not simply supplementary: it was directly called for at 
the front line of the protection of human rights. Mr. Lador supported the idea of establishing 
a special procedure with the view to ensuring the follow-up in integrating human rights into 
climate change discussions. 
</p>
<p>13. In the ensuing interactive debate, Cuba, Nord-Sud XXI and the World Council of 
Churches made interventions. It was reaffirmed that climate change was one of the most 
serious challenges and that it had negative effects on human rights, in particular on the right 
to life and food and the right to self-determination. Further, climate change was deemed to 
exacerbate national disasters with regard to the impact on life, water, health, property and 
housing, and had a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable, especially women, children 
and persons with disabilities. In that regard, the importance of local, national, regional and 
international measures and actions were noted, as was North-South and South-South 
cooperation. The debate also highlighted the challenges in integrating human rights 
language in any texts under climate change negotiations, and the crucial angle of gender 
issues in looking at climate change.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights concerns of specific vulnerable groups, in particular indigenous 
communities, women, children and internally displaced persons, with a special focus 
on economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. Ariranga Govindasamy Pillay, a member of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, gave an overview of the activities of the Committee in addressing the 
negative impact of climate change on human rights including with reference to general 
comments No. 12 (1999) on the right to food; No. 7 (1997) on the right to adequate housing: 
forced evictions; No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health </p>


<p>(para. 4, also referring to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change); 
and No. 15 (2002) on the right to water (para. 28). In his view, the legal obligations of 
States parties under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
could provide effective protection to the vulnerable individuals or groups whose rights were 
particularly affected by climate change or by measures taken to respond to climate change. 
Those obligations included taking measures towards the full realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights to the maximum extent of their available resources, and specific 
obligations which required immediate implementation. In particular, States parties had a 
core obligation to ensure, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each right contained 
in the Covenant, even in situations of conflict, emergency and natural disaster, which they 
were then required to improve over time. In that regard, the Committee had underlined the 
fact that it was particularly incumbent on all those in a position to assist, including 
developed States and international organizations, to provide international assistance and 
cooperation, especially economic and technical, to enable developing countries to fulfil their 
core obligations. Human rights standards and principles should inform and strengthen 
policy measures in the area of climate change to ensure: the effective participation of 
individuals and communities in all the relevant decision-making processes affecting their 
lives; that accountability mechanisms were in place; and that access to administrative and 
judicial remedies in cases of human rights violations was provided (see para. 14 of the 
Statement on Poverty adopted by the Committee in May 2001). 
</p>
<p>15. Pramila Patten, a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women, noted that women made up a large number of the poor in communities that 
were highly dependent on local natural resources for their livelihood, and were 
disproportionately vulnerable to and affected by climate change. Women&#8217;s limited access to 
resources and decision-making processes increased their vulnerability to climate change, 
and climate change magnified existing patterns of discrimination and inequality, including 
gender inequality. Women and men should have equal access to information, training, 
financial instruments and mechanisms, and equal access to commercial approaches to 
climate change. Ms. Patten regretted that the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the other two major multilateral environmental agreements (namely, 
the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
Particularly in Africa) did not have a strong gender approach. She stated that the exclusion 
of women from climate change decision-making processes silenced the voices of half the 
world&#8217;s population, denied women their rights, failed to uphold human rights principles and 
deprived society of many skills, experiences and capacities unique to women. She presented 
the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women as a 
powerful tool to achieve gender justice in climate change policies, and referred to the 
statement on &#8220;gender and climate change&#8221; adopted by the Committee at its forty-fourth 
session in August 2009.  
</p>
<p>16. Philippe Boncour, the Head of the International Dialogue on Migration Division in 
the Migration Policy and Research Department of the International Organization for 
Migration, welcomed the OHCHR efforts to situate the climate change debate in a human 
rights framework, and mentioned the right to life, development, property, health, food and 
water as being of particular concern. He stressed that all migration could not and should not 
be stopped: one should be prepared for the possibility of migration as a legitimate 
adaptation strategy, and that possibility should be incorporated into climate change 
adaptation plans. He referred to research which indicated that the largest proportion of 
environmental migration would take place within national borders, and noted that the 1998 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, a non-binding instrument, had proved 
effective in those situations. Such a non-binding, yet effective instrument was also an option 
for climate change discussions. By contrast, cross-border movements would constitute a </p>


<p>relatively small proportion of the overall environmentally induced population flows. He 
pointed to the legal gaps with regard to those kinds of movements, especially as it was clear 
that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) would not apply, and the need 
to fill those gaps.  
</p>
<p>17. Jos&#233; Riera, Special Adviser to the Director of International Protection, Climate 
Change Focal Point, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) noted that since the 1990s, UNHCR had been proactive in seeking to mitigate the 
environmental impact in areas hosting large concentrations of refugees and other persons of 
concern. Urgent investment was needed to reduce the impact of natural hazards by 
mitigating vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience and strengthening adaptation measures, and 
focusing on people at a grass-roots level. Experience showed that refugees, internally 
displaced persons and stateless people were already congregating in areas of the planet 
which were considered &#8220;high risk&#8221; areas for climate change impacts. He emphasized that 
there were serious legal gaps relating to potential cross-border movement linked to 
environmental factors and climate change, and referred to UNHCR work to generate 
innovative approaches on how to fill those gaps. Natural disasters exacerbated existing 
gender inequalities and pre-existing vulnerabilities, in particular those of children, after a 
major disaster. Mr. Riera made an appeal to place the rights of the most vulnerable at the 
centre of needs assessments, planning, project implementation and evaluation, and to 
improve the resilience and capacity of governments and host communities, by ensuring that 
local authorities and communities are at the centre of actions taken. 
</p>
<p>18. During the ensuing interactive debate, interventions were made by representatives of 
ATD Fourth World and Mr. Lador of Earthjustice. The impacts of climate change on people 
living in extreme poverty were emphasized, as such persons had fewer resources with which 
to respond to the events and yet were often not reached by aid programmes. Crucially, the 
poor endured the loss of the social networks which helped them to survive, and were often 
excluded from decision-making processes on how to prevent, mitigate and adjust to climate 
change. It was recommended that people living in extreme poverty should be at the centre 
of strategies to monitor, mitigate and adjust to climate change, which included active and 
meaningful involvement in the development of these strategies; and that climate change 
should be taken into account in the consultations on the draft guiding principles on extreme 
poverty and human rights. The gender aspect of climate change was emphasized, while it 
was suggested that when looking at vulnerabilities, the concept of the universality of rights 
should not be forgotten: climate change would eventually affect everyone and all 
populations should be protected, not just those deemed vulnerable. It was also noted that 
there was a risk in speaking about adaptation and not mitigation, as it could lead to a form 
of &#8220;giving up&#8221;. Mitigation remained crucial and both adaptation and mitigation policies and 
measures should be undertaken.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Measures and actions: addressing the impact of climate change on the 
full enjoyment of human rights, including on most vulnerable groups, 
particularly women and children 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National level measures and actions 
</b></p>
<p>19. Saida Agrebi, President of the Tunisian Mothers&#8217; Organization, presented findings 
on climate change trends in Tunisia and discussed how a human rights-based approach with 
regard to women, youth and children&#8217;s rights was needed to address climate change. She 
emphasized that children were central actors in promoting behaviour change required to 
mitigate the effects of global warming, and that education on environmental matters was 
crucial. Further, the Convention on the Rights of the Child specifically required States to 
take action with regard to measures to safeguard children&#8217;s right to life, survival and </p>


<p>development through, inter alia, addressing problems of environmental pollution and 
degradation. She also reported on the International Solidarity Conference on Climate 
Change Strategies for Africa and Mediterranean Regions held in Tunis in November 2007, 
and its declaration, which stressed the role of civil society in implementing adaptation 
measures, eradicating poverty and promoting development in the most vulnerable countries. 
Further, the Tunis declaration consolidated the national commitment to a human rights-
based approach to climate change, and confirmed the commitment of Tunisia to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Declaration on the 
Right to Development.  
</p>
<p>20. Angie Daz&#233;, a representative of CARE International, noted that CARE focused on 
community-based adaptation, which incorporated the promotion of climate-resilient 
livelihoods, disaster risk reduction strategies, capacity development for local civil society 
and governmental institutions, and advocacy, social mobilization and empowerment to 
address the underlying causes of vulnerability. She emphasized the importance of gender 
aspects in adaptation, noting that gender inequality was an underlying cause of vulnerability 
to climate change, and that adaptive capacity was strongly influenced by roles, rights, power 
relations and access to/control over resources. CARE supported women and men in 
accessing the resources, rights and opportunities they needed for adaptation, empowered 
vulnerable women to build their adaptive capacity, and promoted gender equality as a long-
term goal. Experience had shown that women were central to finding solutions, and that 
women had important knowledge for adaptation but often lacked the resources or power to 
use it. Ms. Daz&#233; reported on an activity in Bangladesh which addressed livelihoods security 
and power issues, and where women reported more confidence in speaking out in public, 
and negotiating with their husbands on household decisions. In Ghana, adaptation was 
integrated into local planning processes, while women received training and mentoring to 
take on leadership roles in the community and to participate in the designing and 
implementation of the policies by addressing gender-based discrimination in the society. 
</p>
<p>21. Alice Thomas, Climate Displacement Program Manager of Refugees International, 
centred her intervention on a recent mission to Pakistan, examining the impacts of the 
floods on displacement which had affected an estimated 20 million Pakistanis and damaged 
or destroyed an estimated 1.8 million homes. She stressed the importance of putting in place 
mechanisms and procedures to ensure the protection of human rights of affected populations 
when disaster strikes, in addition to investing in disaster risk reduction planning. 
Governments were likely to need significant support from the humanitarian community in 
responding to disasters of that scale, which must be prepared to quickly and effectively 
respond to requests for assistance. She highlighted the challenge that the sheer magnitude of 
displacement across Pakistan presented to ensuring the rights of affected populations to 
voluntary return and resettlement. The floods also demonstrated how natural disasters could 
lead to secondary emergencies that also affected human rights, for example impact on 
agriculture and the threat of an impending food crisis. They were also a reminder of the 
impacts of climate change on the human rights of the most vulnerable groups, including 
tenant farmers, women who faced difficulties in accessing assistance, Afghan refugees and 
IDPs who had recently returned to rebuild their lives. Climate change threatened to 
exacerbate conflict and insecurity, and led to increased migration.  
</p>
<p>22. The above presentations were followed by an interactive debate with interventions 
by representatives of China, Cuba, the Philippines and Nepal, by representatives of the 
Center for International Environmental Law, Nord-Sud XXI, International Disability 
Alliance, International Movement ATD Fourth World, and by Mr. Pillay. The adverse 
impacts of climate change on human rights were reaffirmed, as was the fact that women and 
persons with disabilities were more vulnerable. Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities was a new guidepost in these situations, serving as a link 
between humanitarian and human rights issues in requiring that persons with disabilities be </p>


<p>included in all mainstream services and programmes, and at all phases of preparation, 
response, post-disaster recovery and development. The particular vulnerabilities of people 
living in extreme poverty were also highlighted, as was the importance of addressing their 
needs in national policies. Speakers shared national initiatives to mitigate the adverse effects 
of climate change, including the introduction of energy saving measures, better management 
of waters, more regulations on building construction, forest management, the strengthening 
and monitoring of building construction, risk reduction strategies and reforestation 
measures, and the relocation of informal settlers to higher and safer ground. It was vital that 
national efforts in that regard be supported by international solidarity and knowledge 
transfer, in particular for the most vulnerable countries. Some stressed that more resources 
were needed to address the impact of climate change in developing countries, and that 
funding and technology transfer was required. The particular vulnerability of island States 
and mountainous countries was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>23. In concluding remarks, Ms. Daz&#233; emphasized that the rights-based approach was 
fundamental to adaptation strategies and their implementation. Often those with the least 
ability to secure their rights were also the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. 
For effective adaptation, the underlying causes of vulnerability to climate change must be 
addressed, and that included issues related to human rights. Ms. Thomas added that it was 
imperative for human rights issues to be addressed as early as possible in a disaster 
situation, while acknowledging that there was a great challenge to developing solutions to 
address underlying human rights concerns and implementing a human rights-based 
approach, especially in emergency situations. Mr. Pillay concurred that an essential 
ingredient to a human rights-based approach to climate change was the effective 
participation of vulnerable groups. Human rights standards and principles should inform 
and strengthen policies and measures to address climate change. A human rights-based 
approach demanded accountability and also required administrative and judiciary measures 
where rights had been violated. On the importance of international cooperation, 
accountability required duty-bearers, both State and non-State actors, national human rights 
institutions, international organizations and private sector actors to be held accountable for 
their conduct. The mechanism for accountability should be transparent and accessible.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Measures and actions at the regional and international levels 
</b></p>
<p>24. Cheryl Rosebush, a representative of the United Nations Collaborative Programme 
on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing 
Countries (UN-REDD Programme), provided an overview of REDD+ and the UN-REDD 
Programme. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing 
countries (REDD) was aimed at creating a financial value for the carbon stored in standing 
forests, and encouraging industrialized countries to make financial transfers (carbon offsets) 
to developing countries to compensate them for avoiding deforestation, while REDD+ 
included the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of 
forest carbon stocks and was currently being negotiated under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. She highlighted the programme&#8217;s interaction 
with stakeholders, and in particular indigenous peoples, and the concerns that they had 
raised with regard to REDD+. Engagement was structured by the Operational Guidance on 
Engagement with Indigenous Peoples and Other Forest Dependent Communities, followed a 
human rights-based approach and must adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to free, prior and informed consent, ensuring broad 
representation of indigenous peoples at all stages of its activities. Ms. Rosebush noted that 
both civil society and indigenous peoples were represented on the UN-REDD Programme 
Policy Board, including the Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Reference 
was made to the Independent Advisory Group on Rights, Forests and Climate Change, </p>


<p>which was established to provide independent advice and guidance to the UN-REDD 
Programme. 
</p>
<p>25. Carlo Scaramella, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Coordinator, World 
Food Programme (WFP), stressed that climate change was a hunger risk multiplier, as 
climate change would lead to more frequent, intense and erratic climate and weather-related 
disasters, deteriorating land and environmental conditions, and decreased food production 
and availability in various parts of the world and among people and communities that were 
already experiencing situations of poverty and food insecurity. For WFP, climate change 
was about people, and in particular vulnerable people, and posed an unprecedented 
challenge to eradicating hunger and poverty (Millennium Development Goal 1). It was 
noted that the WFP Strategic Plan emphasized interventions that were &#8220;responsive to the 
principles related to the right to food&#8221; and aimed at addressing &#8220;the root causes of hunger 
and vulnerability, including (&#8230;) protection causes&#8221;. WFP adopted pro-poor, inclusive and 
equitable adaptation and development policies, and viewed strengthened social protection 
systems and enhanced productive safety nets as part of climate adaptation approaches. The 
approach called for local solutions and the empowerment of local actors, with a focus on 
increasing local resilience. Mr. Scaramella provided examples of the use of Safe Access to 
Firewood and Alternative Energy (SAFE) stoves, as experienced in Uganda and Sudan, 
which provide, as a co-benefit, a protection element for women who often experience 
violence when they fetch wood outside of the refugee camps and which reduce the need to 
cut down wood for fuel. He also described the Managing Environmental Resources 
(MERET) programme in Ethiopia, which had successfully contributed to rehabilitating and 
regenerating degraded land for local communities, benefiting about one million people and 
providing an interesting and replicable model of resilience-building interventions that were 
Government owned and community based.  
</p>
<p>26. Niels Scott, a representative of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs, placed the climate change debate within the humanitarian framework, noting that 
the humanitarian community had consistently raised twin concepts of concern: increasing 
risk, and increasing vulnerability because of climate change. He noted that the draft climate 
change negotiating texts included disaster preparedness, early warning systems, emergency 
response and early recovery, disaster risk reduction and the Hyogo Framework for Action 
2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, migration 
and displacement, health impacts, food security, gender-sensitive approaches and the need 
to prioritize help to the most vulnerable communities and countries. A significant part of the 
way forward on climate change adaptation was through supporting activities at the regional 
and national levels. In this regard, Mr. Scott gave a number of examples of adaptation 
activities4 in five key areas, namely: (a) integrating climate change knowledge and research 
into programmes; (b) developing new partnerships; (c) policies, scope of work and capacity-
building; (d) advocacy, especially of national adaptation programmes of action or national 
action plans on disaster risk reduction; and (e) programmes, projects and tools.

<p>27. Ioana Creitaru, a representative of the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), provided information on the Adaptation Learning Mechanism5, a United Nations 
inter-agency global knowledge platform on climate change adaptation. The UNDP Global 
Environment Facility was implementing the project in partnership with the World Bank, the 
Climate Change Secretariat and the United Nations Environment Programme. The

<p>Mechanism responded to knowledge needs expressed by developing country Governments 
for a greater focus on sharing and reviewing good practice, practical resources and tools to 
foster continued knowledge sharing and learning among stakeholders. She explained that 
the objectives of the Mechanism were: to capture the state of knowledge on climate change 
adaptation, with a particular focus on operational aspects; to promote the integration of 
climate change adaptation aspects into development planning, policies, programmes and 
projects; and to accelerate learning by sharing lessons on good adaptation practices and 
operational guidance via a global adaptation network and community of practice. In order to 
deliver on its mandate, the Mechanism targeted development practitioners and sought to 
create partnerships across agencies, sectors and levels, and work with existing climate 
networks. 
</p>
<p>28. The above presentations were followed by interventions from representatives of the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia and Egypt; representatives of the Center for International 
Environmental Law, FIAN International, Associazione Comunit&#224; Papa Giovanni XXIII, 
Nord-Sud XXI, Greenpeace International, Association of World Citizens; and Shyami 
Puvimanasinghe and Jennifer Mohamed-Katerere, independent participants with expertise 
in the subject matter. Reference was made to a study on the relationship between the right to 
development and the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol submitted to 
the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development, and the 
OHCHR 2009 study discussion of extraterritorial obligations.  
</p>
<p>29. Reference was also made to the World People&#8217;s Conference on Climate Change and 
the Rights of Mother Earth, held in April 2010, and its Peoples Agreement, which was 
subsequently submitted by the Plurinational State of Bolivia to the Climate Change 
Secretariat in March 2010. It was argued that the model of development based on unlimited 
growth went against human dignity and was destroying nature. It was suggested that a 
human rights-based approach to climate change, the building up of the principle of 
international solidarity as an individual and a collective right and the implementation of the 
right to development were all instruments that could contribute to solutions to climate 
change. The human rights approach should be focused on ensuring fair and equitable access 
to resources. The access to justice component was often missing in responses to climate 
change, and should be understood in a broader context both in the formal (judicial) and 
informal settings (mechanisms of prevention and dispute resolution). Similarly, legal 
awareness programmes with a human rights focus should be developed so that people were 
made aware of their rights, including of the concepts of free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>30. Concerns were raised with regard to the UN-REDD Programme, which for some 
participants made the environment a commodity, while others objected to placing a 
monetary value on the environment. REDD was described as not allowing for honest 
consultation with those who opposed it on a principled basis, including indigenous peoples, 
and that REDD would not save the forests even by the most optimistic estimates. It was 
queried whether the UN-REDD programme should create a legal redress programme to 
empower indigenous peoples to have access to justice and to provide support for 
organizations and peoples who were affected by the programme. Scepticism was expressed 
about the Clean Development Mechanism as a means by which developed countries 
transferred responsibility to developing countries without assisting with their development. 
One representative queried how the UN-REDD Programme measured whether participation 
from indigenous peoples was meaningful and consistent with other human rights 
obligations, and more broadly suggested that specific indicators should be developed to 
measure whether human rights obligations were being fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>31. In concluding remarks, Ms. Rosebush welcomed the critical thinking linked to 
REDD as the UN-REDD Programme was currently working with countries and 
stakeholders to design what the programme would look like. She also suggested that </p>


<p>indicators of success would be developed in due course. Mr. Scott emphasized the 
importance of addressing the root causes of climate change and the vulnerabilities of certain 
groups, as climate change would increase humanitarian risk as a result of increased 
frequency and intensity of natural hazards and increasing human vulnerability. The most 
vulnerable people already had fewer resources to adapt and were likely to be the last to 
benefit from any new adaptation measures. Countries with poor governance might therefore 
face a spiral of increasing vulnerability and instability, exacerbated by insufficient 
organization or resources to face the negative consequences of climate change. In Mr. 
Scott&#8217;s view, that required: (a) making sure humanitarian concerns and systems are integral 
to the global climate change strategy; (b) that the humanitarian implications of climate 
change are understood and quantified to the extent possible; and (c) that support is offered 
to help develop the capacity of people, communities and authorities to prepare for and adapt 
to climate-related life-threatening hazards. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The way forward: rights-based approach to climate change 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Social dimension and good governance aspects of climate change negotiations  
</b></p>
<p>32. Marek Harsdorff, a member of the High-level Committee on Programmes Working 
Group on Climate Change, presented the work of the task team on social dimensions of 
climate change in which a number of United Nations agencies and programmes 
participated.6 He explained that &#8220;social dimensions of climate change&#8221; referred to a people-
based approach that embraced socio-economic, cultural and scientific knowledge and 
practice, aiming overall to ensure that societal needs played a part in developing practices 
towards mitigation and adaptation, for the short- and long-term benefit of all. The aim was 
to shift the focus in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
negotiations and put people first, by highlighting the socio-economic benefits of addressing 
climate change and ensuring a focus on the most vulnerable in the framework of sustainable 
development. In practical terms, Mr. Harsdorff explained that the task team worked on 
health, employment, incomes and livelihood, gender, education, housing, food and poverty. 
It addressed the needs of particular vulnerable groups (children, women, indigenous peoples 
and the poor), and the opportunities in addressing climate change. The task team aimed to 
understand and address the interlinkages between climate change and development in a 
coherent and coordinated manner, to achieve climate-resilient sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>33. Richard Newfarmer, the World Bank Special Representative to the United Nations 
and the World Trade Organization, presented the World Bank&#8217;s view of the social 
dimensions of climate change as an issue of social justice. He observed that the causes and 
consequences of climate change were deeply intertwined with global patterns of inequality, 
and that climate change acted as a multiplier of existing vulnerabilities which threatened to 
reverse hard-earned development gains. A dual-track approach was needed: both aggressive 
mitigation through curbing of greenhouse gas emissions, and pro-poor adaptation. There 
was an inverse relation between those countries emitting and those countries adversely 
affected, although newly industrializing countries, especially those with larger economies, 
were likely to constitute the great bulk of emissions moving forward. In his view, there was 
a joint responsibility throughout the world to deal with that issue. He also noted the chain of 
causation running from expected impacts of climate change through to possible human 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>OHCHR, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs, UNDP, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Human 
Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), World Bank, WFP and the World Health Organization. </p>


<p>rights and other implications. Examples of the World Bank&#8217;s work on social dimensions of 
climate change included: first, local institutions and climate adaptation, where evidence 
suggested irrigation and investments in dry lands were likely to bring more socially 
inclusive and sustainable results (Yemen and Ethiopia); and second, heavy investments 
which had been made in cyclone shelters in Bangladesh but were often under-utilized for 
social and gender reasons, moreover. early warning and preparedness were found to be 
much more effective when gender dimensions are included. Reference was made to the 
World Bank&#8217;s Social Dimensions of Climate Change Practice Group, which was aimed at 
realizing &#8220;climate-smart policies and operations in client countries that advance the interests 
of those who are the most vulnerable to climate change&#8221;. The World Bank&#8217;s Legal 
Department was finalizing a legal literature survey on links between human rights and 
climate change, explicitly avoiding supporting particular political and legal outcomes. The 
World Bank was also considering the &#8220;value-added&#8221; of a human rights perspective in the 
context of its work on climate change, focusing on most vulnerable people, on critical 
thresholds, and on procedural standards. 
</p>
<p>34. Ms. Mohamed-Katerere, an independent expert on human rights and environmental 
law and policy, spoke of the value of a human rights approach to governance for 
strengthening resilience, defined as the ability of communities and individuals to respond to 
the challenges of climate change and to maintain essential levels of well-being. Recognizing 
and strengthening human rights in governance helped level the playing field and ensure 
more equitable outcomes, which was consistent with the right to development. Human 
rights provided a benchmark for making choices and encouraging equity and non-
discrimination in outcomes, including in the distribution of costs and benefits. For example, 
at the national level the human rights-based approach provided a method for weighing 
climate mitigation and adaptation choices against impacts on the right to food, life and to a 
clean, healthy environment. Further, human rights thinking helped clarify rights, roles and 
responsibilities by distinguishing between (a) rights holders and stakeholders, and 
(b) beneficiaries and facilitators; and it enhanced the legitimacy and sustainability of 
choices and decisions, by increasing local support for globally agreed measures. 
Incorporating human rights strengthened coherence between different levels and sectors by 
emphasizing cooperation based on fundamental principles and encouraging long-term 
perspectives, and made vulnerabilities visible by disaggregating data which helped to 
reduce the likelihood of rights derogations.  
</p>
<p>35. Ms. Mohamed-Katerere suggested that establishing an effective climate governance 
regime required incorporating human rights into institutional and governance arrangements 
for financing, mitigation, adaptation, capacity-building and technology transfer. Where 
governance was weak or ambiguous, international human rights law provided binding 
obligations that ensured that decisions were made in ways that supported and did not 
adversely affect vulnerable or marginalized communities. Human rights governance 
approaches should be adopted currently in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change negotiations, in other multilateral and bilateral agreements, as well as in 
future agreements and actions. In particular, measures to strengthen the voice of the most 
vulnerable should be taken, by building collaborative networks for adaptation and disaster 
risk management; establishing windows for their genuine and effective engagement in the 
development and implementation of policies that affect them; decentralizing policy 
determination; strengthening opportunities for participation of indigenous peoples, forest-
dependent communities, and other communities whose rights are affected by climate 
change. 
</p>
<p>36. Ms. Mohamed-Katerere deemed that establishing a system for allocating both 
benefits and costs was important to strengthen mitigation and adaptation. Such a system 
should be based on the principles of equity and fairness, including paying attention to the 
common but differentiated obligations of actors at global and national levels. Further, </p>


<p>strengthening and extending free, prior and informed consent to all whose rights are 
adversely affected should be considered. Human rights derogations should be avoided by 
establishing a rigorous safeguard system that goes beyond &#8220;do not harm&#8221;. Establishing 
systems for preventing and resolving conflicts over access, use and ownership, and the 
distribution of costs and benefits arising from climate change, mitigation and adaptation 
actions was important for long-term sustainability. 
</p>
<p>37. In the ensuing interactive debate, representatives of the International Environment 
Forum, World Vision International, International Movement ATD Fourth World, Nord-Sud 
XXI and Ms. Puvimanasinghe took the floor. The Social Forum should look not only at the 
human rights of those affected by climate change, but also the physical, financial, social and 
ethical challenges that such massive movements of populations represented for those 
communities receiving the displaced persons. A human rights educational approach was 
deemed essential to ensure respect for the human rights of the migrants. Others highlighted 
the specific plight of children and in particular the impact of climate change on their right to 
health, and the need to reduce vulnerabilities and mainstream child-rights adaptation into 
development programming. It was argued that a human rights approach to climate change 
was not a market-based approach centred on making the environment a commodity. It was 
based on an imperative of action to protect individuals&#8217; and peoples&#8217; fundamental human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>38. In concluding remarks, Mr. Harsdorff noted that both issues of migration and 
children were covered by the task team on social dimensions of climate change, through the 
participation of the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). While pricing the environment might not be the perfect 
solution, it was still a solution and should not be disregarded because it was a market-based 
approach. Mr. Newfarmer noted the World Bank&#8217;s engagement with local stakeholders at 
early stages of project development, and confirmed the overlap and intersection of the 
normative concerns of the human rights community and the development community in 
improving health, livelihoods, eliminating disease, etc. He emphasized that pricing the cost 
of environmental degradation correctly was crucial in order to ensure that polluters paid, as 
was taking such pricing into account in policy framework development and project 
evaluation. There could be a trade-off at the margin between economic growth and the 
environment, and policies must be developed to accommodate that trade-off.  
</p>
<p>39. Ms. Mohamed-Katerere welcomed the focus on migration in the interventions, 
which were indicative of the much larger problem that all actions had costs. The crucial 
issue was how to distribute those costs and what the responsibilities of the various parties 
were, and how to begin a dialogue on the issue between the development and human rights 
communities, and States and citizens. Using human rights was an important tool not only 
for claiming the rights of vulnerable peoples but also for building consensus and 
understanding. Civil society actors should develop ways to build a human rights culture at 
the local level. One participant queried whether a global climate tribunal would be a viable 
legal mechanism to implement human rights obligations related to climate change. There 
was also support for the development of an international climate change tribunal, 
particularly with regard to past and future responsibilities at the global level, while avoiding 
the risk of a proliferation of tribunals. Regional and local mechanisms, including indigenous 
conflict resolution mechanisms, were also crucial. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Green economy and technology transfer 
</b></p>
<p>40. Baskut Tuncak, a representative of the Center for International Environmental Law, 
considered that technology transfer offered one solution to the paradox of development, 
climate change and human rights. Noting studies that showed that 80 per cent of clean-
energy patents were owned by six countries, he stressed that there were legal obligations for </p>


<p>the international transfer of technologies to foster sustainable development and avoid human 
rights violations. Certain climate change mitigation technologies, where appropriate, might 
provide a path to low-carbon development; however, the implications of those technologies 
for human rights and the environment, beyond just climate change, must also be considered. 
The human rights implicated by climate change emphasized the need for the international 
transfer of particular technologies for adaptation, such as: technologies of advance warning 
in the case of impending natural disasters and natural disaster prevention/remediation 
technologies (linked to the right to life); building technologies for resistance to extreme 
weather events (linked to the right to adequate housing); water saving, capture, desalination 
and re-use technologies (linked to the right to water); medicines, vaccines, pest-control 
measures, sanitary products and processes including technologies related to potable water 
(linked to the right to health); and integrated, sustainable forest management techniques and 
agricultural practices (linked to availability and accessibility of the right to food). In 
addition, when and where appropriate, genetically modified organisms and pest-control 
measures might also be linked to the right to food. Mr. Tuncak noted that intellectual 
property rights could be a barrier to the transfer of several technologies, in particular with 
relation to technologies related to climate change adaptation, such as medicines and 
genetically modified organisms. The application of a rights-based approach to technology 
transfer in the context of climate change presented many opportunities, including 
prioritizing which technologies should be targeted for development and transfer, based upon 
human rights implications; helping to identify the most pressing barriers that intellectual 
property and other economic legal regimes posed to sustainable development; and helping 
to improve governance, in taking a holistic approach to the effectiveness of interventions for 
the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. 
</p>
<p>41. Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a D&#237;az Batanero, the focal point for the Climate Change Programme of the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), outlined ways in which ITU was promoting 
the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to address climate change, 
for instance by: promoting new standards and regulations aimed at a reduction of energy 
consumption by ICT equipment; encouraging the industry to focus on energy efficiency and 
the use of renewable energy sources; addressing e-waste and recycling; and developing an 
e-environment toolkit to help countries assess the contribution that ICTs can make to reduce 
greenhouse gases. He reported that over 40 organizations worked with ITU to develop a 
methodology for measuring ICT carbon footprints, and a global online community was 
available to exchange best practices in the use of ICTs to promote sustainable development. 
ICTs should be included in national development plans, industrial sectors should be 
encouraged to adopt ICTs to reduce their carbon footprint, and open standards that use 
energy efficiency should be adopted as a key technical factor.  
</p>
<p>42. Representatives of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Algeria, Ecuador and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and of Espace Afrique International, Nord-Sud XXI, 
Earthjustice, and International Movement ATD Fourth World/International Council of 
Women, WaterLex, and Ms. Puvinamasinghe intervened for interactive debate. It was stated 
that clean technologies to address climate change should be in the public domain and not 
subject to intellectual property rights. A change of paradigm to view nature as a global 
system where each part played a role was advocated, and special rapporteurs, in particular 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises should work on those issues. In response to 
questions raised, it was stated that biofuels could be appropriate, depending on the country, 
as they could increase greenhouse gases instead of reducing them and could have an impact 
on the right to food when food crops were used for biofuels. It was commented that the 
flexibilities of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) would allow 
some flexibility with regard to public health but had been eroded by free trade agreements. </p>


<p>Indigenous processes could be encouraged through the access and benefit sharing in the 
current negotiations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
</p>
<p>43. An NGO speaker presented to the Forum a Declaration on &#8220;Climate Change and 
Human Rights&#8221; endorsed by 28 NGOs. The Declaration contained a number of 
recommendations for the Human Rights Council, including the establishment of a new 
special procedure on the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights and the 
presentation of a study on the responsibilities of states. Amongst all human rights, the right 
to development and the principle of international solidarity were highlighted as having 
specific value on the international level on global governance in relation to climate change.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The conclusions and recommendations below emanated from presentations, 
statements and interactive dialogue during the Social Forum.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>Many speakers, while recognizing the complexity and multi-dimensional nature 
of climate change issues, stressed the urgent need to look beyond the ecological and 
economic impacts of climate change, and to focus on the social dimension and human 
rights impact by putting people at the centre of the discussion, thus reinforcing the 
concept of sustainable development.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>Discussions reaffirmed Human Rights Council resolution 10/4, in which the 
Council affirms &#8220;that human rights obligations and commitments have the potential to 
inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate 
change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes&#8221;. A human 
rights approach is needed across the board at all levels. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>While recognizing the primary responsibility of States to promote, fulfil and 
protect human rights, the global all-pervasive challenge of climate change 
undoubtedly requires a global solution, and clearly calls for international assistance 
and cooperation under the principles of international solidarity and of common but 
differentiated responsibilities. The right to development is central in promoting global 
good governance in relation to climate change. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>Concerns were shared about heightened vulnerabilities to the adverse effects of 
climate change, related to geography, poverty, gender, age, disability, and migrant, 
refugee, internally displaced person, indigenous or minority status. The existing 
inequalities among and within countries were also highlighted as was the unequal 
impact of climate change, which affects even more the already disadvantaged 
communities and States.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The gender dimension of the adverse impact of climate change was specifically 
highlighted, in addition to the important positive role women can play in responding to 
these challenges. Empowering women and using a human rights-based approach to 
climate change measures and actions strengthen the response to climate change 
impact.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Similarly, the positive role to be played by indigenous communities in 
responding to climate change challenges was highlighted. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Movement of people, including cross-border movement, should be seen as a 
possible and legitimate adaptation strategy, among other options, if not the only one at </b></p>


<p><b>a certain point, while the legal gap concerning cross-border movements linked to 
environmental factors and climate was recognized, as stressed by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization 
for Migration.  
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>Human rights mechanisms, including the treaty bodies, special procedures and 
the universal periodic review, were highlighted as an essential tool for early warning 
and facilitating the channelling of cooperation, therefore complementing the scientific 
calls to address the challenge of climate change.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The challenges of climate change to development and the threat to reverse the 
gains made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals were 
highlighted, in particular with regard to Goal 1 on the eradication of extreme poverty 
and hunger and Goal 7 on environmental sustainability.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The right to education and the need for access to information, meaningful 
public participation, transparency and accountability were emphasized as a basis for 
the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to a sound environment or 
sustainable development.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The human rights-based approach calls for a focus on sound governance and 
accountability mechanisms, stressing both procedural and substantive rights. 
Accessible, transparent and effective accountability mechanisms should be in place, 
leading to effective remedies. The justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights 
was recalled, as was the fact that responsibility for achieving economic, social and 
cultural rights was not exclusively on the States concerned but also borne by non-State 
actors including the private sector, and other countries and the international 
community. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Transfer of technology, increased use of information and communication 
technologies, sharing and managing of knowledge, lessons learned and good practices, 
capacity-building and financial support can and must play a crucial role in addressing 
climate change, while promoting sustainable development and the achievement of 
human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The current market approach to finding solutions to climate change was viewed 
as not wholly appropriate or fair, especially towards the countries or communities that 
are dealing already with the negative impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, with the 
appropriate safeguards, &#8220;green economy&#8221; instruments could be a potential tool to 
make economic actors aware of the environmental impact of their activities and of the 
services provided by the ecosystems with a view to ensuring better social returns and 
ecological benefits. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Some concerns were expressed with regard to market-based mechanisms for 
climate change, such as the REDD+ mechanism, which could be seen as a 
commoditization of forests, ineffective in preserving global forest stocks (as it would 
likely apply to only half of current forests) and lacking the effective involvement of 
indigenous peoples and local communities in REDD+ development.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>There was a call for a national and global system allocating benefits and costs, 
ensuring that polluters pay and ensuring equity and non-discrimination. </b></p>


<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The 2010 Social Forum recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Human Rights Council establish a new mechanism, which could 
take the form of a special rapporteur or independent expert, dedicated to human 
rights and climate change. The mandate of this mechanism should include addressing 
the human rights aspects of climate change and elaborating a study on the 
responsibilities of States, and other actors, in the area of climate change adaptation, 
mitigation, technology transfer, technical cooperation and funding, vis-&#224;-vis the 
urgent need for adaptation and commitments with sustainable development, bearing 
in mind the negative impacts of climate change on different human rights and its 
amplification in the case of vulnerable groups, including the reality of persons 
displaced as a result of climate change. It could lead to a non-binding instrument of 
guiding principles for human rights and climate change; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Human Rights Council continue holding an annual discussion with 
the view to tracking the rapidly evolving impacts of climate change on human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The sixteenth Conference of the Parties in Cancun be informed of the 
deliberations of the 2010 Social Forum with the view to: ensuring that the agreed 
outcome texts are consistent with the obligations contained in international human 
rights instruments; integrating social dimension, a gender perspective and the human 
rights-based approach in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
negotiations; respecting intergenerational equity, and addressing extraterritorial State 
obligations; ensuring that safeguards and measures are put in place to avoid side 
effects, such as trade protectionism; and ensuring that specific attention is paid to the 
situation of mountainous countries, small island States and other countries which are 
particularly exposed to the impact of climate change;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Climate change be taken into account in the elaboration of the draft 
guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, and also in other human 
rights reports, such as those on water, food, health, housing or development.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Governments involve local communities and organizations, including 
meaningful participation of vulnerable groups, in developing objectives, policies and 
strategies for the upcoming Cancun and following negotiations, as well as for ensuring 
the success of longer-term strategies. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The situation of persons displaced as a result of climate change be 
addressed, and that national Governments in disaster-prone countries invest in 
disaster risk reduction planning, mechanisms and procedures, as well as in other 
adaptation measures in the face of the already present negative impacts of climate 
change, and that the members of the international community increase their efforts in 
responding to international disasters and in investing in preparedness, adaptation and 
mitigation through sustainable development options, which may imply the transfer of 
best available technologies. The gaps in the legal protection of those displaced across 
borders should be addressed, including through international law related to refugees. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) REDD and REDD+ programmes adopt a more rights-based approach, 
create legal awareness programmes along with other support programmes for 
indigenous peoples that may be affected by REDD programmes, and improve 
participatory and access-to-justice provisions. These programmes on avoiding 
deforestation need to be complemented with broader sustainable development 
programmes all over the world; </b></p>


<p><b> (h) A human rights-based approach be applied to intellectual property and 
technology transfer in order to facilitate adaptation and even mitigation efforts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) A mechanism be put in place for measuring performance on climate 
change, which should include human rights indicators, in order to create awareness 
and promote sustainable development options. </b></p>
