Eighteenth session 
</b>Agenda item 3 
<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil,

</b></p>
<p><b>  Annual report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for children and armed conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy</b>*, **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Summary</i> 
 In the present report, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
children and armed conflict presents her activities undertaken in discharging her mandate, 
including information on her field visits and on the progress achieved, as well as challenges 
remaining on the children and armed conflict agenda. The report covers the period from 
May 2010 to May 2011. 
 In the report, the Special Representative highlights how children continue to be 
disproportionately affected by armed conflict and to have their basic rights violated. She 
sheds light on the growing trend of attacks on schools and hospitals, which increasingly 
deprives children in situations of armed conflict of education and access to health care. She 
also discusses the complex issue of accountability of children involved in armed conflict 
and children&#8217;s access to justice, by examining how the current system enables child 
witnesses and victims to give evidence against perpetrators. 
 The Special Representative acknowledges the progress made since the previous 
reporting period, especially with regard to the ratification of the Optional Protocol on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict and the signing of action plans to release children 
from armed groups. She nevertheless emphasizes the remaining challenges in addressing 
grave violations against children, such as the limited progress in the development of plans 
of action for the release of children in some countries and the continued impunity of 
violating parties. 
 Lastly, the Special Representative outlines a series of recommendations addressed to 
States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States that are under review of 
the Human Rights Council universal periodic review mechanism, the Human Rights 
Council and Member States to further the protection of children&#8217;s rights and to alleviate the 
suffering of children in armed conflict.

<p>GE.11-15092 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, covering the period from May 2010 to May 2011, is submitted 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51/77 and other subsequent resolutions of the 
Assembly on the rights of the child, including its most recent resolution 65/197, in which 
the Assembly requested the Special Representative for children and armed conflict to 
continue to submit a report to the Human Rights Council on the activities undertaken in 
discharging her mandate, including information on her field visits and on the progress 
achieved, and challenges remaining on the children and armed conflict agenda. 
</p>
<p>2. Children continue to be disproportionately affected by armed conflict and to have 
their basic rights violated. They continue to be forcefully recruited, killed and maimed, 
abducted, subjected to sexual violence and are denied humanitarian aid. They are deprived 
of education, health care and access to justice. The changing nature of armed conflict has 
created new dilemmas for the protection of children. Not only have children become the 
primary targets of armed actors and are increasingly used for intelligence purposes and as 
human shields, they are also directly affected by targeted attacks on schools and hospitals 
during armed conflict. Of the total number of primary school age children in the world who 
do are not enrolled in school, 42 per cent &#8212; 28 million children &#8212; live in poor countries 
affected by conflict.1 
</p>
<p>3.  There has been continued progress on the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, 
which has been ratified by 141 countries. Nevertheless, the international community must 
continue to fight against the impunity of violating parties in order to alleviate the suffering 
of children in armed conflict. The Human Rights Council is an important partner 
contributing to efforts to ensure the application of international norms and standards that 
protect children&#8217;s rights. It should continue to make the defence of the rights of children 
affected by armed conflict a key priority. 
</p>
<p>4.  The Special Representative welcomes the adoption by the Human Rights Council of 
its resolution 16/12 on the protection and promotion of children working and/or living on 
the street. The Special Representative especially appreciates the call on States to take 
appropriate measures to protect children affected by armed conflict in order to reduce the 
risk of children resorting to working and/or living on the street. Children in conflict-
affected countries in particular end up living on the street as they are often orphaned, 
internally displaced and stigmatized when they have been recruited and used by armed 
actors. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Representative also wishes to express her appreciation for the invitation 
to attend the annual meeting of special rapporteurs, representatives, independent experts 
and chairpersons of working groups on 27 June 2011, and hopes to maintain a close 
relationship with the special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Working with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Office of the Special Representative is collaborating closely with the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with a view to 
mainstreaming child rights issues relating to armed conflict into the work of human rights 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>mechanisms, including the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council, the 
treaty bodies and the special procedures. In the same vein, recommendations relating to 
children and armed conflict by United Nations human rights mechanisms are important 
advocacy tools in the work of the Special Representative. 
</p>
<p>7. The field presences of OHCHR and its deployment of human rights monitors to 
peacekeeping operations and country missions also continue to make an important 
contribution to the monitoring and reporting of grave violations against children during 
armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Representative attaches great importance to the reporting process to the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child on the implementation of the Optional Protocol on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict. During the period under review, the Office 
of the Special Representative provided information relevant to the issue of children and 
armed conflict to the Committee on the implementation of the Optional Protocol. In 
particular, the Office provided information on the issue of children and armed conflict 
ahead of the Committee&#8217;s country reviews for Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka 
and the Sudan. Such information included key recommendations by the Secretary-General 
and the Working Group of the Security Council on Children and Armed Conflict. The 
Office is pleased that its concerns were reflected in the Committee&#8217;s concluding 
observations and intends to use the relevant observations of the Committee for its advocacy 
purposes. The Office will continue to support the work of the Committee and, in this 
regard, encourages State parties to the Convention to implement the recommendations of 
the Committee and to submit timely reports under the Optional Protocol to the Committee. 
</p>
<p>9. The Office of the Special Representative has also submitted inputs to the universal 
periodic review on Iraq, Myanmar, Nepal, Somalia and the Sudan, and intends to submit 
information on Thailand for consideration by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review during its upcoming sessions. The Special Representative is very pleased that the 
reviews of these countries by States included recommendations relating to children affected 
by armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Representative reiterates the recommendation made in her previous 
report (A/HRC/15/58), in which she encouraged the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review to take into account the concluding observations made by the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child on reports submitted by State parties when reviewing a State 
submission under the universal period review process. State parties are encouraged to 
prioritize the implementation of relevant recommendations of the Working Group, with the 
assistance of the international community as needed. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Representative reiterates her call to all special procedures mandate 
holders to continue to take into account during their missions the challenges faced by 
children, as well as in their reports and recommendations, insofar as they are relevant to 
their respective mandates, and to bring those concerns to her attention. The Special 
Representative is particularly encouraged by the work of the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education and his proactive advocacy for education for children in conflict-affected 
countries. The Special Representative also wishes to thank the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons for his contribution to a working paper by the 
Office of the Special Representative on the rights and guarantees of children displaced by 
armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, when considering or adopting resolutions on country-specific 
situations or thematic issues, the Human Rights Council is encouraged to include 
recommendations therein on or references to protection of children affected by armed 
conflict. A number of Council resolutions during the period under review made such </p>


<p>GE.11-15092 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>references, including resolution 16/24, on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and, 
resolution 15/28 on the assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Progress and challenges in addressing grave violations 
against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>13. Since the previous report of the Special Representative submitted to the Human 
Rights Council, the child protection commitments made by the Government of Nepal and 
the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the 
Philippines, the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army have been translated into concrete actions 
by these parties. New action plans to cease recruitment and use of children as well as to 
secure their release were signed by the United Nations and the Sudan Liberation 
Army/SLA-Free Will on 14 June 2010; the Sudan Liberation army/SLA-Mother Wing 
(Abu Gasim) on 15 August 2010; and the Government of Afghanistan on 30 January 2011, 
respectively. 
</p>
<p>14. In addition, in November 2010, during the visit of the Special Representative, the 
Transitional Federal Government in Somalia committed to work towards an action plan to 
release girls and boys within the ranks of the Government forces and allied militias. In 
Myanmar, action plan negotiations between the Government and the United Nations to end 
the recruitment and use of children in the Tatmadaw Kyi are ongoing. In the Sudan, a 
memorandum of understanding was signed by the Justice and Equality Movement and the 
United Nations on 21 July 2010, paving the way towards the signing of an action plan. On 
22 December 2010, JEM/Peace Wing submitted a draft action plan to the United Nations, 
to be implemented in West Darfur. In Chad, some 1,000 children were released by 12 
armed opposition groups during the reporting period. In April 2011, the Government of 
Chad prepared an action plan to address the recruitment and use of children by the Arm&#233;e 
nationale tchadienne, which is ready for signature with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>15. Since the previous report of the Special Representative, close to 10,000 children 
associated with armed groups have been released as a result of efforts on the ground, 
including agreements on actions plans for the release of children signed by the United 
Nations and parties to conflict. 
</p>
<p>16. Despite the progress made, however, significant challenges in addressing grave 
violations against children remain. In several countries, such as in the Central African 
Republic, Somalia and the Sudan, access constraints for security reasons hamper the 
systematic monitoring and reporting of grave violations. In addition, information gathering 
is challenged by underreporting of grave violations, particularly in the case of sexual 
violence. 
</p>
<p>17. Dialogue between the United Nations and non-State armed groups for the 
development of action plans has been delayed in some cases for a variety of reasons, 
including lack of access to armed groups and of political will, fragmentation within armed 
groups or the inability to identify and hold groups accountable for violations committed. 
Countries affected by these constraints include Afghanistan, Colombia, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the Philippines, Somalia, the Sudan and Yemen. 
</p>
<p>18. In some cases, such as in the Sudan and the Philippines, the implementation of 
action plans has been delayed owing to lack of funding. In places such as the Central 
African Republic, the Philippines, Darfur and South Sudan, children are associated with 
armed groups having close links to the local community, which complicates their formal 
release. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.11-15092 
</p>
<p>19. The reintegration of children formerly associated with armed forces and groups 
continues to be hampered by the lack of economic opportunities in already poor regions and 
insufficient long-term funding, such as is the Philippines. In many countries, ongoing 
fighting and insecurity make children vulnerable to re-recruitment and limit the access of 
actors delivering reintegration support. Inadequate sequencing between the implementation 
of an action plan on the one hand, and the rate of funding for reintegration of children on 
the other, may lead to instances where reintegration programmes are not able to absorb the 
caseload created by the successful implementation of an action plan. The establishment of 
regional coordination mechanisms to respond to reunification and reintegration of children 
abducted across borders, in particular by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army, presents an 
additional challenge. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to attacks on schools and hospitals, limited knowledge of international 
humanitarian law by parties to conflict, insufficient implementation of the law&#8217;s provisions 
and limited insight into the different country contexts in which violations occur still hamper 
the design of clear strategies to address such violations. The case of the military use of 
schools exemplifies the complexity of the issue; although strictly speaking not a violation 
of international humanitarian law, the military occupation of schools clearly impedes 
children&#8217;s access to education and puts them at risk. Further complicating the issue are 
cases where the military provide security to a school at the school&#8217;s request, and there is 
collocation between children and military in the same school, or even partial occupation. 
</p>
<p>21. An emerging concern is the detention of children for alleged association with armed 
groups or other threats to security in several conflict scenarios. An unknown number of 
children have been captured, arrested and detained by security and law enforcement forces 
in contravention of international standards for juvenile justice. Children&#8217;s access to justice 
in conflict and post-conflict settings is hampered by the fact that the infrastructure of 
judicial systems is often inadequate or non-existent. Targeted measures by the Security 
Council and the establishment of the International Criminal Court are steps towards 
mitigating the impunity of perpetrators of grave child rights violations; they cannot, 
however, replace the delivery of national justice. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Children and justice during and in the aftermath of armed 
conflict: bringing conceptual clarity 
</b></p>
<p>22. In contemporary armed conflicts, children are increasingly the subject of targeted 
attacks, sexual violence and military recruitment. Many are forced to witness or even to 
take part in horrifying acts of violence. As a result, it is often difficult to assess whether a 
child is a victim or a perpetrator; depending on the child&#8217;s age and maturity and the forced 
nature of involvement, it may be both. Hence, in the search for justice for serious violations 
committed during armed conflict, children are often involved in justice processes in two 
different and opposite ways: on the one hand, children who have suffered grave violations 
seek justice for the violations of their rights; on the other, children having been forced by 
adults to perpetrate heinous crimes are being held accountable for their acts. 
</p>
<p><b> A. What is &#8220;justice&#8221; for children? 
</b>23.  The ability of children to have access to justice is seen as a vital part of the mandate 
of the United Nations to reduce poverty and fulfil children&#8217;s rights. A clear definition of 
what constitutes &#8220;access to justice&#8221; cannot be found in international instruments. According </p>


<p>GE.11-15092 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>to the United Nations Development Programme, access to justice can be defined as &#8220;the 
ability of people to seek and obtain a remedy through formal or informal institutions of 
justice, and in conformity with human rights standards&#8221;.2 The Common Approach to Justice 
for Children, as explained by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund in 2008, expands on this 
definition:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Access to justice can be defined as the ability to obtain a just and timely remedy for 
violations of rights as put forth in national and international norms and standards [...] 
Proper access to justice requires legal empowerment of all children: all should be 
enabled to claim their rights, through legal and other services such as child rights 
education or advice and support from knowledgeable adults.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>24. Reports and research undertaken with children who are victims of armed conflict all 
find that child victims want perpetrators of grave violations to be held accountable, 
particularly when they continue to live in the same community. For children, however, 
justice includes far more than punishing a perpetrator. Even more important to them is the 
restoration of their rights, especially their socioeconomic rights, and concrete acts of 
compensation and reparation to address the loss of those rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Children as victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p>25. Access to justice for victims and witnesses in conflict and post-conflict situations is 
achieved through judicial and non-judicial justice mechanisms. International crimes are 
generally punishable in national courts, but in many countries where there has been armed 
conflict, the infrastructure of the judicial system is often either virtually non-existent or 
inadequate. Recognizing this, and in order to put an end to a culture of impunity, the 
international community has over the past 20 years set up new accountability mechanisms, 
such as ad hoc tribunals, hybrid courts, human rights panels and truth and reconciliation 
commissions. Children are increasingly playing a role in these mechanisms, as victims and, 
in some cases, as witnesses. 
</p>
<p>26. With the establishment of the International Criminal Court, it is likely that more 
children will participate as witnesses in legal proceedings against the violators of their 
rights. The Rome Statute establishing the Court requires that it &#8220;take appropriate measures 
to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims 
and witnesses&#8221;, and &#8220;have regard to all relevant factors, including age, gender [...] and 
health, and the nature of the crime, in particular, but not limited to, where the crime 
involves sexual or gender-based violence against children.&#8221; Victims and witnesses units in 
charge of short- and long-term protective measures and security arrangements, as well as 
medical and psychological support, have become an established practice in international 
and national courts. Special protection measures can be requested to assist a child giving 
evidence. However, it is not always in the best interest of child witnesses of serious 
violations of human rights or international humanitarian law to give evidence in a court. In 
some cases, it may result in grave psychological trauma and illness or renewal of despair, 
depression or even suicidal tendencies. 
</p>
<p>27. For a range of reasons, only a small proportion of children who have suffered harm 
in armed conflict are likely to be called as witnesses in trials heard by the International 
Criminal Court. For many children, non-judicial mechanisms may provide a better 
opportunity to have their voices heard and to have the wrongs done to them recorded. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 United Nations Development Programme, <i>Programming for Justice: Access For All, A practitioner&#8217;s 
</i></p>
<p><i>guide to a human rights-based approach to access to justice </i>(Bangkok, 2005). </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.11-15092 
</p>
<p>general view is that non-judicial mechanisms can provide more immediate accountability, 
enable community reconciliation, provide reparation for losses and damages, and allow 
children to move on with their lives. Nevertheless, there are significant challenges to the 
effective participation of children, such as the limits and focus of the mandate, the financial 
and human resources available, the expectations raised and disappointment with outcomes, 
and the need to secure long-term political support. 
</p>
<p>28. In some countries, traditional justice mechanisms are commonly used to resolve 
disputes and feuds between families and clans and to bring about settlement and 
reconciliation. For many children in these countries, traditional justice may be the only 
readily accessible form of justice, meaningful to their families and communities. As with all 
other forms of justice, however, there are limitations, particularly in the aftermath of armed 
conflict. Traditional justice relies on oral tradition and customary practice, which can be 
lost as a result of displacement, dissipation of collective memory and loss of traditional 
authority in times of breakdown of social structures. In addition, traditional authority often 
resides with the elder males of the community. This patriarchal structure does not always 
take into account or reflect children&#8217;s rights, and especially the rights of girls and their need 
for protection. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability of children involved in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>29. Although the general view is that children who are associated with an armed force or 
armed group should not be prosecuted but rather be treated primarily as victims, some 
children may, nevertheless, be detained and face prosecution before a national court. When 
determining whether to prosecute children, States should take into account the Principles 
and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Groups, which stipulate that the 
purpose of any sanction imposed on a child accused of international crimes committed 
during association with armed groups should be to promote the child&#8217;s rehabilitation and 
reintegration into the community, not to punish it. Prosecution of children for crimes arising 
from active participation in hostilities in a criminal court should be a matter of last resort. 
</p>
<p>30. Placing children in detention without access to the important procedural safeguards 
and guarantees to which they are entitled in international human rights law can expose 
children to human rights abuses. The international framework on juvenile justice provides a 
very detailed set of standards that are applicable to children who are deprived of their 
liberty. According to article 37(c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, every child 
deprived of liberty should be treated with humanity and respect for inherent dignity of the 
human person and in a manner that takes into account the needs of persons of his or her 
age. All disciplinary measures involving cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, including 
corporal punishment, placement in a dark cell, closed or solitary confinement or any other 
punishment that may compromise the physical or mental health of the child, are strictly 
prohibited. In addition, children should always be kept separately from adult prisoners, and 
detention should last for the shortest period possible. 
</p>
<p>31. In a number of countries, truth and reconciliation commissions have been put in 
place as an alternative to prosecution and judicial trial for children accused of committing 
international crimes. Any such commission needs to take into consideration the prevailing 
view that child soldiers should be regarded primarily as victims rather than as perpetrators, 
and that the child&#8217;s best interests should be the primary concern. This does not mean that 
atrocities committed by child soldiers should be ignored or that the truth about their acts 
should not be established. However, commissions operate at their best for children when 
the purpose is to establish the truth rather than to make a finding of guilt or responsibility 
on the part of the child. </p>


<p>GE.11-15092 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>32. Reintegration is a key post-conflict process for children formerly associated with 
armed groups or armed forces. Its objective is to contribute to security and stability in post-
conflict environments so that recovery and development can begin. It is regarded as a more 
child-friendly mechanism for addressing children&#8217;s participation in hostilities than 
prosecution. The process of reintegration and the approach taken are necessarily different 
for children and adults. It has been suggested that child disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration measures should target the entire community rather than just former 
combatants. Mixing different categories of children may actually be beneficial to their 
social reintegration, and difficulties or tensions between groups of children may be 
overcome. 
</p>
<p>33. Traditional justice, aimed at the reintegration of child soldiers, can make a 
significant contribution to healing, recovery and reintegration. It may employ an array of 
measures, such as punishment, reparation, truth-telling, involving confession and 
absolution, and healing or cleansing ceremonies. Traditional justice can be most helpful in 
assisting reintegration where it focuses on re-establishing the child as a member of the 
community rather than relying upon punishment or public shaming. Restorative justice is 
very often the only way of bringing reconciliation to victims and perpetrators alike in a 
war-torn society where victims of offences suffer, as do child perpetrators, having been 
forced to commit offences. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Attacks on schools and hospitals: an emerging concern 
</b></p>
<p>34. Attacks on schools and hospitals in armed conflict are widespread and are of 
increasing concern. Out of 22 country situations reported in the annual report of the 
Secretary-General on children and armed conflict (A/65/820-S/2011/250), 15 referred to 
attacks on schools and hospitals. Apart from the direct and physical damage to schools and 
hospitals, incidents of closure of schools and hospitals as a result of threats and 
intimidation, as well as the military use of these civilian institutions, have been 
documented. In addition, schools are often used as recruiting grounds for children. 
</p>
<p>35. Armed conflict can either directly or indirectly result in the forced closure or the 
compromised functioning of civilian facilities. Children, teachers and health-care providers 
can be subject to direct threats and acts of intimidation by parties, which, for example, 
target Government institutions or medical personnel assisting the other party to the conflict. 
In other situations, armed elements are opposed to secular and/or girls&#8217; education, or to 
girls being seen by male medical personnel. The delivery of health-care services to children 
is also heavily affected by lack of supplies and manpower caused by looting of the facilities 
and/or access constraints. A general climate of fear and insecurity as a result of armed 
hostilities can also prevent children, teachers and medical personnel from attending school 
or seeking medical help. Parents, for example, may find it too risky to send their children to 
school in a volatile security situation, or children may be denied timely access to hospitals 
because of checkpoints and roadblocks. 
</p>
<p>36. Military control and use of school facilities also endangers children. The Office of 
the Special Representative will advocate with parties, urging them to take all precautionary 
measures not to endanger the life of civilians and civilian objects in the vicinity of military 
objectives. Extreme caution should also be exercised in identifying objects normally 
dedicated to civilian purposes as military targets. In armed conflict situations, the use of 
schools as polling stations may put the physical integrity of such facilities at risk, as some 
armed groups see these civilian institutions as legitimate targets of attack. The Office of the 
Special Representative will further continue to advocate with Governments for the adoption 
of precautionary measures that avoid jeopardizing school facilities. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.11-15092 
</p>
<p>37. The abduction of educational and medical personnel is also of grave concern to the 
children and armed conflict agenda, as it severely affects the provision of basic services to 
children. The Office of the Special Representative is concerned at the use of schools as 
recruiting grounds for children with the aim of involving them in armed hostilities and 
military operations. Schools should be considered safe havens protecting children from 
involvement in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Field visits by the Special Representative 
</b>38. During the period under review, the Special Representative carried out field 
missions to Somalia (November 2010), Afghanistan (January 2011) and the Philippines 
(April 2011). The purpose of these visits was to secure and facilitate the implementation of 
child protection commitments on the ground, to foster more effective coordination among 
key stakeholders, and to follow up on the recommendations of the Secretary-General3 and 
the key provisions of Security Council resolutions 1612 (2005) and 1882 (2009). 
39. The main commitments received from Governments and other parties to the conflict 
during these missions are highlighted below. It is crucial for the protection of children that 
the Human Rights Council and the broader international and human rights community 
continue to collectively monitor follow-up actions and encourage parties to honour their 
commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Representative visited Somalia from 1 to 5 November 2010 to obtain a 
commitment by the Transitional Federal Government to cease recruitment and use of 
children and to take the steps necessary to develop a national legislative framework for the 
protection of children. The Special Representative also discussed with the Government the 
need to protect civilians, including children, from death and injury during military 
operations by means of strict adherence to the principles of distinction and proportionality. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Representative also raised her concerns at the killing and maiming of 
civilians, including children, with the Force Commander of the African Union Mission in 
Somalia (AMISOM), and obtained his commitment that AMISOM would adhere to their 
rules of engagement for the protection of civilians during military operations. 
</p>
<p>42. In December 2010, Prime Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed appointed State 
Minister Zahra Ali Samantar as focal point for child protection and human rights. The focal 
point will work with the United Nations towards the timely development and 
implementation of a comprehensive time-bound action plan to stop and prevent the 
recruitment and use of children. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Representative travelled to Afghanistan from 27 January to 2 February 
2011 to witness the signing, on 30 January, of an action plan for the prevention of under-
age recruitment into the Afghan National Security Forces by the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, Zalmai Rassoul, and the Special Representative for Afghanistan. In the action plan, 
the Government of Afghanistan pledged to prevent under-age recruitment into the Afghan

</b></p>
<p>National Army, the Afghan National Police, including the Afghan Local Police, and the 
National Directorate of Security. 
</p>
<p>44. In addition, the Government pledged to address issues of sexual violence against 
children by its security forces and of killing and maiming in contravention of international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Representative also met with high-level stakeholders and obtained 
commitments from the <i>Ulema Shura</i> (council of clerics), the High Peace Council, the 
International Security Assistance Force, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, donors and 
human rights actors to redouble their efforts to support the action plan. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>46. During her visit to the Philippines from 2 to 9 April 2011, the Special 
Representative met with high-level representatives of the Government Peace Panel of the 
National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP-NPA) to support the negotiation and 
development of an action plan with NDFP-NPA on the recruitment and use of children 
within its ranks. The NDFP representatives agreed to continue the talks and to start 
negotiations on the provisions of an action plan. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Representative also followed up on the implementation of the action 
plan signed in August 2009 by the United Nations and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 
and advocated for better compliance measures and further commitment of the international 
community for the successful completion of the action plan. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Representative also met with high-ranking officials of the Armed Forces 
of the Philippines to deepen ongoing dialogue and to address issues relating to children 
affected by armed conflict, as well as to advocate for the implementation of the specific 
recommendations of the Secretary-General and the Working Group of the Security Council 
on Children and Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Towards universal ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Representative continues to mobilize support for the signing and 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict. The Special Representative held bilateral 
meetings with the majority of Member States that had not ratified the treaty and briefed 
several regional organizations on the matter. The Office provided technical guidance to 
Member States to facilitate the ratification process during a seminar on international treaty 
law and practice organized by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. The 
Office also created an online social networking presence of the campaign and conducted 
media outreach to promote broader awareness, information and support. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Representative would like to reiterate her call upon States to establish 
18 years as the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces when 
depositing their binding declaration (under article 3) upon ratification of the Optional 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>51. There has been important progress since the launch of the two-year global campaign 
on ratification, &#8220;Zero Under 18&#8221;, in May 2010. Three Member States signed (the Central 
African Republic, Ethiopia and Iran (Islamic Republic of),); five ratified (Cyprus, Djibouti, </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.11-15092 
</p>
<p>Gabon, Malawi and Seychelles); and four acceded to the Optional Protocol (the Congo, 
Georgia, Guyana and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). To date, the Optional Protocol has 
been ratified by 141 States; 21 countries have signed but not ratified, while 30 countries 
have neither signed nor ratified. 
</p>
<p>52. In order to accelerate the pace of ratification by the 51 remaining Member States, the 
Office of the Special Representative together with United Nations partners held a forum in 
New York on the occasion of the first anniversary of the campaign in May 2011. Moreover, 
the Office will organize a treaty-signing event during the high-level segment of the sixty-
sixth session of the General Assembly, in September 2011, where Member States will be 
able to demonstrate their commitment by signing, ratifying or acceding to the treaty. 
</p>
<p>53. Given the resource implications and reporting requirements that ratification and 
implementation entail, the Special Representative would like to encourage leadership by 
one or more countries that have already ratified the Optional Protocol to provide guidance 
and other forms of assistance to those willing to ratify. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>54. <b>The Special Representative expresses her appreciation for the strengthened 
collaboration between her Office and the United Nations human rights system, and 
reiterates her continued support, including through regular information-sharing and 
advocating for the protection of children affected by armed conflict. The Special 
Representative wishes to reiterate that, unless all parties to conflict adhere to their 
commitments, comply with their international obligations and are held accountable 
for non-compliance, there will be no improvement in the situation of children in 
armed conflict. To this end, the Special Representative makes the recommendations 
below. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Special Representative encourages State parties to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child to strengthen national and international measures for the 
prevention of recruitment of children into the armed forces or armed groups and their 
use in hostilities. In particular, those measures include signing and ratifying the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
and enacting legislation that explicitly prohibits and criminalizes the recruitment of 
children into armed forces or groups and their use in hostilities; exercising 
extraterritorial jurisdiction in order to strengthen the international protection of 
children against recruitment; establishing mechanisms to identify children, including 
asylum-seeking and refugee children, who have been or may have been recruited or 
used in hostilities; providing such children with the necessary assistance, including 
psychological and psychological rehabilitation and social integration; and prohibiting 
the export of arms to countries where children are recruited or used in hostilities. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>State parties to the Convention and to the Optional Protocol are called upon to 
implement the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and to 
submit timely reports to the Committee under the Optional Protocol. To this end, 
State parties are encouraged to establish effective inter-ministerial coordination 
mechanisms with a view to ensure comprehensive measures to prevent and protect 
children from offences under the Optional Protocol. </b></p>


<p>GE.11-15092 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>States are encouraged to establish 18 years as the minimum age for voluntary 
recruitment into armed forces when depositing their binding declaration upon 
ratification of the Optional Protocol. States that have ratified but not adopted the 
&#8220;straight-18 position&#8221;</b>4<b> are urged to reconsider their declarations and to raise the 
minimum age to 18 years. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>In the light of the fact that ratification and the implementation processes of the 
Optional Protocol place a clear burden on the resources of certain States willing to 
ratify the instrument, leadership by one or more countries that have already ratified is 
encouraged, to provide guidance and other forms of assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>State parties are also encouraged to support the process towards the adoption 
of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a 
communications procedure, which will strengthen the protection of children involved 
in armed conflict. Under the new optional protocol, individuals or groups of 
individuals, including children themselves, who claim to be victims of violations under 
the Convention and its two optional protocols &#8212; on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict and the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography &#8212; 
will be able to submit communications to the Committee for examination. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Representative urges the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To continue to advocate for 18 years as the minimum age for 
recruitment and participation in hostilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To exert international pressure on parties that continue to recruit and 
use children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To monitor and compel adherence by parties to conflict to commitments 
made to protect children, and to hold them accountable for failure to comply with 
international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To address the political, social and economic factors that facilitate the 
recruitment and use of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To respond to the rehabilitation and reintegration needs of former child 
soldiers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>During the universal periodic review process, States are urged to include, as 
appropriate, in their recommendations to the State under review specific references to 
information from the monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave violations 
against children established in accordance with Security Council resolution 1612 
(2005), as well as the country conclusions adopted and recommendations made by the 
Working Group of the Security Council on Children and Armed Conflict, as 
appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 
reports submitted by State parties under the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
should also be taken into consideration by the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review when reviewing a State submissions under the review process. 
</b></p>

<p>4
 See A/HRC/15/58, para. 17. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.11-15092 
</p>
<p>63. <b>States should begin to pay particular attention to the implementation of 
relevant recommendations by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
with the assistance of the international community, wherever it is needed. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Human Rights Council is encouraged, when considering or adopting 
resolutions on country-specific situations or thematic issues, to include therein 
recommendations on, or references to, the protection of children affected by armed 
conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Member States bear a central and immediate political, legal and moral 
responsibility for the protection of children and should comply with international law 
for the protection of children within their territories. They should bring to justice 
individuals responsible for the recruitment and use of children in the armed forces or 
armed groups, and their use in hostilities, in violation of applicable international law. 
They should also take action against other grave violations against children through 
national justice systems, including undertaking appropriate reforms of national 
legislation for the protection of children, in order to bring laws into line with 
international obligations, as well as strengthening child-protection capacity and 
training for the military, the police, and law enforcement and judiciary officials in the 
context of national security sector reform efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Member States should continue to insist that parties listed in the annexes to the 
report of the Secretary-General on the recruitment and use of children, killing and 
maiming of children, and/or rape and other sexual violence against children (see 
annexes I and II),</b>5<b> in contravention of applicable international law, prepare and 
implement concrete time-bound action plans to halt those violations and abuses and to 
take measures against any parties that fail to comply. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Finally, the Special Representative urges all special procedures mandate 
holders to continue to take into account during their missions the challenges faced by 
children, as well as in their reports and recommendations insofar as they pertain to 
their respective mandates, and to bring those concerns to the attention of the Special 
Representative. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Attacks on schools and hospitals 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>In order to ensure the protection of schools and hospitals during armed 
conflict, Member States, the Security Council, the United Nations and civil society are 
encouraged to undertake concerted action, in the form of a global campaign or a 
partnership. In addition, a strategy should be designed and implemented to halt and 
prevent further attacks on schools and hospitals. Creative solutions should also be 
found for complex problems such as the use of schools by the military and as 
recruiting grounds. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Children&#8217;s access to justice 
</b>69. <b>Member States should ensure the participation of children in justice processes, 
whenever grave child rights violations are committed during armed conflict. Children

<p><b>who participate in justice processes should be protected and their best interests should 
be the main concern at all times. The appropriate justice mechanism, whether judicial 
or non-judicial, should be sought. In addition, a child who commits international 
crimes while associated with armed forces or armed groups should be regarded 
primarily as a victim, not as a perpetrator. In the event that a child is held 
accountable, the appropriate form of accountability should be sought. Any decision 
made should take into account the best interest of the child and his or her 
reintegration into society.</b> </p>
