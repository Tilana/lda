<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council decided, in the context of the 
follow-up to the report of the International Independent Fact-Finding Mission (hereinafter 
FFM report),1 &#8220;to establish a committee of independent experts in international 
humanitarian and human rights laws to monitor and assess any domestic, legal or other 
proceedings undertaken by both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side, in the 
light of General Assembly resolution 64/254, including the independence, effectiveness, 
genuineness of these investigations and their conformity with international standards&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 June 2010, the High Commissioner for Human Rights announced the 
appointment of Mr. Christian Tomuschat, Professor Emeritus at Humboldt University 
Berlin, former member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the 
International Law Commission (President in 1992), as Chair of the Committee. The other 
two members were: Judge Mary McGowan Davis, former Justice of the Supreme Court of 
the State of New York and former federal prosecutor, who has advised widely on 
international justice issues, including for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
and the International Criminal Court; and Mr. Param Cumaraswamy, jurist and former 
Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the independence of judges 
and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>3. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
established a secretariat to support the Committee. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its 
resolution 13/9. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate and approach 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Committee interpreted its mandate by reading Human Rights Council resolution 
13/9 in conjunction with General Assembly resolution 64/254, in which the General 
Assembly reiterated its call upon the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side to 
conduct investigations &#8220;that are independent, credible and in conformity with international 
standards into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human 
rights law reported by the [United Nations] Fact-Finding Mission [on the Gaza Conflict], 
towards ensuring accountability and justice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>6. The Committee understood &#8220;domestic, legal or other proceedings&#8221; to refer to 
investigations, disciplinary proceedings and prosecutions undertaken by either military or 
civil justice systems. In accordance with the General Assembly&#8217;s resolution, the 
Committee&#8217;s primary focus was on those proceedings related to the serious violations 
alleged in the FFM report. However, the reference to &#8220;any&#8221; proceedings in the Human 
Rights Council&#8217;s resolution meant that the Committee was not restricted to the allegations 
in the FFM report but could review proceedings pertaining to any incident connected to the 
military operations in Gaza. Additionally, the Committee looked into specific legal issues 
of institutional responsibility and reform processes relating to the legal regime of armed 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/12/48. </p>


<p>conflict in the aftermath of these operations, which Israel codenamed &#8220;Operation Cast 
Lead&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>7. Regarding the temporal scope of the mandate, the Committee considered that any 
proceedings initiated by Israel or the Palestinian side which commenced on or after 18 
December 2008 were relevant to its task. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Committee sought to discharge its mandate by analysing information in the 
public domain and supplementing this information through consultations with stakeholders. 
It relied primarily on the FFM report, the three reports on the Gaza conflict prepared by the 
Government of Israel,2 the report of the Independent Investigation Commission of the 
Palestinian Authority,3 and the reports of the Government Committee and the subsequent 
Independent Legal Committee established by the de facto Gaza authorities in response to 
the recommendations set forth in the FFM report.4<b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Committee also consulted Governments, witnesses and victims, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), a national human rights institution, and experts in 
international law and military justice (see annex I). The Committee held three consultations 
in Geneva on 28-30 June, 11-12 August and 1-3 September 2010, and one in Brussels on 1 
July 2010. They included meetings with civil society organizations and military justice and 
international law experts. The Committee undertook a mission to Amman on 26-30 July 
2010 and another to Gaza on 15-16 August 2010 to meet representatives from Governments 
and NGOs as well as witnesses and victims of the incidents mentioned in the FFM report. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Committee views the relevant government authorities as among the most 
important sources of information about the progress of investigations mandated by the 
General Assembly and so sought their cooperation from the initial stages of its work. On 22 
June 2010, its Chair wrote to the Permanent Representative of the Permanent Observer 
Mission of Palestine, on behalf of the Committee, seeking a meeting and on 30 June 2010 
the Committee met a representative of the Permanent Observer Mission. With the 
assistance of the Permanent Observer Mission, the Committee was able to meet three 
members of the Independent Investigation Commission Established Pursuant to the 
Goldstone Report on 28 July 2010. The Committee met the representative of the Permanent 
Observer Mission again on 12 August 2010 and the Permanent Representative himself on 1 
September 2010. The Committee is grateful to the Palestinian Authority for the cooperation 
extended to it throughout its term.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. To access the fullest information available on investigations undertaken by the 
Palestinian side, the Committee met the Chair of the Government Committee for Follow-up 
</p>
<p>  
 2 &#8220;The operation in Gaza: factual and legal aspects&#8212;27 December 2008 &#8211; 18 January 2009&#8221;, July 2009 
</p>
<p>(hereinafter &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8221;); &#8220;Gaza operation investigations: an update&#8221;, January 2010 
(hereinafter &#8220;January update&#8221;) (A/64/651, annex I); &#8220;Gaza operation investigations: second update&#8221;, 
July 2010 (hereinafter &#8220;Second update&#8221;) (A/64/890, annex I). 
</p>
<p> 3 &#8220;Report of the Palestinian Independent Investigation Commission established pursuant to the 
Goldstone Report&#8221;, August 2010 (A/64/890, annex II). 
</p>
<p> 4 &#8220;Case of applying recommendations of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission report in relation to 
the Israeli aggression against Gaza (December 2008 to January 2009)&#8221; prepared by the Government 
Committee for Follow-up to the Implementation of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission Report 
of the de facto Gaza authorities; &#8220;Report of the Independent Legal Committee to Monitor 
Implementation of the United Nations Fact-Finding Report Recommendation on Gaza Conflict&#8221;, 
presented to the Committee in Gaza on 15 August 2010. </p>


<p>to the Implementation of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission Report in Gaza. In 
addition, it met the three national members of a second investigation committee, the 
Independent Legal Committee to Monitor Implementation of the United Nations Fact-
Finding Report Recommendation on Gaza Conflict, as well as the Prosecutor-General. The 
Committee is grateful for the assistance extended to it while in Gaza.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Committee also sought the cooperation of the Government of Israel. On 22 June 
2010, its Chair wrote to the Permanent Representative of Israel requesting a meeting and 
they met, on 30 June 2010. As the possibility of cooperation between Israel and the 
Committee was left open at that meeting, the Chair wrote again to the Permanent 
Representative on 30 June seeking Israel&#8217;s cooperation, including by providing access to 
Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Chair requested a response 
by 6 July 2010. On 8 July 2010, the Chair wrote to the Permanent Representative inviting 
the Government of Israel to make official submissions to the Committee describing the 
domestic, legal and other proceedings it had undertaken in response to the FFM report. The 
Chair wrote again to the Permanent Representative on 12 July 2010 reiterating his request 
for cooperation and asking for a response to the letter of 30 June by 15 July 2010. The 
Committee did not receive a response. On 3 August 2010, the Chair wrote to the Permanent 
Representative noting the Committee&#8217;s intention to travel to the Gaza Strip through an 
alternative route, given its inability to enter Gaza through Israel. On 5 August 2010, the 
Chair sent a letter to the Permanent Representative requesting a meeting and, on 12 August 
2010, they met to discuss the Committee&#8217;s work. On 24 August 2010, the Chair wrote to 
the Permanent Representative requesting a telephone conference with the Military 
Advocate General to discuss matters related to the Committee&#8217;s mandate. On 31 August 
2010, the Permanent Representative of Israel contacted the Chair to suggest that 
governmental legal representatives might meet the Committee. The Committee spoke with 
the Permanent Representative on 1 September to express its great interest in this possibility. 
The Committee received no further communication from the Permanent Representative and 
in fact never received any official responses to its efforts to reach out to the Government of 
Israel. The Committee deeply regrets the lack of cooperation from the Government of 
Israel. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Committee met many witnesses and victims. In its view, their experience in 
accessing investigatory bodies provides an important perspective on the operation of such 
bodies. Given the restricted time available in the Gaza Strip, the Committee met a 
representative group of victims and witnesses concerning the following incidents: the attack 
on al-Quds hospital; attacks on the houses of Ateya al-Samouni and Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni in 
Zeytoun; the killing of Majda and Rayya Hajaj; the shooting of Amal, Souad, Samar and 
Hajja Souad Abd Rabbo; the shooting of Rouhiyah al-Najjar; the attack on the al-Daya 
family house; the destruction of el-Bader flour mill; the alleged use of Abbas Ahmad 
Ibrahim Halawa and Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami as human shields; and deprivation of 
liberty and ill-treatment in the al-Atatra sandpits.5<b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. Finally, the Committee consulted experts in various fields related to its mandate, 
principally those with knowledge about military justice systems and the international 
standards relevant to investigations during armed conflict. The discussions were informal in 
nature and provided a means for the Committee to deepen its understanding of the legal and 
military issues underlying the mandate and to supplement the available written materials.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. The totality of this information has provided the basis for the Committee&#8217;s efforts to 
implement its mandate &#8220;to assess&#8221; domestic, legal or other proceedings undertaken by 
</p>
<p>  
 5 A/HRC/12/48, paras. 596&#8211;629, 706&#8211;735, 764&#8211;769, 770&#8211;779, 780&#8211;787, 844&#8211;866, 913&#8211;941, 1064&#8211;
</p>
<p>1075, 1076&#8211;1085, 1112&#8211;1126. </p>


<p>Israel and the Palestinian side. The Committee has faced considerable constraints in 
discharging the other part of its mandate, namely &#8220;to monitor&#8221; relevant proceedings. Owing 
to the lack of access to Israel and the West Bank, the Committee was able to visit only the 
Gaza Strip. While in Gaza, the Committee did not receive any detailed information 
substantiating claims that criminal or other proceedings had been initiated by the de facto 
Gaza authorities. 
</p>
<p>16. The Committee has laboured under strict time limitations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Applicable law and standards 
</b></p>
<p>17. The General Assembly called upon Israel and the Palestinian side to conduct 
independent and credible investigations that conform with international standards. The 
Human Rights Council added to these criteria the requirements of effectiveness and 
genuineness. Initially, the Committee must identify the standards by which the Israeli and 
the Palestinian investigations should be evaluated.  
</p>
<p>18. International standards are derived from the duty to investigate under international 
humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL). Because of the 
intensity of the clashes between the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the armed Palestinian 
groups, &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221; in the Gaza Strip constitutes an armed conflict governed by 
IHL. The Committee views this conflict as being of an international character, as do both 
Israel and the Palestinian side.6 Consequently, IHL was applicable to the conduct of 
hostilities in the Gaza Strip. The other violations alleged in the FFM report, such as those in 
the West Bank, did not take place within the context of an armed conflict. They must, 
therefore, be assessed by the yardstick of IHRL. 
</p>
<p>19. IHL imposes the duty to investigate and prosecute grave breaches of all four Geneva 
Conventions on High Contracting Parties.7 The duty to investigate and prosecute 
allegations of war crimes arises also under customary international law.8 Article 146 of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention requires each High Contracting Party &#8220;to search for persons 
alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches and 
bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts.&#8221;9 The article 
requires legal safeguards for the accused in prosecutions, but beyond that, the treaty offers 
little guidance as to the relevant standards an investigation must satisfy. The ICRC 
Commentary provides some direction, specifying that the Parties must actively search for 
and prosecute the accused with speed and that the necessary police action should be taken 
spontaneously and not merely at the request of another State. The Commentary further 
provides that court proceedings should be carried out in a uniform manner and that 
&#8220;nationals, friends, enemies, all should be subject to the same rules of procedure and judged 
by the same courts&#8221;.10

</p>
<p>vol. I, Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, eds. (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 
rule 158. 
</p>
<p> 9 The Committee follows the position of the FFM report that the substantive rules applicable to either 
international or non-international armed conflicts are broadly converging in this area (A/HRC/12/48, 
para. 281).   
</p>

Persons in Time of War</i> (Geneva, ICRC, 1958), pp. 592&#8211;593. </p>


<p>20. In contrast, international human rights law sets out more elaborate standards with 
respect to the duty to investigate. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires &#8220;prompt&#8221; and &#8220;impartial&#8221; 
investigations by competent authorities into allegations of torture (art. 12). The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights does not refer explicitly to a duty to 
investigate; however, the Human Rights Committee has consistently urged States parties to 
undertake full criminal investigations in cases of serious violations of human rights so as to 
bring the perpetrators to justice.11 Despite the Covenant&#8217;s silence on this point, the Human 
Rights Committee has held that a failure to investigate alleged human rights violations, 
such as violations of the right to life and enforced disappearances, itself constitutes a 
violation of the Covenant.12 
</p>
<p>21. The human rights treaties and soft law instruments rely on a range of criteria or 
standards, at times overlapping, to guide investigations. Most of the relevant 
pronouncements stem from the Human Rights Committee. Its jurisprudence runs largely 
parallel to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights. The most common criteria &#8211; referred to in the FFM 
report as &#8220;universal principles&#8221;13 &#8211; are independence, impartiality, thoroughness, 
promptness and effectiveness. In addition, soft law standards specify that investigative 
bodies should have adequate powers to carry out their duties; soft law standards also 
provide direction with respect to collecting and analysing evidence, undertaking autopsies, 
reporting by medical experts, calling and protecting witnesses, involving victims and family 
members, providing budgetary and technical resources, as well as establishing independent 
commissions of inquiry.14 Transparency is also a key element, both as to the manner in 
which the inquiry is conducted and in ensuring there is public scrutiny of the results.15 
Human rights bodies have defined the most common criteria as follows: 
</p>
<p>22. Independence. Both the body undertaking the investigation as well as its members 
should be independent in the sense of being institutionally detached from those implicated 
in the events. For example, those potentially implicated in violations should have no 
supervisory role, whether direct or indirect, over those conducting the investigation.16 
Independence goes beyond institutional independence, however: investigatory bodies and

<p>their members should not be unduly influenced by powerful social groups, such as the 
media, industry or political parties.17 
</p>
<p>23. Impartiality. Impartiality is closely related to independence. While independence 
relates to the establishment and functioning of an investigative body and its members, 
impartiality refers to the question of whether an investigator is or is likely to be biased. The 
Human Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;judges must not harbour preconceptions about 
the matter put before them, and that they must not act in ways that promote the interests of 
one of the parties&#8221;.18 Similar considerations apply to investigators. Indications that 
investigators uncritically adhere to one interpretation of events without bothering to explore 
alternatives, including the version of events advanced by the complainant, or fail to 
acknowledge a lack of evidence to support their interpretation of events, could indicate a 
lack of impartiality.19 
</p>
<p>24. Thoroughness and effectiveness. This standard refers to the completeness and 
comprehensiveness of an investigation. Thorough and effective investigators should: 
undertake necessary autopsies and medical examinations; collect and record all relevant 
evidence; conduct site visits as appropriate; identify, question and take statements from all 
relevant witnesses; question witnesses comprehensively so that the investigation is able to 
establish the cause of the alleged violation and those responsible; and provide conclusions 
based on a comprehensive analysis of all relevant elements.20 The Committee against 
Torture has found that inconsistencies in the results of investigations, as well as a lack of 
qualifications of key experts, such as the doctor undertaking an autopsy, can be evidence of 
a lack of thoroughness.21  
</p>
<p>25. Promptness. As a general rule an investigation should commence and progress with 
reasonable expedition.22 Determining whether an investigation has met this standard of 
reasonableness depends on the specific circumstances of the case. Cases of torture and 
extrajudicial killings &#8211; where medical evidence might disappear &#8211; and enforced 
disappearances &#8211; where an individual&#8217;s life might be in imminent danger &#8211; require 
immediate action. The Committee against Torture suggests that the requirement to 
undertake a prompt investigation means that an investigation should be initiated 
immediately when there is a suspicion of torture or ill-treatment, namely, within hours or 
days.23 It has found delays of 15 months and 10 months between the alleged act and the

investigations, frequent and unexplained adjournments can unacceptably compound 
delay.25  
</p>
<p>26. The Committee must determine what standards are applicable to investigations in 
the present context. Both Israel and the Palestinian side have a duty to investigate alleged 
serious violations of IHL and IHRL. This duty arises as a result of international law and is 
further imposed by General Assembly resolution 64/254. 
</p>
<p>27. As extensively explained in the FFM report,26 all parties to the armed conflict are 
bound by the relevant rules of IHL. Israel is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention and 
is, moreover, bound by the rules of customary international law reflected in the 1907 Hague 
Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Additional Protocol I 
of 1977. Palestine is not a party to any of the relevant international instruments. However, 
in June 1989, the Palestinian Authority submitted a unilateral written undertaking to 
Switzerland, the depositary of the Geneva Conventions, to be bound by the four Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977.27 This declaration 
established a binding commitment under international law.28 Additionally, both the 
Palestinian Authority and the de facto Gaza authorities are subject to the IHL rules of 
customary international law that apply to non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to inquiries into alleged violations of IHRL, Israel has accepted legal 
responsibility to investigate by ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention against Torture. As clarified by the International Court of 
Justice, the Covenant is applicable also to actions by Israel in the occupied Palestinian 
territory.29 The Palestinian Authority has pledged to respect international human rights law 
by several declarations addressed to the international community30 and by enshrining that 
commitment in its Basic Law (arts. 9&#8211;33). Lastly, the de facto Gaza authorities have made a 
series of unilateral declarations of respect for human rights and have acknowledged that the 
Palestinian Basic Law applies to the Gaza Strip.31 
</p>
<p>29. The question remains whether the more elaborate IHRL standards on investigations 
also govern inquiries into violations of IHL. In principle, IHRL continues to apply during 
armed conflict alongside IHL, subject to the possible derogation of certain civil and 
political rights in states of emergency. IHL may prevail as <i>lex specialis</i>.32 There is no

<p>conflict as such between the duty to investigate under IHL and IHRL. Accepting that the 
IHRL standards apply in the current situation of armed conflict, the question arises as to 
how to interpret the more elaborate IHRL standards of investigation in the light of the pre-
eminent position of IHL as the specialized body of law designed for armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>30. The Committee believes that the gap between the expansive standards under IHRL 
and the less defined standards for investigations under IHL is not so significant. Several 
criteria under human rights law can be met within the context of armed conflict. Above all, 
investigators must be impartial, thorough, effective and prompt; otherwise, an investigation 
would be no more than a manoeuvre of artful deceit. Any investigations that meet these 
criteria may be called credible and genuine. Credibility presupposes also that the 
investigating bodies enjoy some measure of independence. The standard of promptness is 
alluded to in the ICRC Commentary, which refers to the duty to search for and prosecute 
the perpetrator with speed. 
</p>
<p>31. It is important to note the growing trend towards requiring comparable standards for 
investigations under IHL and IHRL. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights 
Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, adopted by the General 
Assembly on 16 December 2005 as a set of rules designed to develop the law, state that the 
&#8220;obligation to respect, ensure respect for and implement international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law as provided for under the respective bodies of law, includes, 
inter alia, the duty to: &#8230; (<i>b</i>) Investigate violations effectively, promptly, thoroughly and 
impartially and, where appropriate, take action against those allegedly responsible in 
accordance with domestic and international law&#8221;.33   
</p>
<p>32. Nonetheless, there are constraints during armed conflict that do impede 
investigations. For example, not every death during an armed conflict can be effectively 
investigated. Similarly, the level of transparency expected of human rights investigations is 
not always achievable in situations of armed conflict, particularly as questions of national 
security often arise. The nature of hostilities might obstruct on-site investigations or make 
prompt medical examinations impossible. The conflict might have led to the destruction of 
evidence, and witnesses might be hard to locate or be engaged in conflict elsewhere. When 
the fighting is over, some of these constraints tend to lose their relevance. As summarized 
by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions: &#8220;On a case-
by-case basis a State might utilize less effective measures of investigation in response to 
concrete constraints. For example, when hostile forces control the scene of a shooting, 
conducting an autopsy may prove impossible. Regardless of the circumstances, however, 
investigations must always be conducted as effectively as possible and never be reduced to 
mere formality.&#8221;34 
</p>
<p>33. The purpose and objectives of IHL also affect the legal significance of some IHRL 
standards of investigation beyond the common criteria of independence, impartiality, 
thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness mentioned above. The overriding concern of 
IHRL to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals from the abuse of State power is not 
the primary focus of IHL. The latter seeks first to balance the lawful use of force with the 
protection of individuals. Consequently, some human rights standards, such as the 
involvement of victims in investigations, while desirable, are not requisite for evaluating 
the inquiries into alleged IHL violations. However, the Committee acknowledges that, in

<p>the light of the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations, 
victims&#8217; access to justice is increasingly being accepted as a relevant criterion applicable to 
investigations into alleged war crimes.  
</p>
<p>34. Finally, international humanitarian law and human rights standards do not require 
any specific body to undertake investigations. Military justice systems usually take the lead 
in inquiring into alleged violations of IHL. This is consistent with Additional Protocol I to 
the Geneva Conventions reflecting customary law principles, which places a duty on High 
Contracting Parties to require military commanders &#8220;to prevent and, where necessary, to 
suppress and to report to competent authorities breaches of the Conventions and of this 
Protocol&#8221; as well as &#8220;to initiate disciplinary or penal action against violators&#8221; (art. 87). 
Military investigators have the specialized knowledge of combat conditions and munitions 
that are important to such investigations. However, the use of military courts for 
prosecution of alleged human rights violations has been controversial and has been found to 
lack the independence and impartiality required under IHRL.35 Nonetheless, both military 
and civilian justice systems may properly undertake investigations of incidents occurring in 
armed conflict, the only requirement being that the mechanisms employed conform to the 
various standards discussed above. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Investigations conducted 
</b></p>
<p>35. Israel has issued three reports detailing the proceedings it has undertaken, including 
investigations into some of the allegations raised in the FFM report (see footnote 2 above). 
At the centre of Israel&#8217;s investigation system is the Military Advocate General (MAG). He 
supervises the rule of law in the military, acts as legal adviser to the Chief of Staff and to 
other military authorities in respect of law and justice, and provides legal supervision of 
disciplinary law in the military.36 
</p>
<p>36. The MAG relied on three mechanisms for examining and investigating allegations 
related to the Gaza conflict. The first is the operational debriefing or command 
investigation: an &#8220;inquiry held in the army, in accordance with IDF orders, regarding an 
event which occurred during training or operational activity, or in relation to them&#8221;.37 The 
command investigation forwards its findings to the MAG, who decides whether or not to 
order a criminal investigation. Ordinary command investigations examined 90 allegations, 
including civilian injuries and deaths, and destruction of civilian property. 
</p>
<p>37. Second, the Minister of Defense and the Chief of General Staff may appoint an 
officer or group of officers, often high-ranking, to investigate in confidence high-profile or 
sensitive matters and then submit their findings and recommendations to the MAG. These 
investigations are known as special command investigations. On 20 January 2009, the 
Chief of General Staff ordered five special command investigations headed by Colonels not 
personally related to the incidents. The investigations covered 30 alleged violations of IHL 
grouped as follows: harm to a large number of civilians not directly participating in the 
hostilities; damage to United Nations and international facilities; shooting at medical 
facilities, buildings, vehicles and crews; destruction of private property and infrastructure 
</p>
<p>  
 35 See, e.g., E/CN.4/1995/61, para. 93. 
 36 Military Justice Law, sect. 178. 
 37 Ibid., sect. 539A (a). </p>


<p>by ground forces; and use of weaponry containing phosphorous.38 A sixth command 
investigation was established in November 2009 to investigate the allegations relating to 
the al-Samouni residence, the mistreatment of Palestinian detainees by IDF and the attack 
on the al-Maqadmah mosque.39 
</p>
<p>38. Third, the MAG may order the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division 
(MPCID) to open a criminal investigation into allegations of criminal behaviour.40 He does 
so either directly upon receipt of a complaint from any source or on the basis of the results 
of a command investigation. A team of 16 investigators was designated to undertake 
investigations stemming from the Gaza conflict.41 By July 2010, the MAG had launched 47 
such criminal investigations, of which he had referred 34 directly for criminal investigation 
while the remaining 13 cases had previously been the subject of command or special 
command investigations. 
</p>
<p>39. Once the review is concluded, MPCID reports to the military prosecution and 
transfers the file for review by a prosecutor. The MAG or Chief Military Prosecutor then 
decides whether to initiate disciplinary or criminal proceedings or to undertake further 
investigations. The military prosecution files an indictment before a military court if it 
determines that there is sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction.42 
</p>
<p>40. In total, Israel has launched more than 150 investigations into allegations of 
misconduct or violations of IHL during &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;. As previously noted, this 
has led to 47 criminal investigations and 4 criminal indictments, one of which led to a 
conviction for the crime of looting.43 In addition, investigations have examined operational 
procedures and the use of certain munitions, such as white phosphorous.44 
</p>
<p>41. The FFM report set out 36 incidents alleging serious violations of IHL and IHRL. 
Annex II below illustrates the status of investigations into these incidents based on 
available information. While most have been investigated, the Committee does not have 
information on whether inquiries into certain matters have been launched and these are 
discussed below. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Assessment 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Positive developments 
</i></b></p>
<p>42. The Committee welcomes certain positive steps that have resulted from Israel&#8217;s 
investigations into complaints raised in relation to the Gaza conflict. The adoption of new 
written procedures for the protection of civilians in urban warfare should help to increase 
that protection in armed conflict and ensure that IDF places more emphasis on civilian 
safety. The establishment of a &#8220;humanitarian officer&#8221; for every fighting battalion with 
responsibility for handling the civilian population should be highlighted as an innovative 
means to educate soldiers and advise commanders on the protection of civilians and civilian 
property and the planning and coordination of humanitarian assistance. Likewise, the New 
Order Regulating the Destruction of Private Property for Military Purposes should help to 
minimize such destruction in the future. The establishment of a clear doctrine and strict

<p>orders on the use of munitions containing white phosphorous is a step forward. In addition, 
the Committee notes the establishment of the Turkel Commission, which includes two 
international observers.45 Part of its mandate is to examine &#8220;the question of whether the 
mechanism for examining and investigating complaints and claims raised in relation to 
violations of the laws of armed conflict, as conducted in Israel generally,&#8230; conform with 
the obligations of the State of Israel under the rules of international law&#8221;.46 
</p>
<p>43. In spite of the many investigations undertaken and the sophisticated nature of 
Israel&#8217;s military justice system, the Committee has concerns about the investigations 
conducted into the Gaza conflict thus far. 
</p>
<p><b><i>  Lack of cooperation 
</i></b></p>
<p>44. As a result of the lack of cooperation from Israel, the Committee could rely only on 
three public reports of the Government, supplemented by information from NGOs and 
witnesses. The information in the three reports is inadequate as a basis for a reliable 
evaluation of the independence, effectiveness and genuineness of investigations into such 
serious allegations. The available information is extensive, providing detail on many 
investigations although not on all. The Committee would have preferred to speak directly 
with investigators to assess the thoroughness and effectiveness of their work. Instead, the 
Committee is left with many questions. The fact that it had difficulty verifying whether 
Israel had investigated all 36 incidents in the FFM report illustrates the opacity of the 
information available. Owing to the lack of cooperation, the Committee is unable to make a 
definitive determination as to whether the investigations carried out by Israel meet the 
criteria in resolution 13/9. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. First, in some cases, the Committee could not ascertain whether Israel had met its 
duty to investigate in relation to all 36 incidents. For example, the Committee was unable to 
find any information as to whether or not an investigation into the death of Muhammad 
Hajji and the shooting of Shahd Hajji and Ola Masood Arafat47 was launched. This incident 
might have been the subject of one of the 90 command investigations or the first special 
command investigation that considered harm to civilians not directly participating in the 
hostilities. No reference is made to any investigations into the alleged deprivation of liberty 
of AD/02.48 Likewise, the Committee was unable to find information on whether inquires 
were made into the allegations of indiscriminate killing of members of the Abu Halima 
family49 and instead had to rely on NGO material.50 Cooperation with Israel would have 
enabled the Committee to verify that information.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>46. In other cases, it is evident that investigators compiled a good deal of information. A 
case in point is the incident at the el-Bader flour mill, destroyed by an air attack.51 The 
MAG reopened the investigation upon receiving new evidence and provided further 
explanations to support his conclusion that the mill had not been intentionally targeted. The 
example illustrates a serious attempt on the part of Israeli investigators to explain what 
happened at the flour mill. <b>

 51 A/HRC/12/48, paras. 913&#8211;941. </p>


<p>47. A second category of cases raises questions about the extent of the inquiries 
undertaken. For example, the Committee would have benefited from clarification from 
Israeli investigators with respect to the shooting of Majda and Rayya Hajaj at Juhr ad-Dik 
on 4 January 2009.52 The Israeli report of the investigation into this incident notes the 
indictment of a soldier on the charge of manslaughter for shooting a civilian at the time and 
place where the Hajaj women &#8211; one of whom was carrying a white flag &#8211; were killed.53 Yet, 
the press release announcing the soldier&#8217;s indictment appeared to concern an incident where 
a man, rather than two women, was shot, suggesting that the indictment may relate to an 
entirely different incident.54 The admitted confusion as to the identity and number of the 
victims at Juhr ad-Dik that day calls into serious question whether a full and prompt 
investigation was undertaken into the shooting of the Hajaj women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. Another case concerned the Abd al-Dayem condolence tents incident.55 The Fact-
Finding Mission alleged that Israeli soldiers had launched a deliberate attack on civilians, 
killing 5 and injuring 20. The results of the command and criminal investigations suggest 
instead that soldiers were firing on combatants launching a Grad rocket and that soldiers 
&#8220;did not identify any civilians in the vicinity&#8221; of &#8220;the terrorist squad&#8221;.56 The Committee 
notes the discrepancy in the two versions of the incident.  Owing to the lack of cooperation 
from Israel, it is unable to confirm that extensive efforts were taken by investigators to 
reconcile these conflicting accounts.  
</p>
<p>49. In the al-Quds hospital case,57 there is insufficient information to determine with any 
accuracy what the results of the inquiry demonstrate. Israel has communicated very little 
with respect to this incident. The first Israeli report indicated that an inquiry was ongoing 
into attacks on medical facilities.58 The second report noted that the third special command 
investigation examined incidents of shootings at medical facilities, buildings, vehicles and 
crews.59 The third report reflected that disciplinary action was taken against some officers 
as a result of these attacks,60 but it is unclear whether that disciplinary action corresponded 
to the attack on al-Quds hospital or to attacks on other medical centres. The Committee has 
no basis for assessing whether this investigation was, in fact, effective and thorough.  
</p>
<p>50. Third, owing to a lack of cooperation from Israel, the Committee is not in a position 
to evaluate a range of allegations in the FFM report about the way in which the Israeli 
system of military investigations actually functions. For example, it is alleged that: the 
system of command investigations was not effective owing to the failure of investigators to 
comply with regulations and orders;61 command investigations obstructed criminal 
investigations by destroying the scene of the crime and obstructing and delaying the process 
of identifying and collecting evidence;62 penalties imposed on Israeli offenders had been 
noticeably more lenient than those imposed on Palestinians;63 command investigations had

<p>no established methods of criminal investigations &#8220;such as visits to the crime scene, 
interviews with witnesses and victims, and assessment by reference to established legal 
standards&#8221;;64 the delay of six months to start some 13 criminal investigations constituted 
undue delay;65 criminal investigations had been conducted in an unprofessional way, 
making it virtually impossible to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt;66 and command 
investigations were generally a tool to review performance and learn lessons, which can 
hardly be an effective and impartial investigation mechanism to respond to allegations of 
serious violations.67<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Promptness 
</i></b></p>
<p>51. The Committee has reservations as to whether investigations were sufficiently 
prompt. Promptness requires investigations to commence and progress with reasonable 
expedition. The Committee notes that many Palestinian witnesses were interviewed only at 
the very end of 2009, while many allegations of IHL and IHRL violations were reported 
almost immediately at the end of &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221; in January 2009 and at the latest in 
September 2009 with the publication of the FFM report. Such delays can result in evidence 
being lost or compromised, and in the kind of confusing and conflicting testimony that 
affected the results of the inquiries into the shooting of Majda and Rayya Hajaj and the 
attack on the el-Bader flour mill referred to above. Without additional information on when 
specific investigations actually got under way, the Committee is not in a position to make a 
definitive finding on the expeditiousness with which Israel conducted the relevant 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b><i>  Independence and impartiality 
</i></b></p>
<p>52. In general terms, it appears that Israel&#8217;s military justice system has certain built-in 
mechanisms to preserve its independence. At the heart of the system is the MAG, whose 
hierarchical independence rests on a number of factors. Specifically, the Minister of 
Defense, rather than the Chief of General Staff, is responsible for his appointment and 
decisions of the MAG are subject to review by the Attorney-General and by the Supreme 
Court sitting as the High Court of Justice, including through petition by individuals and 
civil society. Israeli jurisprudence illustrates the careful attention paid to ensuring the 
independent functioning of the MAG within the rule of law.68 
</p>
<p>53. In spite of the structural guarantees of independence built into the military justice 
system, the dual responsibilities of the MAG, in the specific context of these investigations, 
raise concerns of a lack of impartiality.<b> </b>The MAG is legal adviser to the Chief of Staff and 
other military authorities. Yet, at the same time, he is the supervisor of disciplinary law in 
the military. Although the combination of the advisory and supervisory functions in one 
office does not automatically lead to a conflict of interest or a lack of impartiality, the 
situation is complicated in the present case by the fact that many of the allegations of

49(5) P.D. 849. </p>


<p>serious violations of IHL and IHRL in the FFM report directly link to the advice he 
provided. 
</p>
<p>54. Indeed, Israel publicly stated that the MAG gave legal advice on IHL to 
commanders at all levels leading up to and during the Gaza conflict and that &#8220;the lawyers 
examined the legality of planned targets, participated in the operational planning process, 
helped direct humanitarian efforts and took part in situation assessments, exercises and 
simulations&#8221;.69 However, as noted above, the Fact-Finding Mission strongly criticized the 
objectives, strategy and policy underlying the entire Gaza operation.70 The link between the 
advice given and the allegations in the FFM report underlines the importance of the MAG 
not only acting impartially, but also being seen to act impartially. 
</p>
<p>55. One way to dispel any suspicion of a lack of impartiality is to examine the results of 
the investigations. Of the 36 incidents in the FFM report, the Committee notes the 
following findings: no violation or discontinuation of proceedings for various reasons (20); 
unclear results (7); disciplinary action taken (3); indictments (1); ongoing criminal 
investigations (5). Although the Committee does not have access to the full evidence and 
reasoning behind these decisions, given the seriousness of the allegations, the military 
investigations thus far appear to have produced very little. 
</p>
<p>56. The Committee notes that civilian oversight of the MAG decisions provides a 
commendable mechanism to protect against arbitrariness. However, the Committee is not 
aware of any requests for judicial review of a decision of the MAG related to investigations 
connected to the Gaza conflict. While any interested party, including NGOs, can seek a 
High Court judicial review, even in the course of armed conflict, Palestinians in Gaza face 
significant hurdles.<b> </b></p>

<p>57. Palestinian complainants and their legal representatives stated that they were not 
systematically informed of the progress of their cases. While the military has a standard 
practice of acknowledging receipt of a complaint, the vast majority of complainants 
received no further information whatsoever about the status of their cases. Two 
organizations which filed complaints on behalf of Palestinians told the Committee that they 
had learned about the dismissal of their complaints only through the Israeli media.71 The 
lack of any standard process of informing complainants about the progress and results of 
investigations affects the perception of justice. Not surprisingly, the Committee learned that 
the complainants and witnesses affected by investigations had little confidence in the 
system. 
</p>
<p>58. The same lack of transparency was also reported in civil cases. In addition to 
lodging a complaint with the MAG, complainants can initiate a proceeding to seek 
compensation with the Ministry of Defense. The claimant must lodge a form within 60 days 
of incurring damage, followed by a civil claim within two years. The Palestinian Centre for 
Human Rights (PCHR) submitted 1,028 compensation claims to the Israeli Ministry of 
Defense, of which, by 11 February 2010, only 7 on behalf of 20 individuals had been 
acknowledged. The Israeli Military Police notified PCHR that it had opened investigations 
in 15 cases and summoned 35 witnesses to the Erez crossing. According to PCHR, none of 
the interviewed witnesses received any information following their appearance before the 
investigation panel in Erez. In the case of the attack on the al-Daya family residence &#8211;

<p>where Israel admitted it had made an operational error leading to the deaths of 23 civilians 
&#8211; PCHR filed the compensation form on 11 February 2009 and a criminal petition on 18 
May 2009, only to receive a formal letter acknowledging receipt of its petition on 13 
September 2009 and requesting a power of attorney (which PCHR had already filed). 
PCHR has received no further information on the progress of this compensation claim.72<b> 
</b>Furthermore, Palestinian witnesses in Gaza are not always granted a permit to travel out of 
Gaza and so cannot reach courts in Israel, particularly since the closure of the Gaza Strip in 
June 2007.73 Consequently, access to justice is rarely guaranteed in practice to Palestinian 
complainants.  
</p>
<p>59. The experience of victims and witnesses when giving testimony at the border and in 
accessing Israeli justice more broadly helps to explain why Palestinians have little 
confidence in the Israeli investigations. The Committee interviewed 28 witnesses, of whom 
19 had given evidence at the Erez border. Witnesses had had to wait long hours at the 
border. One of the witnesses in the al-Samouni case reported having to wait 13 hours and 
being refused access to sanitary facilities for hours, finally being allowed to use a toilet, but 
only in the company of soldiers.74 Another witness to the Halawa incident had to wait four 
hours without water or food; the witness was forced to wait an hour and a half to use a 
toilet.75 Another person related to the Abd Rabbo incident had to wait six hours at the 
border and was sent home without being interviewed.76  
</p>
<p>60. In the view of the Palestinians residing in Gaza, the Israeli military justice system is 
simply the extension of the same military system that organized and carried out &#8220;Operation 
Cast Lead&#8221;. Most distrust its ability to deliver justice. For this reason, many potential 
witnesses declined to appear in Erez. Perhaps this is not surprising since victims of military 
operations naturally perceive a deep bias and predisposition towards self-preservation and 
national interests among those representing the adversary State. However, in the interests of 
performing effective and impartial investigations, the Committee emphasizes the 
importance of treating all victims and witnesses, whether Israeli or Palestinian, with dignity 
and courtesy.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Allegations not investigated 
</i></b></p>
<p>61.  The information available suggests that Israel has not investigated all the allegations 
of serious violations of IHL and IHRL set out in the FFM report. 
</p>
<p>62. First, Israel has not conducted investigations into the allegations of human rights 
violations with respect to its actions in the West Bank at the time of the military operations 
in Gaza.77 The allegations of violations of the right to life, as well as claims of torture and 
unlawful conditions of detention, give rise to the duty to investigate under the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. There is no 
evidence that Israel has met this duty.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. Furthermore, the information available suggests that Israel has not conducted a 
general review of the military doctrine regarding legitimate military targets. The Fact-
Finding Mission rejected the Israeli viewpoint that the entire governmental infrastructure in

<p>the Gaza Strip, including the Legislative Council building, was a legitimate target, warning 
that it was incompatible with the principle of distinction.78 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>64. Finally, Israel has not conducted investigations into decisions made at the highest 
levels about the design and implementation of the Gaza operations.79 A core allegation in 
the FFM report was that the systematic and deliberate nature of the destruction in Gaza left 
the Mission &#8220;in no doubt that responsibility lies in the first place with those who designed, 
planned, ordered and oversaw the operations&#8221;.80 Those alleged serious violations go beyond 
individual criminal responsibility at the level of combatants and even commanders, and 
include allegations aimed at decision makers higher up the chain of command. The official 
inquiry must be conducted by a truly independent body, given the obvious conflict inherent 
in the military&#8217;s examining its own role in designing and executing &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. The Palestinian side 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 25 January 2010, the Palestinian Authority established a four-member 
Independent Investigation Commission by Presidential Decree to follow up on the 
implementation of the recommendations of the FFM report.81 The Commission was 
authorized to undertake investigative duties pursuant to that report, work in accordance 
with the timetable provided in it, and submit its conclusions and recommendations to the 
relevant authorities.82 
</p>
<p>66. The Committee received the report of the Independent Investigation Commission 
(see footnote 3 above) from the High Commissioner for Human Rights on 19 August 2010. 
It set out in detail the Commission&#8217;s methodology and scope of investigations. The 
Commission&#8217;s mandate was to investigate the alleged violations committed by the 
Palestinian side both before and after the Gaza conflict that were described in the FFM 
report.83 The Commission had powers to collect information, evidence and data relevant to 
its activities; to receive complaints of human rights violations falling within its mandate; 
and to hear testimony from complainants, including victims, witnesses, human rights 
organizations and official agencies.84 
</p>
<p>  
 78 A/HRC/12/48, para. 392. 
 79 In this regard, the FFM report names particular individuals, including the Deputy Prime Minister, Eli 
</p>
<p>Yishai, and the Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, as well as Major-General Dan Harel, whose statements 
during &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221; support its contentions that the Operation was indeed intended to cause 
disproportionate destruction and violence against civilians as part of a deliberate policy. The Fact-
Finding Mission also charges that Israel&#8217;s strategic goals demonstrated a qualitative shift from 
relatively focused operations to massive and deliberate destruction. See A/HRC/12/48, paras. 1177&#8211;

<p>67. The Commission sought the expertise of independent international scholars,85 
human rights organizations and officials in the West Bank. The Commission also collected 
and analysed data from the reports of national and international human rights organizations. 
It placed notices in local newspapers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, organized a press 
conference to introduce itself to its constituents and encourage individuals to bring 
complaints before it,86 and held public hearings.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Commission made a series of findings, including allegations of torture and ill-
treatment by security forces in the West Bank and Gaza; extrajudicial killings by law 
enforcement agencies and armed groups connected to the de facto Gaza authorities; failure 
by these Gaza authorities to protect against extrajudicial killings and to prosecute those 
responsible; and various violations by the West Bank and de facto Gaza authorities in 
relation to the right to form associations, press freedoms and the right to take part in public 
affairs. 
</p>
<p>69. The Commission addressed recommendations to the Palestinian Authority, including 
the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the Office of the Military Prosecutor, the security 
services, the Preventive Security Service, the General Intelligence Service and the Military 
Intelligence Service. In addition, it addressed findings to the de facto Gaza authorities and 
their security services, as well as to the United Nations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Committee notes that the Independent Investigation Commission undertook 
independent and impartial investigations in a comprehensive manner that squarely 
addressed the allegations in the FFM report.87<b> 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Commission was established as an independent investigatory body and its 
members were not directly linked to the Palestinian Authority hierarchy being investigated. 
Two of the four members were retired judges of high standing in the occupied Palestinian 
territories; the other two were university professors. The Commission established in its 
statute the principle of complete independence of its members. It claimed that &#8220;no party 
was allowed to interfere with or influence the course of the investigation&#8221;.88 The 
conclusions tend to support this claim, particularly given the Commission&#8217;s allegations of 
violations committed by the Palestinian Authority, including at high levels, as well as by 
the de facto Gaza authorities. Furthermore, the Commission&#8217;s investigatory powers were 
sufficient to support its investigations and are reflected in its statute.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>72. Moreover, its report demonstrates that it was thorough. In the elaboration of its 
methods of work, the Commission set out in detail the process it had followed to arrive at 
its conclusions. The fact that the Commission was able to undertake some 100 hearings in 
relation to each of the alleged violations illustrates the comprehensiveness of its work. The 
Commission met governmental representatives accused of violations, including high-level 
officials. The steps taken to protect witnesses and safeguard the information it obtained 
demonstrate its professionalism. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 85 Ibid., para. 63. 
 86 Ibid., paras. 68&#8211;70. 
 87 The Commission covered allegations in the FFM report as follows: arrest and detention by security 
</p>
<p>forces (A/HRC/12/48, paras. 1555&#8211;1558); torture and ill-treatment (paras. 1559&#8211;1560); freedom of 
association (para. 1561); freedom of the press; freedom of expression and opinion (paras. 1564&#8211;
1570); freedom of assembly (paras. 1571&#8211;1575).  The Commission also attempted to cover 
allegations of violations by armed groups and security services in the Gaza Strip including: launching 
of attacks within civilian areas (paras. 446&#8211;460); detention of Gilad Shalit (paras. 1336&#8211;1344); 
killings, torture and other human rights violations (paras. 1345&#8211;1372); and rocket and mortar attacks 
by Palestinian armed groups on Israel (paras. 1594&#8211;1691).  
</p>
<p> 88 A/64/890, annex II, chap. II, para. 62. </p>


<p>73. The Commission set out the limitations impeding its work, including the fact that it 
was unable to travel to the Gaza Strip. While these limitations affected the thoroughness of 
its work, the Commission was able to interview victims, witnesses and representatives of 
human rights organizations in the Gaza Strip by videoconference.89 However, it is unclear 
to what extent its report will lead to criminal investigations and prosecutions there. 
</p>
<p>74. The Committee also has some concerns about the promptness of the investigations. 
The FFM report published allegations of violations in September 2009. Yet the 
Commission was established only in January 2010, presumably in response to General 
Assembly resolution 64/10 (para. 4) rather than to the FFM report itself. This delays the 
start of criminal investigations and prosecutions. That said, the Committee observes that the 
Commission undertook a task of significant proportions with reasonable expedition so that 
it was able to submit its results to the Secretary-General in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>75. Finally, the Committee emphasizes that investigations are only the first step to 
achieving accountability for alleged human rights violations and that the prosecution of 
perpetrators, as well as the provision of an effective remedy to those whose rights have 
been violated, should follow promptly. At the time of writing, the Committee had not 
received any information to indicate that criminal investigations or prosecutions were 
actually under way in the West Bank. On 6 September 2010, the Committee received a 
copy of a letter sent by the Prime Minister, Mr. Sallam Fayyad, to the Chair of the 
Commission, Mr. Issa Abu-Sharar, reiterating the commitment of the Council of Ministers 
&#8220;to the full implementation of the recommendations contained [in the Commission&#8217;s report] 
towards respecting and ensuring respect of human rights and public freedoms in Palestine&#8221;. 
The Committee strongly encourages the Palestinian Authority to live up to this commitment 
through prompt and effective prosecutions where appropriate.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. The de facto Gaza authorities 
</b></p>
<p>76. The de facto Gaza authorities established two committees in response to General 
Assembly resolution 64/254. The United Nations received the report of the first Committee 
in January 2010 and the report of the second in August 2010 (see footnote 4 above). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>77. The first Committee was an entirely governmental body headed by the Minister of 
Justice of the de facto Gaza authorities. The other Committee members were members of 
the Prime Minister&#8217;s Legal Council, the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, the Chair of the Military Jurisdiction 
Authority, the Public Prosecutor, the Head of the Central Documentation Committee, a 
Judge of the Court of Appeal, the Director-General of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of 
Justice, the Director-General of Fatwa and Legislation, the Director-General of the 
Legislative Council, and the General Controller of the Ministry of the Interior. Its report 
focused entirely on Israeli Government policy vis-&#224;-vis the Gaza Strip and the conduct of 
Israeli military troops during the Gaza conflict. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>78. It did not carefully consider the violations allegedly perpetrated by the de facto Gaza 
authorities or associated armed groups. However, in its report, it stated that all claims 
concerning the conduct of the de facto Gaza authorities and armed groups should be 
directed to the Office of the Prosecutor-General. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>79. The report, while submitted as a response to the FFM report, did not discuss the 
Fact-Finding Mission&#8217;s recommendations in detail, nor did it propose measures to address 
alleged violations committed by the de facto Gaza authorities or the armed groups under its 
</p>
<p>  
 89 Ibid., para. 66. </p>


<p>control. The report is not an investigative report, but simply a description of what, in the 
view of the de facto Gaza authorities, the situation currently is in the Gaza Strip. It 
primarily reiterated the allegations of the FFM report against Israel. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>80. However, the report did announce the establishment of a follow-up Independent 
Legal Committee (hereinafter &#8220;second Gaza Committee&#8221;), composed of three national and 
three international experts, to implement the Fact-Finding Mission&#8217;s recommendations &#8220;in 
accordance with international standards.&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>81. This second Gaza Committee90 presented its report to this Committee in Gaza on 15 
August 2010. Its national experts were introduced as Gaza-based lawyers with many years&#8217; 
experience in international law practice. Its three international experts were international 
lawyers from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. They were unable to enter the Gaza Strip and were 
limited to communicating with the national members by telephone. The Committee accepts 
that the de facto Gaza authorities sought to establish an independent body to undertake 
investigations.  
</p>
<p>82. The second Gaza Committee made field visits, interviewed victims and officials, and 
reviewed criminal investigation files. However, its report did not include sufficient 
information to demonstrate systematically the steps it took to collect and evaluate evidence. 
More details would have shed light on the thoroughness of its investigations. 
</p>
<p>83. The second Gaza Committee&#8217;s report did give examples of criminal proceedings 
related to alleged violations of IHL and IHRL, including a case where a number of 
defendants were convicted and imprisoned, while others were given suspended prison 
sentences. Some cases were settled out of court between the families involved. While in the 
Gaza Strip, the Committee requested the Prosecutor-General to provide it with specific 
information about the number and progress of the investigations his Office had undertaken. 
His Office subsequently responded in writing, but its submission contained no statistics or 
other data substantiating the report&#8217;s reference to investigations or prosecutions undertaken 
by the de facto Gaza authorities.  
</p>
<p>84. The second Gaza Committee&#8217;s report stated in addition that all persons detained on 
political grounds had been released; Palestinian groups had not deliberately violated the 
principle of distinction; there was no credible testimony to support the charge that 
Palestinian armed groups had intentionally targeted Israeli civilians when launching rockets 
against Israeli targets; mosques and civilian buildings had not been used as storage space or 
bases for weapons; and there was no evidence that Palestinians had used civilians as human 
shields. 
</p>
<p>85. The Committee is not in a position to ascertain the veracity of any of these 
assertions.  
</p>
<p>86. The Committee also has concerns related to the impartiality of the second Gaza 
Committee&#8217;s investigations. The report did not seriously address the recommendations by 
the Fact-Finding Mission to the de facto Gaza authorities. This is in stark contrast to the 
report of the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s Commission, which demonstrated a sincere effort on 
its part to investigate and expose the culpability of the government authorities. Instead, the 
second Gaza Committee &#8211; like the first &#8211; addressed recommendations to the United Nations 
and the international community, while its conclusions concentrated on criticizing Israel&#8217;s 
policies and actions towards Gaza, rather than on addressing those of the de facto Gaza 
authorities. This gives the impression that the investigations sought to deflect attention from 
</p>
<p>

</p>

Mr. Nazem Owaida (Gaza). </p>


<p>the alleged violations of IHL and IHRL by the de facto Gaza authorities and raises concerns 
about their credibility and genuineness. 
</p>
<p>87. Moreover, some aspects of the report sought to explain away allegations of serious 
violations of IHL. For example, the second Gaza Committee suggested that the 
unavailability of modern military technology could not preclude armed groups from 
defending themselves. This implicitly acknowledges the truth of the allegations in the FFM 
report that armed groups violated IHL by launching weapons at Israel that were incapable 
of striking precise targets, while seeking to justify the violation and absolve the 
perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>88. The investigations of the second Gaza Committee, which began more than a year 
after the Gaza conflict, also raise questions as to the promptness of its inquiry. The report 
set out reasons for the delay, noting the difficulties inherent in undertaking effective 
investigations in the wake of the destruction caused by the conflict. This Committee 
understands that the chaos resulting from armed conflict had an impact on the second Gaza 
Committee&#8217;s capacity to undertake investigations. In this sense, the strict application of the 
standard of promptness might not be appropriate.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Israel 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>A lack of cooperation hampered the Committee&#8217;s assessment of Israel&#8217;s 
response to the call by the General Assembly to conduct investigations that are 
independent, credible and in conformity with international standards into the serious 
violations of IHL and IHRL reported by the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on 
the Gaza Conflict. The Committee&#8217;s bases of information are insufficient for a 
definitive assessment. Consequently, the Committee is not in a position to establish 
whether the investigations carried out by Israel met international standards of 
independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Committee acknowledges that there are mechanisms in place within the 
Israeli legal order to investigate allegations of war crimes. It accepts that military as 
well as civilian investigative bodies may inquire into such crimes so long as the 
investigations conform to international standards. Investigations into allegations of 
violations of either IHL or IHRL should meet the universal criteria of independence, 
impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness, subject to the constraints of 
armed conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The actual operation of Israel's military investigations system raises concern in 
the present context. Specifically, the Committee concludes that the dual role of the 
Military Advocate General (MAG) to provide legal advice to IDF with respect to the 
planning and execution of &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221; and to conduct all prosecutions of 
alleged misconduct by IDF soldiers during the operations in Gaza raises a conflict of 
interest, given the Fact-Finding Mission&#8217;s allegation that those who designed, planned, 
ordered and oversaw the operation were complicit in IHL and IHRL violations. This 
bears on whether the MAG can be truly impartial &#8211; and, equally important, be seen to 
be truly impartial &#8211; in investigating these serious allegations. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Israeli investigators did not always undertake steps to inform victims, 
witnesses and their legal representatives of the progress of their inquiries, nor did they 
consistently treat victims with dignity and courtesy. Transparency in reporting 
progress and results of investigations and access to justice for victims are </b></p>


<p><b>requirements for investigations under IHRL, although they are not strictly applicable 
to investigations under IHL, owing to the differing objectives of investigations under 
these two bodies of law. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Nonetheless, without the full participation of victims and witnesses in 
investigations, their effectiveness and thoroughness suffer. The Committee notes that 
international standards are evolving in this area, with ever stronger emphasis on 
affording access to justice for victims even with respect to investigations into alleged 
violations of IHL. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Committee does not have any information on whether Israel has 
undertaken investigations into the allegations raised in the FFM report concerning 
IHRL violations in the West Bank. In this regard, Israel has not met its duty, under 
the International Covenant or under the Convention against Torture, to investigate 
these claims. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Similarly, there is no indication that Israel has opened investigations into the 
actions of those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;. 
The FFM report contained serious allegations that officials at the highest levels were 
complicit in violations of IHL and IHRL. Israel has not met its duty to investigate this 
charge. The Committee observes that the military justice system would not be the 
appropriate mechanism to undertake such an investigation, given the military&#8217;s 
inherent conflict of interest. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. The Palestinian side 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Palestinian Authority established an independent commission of 
investigation, which carried out a careful and detailed inquiry into the allegations 
addressed to the Palestinian Authority. On the basis of the Commission&#8217;s report and 
its meeting with the Commission&#8217;s Chair and members, the Committee concludes that 
the Commission was not only independent in form, according to its legal statute, but 
also in fact. Its report alleges that serious violations of IHRL were committed by 
public officials in the West Bank. The Committee concludes that the investigation 
conforms with international standards and can be considered credible and genuine.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>However, the Committee observes that the Commission&#8217;s work was hampered 
by difficulties in accessing the Gaza Strip. While the Commission took all appropriate 
steps to investigate the allegations of serious violations of IHL and IHRL in Gaza, the 
Committee concludes that the Commission was unable to do so. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Commission has laid the groundwork for the commencement of 
proceedings against the perpetrators and other measures suited to provide redress to 
the victims. Its Chair has received written assurances from the Prime Minister 
concerning the implementation of all its recommendations, but the Committee is 
unaware of any criminal proceedings that may have been initiated since the 
Commission filed its report.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. The de facto Gaza authorities 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The de facto authorities in Gaza established two committees of inquiry. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The report of the first Committee, made up of officials of the de facto Gaza 
authorities, makes no serious effort to address the allegations detailed in the FFM 
report against the de facto authorities in Gaza; it focuses primarily on the allegations 
directed against Israel.  </b></p>


<p>101. <b>The second report, prepared by three national and three international legal 
experts, provides some information about the actual measures taken to redress the 
violations that were alleged, but fails to substantiate assertions that all political 
prisoners have been released and criminal prosecutions have taken place in response 
to the FFM report. On the basis of the information before it, the Committee cannot 
conclude that credible and genuine investigations have been carried out by the de 
facto authorities in the Gaza Strip.  </b></p>
