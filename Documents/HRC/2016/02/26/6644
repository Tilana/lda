 AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DURBAN DECLARATION

<p><b>Egypt (on behalf of the Group of African States):  draft resolution 
 6/&#8230; Elaboration of international complementary standards to  
  the International Convention on the Elimination of All  
  Forms of Racial Discrimination </b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in September 2001 by 
the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance (A/CONF.189/12 and Corr.1), 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 2106 A (XX) of 
4 January 1969, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, proclaimed by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 2200 A (XXI) of 16 December 1966, in particular 
article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant, which stipulates that any advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, shall be 
prohibited by law,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, proclaimed by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that general recommendation No. 15 (1993) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination on article 4 of the International Convention stipulates that 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is 
compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action urged States that had 
not yet done so to accede to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, as a matter of urgency, with a view to achieving its universal ratification 
</p>
<p>by 2005, to consider making the declaration envisaged under article 14 thereof, and to withdraw 
reservations contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention, all of which have regrettably 
not been accomplished to date, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply alarmed</i> at the sharp increase in xenophobic tendencies and intolerance towards 
various racial and religious groups and cultures, where people belonging to minorities, migrants, 
refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal migrants are the worst affected victims of such tendencies 
and acts, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>at the lack of political will to address comprehensively, by all available 
measures, the various forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, and to provide adequate remedies to the victims, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006, by which, heeding the decision and 
instruction of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Related Intolerance, it decided to establish the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights 
Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, with the mandate to elaborate, as a 
matter of priority and necessity, complementary standards in the form of either a convention or 
additional protocol(s) to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, filling the existing gaps in the Convention, and also providing new normative 
standards aimed at combating all forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial 
and religious hatred, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Regretting </i>that the mandate of the Five Experts on Complementary Standards was not 
accomplished in accordance with the requirements set out in its decision 3/103, 
</p>
<p><i> Decides</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To convene the inaugural session of the Ad Hoc Committee in the first quarter 
of 2008 to commence its mandate; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To allocate no more than two days at the beginning of the inaugural session of the 
Ad Hoc Committee, to reflect on all contributions and studies presented by various stakeholders 
and the relevant mechanisms which are necessary for the realization of its mandate.
