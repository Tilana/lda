<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of El Salvador was held at the 2nd meeting on 
</p>
<p>27 October 2014. The delegation of El Salvador was headed by Carlos Alfredo Castaneda, 
</p>
<p>Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on El Salvador. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of El Salvador: China, Ethiopia and the 
</p>
<p>Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>El Salvador: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SLV/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/SLV/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/SLV/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to El Salvador through the 
</p>
<p>troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the preparation of the oral presentation was the result of 
</p>
<p>consultations between different government institutions, coordinated by the Ministry for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p>6. The second review has allowed El Salvador to take stock of progress made in human 
</p>
<p>rights since its first universal periodic review in 2010. The recommendations received and 
</p>
<p>the voluntary pledges put forward on that occasion had shaped some objectives established 
</p>
<p>by the Government, which had contributed to the reconstruction of democracy. 
</p>
<p>7. The progress identified had not prevented the Government from acknowledging that 
</p>
<p>El Salvador was a country facing several challenges that needed to be overcome before it 
</p>
<p>attained the full enjoyment of the rights of its people, in compliance with its human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government had a firm commitment to work for the strengthening and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights as part of State policy and as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. 
</p>
<p>The new Administration was inaugurated on 1 June 2014, after the Salvadoran people 
</p>
<p>expressed its will through a democratic exercise. The new Government was working on the 
</p>
<p>validation of its five-year development plan, as the main guiding public policy tool. As part </p>


<p>of the validation of the plan, the Government had launched a broad public consultation 
</p>
<p>process, which included the Salvadoran community abroad. 
</p>
<p>9. The institutional focus of the Government of President Salvador S&#225;nchez C&#233;ren was 
</p>
<p>the strengthening of the structural achievements of recent years, which had improved the 
</p>
<p>living conditions of sectors of society that had been excluded and impoverished for 
</p>
<p>decades. 
</p>
<p>10. During its first universal periodic review, El Salvador committed to ratifying several 
</p>
<p>international instruments. In that regard, the delegation noted that in 2011, El Salvador had 
</p>
<p>ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) and in early 2014, it had also ratified the Second Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition 
</p>
<p>of the death penalty (ICCPR-OP2). In addition, the Legislative Assembly was in the 
</p>
<p>process of considering ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
</p>
<p>Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), the Convention relating to the Status of 
</p>
<p>Stateless Persons and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>11. The Executive had also engaged in inter-agency consultations regarding the possible 
</p>
<p>ratification of other instruments, including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT). In 
</p>
<p>that context, the Government had submitted for the consideration of the Legislative 
</p>
<p>Assembly a draft piece of legislation to lift the reservation of El Salvador to the 
</p>
<p>Convention. In addition, the definition of torture had been amended in 2011 to make the 
</p>
<p>crime imprescriptible and include all acts of torture, as defined by the Convention. 
</p>
<p>12. Internal consultations were also under way to consider the possibility of becoming a 
</p>
<p>party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
</p>
<p>communications procedure; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in Education; International 
</p>
<p>Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 169, 189, 97 and 143; the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity; 
</p>
<p>the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty 
</p>
<p>and the Inter-American Convention against All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance. 
</p>
<p>13. At the domestic level, there had been some developments in the construction of a 
</p>
<p>legal framework that would extend the recognition of the rights of particularly vulnerable 
</p>
<p>sections of the population and the Government had established some institutions and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to monitor human rights. 
</p>
<p>14. For instance, in June 2014, the Legislative Assembly had ratified the amendment to 
</p>
<p>article 63 of the constitution to add a clause recognizing indigenous peoples, for whom, in 
</p>
<p>that framework, policies which respect and develop their identity, world view, values and 
</p>
<p>spirituality will be set up. 
</p>
<p>15. Also, after extensive consultations with organizations of persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>the National Policy on Comprehensive Care for Persons with Disabilities had been adopted 
</p>
<p>in April 2014 and the Legislative Assembly was debating the possible lifting of the 
</p>
<p>reservation to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Furthermore, sign 
</p>
<p>language had been recognized as an official language. 
</p>
<p>16. In relation to older people, the Government had carried out a consultation process to 
</p>
<p>substantially revise the Act on Older People, under a human rights approach. That reform 
</p>
<p>would soon be introduced in the Legislative Assembly. The delegation added that El 
</p>
<p>Salvador was a strong supporter of the negotiations for a regional and an international 
</p>
<p>instrument for the protection of the rights of older people. </p>


<p>17. The fight against poverty and social exclusion were priorities for the Administration. 
</p>
<p>Since 2009 the Government had established various programmes and measures that were 
</p>
<p>part of the universal social protection system. In that regard, the Legislative Assembly had 
</p>
<p>adopted, in April 2014, the Law on Social Protection and Development which established 
</p>
<p>the right of the whole population to receive a minimum of social public services. 
</p>
<p>18. In 2010, El Salvador had launched a reform of the national health system, based on 
</p>
<p>community family health teams, which guaranteed the right to health using a strategy of 
</p>
<p>providing comprehensive primary health care and which worked directly with families and 
</p>
<p>communities. The Government had also worked to raise awareness of the importance of 
</p>
<p>vaccinating children and the whole family. 
</p>
<p>19. In March 2012, the Legislative Assembly passed a law on medicines, aimed at 
</p>
<p>ensuring the availability, registration, quality and safety of medicines, promoting fair prices 
</p>
<p>for medicines and their rational use as well. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation also pointed out that El Salvador had already reached the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal 5 target related to the reduction in maternal mortality. 
</p>
<p>21. In relation to people with HIV/AIDS, there was a proposed law for a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>response to HIV/AIDS which, it is intended, will establish an approach that goes beyond 
</p>
<p>the consideration of that epidemic as a health problem and contribute to the elimination of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and stigmatization. 
</p>
<p>22. On the other hand, El Salvador was committed to protecting the rights of 
</p>
<p>Salvadorans who had migrated. In that sense the delegation considered as a great 
</p>
<p>achievement the adoption, in 2011, of the Special Law on the Protection and Development 
</p>
<p>of Salvadoran Migrants and Their Families. Also, in that context, the Government had 
</p>
<p>strengthened, as a priority, the consular network since 2009. The delegation informed the 
</p>
<p>Working Group that, more importantly, in the 2014 elections Salvadorans abroad were able 
</p>
<p>to vote for the first time. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation pointed out that, in June 2014, the migration flow of unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>children and adolescents toward the United States of America had dramatically increased, 
</p>
<p>because of false expectations generated by human traffickers, the longing for family 
</p>
<p>reunification and the lack of opportunities and insecurity in El Salvador. That outflow was 
</p>
<p>rated internationally as a humanitarian crisis. 
</p>
<p>24. El Salvador had sought to coordinate efforts to cope with that international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian crisis with the countries of the northern triangle of Central America. And in 
</p>
<p>July 2014 the Government had launched an awareness campaign and information about the 
</p>
<p>risks that unaccompanied children faced when undertaking such a dangerous journey, under 
</p>
<p>the slogan &#8220;Do not put their lives at risk&#8221;. The campaign materials were being distributed 
</p>
<p>and discussed in all schools in the country. 
</p>
<p>25. The Administration had also signed the Special Declaration on the situation of 
</p>
<p>Central American unaccompanied migrant boys, girls and adolescents to the United States 
</p>
<p>and, within the framework of the Organization of American States, El Salvador had 
</p>
<p>sponsored, along with Guatemala and Honduras, the adoption of a declaration on  Central 
</p>
<p>American unaccompanied migrant children. 
</p>
<p>26. Public security and peaceful coexistence required the joint efforts of the Government 
</p>
<p>and the participation of different actors and sectors of society. For that purpose, the 
</p>
<p>Administration had established, in September 2014, the National Council for Citizen 
</p>
<p>Security and Coexistence, composed of local governments, the business sector, people with 
</p>
<p>experience in the field, political parties, the media and the church, in order to promote 
</p>
<p>dialogue and agreements that would develop into sustainable public policies on the issue. </p>


<p>27. The delegation mentioned that, among the measures to address the security 
</p>
<p>challenges, El Salvador was a party to the Central American Security Strategy, an 
</p>
<p>instrument that from a comprehensive perspective guided the coordinated actions on 
</p>
<p>security adopted by the eight countries in the region. 
</p>
<p>28. El Salvador had also focused its efforts on fighting crime and corruption and 
</p>
<p>promoting transparency. Hence, a number of laws had been adopted: Law on Access to 
</p>
<p>Public Information, Special Law for Intervention Telecommunications, Law against Money 
</p>
<p>and Asset Laundering, Special Law on the Forfeiture and Administration of Goods of Illicit 
</p>
<p>Origin or Destination and Government Ethics Law.  
</p>
<p>29. In addition to that important legislation, the Administration had sponsored the 
</p>
<p>development of technological tools, such as the portal on transparency and open 
</p>
<p>government, and the adoption of public policies and mechanisms of social control, such as 
</p>
<p>accountability of public institutions and citizens&#8217; participation. 
</p>
<p>30. The fight against trafficking had also been a priority for El Salvador. The National 
</p>
<p>Council against Trafficking was the body responsible `for the formulation of policies and 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a political and strategic long-term framework for a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>approach to trafficking. El Salvador announced with satisfaction that it had already adopted 
</p>
<p>a Special Law against Trafficking in Persons. 
</p>
<p>31. Fighting crime was associated with another problem faced by El Salvador: prison 
</p>
<p>overcrowding. On this issue, the Government had already received a number of 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the Rapporteur on Persons Deprived of Liberty of the Organization 
</p>
<p>of American States and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention after their visits in 2010 
</p>
<p>and 2012 respectively. In addition, the Legislative Assembly was considering a draft law 
</p>
<p>that would allow the use of alternative technologies to ensure surveillance and attendance 
</p>
<p>of persons charged in a judicial process. 
</p>
<p>32. In conclusion, the delegation recalled that El Salvador had been elected to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council for the first time in its history, which, it added, was an 
</p>
<p>acknowledgment of the progress and achievements of the country in recent years. El 
</p>
<p>Salvador was committed to the strengthening of the international system of human rights 
</p>
<p>and in particular, the full consolidation of the Human Rights Council. El Salvador was 
</p>
<p>extremely grateful for the trust it had received during the elections to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>33. During the interactive dialogue, 59 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>34. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted the significant progress made since the 
</p>
<p>1992 Peace Agreements. It commended the efforts to provide for the poorest families and 
</p>
<p>for persons with a disability; to combat gender-based violence; and to educate the 
</p>
<p>population and law -enforcement officers on human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Algeria noted that El Salvador had put in place a constitutional legislative 
</p>
<p>framework that made human rights one of the main guiding principles of State action. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed the efforts in promoting the enjoyment of human rights, especially economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights, and in providing assistance to victims of the internal armed 
</p>
<p>conflict. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Angola highlighted the achievements in promoting and protecting the human rights 
</p>
<p>of women and children and the right to health, and the issuing of a standing invitation to </p>


<p>special procedures mandate holders. It was concerned by the low level of school enrolment 
</p>
<p>of disabled and indigenous children. Angola made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>37. Argentina welcomed the ratification of OP-ICESCR and noted that ICPPED was 
</p>
<p>under review with a view to ratification. It noted the enactment of domestic legislation on 
</p>
<p>eliminating discrimination and preventing violence against women. Argentina made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Australia congratulated El Salvador on its recent presidential elections and the 
</p>
<p>introduction of voting for Salvadoran citizens abroad. It also welcomed the moves to 
</p>
<p>address violence against women. Australia expressed concern at the punitive anti-abortion 
</p>
<p>laws and at the fact that the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) rated El Salvador as 
</p>
<p>having among the highest incidences of homicide of children. Australia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Bangladesh noted the adoption of the 2011 Act on Equality, Fairness and the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and the reform of the Political Parties Act. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged the measures relating to the family. It emphasized that the treaty bodies had 
</p>
<p>raised concerns about discrimination against women and socioeconomic disparities, 
</p>
<p>particularly for migrants. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Plurinational State of Bolivia commended the constitutional changes to 
</p>
<p>recognize indigenous peoples and the policies to develop their cultural identity. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged further strengthening of human rights institutions, standards and public 
</p>
<p>policies. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Brazil noted the ratification of international human rights instruments and the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a national child protection policy. Noting ongoing challenges, it commended 
</p>
<p>the progress made in protecting women&#8217;s rights, including providing assistance to victims 
</p>
<p>of violence, and providing reproductive and sexual advice. Further measures should be 
</p>
<p>taken to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons. Brazil 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Canada welcomed the steps taken by El Salvador to address violence against 
</p>
<p>women. It also welcomed efforts to improve the implementation of national programmes 
</p>
<p>aimed at fostering children&#8217;s rights. However, it stressed the importance of taking measures 
</p>
<p>to improve the protection of children against violence. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Chile recognized efforts to strengthen human rights within a complex context. It 
</p>
<p>noted the child protection law and the Political Parties Act, which would promote the 
</p>
<p>political participation of women. Cultural models discriminating against women should be 
</p>
<p>eliminated, promoting access to judicial protection and combating impunity. Chile made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Colombia noted efforts to implement recommendations of the first universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. It noted the transparency of the country in collaborating with human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. Colombia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Costa Rica commended human rights improvements, particularly in women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>and the health sector. It expressed concern regarding violence, particularly against women 
</p>
<p>and children, as a cause of migration and the collapse of the prison system. Efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve children&#8217;s living conditions should be strengthened. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted the efforts carried out by El Salvador in implementing the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the first cycle of the universal periodic review. It was especially 
</p>
<p>pleased with the measures taken to combat discrimination against vulnerable persons and to 
</p>
<p>ensure equality in different areas. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire made recommendations. </p>


<p>47. Cuba noted progress in promoting and protecting human rights. It commended the 
</p>
<p>steps taken to combat discrimination and improve judicial administration and public 
</p>
<p>security, thereby combating crime and corruption. It noted progress in the area of health. 
</p>
<p>Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. The Czech Republic expressed its appreciation for the details on human rights in 
</p>
<p>El Salvador. It also welcomed steps towards eventual ratification of OP-CAT. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea noted achievements in the protection 
</p>
<p>and promotion of human rights and encouraged further progress in that regard. It took note 
</p>
<p>of the election of El Salvador to the Human Rights Council. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Ecuador recognized the ratification of OP-ICESCR and the government programme 
</p>
<p>2014&#8211;2019, which would ensure that human rights were used to guide the Government. It 
</p>
<p>acknowledged public policies on equality, food and nutritional security, health, 
</p>
<p>environment and education. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Egypt commended the positive promotion of human rights and the accession of El 
</p>
<p>Salvador to international conventions, and the consultations with national agencies and civil 
</p>
<p>society on the possible ratification of other instruments. It requested additional information 
</p>
<p>on the experience of integrating street children into Salvadoran society. Egypt made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Estonia commended the ratification of ICCPR-OP2 and the standing invitation to 
</p>
<p>special procedures, and encouraged compliance with the requests of the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>Recognizing commitments to free speech, Estonia encouraged further protection for media 
</p>
<p>workers. It invited steps to prevent violence against women and LGBTI persons and made a 
</p>
<p>call for the abortion legislation to be amended. Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The United States of America noted that insecurity, lack of economic opportunity 
</p>
<p>and weak governance caused significant population displacement. It recognized the 
</p>
<p>progress in combating impunity, but noted low conviction rates and corruption. A lack of 
</p>
<p>respect for the separation of powers and prison conditions were causes for concern. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Germany welcomed the progress on child labour and encouraged the adoption of a 
</p>
<p>national plan on that regard. Although the national reconciliation process had advanced, the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation remained a concern, as reflected in the high rate of child homicide 
</p>
<p>and the inhumane prison conditions. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Ghana applauded the bill to tackle discrimination against persons living with HIV 
</p>
<p>and to recognize that the issue was linked to the country&#8217;s development. It reiterated 
</p>
<p>concerns raised by the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding violence against 
</p>
<p>children, child labour and the possible recruitment of children into gangs. Ghana made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Greece recognized the investment in policies and social programmes. It emphasized 
</p>
<p>that challenges prevailed, especially regarding education. Greece expressed concern 
</p>
<p>regarding the not yet achieved demilitarization of public security institutions, especially the 
</p>
<p>police force. It requested information on the ratification of the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court. Greece made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Guatemala welcomed the election of El Salvador to the Human Rights Council; the 
</p>
<p>ratification of OP-ICESCR; and the constitutional reform to recognize indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>It valued the adoption of legislation on migrants&#8217; rights, gender equality and voting rights 
</p>
<p>for Salvadorans abroad. It noted the lack of a specific definition of discrimination. </p>


<p>58. The Holy See commended efforts to promote and protect human rights and noted the 
</p>
<p>determination to protect migrants&#8217; rights and aid their integration, which was particularly 
</p>
<p>important for women and unaccompanied minors. The initiative to secure proper birth 
</p>
<p>registration was a positive defence of human life. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Iceland expressed concern at the prohibition and criminalization of abortion, even in 
</p>
<p>life-threatening cases or cases of rape. The prevalence of gender-based violence was also a 
</p>
<p>cause for concern and El Salvador was encouraged to ensure the effective implementation 
</p>
<p>of legislation to protect women. Iceland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Indonesia welcomed the measures taken to promote human rights, including the 
</p>
<p>adoption of legislation aimed at protecting women from violence and discrimination, and 
</p>
<p>the adoption of the Special Law on the Protection and Development of Salvadoran Migrants 
</p>
<p>and Their Families. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Ireland commended legislation to combat gender-based violence, but noted a lack of 
</p>
<p>resources for its implementation. It noted high levels of gender-based violence, including 
</p>
<p>on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Impunity for human rights violations 
</p>
<p>remained a concern. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Italy congratulated El Salvador on the achievement of the Millennium Development

</p>
<p>prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Several measures 
</p>
<p>had been implemented to ensure access to work without discrimination, education on non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, and the safety of LGBTI people.

</p>
<p>human rights violations within the armed conflict context. Progress was being made on 
</p>
<p>reparations in the fields of health, education and historical memory. </p>


<p>101. The strategy entitled Ciudad Mujer ensured the full access of women to knowledge 
</p>
<p>and the exercise of their rights, especially those related to a life free from violence and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination. 
</p>

</p>
<p>periodic review as an opportunity to share achievements on human rights. The

</p>
<p>rights in the country and would be considered at the moment of defining its priorities.
