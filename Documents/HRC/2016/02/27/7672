<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism 
conducted a visit to Burkina Faso from 8 to 12 April 2013. He wishes to thank the 
Government for the invitation and the excellent cooperation extended to him. 
 Burkina Faso has not been affected by terrorist acts to date. The Government is 
committed to the global measures being taken to counter terrorism and remains vigilant in 
that regard. In his report, the Special Rapporteur seeks to highlight central issues for the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, and points to 
particular areas of interest or concern in his conclusions and recommendations.  
 The Special Rapporteur refers to the country&#8217;s involvement in international efforts 
to counter terrorism and applauds its efforts to prevent terrorism. Burkina Faso recognizes 
the international nature of measures to counter terrorism, and therefore actively supports 
regional and subregional efforts in that regard. The Special Rapporteur encourages Burkina 
Faso to support such cooperation and, in particular, to ensure that the promotion and 
protection of human rights is mainstreamed into all efforts to counter terrorism.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 15/15, 19/19 and 22/8, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism conducted an official visit to Burkina Faso from 8 to 12 April 
2013 at the invitation of the Government. The present report is submitted pursuant to those 
resolutions, which request the Special Rapporteur to report regularly to the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to gather information about the current situation in 
Burkina Faso with regard to the protection and promotion of human rights while 
countering terrorism, in particular, conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism (pillar I 
of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy) and to assist the Government in 
its efforts to counter terrorism while respecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>3. During the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur had meetings with the Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Human Rights and the Promotion of Civic Responsibility, the 
Minister for Territorial Administration and Security, the Minister for Relations with 
Institutions and Political Reforms, and the Minister of Justice. He also met with the 
Procurator-General, the President of the National Financial Information Processing Unit, 
the High Authority for the Control of Arms Imports and their Use, and high-level 
representatives of the National Commission to Combat the Proliferation of Small Arms. 
During a visit to the National Assembly, the Special Rapporteur met with the President and 
Vice-President of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and the President of the 
Committee on General, Institutional and Human Rights Affairs. He also met with the Vice-
President and Rapporteur of the National Human Rights Committee. The Special 
Rapporteur also met with lawyers, judges, non-governmental organizations and 
representatives of the international community, including the Ambassador of the United 
States of America, the Ambassador of France, and the Ambassador and Head of the 
European Union Delegation to Burkina Faso. The Special Rapporteur also consulted with 
relevant United Nations agencies operating in Burkina Faso, including those involved with 
the influx of refugees from the conflict in Mali. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition, the Special Rapporteur conducted a visit to the military prison (Maison 
d&#8217;Arr&#234;t et de Correction des Arm&#233;es) which houses members of the Armed Forces and the 
gendarmerie detained on remand or convicted of military offences, where he was able to 
conduct confidential interviews with detainees. He also visited the main prison in 
Ouagadougou (Maison d&#8217;Arr&#234;t et de Correction de Ouagadougou).  
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the invitation and the excellent 
cooperation extended to him throughout the visit. The Special Rapporteur also expresses 
his appreciation to the United Nations Resident Coordinator and his team in Burkina Faso 
for their diligent support in preparation for and during the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context of the visit 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General political background 
</b></p>
<p>6. Burkina Faso is a landlocked country situated in Central West Africa. The 
population of just over 17 million people is growing at a rate of 3 per cent per annum. The 
country does not have extensive natural resources or a strong industrial base. A large part 
of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture and the main cash crop is cotton. 
Since 2004, restrictions on inward investment have been very significantly relaxed, which </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>has resulted in an increase in gold mining and prospecting, which is now the country&#8217;s 
main source of export revenue. 
</p>
<p>7. Burkina Faso borders a number of States that have been affected by conflict in 
recent years, including C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Mali and Niger; some of the conflicts are ongoing. In 
2012, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Burkina Faso was estimated to be 
approximately $24.69 billion.1 According to the United Nations Development Programme, 
approximately 45 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line set by the World 
Bank.2 The highest rate of unemployment is among the 18&#8211;25-year age group. 
Approximately 60 per cent of the population is Muslim, with the remainder made up of 
Catholics (19 per cent), Animists (15.3 per cent), and Protestants (4.2 per cent).3 The 
population includes more than 60 different ethnic groups and over 120 different languages 
are spoken. The official language is French. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite the apparent geographical vulnerability of Burkina Faso, to date it has not 
suffered from serious internal armed conflict or acts of terrorism. All those who spoke to 
the Special Rapporteur ascribed that to the country&#8217;s long history of promoting interfaith 
tolerance and dialogue, a tradition which is described as a part of the national 
consciousness. The rate of interfaith and inter-ethnic marriage is high, and it is common 
for children of one faith to be educated in schools run by religious organizations other than 
their own. The people of Burkina Faso attach considerable importance to the principle of 
respect for alternative faiths and cultures. That is reflected in government policy at the 
highest level. In April 2011, for example, the Ministry for Human Rights launched its 
national strategy to promote a culture of tolerance and peace in Burkina Faso. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that, on 13 March 2013, the Council of Ministers adopted the 
national policy (2013&#8211;2022) and action plan (2013&#8211;2015) on human rights and the 
promotion of civic responsibility, to which reference had been made in the national report 
submitted in accordance with paragraph 5 of the annex to Human Rights Council 
resolution 16/21 (A/HRC/WG.6/16/BFA/1, para. 16).4 In January 2012, the Ministry 
published a handbook on the prevention and management of conflicts between farmers and 
cattle breeders, aimed at resolving long-running disputes concerning land usage in rural 
areas.  
</p>
<p>9. Since the early 1990s, the Presidency of Burkina Faso has acted as mediator in 
regional disputes and armed conflicts between and within States in the region, facilitating 
peace negotiations in a variety of situations, including conflicts involving the Tuareg 
people of the subregion. Within the framework of the second universal periodic review of 
Burkina Faso, Burkina Faso was commended for its role as the chief peace negotiator for 
many of the conflicts in the region, as indicated in the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review on Burkina Faso (A/HRC/24/4, para. 42). During his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that most recently, during 2012, the President and the 
Minister for Foreign Affairs played a central role in the mediation efforts of the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the conflict in northern Mali, hosting 
negotiations between the Government and rebel factions in Ouagadougou. Pursuant to 
information received, during that process the President drew a clear distinction between

<p>national rebel forces, such as the Mouvement national pour la lib&#233;ration de l&#8217;Azawad, and 
Islamist insurgents from outside Mali, such as the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West 
Africa. Following the French military intervention in Mali in January 2013, Burkina Faso 
provided a contributory contingent of 700 soldiers to the ECOWAS force operating in the 
country. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal background 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights and other international obligations 
</b></p>
<p>10. In its preamble, the Constitution of Burkina Faso explicitly endorses the 1948 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international instruments on economic, 
political, social and cultural rights as well as the 1981 African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights.5 Burkina Faso has ratified a wide range of international treaties in the 
human rights field, as indicated in the compilation on Burkina Faso prepared by the Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in accordance with paragraph 5 of the annex 
to Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 (A/HRC/WG.6/16/BFA/2, p. 2). The political 
will of the Government to effectively counter terrorism is visible in the number of 
international counter-terrorism instruments to which Burkina Faso is a party. To date, the 
Government is a party to 12 of the 16 international counter-terrorism instruments.6 
</p>
<p>11. Burkina Faso is not a party to the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression 
of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material, the 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of 
Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, or the 2005 Protocol to the 
Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms 
Located on the Continental Shelf.7 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Current national legislative counter-terrorism framework  
</b></p>
<p>12.  Following the visit and recommendations of the Counter-Terrorism Committee 
Executive Directorate in 2009 to monitor and promote the implementation of Security 
Council resolution 1373 (2001),8 Burkina Faso enacted Act No. 60-2009/AN of 17 
December 2009 punishing acts of terrorism in Burkina Faso and Act No. 61-2009/AN of 
17 December 2009 on combating the financing of terrorism in Burkina Faso.

<p>7
 During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Government officials expressed the view that, although 
</p>
<p>Burkina Faso is a landlocked country, the 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of 
Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the 2005 Protocol to the Protocol for 
the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental 
Shelf are important to Burkina Faso. Their reasoning was that the occurrence of a terrorist attack 
referred to in those instruments could also have negative consequences for a landlocked country like 
Burkina Faso.

</p>
<p><i> (a) Act punishing acts of terrorism in Burkina Faso 
</i>13. Act No. 60-2009/AN of 17 December 2009 punishing acts of terrorism defines and 
prohibits acts of terrorism in Burkina Faso. Article 2 provides a list of serious crimes 
which constitute acts of terrorism and which are subsequently detailed in articles 3&#8211;13. 
Article 2 further specifies that those acts constitute crimes when they are intended to 
intimidate or terrorize the general population or compel a State or an international 
organization to do or abstain from doing something. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur believes that the Act incorporates a definition of terrorism 
that broadly corresponds to international standards. 
</p>
<p>15. While the existing international legal framework does not provide for a 
comprehensive definition of the concept of terrorism, the former Special Rapporteur, in the 
report on his 2008 mission to Spain (A/HRC/10/3/Add.2), expressed the view that the 
cumulative characterization of a terrorist crime, as elaborated by the Security Council in its 
resolution 1566 (2004), represents an effort to confine counter-terrorism measures to 
offences of a genuinely terrorist nature. In his view, any offence defined in domestic law 
as a terrorist crime should meet the following three conditions: (a) committed against 
members of the general population, or segments of it, with the intention of causing death 
or serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages; (b) committed for the purpose of 
provoking a state of terror, intimidating a population, or compelling a Government or 
international organization to do or abstain from doing any act; and (c) corresponding to all 
elements of a serious crime as defined by the law. Any law proscribing terrorism must 
adhere to the principle of legality enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, be applicable to counter-terrorism alone and comply with the 
principle of non-discrimination (A/HRC/10/3/Add.2, para. 6).9 
</p><p>16. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that no jurisprudence is 
available regarding the implementation of the Act No. 60-2009/AN of 17 December 2009 
punishing acts of terrorism in Burkina Faso. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur has one concern with regard to article 2. The offence of 
&#8220;criminal conspiracy&#8221; in article 2, which derives from French law, has been used in some 
countries to prosecute individuals with only the most tenuous connection to alleged 
terrorists. However, according to information received during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit, no individual has thus far been arrested or charged in Burkina Faso for any offence 
under the 2009 counter-terrorism legislation. There is therefore no evidence to suggest that 
that very broad offence has been, or would be, misused by the authorities. Furthermore, the 
Government of Burkina Faso informed the Special Rapporteur that the provision would be 
implemented only in strict application of the letter of the law.  
</p>
<p>18. The Act also lists a range of terrorist offences relating to civil aviation, maritime 
navigation, fixed platforms and public transport, offences against internationally protected 
persons, kidnapping, offences connected with the use of dangerous materials (arts. 3&#8211;13), 
and acts concerned with the provision of material support to terrorism, including the 
provision of arms for the purpose of terrorism, and for recruitment or training of 
individuals in acts of terrorism (arts. 14 and 15). It provides for a range of penalties up to 
and including life imprisonment.

<p><i> (b) Act on combating the financing of terrorism in Burkina Faso 
</i>19. Act No. 61-2009/AN of 17 December 2009 on combating the financing of terrorism 
in Burkina Faso is designed to give effect to the country&#8217;s obligations under the 1999 
International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Financing10 and Security Council 
resolution 1373 (2001). The Special Rapporteur welcomes with appreciation the enactment 
of that law. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conditions conducive to counter-terrorism: challenges 
faced by Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur stated in his 2011 report to the General Assembly 
(A/66/310) that the first obligation of any State, and a key component of its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre, 
is to protect the lives of its citizens and of all individuals within its territory and subject to 
its jurisdiction (para. 20). Under article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights,11 the right to life has been characterized as the supreme human right.12 It is 
non-derogable within the meaning of article 4, paragraph 2, of the Covenant, as indicated 
in Human Rights Committee general comment No. 6 (1982) on the right to life (para. 1). 
Human rights-compliant counter-terrorism measures help to prevent the recruitment of 
individuals to commit acts of terrorism (A/HRC/16/51, para. 12). In his first report to the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/20/14), the Special Rapporteur stated that human rights 
abuses have all too often contributed to the grievances which cause people to make the 
wrong choices and to resort to terrorism. Singling out communities and disproportionately 
addressing law enforcement measures against them entails the risk of collective alienation. 
States that have derogated from their human rights obligations on grounds of national 
emergency, or resorted to military responses in countering terrorism, have witnessed an 
erosion of institutional, procedural and substantive safeguards. The collective commitment 
of the international community to protect the rights of potential future victims of terrorism 
necessarily entails an equally resolute commitment to the principles of international human 
rights law in the conception and implementation of counter-terrorism strategies (para. 32).  
</p><p>21. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy was adopted by Member 
States on 8 September 2006 and was most recently reaffirmed in June 2012 in General 
Assembly resolution 66/282, itself reaffirming General Assembly resolutions 60/288, 
62/272 and 64/297. It is a global instrument to enhance national, regional and international 
efforts to counter terrorism, within which all Member States have agreed to a common 
strategic approach to fighting terrorism. The strategy is not limited to sending the clear 
message that terrorism is unacceptable in all its forms and manifestations; it also aims to 
ensure that States take practical steps individually and collectively to prevent and combat 
it. The steps include a wide array of measures ranging from strengthening State capacity to 
counter terrorist threats to better coordinating the counter-terrorism activities of the United 
Nations system.13

</b></p>

</p>
<p><b> A. External threats 
</b></p>
<p>22. Government sources provided the Special Rapporteur with a seemingly realistic and 
transparent assessment of the external and internal threats Burkina Faso is facing. As to the 
former, the country&#8217;s border security is a matter of considerable concern to the 
Government. The border with Mali is 1,200 kilometres long and is not marked by any 
natural or man-made physical boundary. Along approximately half its length, the border is 
in direct contact with the conflict zone in northern Mali. The border as a whole is highly 
porous and difficult to secure. The army of Burkina Faso is 10,000 strong, but more than 
2,000 troops are currently committed to military operations in other States, including 
Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Sudan, placing considerable strain on the country&#8217;s military 
resources.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in response to the existence of external 
threats on its borders, the Government has created a dedicated counter-terrorism force and 
has stationed 1,000 troops &#8212; army and specialist gendarmerie &#8212; on parts of the border 
with Mali. There have so far been a small number of cross-border incidents in the north 
and there remains an ever-present risk that groups such as the Mouvement national pour la 
lib&#233;ration de l&#8217;Azawad, Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Movement for Unity and 
Jihad in West Africa may transit across Burkina Faso from Mali and Niger and carry out 
kidnappings and similar attacks in the Sahel.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur heard that there have also been a number of sporadic and, 
thus far, relatively minor border incursions by insurgents from Mali into the territory of 
Burkina Faso along those sections of the border. There is no evidence that any group has 
so far established an operational base within the territory of Burkina Faso, but the need for 
international support to police the border is urgent and imperative. The southerly part of 
the border with Mali is poorly protected, and is dependent upon intermittent manned 
border posts, with ground patrols and a limited amount of air support from the Air Force of 
Burkina Faso.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that, taken as whole, border security 
represents a considerable vulnerability for the country. The Government has received a 
certain amount of bilateral support in its efforts to secure the border, but that has been 
largely confined to capacity-building, training and the supply of a limited amount of 
equipment. The Government considers that further international assistance is essential to 
maintain its border security. Government security sources stressed to the Special 
Rapporteur that in order to guarantee the protection of the population, the army needed 
additional material and other support, particularly communication, observation and radar 
equipment as well as additional vehicles.  
</p>
<p>26. During his meeting with the National Commission to Combat the Proliferation of 
Small Arms, the Special Rapporteur was informed that poor border security also 
represented a major obstacle to efforts to suppress arms trafficking. The Commission 
estimates that there are approximately 2 million unlawful light weapons in circulation 
within the borders of Burkina Faso, including automatic weapons and light missiles. For a 
country with a population of just over 17 million, the Special Rapporteur considers that 
that represents a significant threat to security and is evidence of continuing cross-border 
arms trafficking. Prior to the conflict in Mali, the Commission estimated that inward 
trafficking represented a significant problem, with 39 per cent of weapons coming from 
Ghana, 19 per cent from C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and 6 per cent from Mali. A recent initiative to 
monitor and suppress arms trafficking across the Malian border since the start of the 
conflict had to be abandoned due to a lack of funds.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Commission has been working with a 
number of organizations promoting arms control, including Amnesty International, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>to shape the recently adopted Arms Trade Treaty. He welcomes that development. 
However, senior members of the Commission emphasized that improved border security 
was essential in order to suppress the proliferation and cross-border smuggling of light 
weapons that could be used in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>28. As a result of the conflict in Mali, Burkina Faso is home to approximately 50,000 
refugees.14 They have fled the fighting and are currently living in three consolidated 
refugee camps in Goud&#233;bou, Mentao and Saag Nioniogo, following relocation from sites 
close to the northern border as well as areas outside the camps in the provinces of Oudalan 
and Soum. The Government has taken considerable care to screen new arrivals and 
separate genuine refugees from non-civilians. The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has no indication that 
there are former combatants in refugee camps in Burkina Faso. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that a significant number of former combatants associated with 
the Mouvement national pour la lib&#233;ration de l&#8217;Azawad and other groups involved in the 
conflict in Mali are among the refugees within its borders, and are organized into 
identifiable groups. Government officials maintain a close watch on those groups and 
individuals in order to identify and prevent security risks that may arise from their 
presence on the territory of Burkina Faso.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes that, while the conflict in Mali has not so far spilt over 
to the territory of Burkina Faso, there is a risk that it may do so. In the view of the Special 
Rapporteur, Burkina Faso needs further international support and assistance in order to be 
able to guarantee the security of the border and the safety of its citizens and others within 
its territory. While the primary need is for support in connection with border security, 
some interlocutors suggested that improved intelligence systems training would also be 
useful. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, at present, it appears that any report of 
abnormal activity is escalated to ministerial level. Many of the reports turn out to be 
unfounded, with a consequent diversion of resources. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit, it was suggested that international assistance would be useful in introducing the 
systematization of intelligence evaluation so that only reliable threat reports are escalated 
to ministerial level. For the Special Rapporteur, that points again to the need for additional 
international support.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some interlocutors considered the 
mediating role of the Presidency to pose a threat of reprisals against Burkina Faso from the 
Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, the Mouvement national pour la lib&#233;ration 
de l&#8217;Azawad or Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, and noted that at least one group had 
previously announced an intention to mount a reprisal attack against a number of major 
cities in different parts of the subregion, including Ouagadougou. However, government 
sources noted that domestic intelligence and security arrangements in the capital and 
elsewhere in Burkina Faso have been considerably strengthened since January 2013, and 
the threat of an externally planned terrorist attack is currently well-contained. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Internal threats 
</b></p>
<p>31. Pillar I of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see para. 2 above) 
emphasizes the fact that conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism include not only 
long-running regional conflicts such as that in the Sahel, but also social, political,

</p>
<p>economic and educational exclusion, shortcomings in good governance, and the 
persistence of unresolved human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Poverty and inequality 
</b></p>
<p>32. Within Burkina Faso, poverty and perceived inequality are sources of increasing 
levels of frustration among poorer sections of the population, as evidenced by civil unrest 
and the army mutiny in 2011. The Special Rapporteur heard from civil society 
representatives during his visit that there is a perception among disadvantaged sectors of 
society that the wealth generated by mining has been unfairly distributed, that land 
disputes have resulted in frustration, and that there are signs of mounting political 
dissatisfaction and unrest.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur considers that the underlying problem is poverty. In recent 
years, GDP has increased at a rate of approximately 5 per cent per annum with the 
population growth in the region of 3 per cent. During his visit to Burkina Faso, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that some people consider that growth of that level ought to have 
been reflected in at least some reduction in absolute poverty levels, which have in fact 
remained relatively static. On the other hand, the Prime Minister informed the Special 
Rapporteur that a recent job creation initiative has allocated CFA francs 10 billion for the 
creation of 60,000 new jobs. All interlocutors, however, expressed the view that there is 
evidence of growing frustration and social dissatisfaction, particularly among young 
people, which have the potential to lead to radicalization and even violent extremism.  
</p>
<p>34. In his first report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
the view that there were at least &#8220;patterns of correlation&#8221; between poverty and terrorism, 
suggesting that societies characterized by economic, social, political and educational 
exclusion were often breeding or recruitment grounds for terrorism. He also referred to the 
suggestion of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that efforts at 
terrorism prevention should focus on grievances arising from inequality and social 
exclusion (A/HRC/20/14, para. 31). Equally, in its Sahel strategy, the European Union lists 
poverty, social exclusion and unsatisfied economic needs as factors that create the risk that 
extremism will develop.15 The Algiers Plan of Action on the Prevention and Combating of 
Terrorism in Africa, adopted by the African Union in 2002, also recognizes poverty, 
deprivation and marginalization as conditions that are conducive to terrorism.16 In that 
context, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of Burkina Faso to increase its 
efforts to effectively combat poverty.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Freedom of religion and religious tolerance 
</b></p>
<p>35. Violations of human rights, including freedom of religion and infringements of 
religious tolerance, are recognized as conditions conducive to terrorism (see para. 31 
above). The Special Rapporteur was informed of some minor, but unprecedented, incidents 
that some people have suggested are early warning signs, pointing to the emergence of 
religious intolerance in some sections of society. Examples given to the Special 
Rapporteur included threats that were reportedly made to a senior imam following a 
meeting with a Catholic archbishop in Ouagadougou as part of an ongoing process of 
interfaith dialogue between religious leaders, and an incident in which a number of

</b></p>
<p>Muslim families removed their children from a Christian school in protest at the 
introduction into the school uniform of a cross as a religious emblem. It appears to the 
Special Rapporteur that the incidents may have attracted a disproportionate amount of 
attention in the media and among the political classes in Ouagadougou due to the 
importance attached in Burkina Faso to the tradition of religious tolerance and interfaith 
cooperation. Nonetheless, the very fact that they have attracted so much attention is, to the 
Special Rapporteur, evidence of a degree of social fragility and perceived vulnerability.  
</p>
<p>36. While incidents such as those have caused unease, and are closely monitored by the 
Government and civil society, the Special Rapporteur agrees with most interlocutors that 
they do not amount to proof of any discernable shift in attitudes among any sector of the 
population towards religious intolerance or radicalization. The attention attached to them is 
perhaps best seen as evidence of the sensitivity of the population, the Government and the 
media to signs of intolerance.  
</p>
<p>37. The value of religious tolerance is enshrined in the Constitution: the State is 
committed to secularism (art. 31), and freedom of thought and of religion are guaranteed 
(art. 7).17 In September 2012, the Ministry for Relations with Parliament and Political 
Reforms sponsored a forum for dialogue between faith leaders aimed at examining the 
relationship between religious and State institutions, and promoting tolerance and 
understanding between them.  
</p>
<p>38. In the same vein, in its 1997 concluding observations, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination commended &#8220;the spirit of tolerance in Burkina Faso, 
the State party&#8217;s active policy of equality and non-discrimination, and the process of 
democratization&#8221; (CERD/C/304/Add.41, para. 4). 
</p><p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that the Government pursues an 
active programme of interfaith cooperation, which is also visible in its national strategy to 
promote a culture of tolerance and peace in Burkina Faso (see para. 8 above), and 
considers it an element of best practice.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, over the past year, a number of imams 
and scholars from abroad have entered Burkina Faso for religious purposes and have been 
preaching at local mosques. Foreign preachers travel around the country and move freely. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Government monitors the activities of 
preachers and their preaching in order to fulfil its obligation, under paragraph 1 (b) of 
Security Council resolution 1624 (2005), to prevent incitement to commit a terrorist act or 
acts. The Government further informed the Special Rapporteur that it is satisfied that none 
of the foreign preachers has so far crossed the line from inflammatory rhetoric to 
incitement to acts of violence. The Burkina Faso authorities stated to the Special 
Rapporteur that radical sermons are prohibited. The Special Rapporteur commends the 
efforts of Burkina Faso to counter incitement to acts of violence. He reaffirms the 
provisions in Security Council resolution 1624 (2005) requiring that measures to 
implement the resolution must comply with States&#8217; obligations under international law, in 
particular to respect the right to freedom of expression. Nonetheless, he has not heard any 
concerns in that respect.  
</p>
<p>41. There was consensus among all the interlocutors the Special Rapporteur met during 
his visit that the Burkina Faso tradition of interfaith tolerance, dialogue and peacebuilding 
represented a significant defence against the growth of violent religious extremism, and 
that there was currently no evidence of a significant trend in that direction. On the other

</p>
<p>hand, all interlocutors expressed their agreement with the Special Rapporteur that poverty, 
social and educational exclusion and frustration, combined with the presence of armed 
groups and ideologues operating in the subregion, mean that there can be no grounds for 
complacency. The Special Rapporteur noted during his visit that the Government is very 
much aware of the need to address social concerns and improve local governance, but is 
severely constrained by the scarcity of economic and other resources.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Detention  
</b></p>
<p>42. The most visible and persistent human rights violations in Burkina Faso affect those 
who are deprived of their liberty. Allegations persist of torture and ill-treatment by the 
gendarmerie during the initial detention stage in prison prior to the first court appearance. 
The Special Rapporteur did not hear any direct evidence of such incidents during his visit, 
but noted that the issue would form part of the examination of the country&#8217;s national report 
submitted to the universal periodic review by the Human Rights Council subsequent to his 
visit in April 2013.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur did, however, see and hear first-hand evidence of the 
conditions of detention in military and civilian prisons. The total prison population is in the 
region of 5,660, including approximately 160 military prisoners detained as a result of 
their alleged involvement in the 2011 army mutiny, which was reportedly motivated by 
perceived inequalities in pay and conditions, rather than broader political considerations. 
</p>
<p>44. During his visit to the military prison in Ouagadougou (Maison d&#8217;Arr&#234;t et de 
Correction Militaire de Ouagadougou), the Special Rapporteur was informed that there is a 
severe shortage of medical support and supplies for sick prisoners. He was also informed 
that the majority of those detained as a result of the mutiny have been in pretrial detention 
for more than two years and still do not have a date fixed for their trials. The conditions of 
detention were extremely basic, but morale among the prisoners appeared to be generally 
satisfactory and the relationship between prisoners and prison staff appeared polite and 
friendly. The Special Rapporteur conducted a number of private and confidential 
interviews with detainees, none of whom reported ill-treatment or made any complaint 
about their conditions of detention other than the absence of medical treatment and the 
length of pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>45. However, the situation in the civil prison system is radically different and grossly 
inadequate. The Special Rapporteur visited the main prison in Ouagadougou (Maison 
d&#8217;Arr&#234;t et de Correction de Ouagadougou<i>)</i>, inspected the premises, and spoke at 
considerable length with the senior staff, who were transparent and forthright in expressing 
their concerns about the conditions in which prisoners were being held. The Special 
Rapporteur was impressed by the professionalism, care and commitment of the senior 
staff, including the Regional Director for the Ouagadougou district who is responsible for 
the supervision of 16 prisons. It appeared clear to the Special Rapporteur that the staff 
were striving to do their utmost to provide a constructive and healthy environment for the 
prisoners, and were frustrated by their inability to afford humane conditions of detention. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur was informed during his visit that the facility currently 
houses 1,281 prisoners, including adult males and females and juveniles. The Special 
Rapporteur was further informed that the adult male facilities were currently 
approximately 250 per cent over capacity, with many inmates sleeping more than six to a 
cell. The Special Rapporteur found the sanitation to be extremely poor and the fabric of the 
prison was in an observably poor state of disrepair. During his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur heard that there was an almost total absence of medication for the treatment of 
infections or diseases which, in view of the overcrowding and poor sanitation, were 
commonplace. The medical infirmary was an empty building, without medical staff or 
equipment, and senior prison staff expressed grave concerns about the health implications </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>13 
</b></p>
<p>for prisoners. The prison had reportedly only one functioning pickup truck for transporting 
prisoners to court or hospital, which was on loan from the Ministry of Justice. The 
authorities depended heavily on Catholic and other religious charities for donations and 
support to run even the most basic of services. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
during his visit that the conditions in the Maison d&#8217;Arr&#234;t et de Correction de Ouagadougou 
were typical of most prisons in Burkina Faso.18 He considers the conditions of detention to 
amount to inhuman and degrading treatment and stresses the imperative need for urgent 
action.  
</p>
<p>47. Pretrial detention is regulated in title III, section 7 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure and is intended as a means of preventing detainees from escaping, repeat 
offending and contacting certain persons pending trial. Article 136 provides that &#8220;pretrial 
detention is an exceptional measure&#8221;. The length of pretrial detention depends on whether 
the alleged act was a crime or an offence. In the case of an offence, when the maximum 
penalty prescribed by law is less than one year&#8217;s imprisonment, an accused person 
domiciled in Burkina Faso may not be detained for more than five days after his or her first 
appearance before the investigating judge if he or she has not previously been convicted of 
a crime or sentenced to more than three months&#8217; imprisonment without probation for an 
ordinary offence. In other cases, pretrial detention may not exceed six months. If continued 
detention appears necessary at the end of that period, the investigating judge may extend it 
by a special substantiated court order, based on reasoned arguments by the chief 
prosecutor. No extension may be granted for a period of more than six months.19  
</p>
<p>48. In contrast, during his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that, for example, 
in the Maison d&#8217;Arr&#234;t et de Correction de Ouagadougou, approximately 40 per cent of 
those in custody were held on remand pending trial.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts of the Government of Burkina Faso to 
implement the tenth recommendation listed in the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review of Burkina Faso (A/HRC/10/80, para. 98 (10)). The efforts 
have included building a new prison and reform institution and implementing the national 
justice policy 2010&#8211;2019, which involves improving prison management, promoting and 
protecting the rights of detainees, promoting the social reintegration of prisoners and 
humanizing places of detention (A/HRC/WG.6/16/BFA/1, paras. 56&#8211;60). The Special 
Rapporteur also takes note that the average time required to process cases has decreased 
significantly from 4 months and 15 days in 2009 to 2 months and 26 days in 2011 for civil 
cases (A/HRC/WG.6/16/BFA/1, para. 33). The Special Rapporteur calls upon the 
Government to strive for a significant decrease in the average time to process criminal 
cases. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur further welcomes the fact that, under the national justice 
policy, by 2019 there should be a credible, fair, independent, transparent, decentralized and 
competent justice system accessible to all. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government of Burkina Faso to pursue its efforts to realize that vision, in particular to 
improve prison conditions and lower the average time required to process criminal cases.

<p><b> C. Government action 
</b></p>
<p>51. During and following his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted the considerable 
political will and commitment to the promotion of human rights and countering terrorism.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment on 23 February 2012 of the 
Ministry for Human Rights and the Promotion of Civic Responsibility by Decree 
No. 2012-122/PRES/PM. It had previously been merged with the Ministry of Justice 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/BFA/1, para. 7). The Special Rapporteur was informed that the aim of 
the change was to promote responsible citizenship through a culture of values and respect 
for human rights. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the diverse activities undertaken by 
the Ministry for Human Rights and the Promotion of Civic Responsibility to raise 
awareness about human rights, including the integration of human rights into formal and 
non-formal education as part of the national strategy to promote a culture of tolerance and 
peace (see para. 8 above). 
</p><p>54. The Special Rapporteur further notes with appreciation the establishment of the 
National Human Rights Commission on 20 November 2001 (Decree No. 2001-
628/PRES/MP/MJPDH) and further amendments in 2009 to bring it into line with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles) (Act No. 062-2009/AN of 21 December 2009).20 During 
his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Commission was in the process of 
becoming operational, with the recent appointment of Commissioners.21 The Special 
Rapporteur expresses his regret at not have been able to gather information on the work of 
the Commission and urges it to take up its work in promoting and protecting human rights 
in Burkina Faso.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Counter-terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the dedication of the Government of 
Burkina Faso to countering terrorism. It is the view of the Special Rapporteur that 
government representatives of Burkina Faso recognize the international nature of terrorism 
and the need to prevent and counter terrorism globally. That is reflected in the domestic 
and international commitment of Burkina Faso to counter terrorism. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that, in response to the existence of 
external threats on its borders, the Government has created a dedicated counter-terrorism 
force. The Special Rapporteur further welcomes the fact that the Government is 
establishing a national committee to counter terrorism to coordinate all reflections, 
initiatives and actions to counter terrorism, and a national centre to counter terrorism 
which will be responsible for counter-terrorism on the national territory at the operational 
level.22 The Special Rapporteur further welcomes the previous and continuing cooperation

 The Special Rapporteur received the information at the stakeholders&#8217; coordination meeting held by 
</p>
<p>the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate within the framework of the I-Act Initiative 
in Ouagadougou, with the objective of helping strengthen counter-terrorism coordination and 
prevention mechanisms in Burkina Faso. </p>

</p>
<p>57. Burkina Faso is one of the three first partnering Member States of the Integrated 
Assistance for Countering Terrorism Initiative (I-ACT Initiative) of the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force (CTITF). The Initiative aims to help interested Member States, 
upon their request, to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.23 
As part of the initiative, and at the request of Burkina Faso, CTITF, the United Nations 
Counter-Terrorism Centre and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime are working 
together to deliver relevant counter-terrorism technical assistance, including capacity-
building for national criminal justice officials and relevant national training entities, such 
as advanced training for trainers who run workshops for magistrates and judicial police 
officers. 
</p>
<p>58. Burkina Faso is one of the four member countries of the Regional Judicial Platform 
of the Sahel countries. The Platform, created in 2010 with the support of the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, facilitates judicial cooperation between focal points in 
Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, particularly in matters related to extradition and 
mutual legal assistance in criminal procedures related to terrorism.24  
</p>
<p>59. On 18 and 19 April 2013, a workshop on countering violent extremism in West 
Africa and the Sahel took place in Ouagadougou, under the auspices of the Global 
Counterterrorism Forum, co-chaired by Burkina Faso and Denmark.25 The aim of the 
workshop was to improve understanding of the sources and drivers of violent extremism in 
the region and to discuss concrete ways of addressing the issue, which is of growing 
concern for the development and security of the countries in the region and beyond. 
</p>
<p>60. On 26 and 27 June 2013, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate 
held, within the framework of the I-Act Initiative, a stakeholders&#8217; coordination meeting in 
Ouagadougou with the objective of helping strengthen counter-terrorism coordination and 
prevention mechanisms in Burkina Faso.26  
</p>
<p>61. On 29 and 30 October 2013, the CTITF Working Group on Protecting Human 
Rights While Countering Terrorism held a second workshop entitled &#8220;Mapping and 
Developing Training Curricula from the Human Rights Training and Capacity Building 
Project&#8221; in Ouagadougou.27

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the cooperation of the Government of 
Burkina Faso. He welcomes the fact that Burkina Faso has repeatedly made 
commitments to uphold human rights in the context of counter-terrorism, including 
by ratifying many international instruments related to human rights and terrorism. 
The Special Rapporteur regards the commitments, together with the invitation 
extended to him, as significant steps on the way to fulfilling international human 
rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>To date, Burkina Faso has escaped the threat of terrorist attack, the spread of 
armed conflict across its borders, and religious intolerance, radicalization and violent 
extremism among its population. The Special Rapporteur concludes, however, that it 
remains vulnerable to all those threats due to its geographical proximity to the 
conflict in northern Mali, the length and insecurity of its borders with Mali and 
Niger, the economic instability of the country and its lack of natural resources, and 
the social and political tensions that have been evident in recent years, particularly 
among young people aged between 18 and 25 who suffer the highest levels of 
unemployment, as well as the fact that nearly half of the population is living beneath 
the poverty line. For the Special Rapporteur, it is troubling that, while the national 
economy is steadily growing, nearly half of the population is living on an income that 
falls below the World Bank poverty line. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the country has thus far proved 
to be resiliently committed to peaceful negotiation and coexistence within a subregion 
that has been riven by conflicts in neighbouring States including C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Mali 
and Niger. Burkina Faso has acted as chief peace negotiator for many of the major 
conflicts in the region. The Special Rapporteur concludes with appreciation that that 
is largely due to a long and deeply held tradition of religious and ethnic tolerance, 
dialogue and cooperation among its people. The Special Rapporteur concludes that 
Burkina Faso provides important lessons with regard to promoting religious and 
ethnic tolerance and considers the engagement of the Government of Burkina Faso as 
a best practice for ongoing dialogue and cooperation among its people. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur concludes that it would, however, be naive to assume 
that the country is not at risk. It is essential that a vulnerable State in such an 
exposed geographical location has the tools at its disposal to ensure the security of its 
borders, maintain the security of inward investment that is essential to its 
development, and address the economic, social, political and human rights concerns 
that can so easily become conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, as foreseen 
in Pillar I of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.

<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur was informed during his visit that, for a number of 
years, Burkina Faso has been the beneficiary of considerable overseas development 
aid. From 2008 to 2013, the European Union provided </b>&#8364;<b>700 million in development 
aid. The European Union budget for the period 2014&#8211;2019 is currently under review. 
The economic crisis in the eurozone and the austerity measures that have been 
introduced in many European States pose a threat to international aid budgets. 
However, the Special Rapporteur strongly urges the European Union and other 
international donors to maintain and increase levels of international support for 
Burkina Faso. Such support should be targeted at measures that contribute to 
securing stability and social justice, protecting the country&#8217;s borders, alleviating </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty, resolving the crisis in the justice system, protecting and promoting human 
rights, and promoting inward investment and job and wealth creation.  
</b>68. <b>In the view of the Special Rapporteur, Burkina Faso plays a critical role in 
promoting peace and dialogue within the subregion. It will almost certainly occupy 
an important mediating position in the forthcoming negotiations on the future of 
Mali, and will contribute significantly to the maintenance of any settlement that is 
reached. In performing that role, Burkina Faso needs the active support of the 
United Nations, its agencies and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the 
Sahel. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern that any significant terrorist 
attack on the infrastructure or security of Burkina Faso would undermine social 
cohesion within the country, impair inward investment and further destabilize the 
region. The international community needs to ensure that the material and other 
resources necessary to protect that small and peaceful State from both external and 
internal threats are made available to it as a matter of regional priority. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following 
recommendations to the Government of Burkina Faso. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Burkina Faso should implement its national justice policy (2010&#8211;2019) in order 
to create a justice system that is credible, fair, independent, transparent, 
decentralized, competent and accessible to all. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government of Burkina Faso: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Undertake a comprehensive review of sentencing policy to ensure that 
the judiciary does not impose prison sentences that the Government is unable to 
administer in humane conditions;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Strive to significantly decrease the average time taken to process 
criminal cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure, as an immediate means of easing prison overcrowding, that any 
person on pretrial remand for a non-violent offence is urgently considered for 
conditional release. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Burkina Faso should take all possible measures to ensure that GDP growth 
results in a proportional decrease in the poverty level of its population. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government not to spare any effort in that regard, as poverty 
and inequality are conditions conducive to terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Notwithstanding the fact that Act No. 60-2009/AN of 17 December 2009 
punishing acts of terrorism has not been applied to date, Burkina Faso should ensure 
that it will not be misused, particularly in application of the offence of &#8220;criminal 
conspiracy&#8221; in article 2.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>While commending the Government for its efforts to protect its borders, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that Burkina Faso pursue those and related efforts 
further. In order to enable Burkina Faso to remain a haven of peace in the region, the 
Special Rapporteur also calls upon the international community to spare no effort in 
providing it with international assistance for border security maintenance.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>While welcoming the assistance the Government of Burkina Faso provides to 
the many thousands of people who flee there from conflict in neighbouring countries, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur recommends that Burkina Faso pursue its efforts to identify 
and prevent security risks arising from extremist elements among refugees.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>While commending the Government of Burkina Faso for its sensitivity towards 
signs of intolerance and its vigilance against violent extremism, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that Burkina Faso ensure that all the measures it takes to 
implement Security Council resolution 1624 (2005) comply with its obligations under 
international law, particularly regarding freedom of expression and freedom of 
association. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>While commending the Government of Burkina Faso for having ratified many 
international conventions on counter terrorism, the Special Rapporteur further calls 
on the Government to ratify the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression 
of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the 
Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, and the 
2005 Protocol to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety 
of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf.
