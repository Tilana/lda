TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1—Business
Transocean Partners LLC (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean 
Partners”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, was formed on February 6, 2014 by Transocean Partners 
Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands company (the “Transocean Member”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. (together 
with its affiliates, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean”), to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced 
offshore drilling rigs.  At June 30, 2016, the drilling units in our fleet included the ultra-deepwater drillships  Discoverer Inspiration and 
Discoverer Clear Leader and the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III, which are located in the United States (“U.S.”) 
Gulf of Mexico.
We own a 51 percent interest in each of the entities that owns and operates the drilling units in our fleet (each individually, a 
“RigCo”, and collectively, the “RigCos”).  The Transocean Member owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the 
RigCos.    At  June 30,  2016  and  December 31,  2015,  the  Transocean  Member  held  21.3 million  common  units  and  27.6 million 
subordinated units, which collectively represented a 71.3 percent and 70.9 percent, respectively, limited liability company interest in us, 
and all of our incentive distribution rights.  See Note 8—Equity.
See Note 11—Subsequent Events.
Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies
Presentation—We  have  prepared  our  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance 
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  U.S.  for  interim  financial  information  and  with  the  instructions  to  Form 10-Q  and 
Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Pursuant to such rules and regulations, these 
financial statements do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for complete financial 
statements.  The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary 
for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods.  Such adjustments are considered to 
be of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise noted.  Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not 
necessarily  indicative  of  the  results  that  may  be  expected  for  the  year  ending  December 31,  2016  or  for  any  future  period.    The 
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated 
financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  as  of  December 31,  2015  and  2014  and  for  each  of  the  three years  in  the  period  ended 
December 31, 2015 included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2016.
Accounting estimates—To prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
U.S., we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 
and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those 
related  to  our  allocated  costs  and  related  party  transactions,  materials  and  supplies  obsolescence,  property  and  equipment,  drilling 
contract  intangible  liability,  income  taxes  and  equity-based  compensation.    We  base  our  estimates  and  assumptions  on  historical 
experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making 
judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ 
from such estimates.
Fair value measurements—We estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability.  Our valuation techniques require 
inputs  that  we  categorize  using  a  three-level  hierarchy,  from  highest  to  lowest  level  of  observable  inputs,  as  follows:  (1) significant 
observable inputs, including unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (“Level 1”), (2) significant other 
observable inputs, including direct or indirect market data for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in 
less active markets (“Level 2”) and (3) significant unobservable inputs, including those that require considerable judgment for which there 
is  little  or  no  market  data  (“Level 3”).    When  multiple  input  levels  are  required  for  a  valuation,  we  categorize  the  entire  fair  value 
measurement  according  to  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  measurement  even  though  we  may  have  also  utilized 
significant inputs that are more readily observable.
Reclassifications—We  have  made  certain  reclassifications  to  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  with  the  current  period’s 
presentation.  Such reclassifications did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows.
Subsequent  events—We  evaluate  subsequent  events  through  the  time  of  our  filing  on  the  date  we  issue  our  financial
statements.  See Note 11—Subsequent Events.

TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – continued
(Unaudited)
Note 3—New Accounting Pronouncements 
Recently issued accounting standards
Presentation of financial statements—Effective with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2016, we will adopt 
the accounting standards update that requires us to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that 
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are 
issued.  The update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim and annual periods thereafter.  We 
do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial 
statements.
Stock  compensation—Effective  no  later  than  our  annual  report  for  the  year  ending  December 31,  2016,  we  will  adopt  the 
accounting standards update that allows for simplification of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income 
tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The update, 
which  permits  early  adoption,  is  effective  for  the  annual  period  ending  after  December 15,  2016  and  for  interim  and  annual  periods 
thereafter.  We do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, 
operations and cash flows or the notes thereto.
Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers—Effective  January 1,  2018,  we  will  adopt  the  accounting  standards  update  that 
requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The update, which permits early adoption, 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the requirements to determine the 
effect such requirements may have on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, operations and cash flows and on the 
disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
Leases—Effective no later than January 1, 2019, we will adopt the accounting standards update that (a) requires lessees to 
recognize a right–to–use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases, and (b) updates previous accounting standards for lessors to 
align  certain  requirements  with  the  updates  to  lessee  accounting  standards  and  the  revenue  recognition  accounting  standards.    The 
update,  which  permits  early  adoption,  is  effective  for  interim  and  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  December 15,  2018.    We  are 
evaluating the requirements to determine the effect such requirements may have on our condensed consolidated statements of financial 
position, operations and cash flows and on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 4—Goodwill Impairment
During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we noted impairment indicators that the fair value of our goodwill could have 
fallen below its carrying amount.  Such impairment indicators included further reduction in the market value of our publicly traded common 
units and oil and natural gas prices as well as projected reductions in dayrates and utilization.  As a result, we performed an interim 
goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2015 and determined that the goodwill associated with our reporting unit was impaired.  In the 
six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a loss of $67 million associated with the partial impairment of the carrying amount of our 
goodwill, which had no tax effect, including $34 million attributable to controlling interest ($0.49 per diluted unit) and $33 million attributable 
to noncontrolling interest.  We estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill using a variety of valuation methods, including the income 
and market approaches.  Our estimate of fair value required us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value 
measurement, including assumptions related to the future performance of our reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices, 
projected demand for our services, rig availability and dayrates.  Subsequent to June 30, 2015, we identified additional indicators that the 
remaining goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit may have again fallen below its carrying amount.  In the 
three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an incremental loss of $289 million, which had no tax effect, associated with the 
impairment of our then remaining goodwill.
Note 5—Income Taxes
We are organized as a limited liability company under the laws of The Republic of the Marshall Islands and are a resident in the 
United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) for taxation purposes.  We are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Certain of our 
controlled affiliates, including the RigCos, are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized, conduct business or own 
assets.  We calculate our provision for income taxes based on the laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and 
earn income.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our estimated annual effective tax rate was 5.4 percent and 6.2 percent, 
respectively, based on estimated annual income before income taxes, after excluding the loss on impairment.

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we excluded from the calculation 30,189 and 44,074 equity-based awards, 
respectively, since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, no equity-based awards 
were excluded from the calculation.
See Note 8—Equity and Note 11—Subsequent Events.
Note 7—Credit Agreement
Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility—On August 5, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement, which is scheduled to expire on 
August 5,  2019,  with  a  Transocean  affiliate  to  establish  a  committed  $300 million five-year  revolving  credit  facility  that  allows  for 
uncommitted increases in amounts agreed to by the Transocean affiliate and us (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility”).  We may 
borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (the “revolving 
credit facility margin”), which ranges from 1.625 percent to 2.250 percent based on our leverage ratio, as defined, or (2) the base rate 
specified  in  the  credit  agreement  plus  the  revolving  credit  facility  margin,  less  one percent  per  annum.    Throughout  the  term  of  the 
Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment, 
which ranges from 0.225 percent to 0.325 percent based on our leverage ratio, as defined.  Among other things, the Five-Year Revolving 
Credit  Facility  includes  limitations  on  creating  liens,  incurring  subsidiary  debt,  transactions  with  affiliates,  sale/leaseback  transactions, 
mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets.  The Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility also includes a covenant imposing a 
maximum  debt  ratio,  as  defined  in  the  credit  agreement.    Borrowings  under  the  Five-Year  Revolving  Credit  Facility  are  subject  to 
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default.  At June 30, 2016, based on our leverage ratio on that date, the revolving credit 
facility  margin  was  1.625 percent.    At  June 30,  2016  and  December 31,  2015,  we  had  no  borrowings  outstanding  and  $300 million 
available borrowing capacity under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.

Master services agreements—On August 5, 2014, we entered into master services agreements, which have initial terms of 
five years,  with  certain  Transocean  affiliates,  pursuant  to  which  Transocean  affiliates  provide  certain  administrative,  technical  and 
non-executive management services to us.  We agreed to reimburse Transocean for the cost of all direct labor, materials and expenses 
incurred in connection with the  provision of such services,  plus an allocated portion of Transocean’s  shared and pooled direct  costs, 
indirect costs and general and administrative costs as determined by Transocean’s internal accounting procedures, and a markup fee 
under  certain  circumstances.    In  the  three and  six months  ended  June 30,  2016,  we  recognized  costs  of  $27 million  and  $52 million, 
respectively, recorded in operating and maintenance costs and expenses, and $6 million and $11 million, respectively, recorded in general 
and administrative costs and expenses, for services under the master services agreements.  In the three and six months ended June 30,

Other agreements
Omnibus agreement—On August 5, 2014, we entered into an omnibus agreement with Transocean and certain of its affiliates 
(the “Omnibus Agreement”).  Under the Omnibus Agreement, Transocean granted us a right  of first offer for its remaining ownership 
interests in each of the RigCos should Transocean decide to sell such interests.  Transocean also agreed to offer us within five years of 
the effective date of the Omnibus Agreement, the opportunity to purchase, subject to requisite government and other third-party consents, 
not  less  than  a  51 percent  interest  in  any  four of  the  following  six ultra-deepwater  drillships:  Deepwater Invictus,  Deepwater Thalassa, 
Deepwater Proteus,  Deepwater Pontus,  Deepwater Poseidon and  Deepwater Conqueror.  The purchase price for each drillship will be 
equal to the greater of the fair market value, taking into account the anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts, or the 
all-in construction cost, plus transaction costs.  Transocean will select which of these drillships it will offer to us, the timing of the offers and 
whether it will offer us the opportunity to purchase a greater than 51 percent interest in any offered drillship.  In addition, Transocean 
agreed not to acquire, own or operate any new drilling rig or contract for any drilling rig, in each case that was constructed in 2009 or later 
and is operating under a contract for five or more years (each, a “Five-Year Drilling Rig”), subject to certain exceptions, without offering us 
the opportunity to purchase such rig.  We also agreed not to acquire, own, operate, or contract for any drilling rig that is not a Five-Year 
Drilling Rig, subject to certain exceptions, without first offering the contract to Transocean.
Among other things, Transocean also agreed to indemnify us for any lost revenue, up to $100 million, arising out of the failure to 
receive an operating dayrate from our customer for Discoverer Clear Leader, for the period commencing on the closing date of our initial 
public  offering  through  the  completion  of  the  rig’s  2014  special  periodic  survey,  which  occurred  during  the  three months  ended 
December 31, 2014.  In the six months ended June 30, 2015, we received a cash payment of $10 million for such indemnification claims 
submitted in the year ended December 31, 2014.
Dual-activity  license  agreements—All  three of  our  drilling  units  are  equipped  with  Transocean’s  patented  dual-activity 
technology.  Dual-activity technology employs structures, equipment and techniques using two drilling stations within a dual derrick to 
perform drilling tasks.  Dual-activity technology allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than a sequential 
manner and reduces critical path activity, improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.
Under our license agreements with Transocean, which expired in May 2016, we were required to pay quarterly patent royalties of 
between 3 percent and 5 percent of revenues.  The Transocean Member agreed to retain and pay the obligation for the quarterly patent 
royalties.  As a result, we recognized non-cash operating expense for patent royalties, recorded in operating and maintenance costs and 
expenses, representing the patent royalties paid by the Transocean Member on our behalf, with corresponding entries to members’ equity.  
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized patent royalties expense of $2 million and $8 million, respectively.  In the 
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized patent royalties expense of $7 million and $12 million, respectively.
Credit agreement—On August 5, 2014, we entered into the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility with a Transocean affiliate.  See
Note 7—Credit Agreement.

Merger—On July 31, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Transocean and 
two wholly owned subsidiaries of Transocean.  Upon the closing of the merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we will merge 
with  one of  the  Transocean  subsidiaries,  with  Transocean Partners  continuing  as  the  surviving  company  as  a  wholly  owned  indirect 
subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.  Each of our common units that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing, other than units 
held by Transocean and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive 1.1427 Transocean Ltd. shares.  If the transaction is 
completed, our common units will cease to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The merger has been approved by our board of directors and our conflicts committee, by a special committee of the board of 
directors  of  Transocean Ltd.,  and  by  the  boards  of  directors  of  the  Transocean  subsidiary  companies  that  are  parties  to  the 
Merger Agreement.  Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by our 
unitholders including at least 50.1 percent of the common units not held by Transocean, and other customary closing conditions.  We 
estimate that the closing of the merger will take place in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Cash distribution to unitholders—On August 2, 2016, our board of directors approved a distribution of $0.3625 per unit to our 
unitholders.    We  expect  to  pay  the  aggregate  cash  distribution  of  $25 million  on  August 24,  2016  to  our  unitholders  of  record  as  of 
August 15, 2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member.
Cash  distribution  to  holder  of  noncontrolling  interests—Subsequent  to  June 30,  2016,  we  made  an  aggregate  cash
distribution of $12 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests.

Business
Transocean Partners LLC (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean 
Partners”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was  formed as a growth-oriented limited liability company by Transocean to own, operate and acquire 
modern,  technologically  advanced  offshore  drilling  rigs.    The  drilling  units  in  our  fleet  include  the  ultra-deepwater  drillships 
Discoverer Inspiration and Discoverer Clear Leader and the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III, which are located in 
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  We generate revenues through contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling 
fleet, related equipment and seconded work crews on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.
We own a 51 percent interest in each of the entities that owns and operates the drilling units in our fleet (each individually, a 
“RigCo”, and collectively, the “RigCos”).  Transocean Partners Holdings Limited (the “Transocean Member”), an indirect wholly owned 
subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.,  owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each  of the RigCos.   We control each RigCo 
through our ownership of the majority of its shares or limited liability company interests.  We are entitled to only 51 percent of the RigCos’ 
distributions, if any.  Our interest in the RigCos represents our only cash-generating asset.  We depend on Transocean affiliates to operate 
our drilling units, manage our customer relationships, renew existing and obtain new drilling contracts and to perform other administrative 
support activities.
Although our contract drilling services operations are currently concentrated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we can provide our 
services anywhere in the global offshore drilling market.  Although rigs can be moved from one region to another, the cost of moving rigs 
and  the  availability  of  rig-moving  vessels  may  cause  the  supply  and  demand  balance  to  fluctuate  somewhat  between  regions.    Still, 
significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility.  Our fleet operates in a single, global market 
for the provision of contract drilling services.  The location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to operate or upgrade our rigs are 
determined by the activities and needs of our customers.
Significant Events
Merger—On July 31, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Transocean and 
two wholly owned subsidiaries of Transocean.  Upon the closing of the merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we will merge 
with  one of  the  Transocean  subsidiaries,  with  Transocean Partners  continuing  as  the  surviving  company  as  a  wholly  owned  indirect 
subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.  Each of our common units that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing, other than units 
held by Transocean and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive 1.1427 Transocean Ltd. shares.  If the transaction is 
completed, our common units will cease to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The merger has been approved by our board of directors and our conflicts committee, by a special committee of the board of 
directors  of  Transocean Ltd.  and  by  the  boards  of  directors  of  the  Transocean  subsidiary  companies  that  are  parties  to  the 
Merger Agreement.  Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by our 
unitholders, including at least 50.1 percent of the common units not held by Transocean, and other customary closing conditions.  No 
Transocean shareholder vote will be required to complete the merger.  We estimate that the closing of the merger will take place in the 
fourth quarter of 2016.
Cash distributions to unitholders—On February 9, May 5 and August 2, 2016, our board of directors approved distributions of 
$0.3625 per  unit  to  our  unitholders.    On  February 25 and  May 24,  2016,  we  made  an  aggregate  cash  payment  of  $50 million  to  our 
unitholders  of  record  as  of  February 22 and  May 17,  2016,  including  an  aggregate  cash  distribution  of  $36 million  to  the  Transocean 
Member.  We expect to pay an aggregate cash distribution of $25 million on August 24, 2016 to our unitholders of record as of August 15, 
2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member.  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources 
and uses of liquidity.”
Cash distributions to holder of noncontrolling interests—In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we made an 
aggregate cash distribution of $45 million and $99 million, respectively, to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests.  In July 2016, 
we made an aggregate cash distribution of $12 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests.  See “—Liquidity and Capital 
Resources—Sources and uses of liquidity.”
Unit repurchase program—In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased 386,876 of our publicly held common units 
at an average market price of $8.23 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million.  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Sources and uses of liquidity.”

Outlook
Drilling market—Our long-term view of the offshore drilling market remains positive, particularly for high-specification assets; 
however, the near to medium term remains very challenging.  Low commodity pricing due to the current surplus of oil continues to hamper 
energy spending.  Our customers remain focused on maintaining their capital allocation policies, reducing their costs and limiting their 
spend on exploration and development opportunities in 2016.  The risks of project delays, contract renegotiations and contract terminations 
will continue.  As expected, few new contracts have been awarded year to date, and this trend is likely to continue through the remainder 
of 2016, resulting in falling rig utilization rates exacerbating the negative pressure on rig pricing.  Development Driller III is scheduled to 
complete its drilling contract in November 2016, and the rig could be idle for some period of time thereafter.  Over time, we believe the 
oversupply of oil will decrease as the current supply and demand imbalance narrows.  As spare oil capacity diminishes, we expect upward 
pressure on commodity pricing with subsequent increased demand for drilling rigs.
Fleet status—We present the availability of our rigs in terms of the uncommitted fleet rate.  The uncommitted fleet rate is defined 
as  the  number  of  uncommitted  days  divided  by  the  total  number  of  rig  calendar  days  in  the  measurement  period,  expressed  as  a 
percentage.  An uncommitted day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is idle or stacked, is not contracted to a customer and is 
not committed to a shipyard.
As of July 21, 2016, uncommitted fleet rates for the remainder of 2016 and for each of the subsequent four years in the period
ending December 31, 2020 were as follows:

Contract backlog—Contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days 
remaining  in  the  firm  contract  period,  excluding  revenues  for  mobilization,  demobilization  and  contract  preparation  or  other  incentive 
provisions.  Contract backlog represents the maximum contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering the contractual operating 
dayrate  in  effect  during  the  firm  contract  period  and  represents  the  basis  for  the  maximum  revenues  in  our  revenue  efficiency 
measurement.  To determine maximum revenues for purposes of calculating revenue efficiency, however, we include the revenues earned 
for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, other incentive provisions or cost escalation provisions, which are excluded from 
the amounts presented for contract backlog.  The contract backlog for our fleet was as follows:

Our  contract  backlog  includes  only  firm  commitments,  which  are  represented  by  signed  drilling  contracts.    The  contractual 
operating  dayrate  may  be  higher  than  the  actual  dayrate  we  ultimately  receive  or  an  alternative  contractual  dayrate,  such  as  a 
waiting-on-weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain circumstances.  The contractual operating 
dayrate  may  also  be  higher  than  the  actual  dayrate  we  ultimately  receive  because  of  a  number  of  factors,  including  rig  downtime  or 
suspension of operations.  In certain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period 
of time.  The actual dayrate we receive may be higher than the contractual rate under certain circumstances, such as when cost escalation 
provisions are applied.
The actual amounts of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will differ from the amounts 
and periods shown in the tables above due to various factors, including shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime and 
other factors that result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate.  Additional factors that could affect the 
amount and timing of actual revenue to be recognized include customer liquidity issues and contract terminations.

Average daily revenue—Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day.  An operating 
day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period after commencement of 
operations.  The average daily revenue for our fleet was as follows:

Our average daily revenue fluctuates primarily due to our revenue efficiency. 
Revenue efficiency—Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by 
the maximum revenue calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest 
amount  of  contract  drilling  revenues  the  drilling  unit  could  earn  for  the  measurement  period,  excluding  amounts  related  to  incentive 
provisions.  The revenue efficiency rates for our fleet were as follows:

Our revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting-on-weather
rate, repair rate, standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, revenues earned by Discoverer Inspiration and Discoverer Clear Leader and, in the 
three months  ended  June 30,  2015,  revenues  earned  by  Discoverer Inspiration  and  Development Driller III  each  exceeded  maximum 
revenues as a result of achieving certain contractual incentive bonuses.
Rig utilization—Rig utilization is defined as the total number of operating days divided by the total number of rig calendar days
in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  The rig utilization rates for our fleet were as follows:

Operating  revenues—Contract  drilling  revenues  decreased  for  the  three months  ended  June 30,  2016  compared  to  the 
three months  ended  June 30,  2015  primarily  due 
for 
Development Driller III  resulting  from  reduced  revenue  efficiency  and  (b) approximately  $2 million  of  decreased  revenues  for 
Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III resulting from reduced contractual dayrates.  These decreases were partially offset by 
approximately $2 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration resulting from increased revenue 
efficiency.

Costs and expenses—Operating and maintenance expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 
the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $8 million of decreased maintenance expense for 
all three rigs because of unplanned repairs and shipyard time in the prior-year period and no comparable activity in the current-year period 
and (b) approximately $4 million of decreased operating costs for all three rigs due to the expiration of the patent royalty arrangement in 
May 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $5 million of increased cost allocations from Transocean.
Income tax expense—For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our annual effective tax rate was 5.4 percent and 
5.8 percent,  respectively,  based  on  income  before  income  taxes  after  excluding  the  loss  on  impairment.    We  treat  the  tax  effect  of 
settlements  of  prior-year  tax  liabilities  and  changes  in  prior-year  tax  estimates  as  discrete  period  tax  expenses  or  benefits.    For  the 
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of less than $1 million and a 
net tax benefit  of less than $1 million, respectively.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate was 
5.7 percent based on income before income taxes, including these discrete items.

Operating revenues—Contract drilling revenues remained unchanged for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the 
six months ended June 30, 2015 with the following offsetting activity: (a) approximately $15 million of decreased revenues for all three rigs 
resulting  from  reduced  revenue  efficiency  and  (b) approximately  $2 million  of  decreased  revenues  for  Discoverer Clear Leader  and 
Development Driller III  resulting  from  reduced  contractual  dayrates,  offset  by  (c) approximately  $8 million  of  increased  revenues  for 
Discoverer Inspiration  resulting  from  an  increase  in  contractual  dayrate  and  (d) approximately  $9 million  of  increased  revenues  for 
Discoverer Inspiration resulting from improved utilization because of shipyard time in the prior-year period and no comparable activity in 
the current-year period.
Costs and expenses—Operating and maintenance expense decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 
the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $9 million of decreased maintenance costs for all 
three rigs because of unplanned repairs and shipyard time in the prior-year period and no comparable activity in the current-year period 
and (b) approximately $4 million of decreased operating costs for all three rigs due to the expiration of the patent royalty arrangement in 
May 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $4 million of increased cost allocations from Transocean.
General and administrative costs and expenses increased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2015 due to increased cost allocations from Transocean.
Loss on impairment—During the six months ended June 30, 2015, as a result of an interim impairment test, we recognized a
loss on the impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill.
Income tax expense—For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our annual effective tax rate was 5.4 percent and 
6.2 percent,  respectively,  based  on  income  before  income  taxes  after  excluding  the  loss  on  impairment.    We  treat  the  tax  effect  of 
settlements  of  prior-year  tax  liabilities  and  changes  in  prior-year  tax  estimates  as  discrete  period  tax  expenses  or  benefits.    For  the 
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of less than $1 million and a 
net  tax  benefit  of  less  than  $1 million,  respectively.    For  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016  and  2015,  our  effective  tax  rate  was

Net  cash  used  in  financing  activities  increased  for  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016  compared  to  the  six months  ended 
June 30,  2015  primarily  due  to  the  following:  (a) increased  distributions  to  the  holder  of  noncontrolling  interests,  (b) payments  to 
repurchase common units with no comparable cash flows in the prior-year period and (c) proceeds from affiliates for indemnification of lost 
revenues with no comparable cash flows in the current-year period.
Sources and uses of liquidity
Overview—We operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to finance the purchase of additional 
drilling  rigs  and  other  capital  expenditures,  fund  investments,  including  the  equity  portion  of  investments  in  drilling  rigs,  fund  working 
capital,  maintain  cash  reserves  against  fluctuations  in  operating  cash  flows  and  pay  distributions  to  our  unitholders.    We  may  also 
repurchase our common units under the unit repurchase program.  We expect to fund our short-term liquidity needs through cash on hand, 
borrowings under credit facilities provided by Transocean affiliates or commercial banks, cash generated from operations and issuance of 
debt or equity securities.
We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under existing or new credit 
facilities provided by Transocean affiliates or commercial banks and issuances of debt and equity securities.  Generally, our long-term 
sources of funds will be cash from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt and equity financings.  Because we will distribute 
all of our available cash, after deducting estimated maintenance, net of replacement capital expenditures, we expect to fund acquisitions 
and capital expenditures for expansion by relying on external financing sources, including bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and 
equity securities.
Our access to debt and equity markets may be limited due to a variety of events, including, among others, industry conditions, 
general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry.  Our ability to access such markets may be 
restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing 
economic and business conditions.  An economic downturn could have an impact on Transocean, which is the lender in our revolving 
credit facility, or on our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.
We intend to pay and we expect to have sufficient ability to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit per quarter, 
equivalent to $25 million per quarter, or approximately $99 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of outstanding common 
and subordinated units.  At July 26, 2016, we had 40.9 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units outstanding.  We do not 
have a legal obligation to pay this distribution, and the amount declared by our board of directors may vary from this minimum quarterly 
distribution depending on expectations for future transactions and activities in which we may engage.
The  Merger Agreement  restricts  our  ability  to  declare  cash  distributions,  in  excess  of  the  minimum  quarterly  distribution  of 
$0.3625 per unit, or to repurchase our common units without the consent of Transocean, provided, that we and Transocean have agreed 
to coordinate the timing of the closing of the merger to facilitate the payment of the regular quarterly distribution on our common units for 
the quarter ending September 30, 2016.
Cash distributions to unitholders—On February 9, May 5 and August 2, 2016, our board of directors approved distributions of 
$0.3625 per  unit  to  our  unitholders.    On  February 25  and  May 24,  2016,  we  made  an  aggregate  cash  payment  of  $50 million  to  our 
unitholders  of  record  as  of  February 22  and  May 17,  2016,  including  an  aggregate  cash  payment  of  approximately  $36 million  to  the
‐ 17 ‐
Transocean Member.  On August 24, 2016, we expect to make an aggregate cash payment of $25 million to our unitholders of record as of 
August 15, 2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member.
On February 9, May 4, July 30 and October 29, 2015, our board of directors approved distributions of $0.3625 per unit to our 
unitholders.  On February 26, May 27, August 25 and November 23, 2015, we made an aggregate cash distribution of $100 million to our 
unitholders of record as of February 20, May 15, August 12 and November 9, 2015, including an aggregate cash distribution of $71 million 
to the Transocean Member.
Cash  distributions  to  holder  of  noncontrolling  interests—In  July 2016,  we  made  an  aggregate  cash  distribution  of 
$12 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests.  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we made an aggregate 
cash  distribution  of  $45 million  and  $99 million,  respectively,  to  Transocean  as  holder  of  noncontrolling  interests.    In  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2015, we made an aggregate cash distribution of $101 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests.
Unit  repurchase  program—On  November 4,  2015,  we  announced  that  our  board  of  directors  approved  a  unit  repurchase 
program authorizing us to repurchase up to $40 million of our publicly held common units for cancellation.  Subject to market conditions, 
we may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  We may suspend or discontinue the 
program at any time.  As of July 26, 2016, since the inception of the unit repurchase program, we repurchased 478,376 of our publicly held 
common units at an average market price of $8.41 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $4 million.
Working  capital  note  payable—On  July 29,  2014,  we  entered  into  agreements  with  a  Transocean  affiliate  to  establish  a 
working capital note payable in the principal amount of $43 million that was due and payable at maturity on July 28, 2015.  On July 17, 
2015, we made a cash payment of $43 million to repay in full the borrowings outstanding under the working capital note payable.
Revolving credit facility—On August 5, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement, which is scheduled to expire on August 5, 
2019,  with  a  Transocean  affiliate  to  establish  a  committed  $300 million five-year  revolving  credit  facility  that  allows  for  uncommitted 
increases in amounts agreed to by Transocean and us (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility”).  We may borrow under the Five-Year 
Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (the “revolving credit facility margin”), 
which ranges from 1.625 percent to 2.250 percent based on our leverage ratio, as defined, or (2) the base rate specified in the credit 
agreement plus the revolving credit facility margin, less one percent per annum.  Throughout the term of the Five-Year Revolving Credit 
Facility,  we  are  required  to  pay  a  commitment  fee  on  the  daily  unused  amount  of  the  underlying  commitment,  which  ranges  from 
0.225 percent  to  0.325 percent  based  on  our  leverage  ratio,  as  defined.    Among  other  things,  the  Five-Year Revolving  Credit  Facility 
includes limitations on creating liens, incurring subsidiary debt, transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the 
sale of substantially all of our assets.  The Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility also includes a covenant imposing a maximum debt ratio, as 
defined in the agreement, with certain adjustments during a specified acquisition period.  Borrowings under the Five-Year Revolving Credit 
Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default.  At July 26, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding and 
$300 million of available borrowing capacity under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.
Lost revenues indemnification—Under the Omnibus Agreement, Transocean agreed to indemnify us for any lost revenues, up 
to $100 million, arising out of the failure to receive an operating dayrate from our customer for Discoverer Clear Leader, for the period 
commencing on the closing date of our initial public offering through  the completion of the rig’s 2014 special  periodic survey.  In the 
six months ended June 30, 2015, we received a cash payment of $10 million for such indemnification claims submitted in the year ended 
December 31, 2014.
Estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures—Subject to the approval by the board of directors of each of 
the RigCos, each RigCo will transfer its available cash to its equityholders, including the Transocean Member, as holder of noncontrolling 
interests, each quarter.  In determining the amount of cash available for transfer, the board of directors of each of the RigCos and our 
board of directors determine the amount of cash reserves to set aside, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital 
expenditures, working capital and other matters.  Because of the substantial capital expenditures the RigCos are required to make to 
maintain  their  fleets,  we  estimate  the  average  annual  maintenance  and  replacement  capital  expenditures  to  be  $69 million  per  year, 
including $50 million for long-term maintenance and classification society surveys and $19 million for replacing the rigs at the end of their 
useful lives.
We estimate $19 million per year for future rig replacement based on assumptions regarding the remaining useful life of the 
RigCos’ rigs, a net investment rate applied on reserves, replacement values of the RigCos’ rigs based on current market conditions, and 
the residual value of the rigs.  The actual cost of replacing the rigs in the RigCos’ fleet will depend on a number of factors, including 
prevailing market conditions, drilling contract operating dayrates and the availability and cost of financing at the time of replacement.  Our 
second amended and restated limited liability company agreement allows our board of directors to deduct from our operating surplus each 
quarter  estimated  maintenance  and  replacement  capital  expenditures,  as  opposed  to  actual  maintenance  and  replacement  capital 
expenditures, in order to reduce disparities in operating surplus caused by fluctuating maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, 
such as classification society surveys and rig replacement.  Our board of directors, with the approval of the conflicts committee, may 
determine that one or more of our assumptions should be revised, which could cause our board of directors to increase the amount of 
estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures.  We may elect to finance some or all of our maintenance and replacement 
capital  expenditures  through  the  issuance  of  additional  equity  securities,  which  could  be  dilutive  to  existing  unitholders.    As  our  fleet 
matures and expands, our long-term maintenance expenses will likely increase.

Contractual  obligations—As  of  June 30,  2016,  there  have  been  no material  changes  to  the  contractual  obligations  as 
previously disclosed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual 
report on Form 10–K.
Contingencies and Uncertainties
We are organized as a limited liability company under the laws of The Republic of the Marshall Islands and are a resident in the 
United Kingdom (“U.K.”) for taxation purposes.  We are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Certain of our 
controlled affiliates, including the RigCos, are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized, conduct business or own 
assets.  We calculate our provision for income taxes based on the laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and 
earn income.
In March 2016, the U.K. publicly announced its 2016 Budget and Finance Bill.  These tax reform proposals include measures 
that would deny tax deductions or require inclusion of taxable income for certain cross-border structure arrangements and transactions and 
are expected to be declared effective January 1, 2017.  The U.K. continues to modify the initial proposals.  Although the final legislation 
could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and an associated increase in tax costs, we do not believe that the 
proposals, as currently drafted, would result in an increase in our tax costs.  We continue to monitor developments for potential applicability 
to our structure.
Non-GAAP Measures
We present our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  We believe certain financial measures that are not prepared in 
conformity with U.S. GAAP, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP measures, provide 
users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity.  
We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provide management and external users of our financial statements, 
such as investors and commercial banks, with supplemental information that can be used to assess the following: (a) our performance 
from period to period and against performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost 
basis or capital structure, (b) the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our members, (c) our ability to 
incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and (d) the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the 
returns on investment of various investment opportunities.
We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense net of interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  We 
define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for losses on impairment, recognition of prior certification costs and license fees, recognition 
of non-cash patent royalties, recognition of the drilling contract intangible revenues and recognition of pre-operating revenues.  We define 
Distributable  Cash  Flow  as  Adjusted  EBITDA,  further  adjusted  for  planned  out-of-service  operating  and  maintenance  expense,  cash 
proceeds  from  pre-operating  revenues  associated  with  our  long-term  receivables,  estimated  maintenance  and  replacement  capital 
expenditures, cash interest income and expense and cash income taxes.
The U.S. GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are net income 
and  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.    EBITDA,  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  Distributable  Cash  Flow  should  not  be  considered  an 
alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of operating performance or 
liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow exclude some, but not all, 
items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and the preparation of such measures may vary among other 
companies.  Therefore, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of 
other companies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated 
financial statements.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with disclosures included in the notes to our condensed consolidated 
financial statements related to estimates, contingencies and other accounting policies.  Significant accounting policies are discussed in 
Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial 
statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
To prepare financial statements, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities,  revenues,  expenses  and  related  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities.    On  an  ongoing  basis,  we  evaluate  our 
estimates, including those related to our allocated costs and related party transactions, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and 
equipment,  drilling  contract  intangible  liability,  income  taxes  and  equity–based  compensation.    These  estimates  require  significant 
judgments and  assumptions.   We base our estimates on historical  experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our condensed consolidated 
financial  statements,  see  “Item 7.  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations—Critical 
Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  We have discussed the 
development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.  
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the types of judgments, assumptions and estimates 
upon which our critical accounting estimates are based. 
New Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have an effect on our consolidated 
financial  statements,  see  Notes  to  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements—Note 3—New  Accounting  Pronouncements  in  this 
quarterly report on Form 10–Q and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in 
our annual report on Form 10–K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
We qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”).  
As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five years after the date of our initial public offering, take advantage of specified 
exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including, but 
not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced 
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements 
of holding advisory say-on-pay votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.  In 
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition 
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  An emerging growth 
company  can,  therefore,  delay  the  adoption  of  certain  accounting  standards  until  those  standards  would  otherwise  apply  to  private 
companies.    We  have  elected  to  take  advantage  of  all  of  the  applicable  JOBS  Act  exemptions,  including  the  exemption  provided  by 
Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as described above.  This election to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with 
new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable.  Accordingly, the information that we provide you may be different than what 
you may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. 
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Credit risk—We are exposed to credit risk associated with having only two customers.  As of June 30, 2016, there have been no 
material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as previously disclosed under “Item 7A. Quantitative and 
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures—We  carried  out  an  evaluation,  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of 
management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  disclosure  controls  and 
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  as  defined  in  the  United  States  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as 
amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”),  Rules 13a-15  and  15d-15,  were  effective  as  of  June 30,  2016  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that 
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (1) accumulated and communicated to our 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and 
(2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s 
rules and forms.
Internal control over financial reporting—There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the 
quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting.

PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
As of June 30, 2016, we were not involved in any lawsuits or other matters that could have a material adverse effect on our
condensed consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Failure to complete, or delays in completing, the merger with Transocean could negatively impact the market price of our 
common units and our financial results.
Completion of the proposed merger with Transocean is subject to various conditions, including, among others, approval by our 
unitholders, the absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions, and the truth and accuracy of representations and warranties, including 
those relating to the absence of any material adverse effect.  There is no certainty that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and 
that the necessary approvals will be obtained.  If these or other conditions are not satisfied or if there is a delay in the satisfaction of such 
conditions,  then  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  merger  timely  or  at  all,  and  such  failure  or  delay  may  have  other  adverse 
consequences.  If the merger is not completed or is delayed, we will be subject to a number of risks, including:
 

 

we may not realize the expected benefits of the combined company; 
the market price of our common units may decline to the extent that their current market price reflects a market assumption that the 
merger will be completed; 
some costs relating to the merger, such as certain financial advisor and legal fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; and 
in specified circumstances, if the merger is not completed, we must pay Transocean  either a termination fee  of $15 million or up to 
$2.5 million in expense reimbursements.
  Until the merger with Transocean is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, we will not be able to pursue certain
other alternatives to the merger because of restrictions in the merger agreement.
Unless and until the merger agreement with Transocean is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, we are restricted from 
soliciting,  initiating  or  knowingly  encouraging  any  inquiry,  proposal  or  offer  for  an  alternative  transaction  with  any  person.    We  may 
terminate the merger agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been 
satisfied, including our compliance in all material respects with these non-solicitation provisions, and paying a $15 million termination fee.  
These  restrictions  could  affect  the  structure,  pricing  and  other  terms  proposed  by  other  parties  seeking  to  enter  into  an  alternative 
transaction with us and, as a result of these restrictions, we may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to an alternative 
transaction on more favorable terms without incurring potentially significant liability to Transocean. 
  While the merger with Transocean is pending, we may experience diminished productivity due to the impact of the merger
on our current and prospective employees and key management.
Our  management  may  be  required  to  devote  substantial  time  to  activities  related  to  the  merger,  which  could  otherwise  be 
devoted to pursuing other beneficial business opportunities.  Furthermore, our current and prospective employees may be uncertain about 
their future roles and relationships with the combined company following the completion of the merger.  This focus of management on the 
merger and employee uncertainty may also affect our productivity. 
  We will be subject to certain operating restrictions until completion of the merger.
The merger agreement with Transocean generally restricts us, without Transocean’s consent, from taking actions outside the 
ordinary course of business or from taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the merger agreement terminates.  These 
restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we might otherwise consider beneficial. 

The results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on 
global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national 
referendum.  The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least 
two years after the government of the U.K. formally initiates a withdrawal process.  Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant 
uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that 
will apply as the U.K. determines which European Union-derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal.  The referendum 
has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal.  These developments, or 
the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions 
and  the  stability  of  global  financial  markets,  and  may  significantly  reduce  global  market  liquidity  and  restrict  the  ability  of  key  market 
participants to operate in certain financial markets.  Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, 
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unit repurchase program
On  November 4,  2015,  we  announced  that  our  board  of  directors  approved  a  unit  repurchase  program  authorizing  us  to 
repurchase up to $40 million of our publicly held common units for cancellation.  Subject to market conditions, we may repurchase units 
from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  We may suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  As 
of  June 30,  2016,  since  inception  of  the  unit  repurchase  program,  we  repurchased  478,376 of  our  publicly  held  common  units  at  an 
average  market  price  of  $8.41 per  unit  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $4 million,  and  such  common  units  were  cancelled.    The 
Merger Agreement  restricts  our  ability  to  repurchase  our  common  units  without  the  consent  of  Transocean.    See  “Part I.  Item 2.
