<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on the issue of discrimination 
against women in law and in practice 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In this report, the Working Group examines discrimination against women and girls 
</p>
<p>in cultural and family life. The cultural construction of gender determines the role of 
</p>
<p>women and girls within the family, including in marriage. After analysing the impact of 
</p>
<p>culture and religion on the enjoyment of equal rights by women and girls in society and the 
</p>
<p>family, the Working Group redefines family by incorporating a gender perspective. In 
</p>
<p>reaffirming equality between the sexes and family diversity, it is necessary to apply the 
</p>
<p>principle of women&#8217;s right to equality in all forms of family law, in secular family law 
</p>
<p>systems, State-enforced religious family law systems and plural systems. After recalling the 
</p>
<p>obligation of States to combat discrimination against women in cultural and family life, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group makes several recommendations, drawing on good practices, for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of true equality between the sexes in cultural and family life.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 15/23 
</p>
<p>and 26/5. In chapter II, the Working Group summarizes its activities from the submission of 
</p>
<p>its last report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/26/39) until March 2015. In chapter 
</p>
<p>III, it addresses discrimination against women in cultural and family life.  
</p>
<p>2. The roles of Chairperson-Rapporteur and Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group 
</p>
<p>were carried out by Frances Raday and Emna Aouij, respectively, until January 2015, and 
</p>
<p>then by Emna Aouij and Eleonora Zielinska, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Sessions 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Working Group held three sessions during the period under review. At its tenth 
</p>
<p>session, held from 5 to 9 May 2014 in Geneva, it discussed various issues relating to 
</p>
<p>women in cultural and family life with a number of stakeholders, relevant parts of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Secretariat and other experts. At its eleventh session, held from 10 to 16 
</p>
<p>October 2014 in Geneva, the Working Group continued its consultations with several 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including the International Labour Organization and departments of the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. By way of follow-up 
</p>
<p>to the first meeting it organized in 2013, the Working Group held a seminar on the priority 
</p>
<p>theme of cultural and family life, bringing together several representatives of the regional 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms of America, Europe and Africa. At its twelfth session, held from 
</p>
<p>19 to 23 January 2015 in New York, the Working Group continued its cooperation with its 
</p>
<p>partners, including the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</p>
<p>Women (UN-Women), and with several Member States regarding the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>legal framework for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda and Beijing 
</p>
<p>+ 20. The Working Group consulted experts, academics and NGOs on the next priority 
</p>
<p>theme it will address, namely discrimination against women in the areas of health and 
</p>
<p>safety. It consolidated the information it had gathered to inform the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group visited Chile from 1 to 9 September 2014 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/40/Add.<footnote name="1">See www.ohchr.org/en/issues/women/wgwomen/pages/wgwomenindex.aspx.  
</footnote>), Peru from 10 to 19 September 2014 (A/HRC/29/40/Add.<footnote name="2">Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 21, para. 11.  </footnote>) and 
</p>
<p>Spain from 9 to 19 December 2014 (A/HRC/29/40/Add.<footnote name="3">6 See A/HRC/20/28/Add.1, paras. 18&#8211;22.  
</footnote>). It wishes to thank the 
</p>
<p>Governments of these countries for their cooperation before and during the visits and 
</p>
<p>thanks Senegal, Hungary, the United States of America and Maldives for responding 
</p>
<p>positively to its requests to visit. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Communications and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the period under review, the Working Group addressed communications to 
</p>
<p>Governments, individually or jointly with other special procedures mandate holders of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council. Those communications concerned a wide range of subjects falling 
</p>
<p>within its mandate, including discriminatory legislation on nationality, and the legal 
</p>
<p>minimum age for marriage, allegations of forced and/or early marriage, and sexual and 
</p>
<p>reproductive health (A/HRC/27/72, A/HRC/28/85 and A/HRC/29/50). The Working Group </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.15-07003 
</p>
<p>also issued press releases, individually or jointly with other mandate holders, treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>and regional mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Commission on the Status of Women 
</b></p>
<p>6. Alda Facio acted as moderator of a discussion on the realization of the rights of 
</p>
<p>marginalized and disadvantaged women and girls, on 18 March 2015, and participated in 
</p>
<p>other events at the fifty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 1 September 2014, Frances Raday, the Chairperson of the Working Group, wrote 
</p>
<p>to the President of the Human Rights Council regarding the lack of a reference to gender 
</p>
<p>equality within the family in Human Rights Council resolution 26/11 on the protection of 
</p>
<p>the family. On 3 October 2014, she presented a draft statement on the issue, which was 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures. On 2 December 2014, she 
</p>
<p>participated in a discussion on national action plans on business and human rights at the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights. On 2 and 3 December 2014, Emna 
</p>
<p>Aouij and Kamala Chandrakirana participated in a meeting of experts organized by the Due 
</p>
<p>Diligence Project on the role of the State and the due diligence principle in relation to 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in cultural and family life. During the period under review, 
</p>
<p>members of the Working Group participated in different activities relating to the Working 
</p>
<p>Group&#8217;s mandate in their respective regions.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic analysis: eliminating discrimination against women 
in cultural and family life, with a focus on the family as a 
cultural space 
</b></p>
<p>8. The legal rights of women and girls to equality and non-discrimination in cultural 
</p>
<p>and family life, established in 1948 by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, are often restricted in national laws and in practice, 
</p>
<p>including in cultural practice. The Working Group emphasizes that, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, States have an obligation to adopt appropriate measures 
</p>
<p>with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and girls in laws, 
</p>
<p>cultural practices and the family, whether perpetrated by State agents or private actors.  
</p>
<p>9. In order to prepare this report, the Working Group used responses to a questionnaire 
</p>
<p>received from 32 Member States, as well as studies and research by United Nations 
</p>
<p>programmes and bodies, international human rights mechanisms and other stakeholders that 
</p>
<p>were transmitted to it directly or have been carried out recently on the subject. 1  The 
</p>
<p>Working Group also identified good practices in respect of equality in the family and in 
</p>
<p>cultural life, as required by Human Rights Council resolution 15/23.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The cultural construction of gender 
</b></p>
<p>10. Culture is a broad concept encompassing all forms of conduct, organization and 
</p>
<p>human behaviour within society,2 including family, language, religion, philosophy, law, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>GE.15-07003 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>government, art and sport. 3  Cultural diversity occurs when culture is expressed and 
</p>
<p>develops in different contexts in society. Culture is not a static or unchanging concept, 
</p>
<p>although some States tend to present it as such in order to justify inequality between men 
</p>
<p>and women. This living, dynamic and evolving process4 permeates all human activities and 
</p>
<p>institutions, including legal systems, in all societies across the world.5 Viewing culture and 
</p>
<p>beliefs as immutable hinders the realization and development of all human rights, including 
</p>
<p>those of women. 
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group has taken as its basis the legal framework established by the 
</p>
<p>human rights community regarding the right of women to participate, on an equal footing 
</p>
<p>with men, in creating, contesting and recreating their cultures and in all aspects of cultural 
</p>
<p>life. The equal right of all persons to participate in, access and contribute to cultural life is 
</p>
<p>guaranteed by international human rights law, particularly articles 5 and 13, subparagraph 
</p>
<p>(c), of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p>article 27, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The construction of gender is deeply embedded in culture. In its general 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 28, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women indicates that &#8220;the term &#8216;gender&#8217; refers to socially constructed identities, attributes 
</p>
<p>and roles for women and men and society&#8217;s social and cultural meaning for these biological 
</p>
<p>differences resulting in hierarchical relationships between women and men and in the 
</p>
<p>distribution of power and rights favouring men and disadvantaging women. This social 
</p>
<p>positioning of women and men is affected by political, economic, cultural, social, religious, 
</p>
<p>ideological and environmental factors and can be changed by culture, society and 
</p>
<p>community.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>13. The cultural construction of gender is conducive to generalized discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women in all cultures. Discrimination against women and girls cannot, therefore, be 
</p>
<p>considered an essentialist element, present in certain cultures and not in others. Since 
</p>
<p>cultures are neither homogeneous nor unchanging, there are very significant differences 
</p>
<p>between them concerning their stages of development and the extent to which the 
</p>
<p>patriarchy, misogyny and practices that are harmful to women and girls exist within them. 
</p>
<p>14. Culture, when understood as a macro concept, also includes religion. Religion 
</p>
<p>constitutes an institutionalized aspect of culture, with its own sources of authority that 
</p>
<p>regulate social behaviour. It is often based on the concept of transcendental authority, and 
</p>
<p>most religions have codified normative systems. Change must be wrought within the 
</p>
<p>religious hierarchy of the community and must conform to the religious dogma of the 
</p>
<p>written sources. As a consequence, religions are often a haven against social and cultural 
</p>
<p>change. In all religions, there are movements that resist any change to the patriarchy and the 
</p>
<p>status of women and girls in the family. 7 Conversely, non-gender-based discriminatory 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Culture is understood here as a macro concept of human behaviour. The issue of women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>participation in cultural activities will not be analysed. The Working Group refers to the work of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights and fully supports the implementation of her 
</p>
<p>recommendations (see A/67/287).

</p>
<p>practices, including some previously defended in the name of culture and religion, such as 
</p>
<p>slavery, have been delegitimized or abandoned as values and ethics have evolved.8 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group notes the vital importance of article 5 of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which requires States to 
</p>
<p>modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to 
</p>
<p>achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary practices that are based on the idea 
</p>
<p>of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and 
</p>
<p>women. This provision establishes a legal basis for the primacy of women&#8217;s right to 
</p>
<p>equality over discriminatory cultural patterns of conduct, including those stemming from 
</p>
<p>religious edicts. 
</p>
<p>16. Culture and religion are often invoked to justify discrimination and violent practices 
</p>
<p>against women and girls. Women have often been viewed as objects rather than as equal 
</p>
<p>participants with men in the creation and manifestation of cultural principles. Indeed, when 
</p>
<p>culture and religion are invoked to justify different forms of discrimination against women, 
</p>
<p>women are seen not as victims or survivors of such discrimination, but as persons who 
</p>
<p>&#8220;violate&#8221; cultural rules and norms.9 
</p>
<p>17. Several United Nations human rights experts, special procedures mandate holders,10 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies 11  and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have established that 
</p>
<p>neither cultural diversity nor freedom of religion may justify discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>Discriminatory, repressive and violent practices against women should be eliminated, 
</p>
<p>whatever their origins, including those founded in culture or religion.12 The Working Group 
</p>
<p>is convinced that this opinion is crucial to securing women&#8217;s enjoyment of their right to 
</p>
<p>equality in all aspects of life.  
</p>
<p>18. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child have noted that harmful practices affecting women 
</p>
<p>and girls are deeply rooted in social attitudes according to which women and girls are 
</p>
<p>regarded as inferior to men and boys based on stereotyped roles.13 They highlight the 
</p>
<p>gender dimension to violence and indicate that sex- and gender-based attitudes and 
</p>
<p>stereotypes, power imbalances, inequalities and discrimination perpetuate the widespread 
</p>
<p>existence of practices that often involve violence or coercion. They maintain that the nature 
</p>
<p>and prevalence of these practices vary according to region and culture. These practices 
</p>
<p>cause serious harm to every aspect of the lives of the women and girls who fall victim to 
</p>
<p>them and include incest, female genital mutilation, early and/or forced marriage, so-called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;honour crimes&#8221;, dowry-related violence, neglect of girls, extreme dietary restrictions, 
</p>
<p>virginity tests, servitude, stoning, violent initiation rites, widowhood practices and female 
</p>
<p>infanticide.14 The obligations set out in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child form the 
</p>
<p>basis for the elaboration of a global strategy to eliminate harmful practices,15 which should

<p>be well defined, rights-based, have local relevance and comprise legal, economic and social 
</p>
<p>support measures combined with proportional political engagement and State responsibility 
</p>
<p>at all levels.  
</p>
<p>19. In many contexts, States fail to establish and enforce a clear legal hierarchy based on 
</p>
<p>the guarantees of equality and non-discrimination set forth in international human rights 
</p>
<p>law and national legislation, thus helping to maintain patriarchal modes of organization and 
</p>
<p>behaviours.16 Even when the law is independent of any religious source, it may be strongly 
</p>
<p>influenced by culture, deriving from dominant ideologies linked to religion, traditional 
</p>
<p>attitudes and social norms. Some States adopt national laws and regulations that restrict the 
</p>
<p>rights, power and mobility of women on the basis of essentialist points of view belonging to 
</p>
<p>a particular culture or religion. Conservative religious extremist movements impose strict 
</p>
<p>modesty codes in order to subjugate women and girls in the name of religion, particularly in 
</p>
<p>situations of political transition or conflict. For example, some branches of Islam have 
</p>
<p>reintroduced forced and/or early marriage and some branches of Christianity prevent 
</p>
<p>women from having access to therapeutic abortion. Religious extremism limits women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, including their right to health and economic activity, and they are generally subject 
</p>
<p>to harsh sanctions for crimes committed against the patriarchy, such as adultery. At the 
</p>
<p>international level, many States justify their reservations to articles of several human rights 
</p>
<p>conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women, in the name of preserving their cultures and religions. Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 16/3 on promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms through a 
</p>
<p>better understanding of traditional values of humankind and 26/11 on the protection of the 
</p>
<p>family threaten to undermine international achievements in the field of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>name of cultural and religious diversity.  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group is concerned about the considerable increase in laws and public 
</p>
<p>policies developed to protect culture and religion that threaten the universally established 
</p>
<p>standards on the rights of women. Gender-based stereotypes, often strengthened and 
</p>
<p>legitimized in national constitutions, laws and policies, are justified in the name of cultural 
</p>
<p>norms or religious beliefs. Failure to eliminate these stereotypes leads to the generalization 
</p>
<p>of practices that are harmful to women and girls. The sexist stereotypes present in the 
</p>
<p>media, on the Internet, in audiovisual productions and in video games contribute to the 
</p>
<p>perpetuation of a culture of discrimination and violence against women. 
</p>
<p>21. Women who do not conform to the gender stereotypes that predominate in some 
</p>
<p>cultures and those who openly contest them, including within their own cultural or religious 
</p>
<p>communities, are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, violence and criminalization. 
</p>
<p>They include, among others, single women, widows, female heads of family, lesbians, 
</p>
<p>bisexual and transgender women, sex workers and women human rights defenders. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group emphasizes that the obligation of States to protect cultural diversity applies 
</p>
<p>to diversity within cultures as well as between them. 
</p>
<p>22. While gender stereotypes pervade all aspects of human existence, women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>are at particular risk in the family, which is a locus for the perpetuation of traditional 
</p>
<p>values. The family is a product of patriarchal culture and a vital institution for upholding 
</p>
<p>the patriarchy. The Working Group emphasizes that women&#8217;s equal rights in the family are 
</p>
<p>closely linked to their rights in all areas of life, including public and political life and social, 
</p>
<p>economic and cultural life.

<p><b> B. The family: conceptual and sociological aspects 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Redefining the family by incorporating a gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>23. The family exists in various forms. The expression &#8220;diverse families&#8221; encompasses, 
</p>
<p>for example, single-parent families; families headed by women; intergenerational families 
</p>
<p>including, among others, grandparents; families headed by children, such as orphans or 
</p>
<p>street children; families comprising lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex 
</p>
<p>(LGBTI) persons; extended families; self-created and self-defined families; families 
</p>
<p>without children; families of divorced persons; polygamous families; and non-traditional 
</p>
<p>families resulting from interreligious, intercommunity or inter-caste marriages. Self-created 
</p>
<p>and self-defined families include, in particular, families formed in marginalized 
</p>
<p>communities. In all these different forms of family, women tend to be subject to legal 
</p>
<p>sanctions and to experience difficult social and economic situations. Indigenous and 
</p>
<p>minority women and women living in strict patriarchal, religious, traditional or caste 
</p>
<p>systems are more likely to be found in these forms of family and are especially vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to early and/or forced marriage, while men may have multiple households or second 
</p>
<p>families with their de facto spouses or partners.  
</p>
<p>24. The different forms of family and their recognition by the State are influenced by a 
</p>
<p>multitude of normative factors, such as culture, religion and caste, and behavioural factors, 
</p>
<p>such as livelihoods, sexuality and social status. Although several international forums 
</p>
<p>recognize family diversity, including &#8220;in different cultural, political and social systems&#8221;,17 
</p>
<p>many of the aforementioned non-traditional forms of family are not recognized by all 
</p>
<p>States. The family is often defined by legal systems as a unit founded on marriage between 
</p>
<p>a man and a woman, affecting rights relating to, for example, inheritance, property, child 
</p>
<p>custody, pensions, tax relief and social service provision. Laws and public institutions in 
</p>
<p>some States require a male family member or male guardian to initiate or conclude official 
</p>
<p>transactions, thus placing families headed by women or consisting solely of women at a 
</p>
<p>disadvantage. Families headed by women, like those headed by children, are more seriously 
</p>
<p>affected by poverty because of the discrimination they suffer. Given that State recognition 
</p>
<p>is often a condition for families to receive services and benefits, such as accommodation 
</p>
<p>and protection provided by the State and/or non-State actors, lack of recognition leads to 
</p>
<p>the marginalization of these families.  
</p>
<p>25. It is the opinion of the Working Group that the understanding and legal definition of 
</p>
<p>the family in national legislation should be extended to recognize different forms of family. 
</p>
<p>The recognition of same-sex couples, for both women and men, and other forms of family 
</p>
<p>is an example of good practice that a number of States have already implemented. In this 
</p>
<p>regard, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has confirmed that mothers who are 
</p>
<p>lesbians should not be deprived of custodial rights over their children.18 
</p>
<p>26. However, not all forms of marriage deserve recognition. The Working Group calls 
</p>
<p>for the non-recognition of those forms that discriminate against women and/or fail to ensure 
</p>
<p>equality and justice for women, whatever the legal system, religion, custom or tradition. 
</p>
<p>This refers to, among others, early and/or forced marriage, temporary marriage and 
</p>
<p>polygamy. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the

<p>Human Rights Committee19 have recommended that States should prohibit polygamy on the 
</p>
<p>grounds that it contravenes women&#8217;s right to equality with men and can have serious 
</p>
<p>emotional and financial consequences for women and their dependants.20 However, there 
</p>
<p>are national civil codes that legalize polygamous marriage, early and/or forced marriage 
</p>
<p>and temporary marriage. The Working Group advocates the repeal of these codes. Among 
</p>
<p>the countries that deem such marriages to discriminate against women and girls, some 
</p>
<p>consider them void and others merely voidable. In all cases, the legal solution must protect 
</p>
<p>the rights of women and girls, who remain the victims of these harmful marriages. Their 
</p>
<p>rights to subsistence, to property, including land and inheritance, to a place of residence, to 
</p>
<p>custody of children and to remarry must be guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>27. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has 
</p>
<p>recommended the prohibition and annulment of these marriages, which violate the dignity 
</p>
<p>of women, and calls for safeguards and guarantees to protect the rights of women and girls 
</p>
<p>living in such families. 21 Invalidating an early marriage protects the minor spouses by 
</p>
<p>restoring their single status so that they are deemed never to have been married, rather than 
</p>
<p>divorced, and by cancelling all financial or property transactions linked to the marriage.22 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Women</b>&#8217;<b>s right to equality in the family 
</b></p>
<p>28. All legal definitions of the family should include the right to equality, de jure and de 
</p>
<p>facto, of women and girls within the family. Full equality between women and men, and 
</p>
<p>girls and boys, is a requirement of international human rights law and constitutes a right of 
</p>
<p>women that is vital for the well-being of the family and for society as a whole.  
</p>
<p>29. International human rights law guarantees gender equality in the family, including 
</p>
<p>when marriage is entered into, during marriage and at its dissolution, as set out in article 16 
</p>
<p>of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 23 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights. Article 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
</p>
<p>of Discrimination against Women establishes the obligation of States to ensure gender 
</p>
<p>equality in all matters relating to marriage and family relations, including in respect of the 
</p>
<p>decision whether to marry, the free choice of spouse, rights and responsibilities as parents, 
</p>
<p>the decision on the number and spacing of children, and personal rights as husband and 
</p>
<p>wife. Similarly, articles 1 to 3 of the 1962 Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum 
</p>
<p>Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages require States to ensure gender equality 
</p>
<p>regarding consent to marriage, to specify a legal minimum age for marriage and to register 
</p>
<p>marriages.  
</p>
<p>30. When the rules governing family relations discriminate against women, they violate 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. Furthermore, considerations linked to protecting and 
</p>
<p>strengthening the family may not be invoked to justify forms of family that do not meet the 
</p>
<p>requirement for equality between men and women and girls and boys. The lack of equality 
</p>
<p>in these forms of marriage leads women and girls to experience discrimination, making 
</p>
<p>them vulnerable to domestic violence.

<p>31. The family is the basic unit of society and, as such, should be strengthened. It is 
</p>
<p>entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support.23 The family plays a key role in 
</p>
<p>social development and in the growth and well-being of children, including girls. Women 
</p>
<p>and girls&#8217; ability to act and participate in the different aspects of life in society derives 
</p>
<p>mainly from respect for their right to equality with men and boys in the family. In this 
</p>
<p>context, the Working Group deems it essential for families to be formed in such a way that 
</p>
<p>women and girls&#8217; right to equality is fully recognized, respected, protected, fulfilled and 
</p>
<p>promoted. 
</p>
<p>32. The Human Rights Council, however, in its resolution 26/11 on the protection of the 
</p>
<p>family, did not reaffirm the right of women to equality in the family. In October 2014, the 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders issued a statement calling on the Council to ensure that 
</p>
<p>the right to equality between women and men, and girls and boys, was included in all future 
</p>
<p>resolutions concerning the family.24 
</p>
<p>33. Several States, in the name of culture or religion, have entered reservations to article 
</p>
<p>16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p>which requires gender equality in marriage and the family. Withdrawal of reservations to 
</p>
<p>article 16 of the Convention, and also to articles 2 and 5, represents good practice and a 
</p>
<p>vital step towards the establishment of an effective legal framework to protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>women in the family and in cultural life. Morocco and Tunisia have thus recently 
</p>
<p>withdrawn reservations to the Convention, including to article 16. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>shares the opinion of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>to the effect that reservations to articles 2 and 16 are incompatible with the object and 
</p>
<p>purpose of the Convention, and it reiterates the importance of States&#8217; withdrawing their 
</p>
<p>reservations to these articles, and to article 5, so as to ensure gender equality in cultural and 
</p>
<p>family life. It is the responsibility of States to respect their international commitments and 
</p>
<p>the clear choices they have made regarding the primacy of international legal standards on 
</p>
<p>gender equality over national secular, religious or customary legal standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Manifestations of discrimination against women in the family 
</b></p>
<p>34. The role of women in the family has generally been under patriarchal control in 
</p>
<p>cultures and religions that subject women and girls to forced and/or early marriage and 
</p>
<p>discrimination in a number of areas of family life, such as consent to enter into marriage, 
</p>
<p>dowry obligations, the right to possess and manage property, sexual relations, requirements 
</p>
<p>regarding modesty and freedom of movement, guardianship and custody of children, 
</p>
<p>divorce and division of matrimonial assets, the punishment of adultery, the right to remarry 
</p>
<p>following dissolution of the marriage or death of the husband, the status of widows and 
</p>
<p>inheritance. In addition, women and girls are generally not treated equally in families with 
</p>
<p>regard to the division of rights and responsibilities. Discrimination against women and girls 
</p>
<p>in the family and in marriage affects all aspects of their lives. 
</p>
<p>35. In many cultures and religions, wives have a duty of obedience, and husbands have 
</p>
<p>the right to punish their wives, including physically. The provision of sexual services by 
</p>
<p>wives is deemed part of their duty to obey their husbands, 25  and marital rape is not 
</p>
<p>prohibited.26 The Working Group welcomes the introduction of laws criminalizing domestic 
</p>
<p>violence in around 130 countries but finds it regrettable that only 52 countries explicitly 
</p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p>criminalize marital rape.27 Domestic violence has a considerable impact on women, causing 
</p>
<p>more deaths than civil wars and entailing much higher economic costs than those linked to 
</p>
<p>homicides or civil wars.28 
</p>
<p>36. In some countries, legislative provisions strengthen patriarchal family structures, as 
</p>
<p>well as the concomitant discrimination and violence against women. This is particularly 
</p>
<p>true of provisions allowing rapists to marry their victims in order to escape legal 
</p>
<p>proceedings and laws that exclude marital rape from the prohibition of rape under criminal 
</p>
<p>law. In some contexts, only men are able to transmit their nationality to their foreign 
</p>
<p>spouses and their children. This de jure inequality has considerable effects on women and 
</p>
<p>their children because the State protection granted by citizenship is refused them de facto.29 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal sources of family law 
</b></p>
<p>37. Family law may derive from various legal sources in a State, such as constitutions, 
</p>
<p>laws, judicial decisions, and religious and customary codes. However, States are required, 
</p>
<p>under international human rights law, to respect, protect and realize women&#8217;s right to 
</p>
<p>equality in the family, regardless of the source of family law. 
</p>
<p>38. National constitutions are generally the supreme law in most States and form the 
</p>
<p>foundation of the State&#8217;s institutional and legal structures. They also provide the framework 
</p>
<p>for the elimination of discrimination against women. An explicit constitutional guarantee of 
</p>
<p>gender equality is fundamental to combating discrimination against women and girls in law 
</p>
<p>and in practice. Many countries have already recognized and enshrined this principle of 
</p>
<p>equality in their constitutional laws, and it is essential that it apply in all areas of law, 
</p>
<p>including family law.<footnote name="3">2 See A/HRC/26/39/Add.2, para. 17.  </footnote>0 
</p>
<p>39. Family law primarily addresses personal status and relations between family 
</p>
<p>members. 
</p>
<p>40. In addition, secondary family law covers such areas as taxation, social security, 
</p>
<p>retirement benefits, survivors&#8217; benefits and the right to family reunification. 
</p>
<p>41. The three main systems of family law are secular law systems, religious law systems 
</p>
<p>and plural systems. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Secular family law systems 
</b></p>
<p>42. In most countries, family law is regulated by secular codes that have been 
</p>
<p>established by the State, under civil or common law systems, and have no basis in religious 
</p>
<p>or customary norms. Secular family law was originally patriarchal. The very being or legal 
</p>
<p>existence of the woman was &#8220;suspended during the marriage, or at least [was] incorporated 
</p>
<p>and consolidated into that of the husband&#8221;.<footnote name="3">9 Ibid., p. 68.

</p>
<p>and guardianship and custody of children. Moreover, women had to pledge obedience to 
</p>
<p>their husbands, and marital rape and corporal punishment were permitted. 
</p>
<p>43. Reforming family codes is essential to establishing, in national legislation, women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>equal status in marriage and the family structure. Two types of process can be observed 
</p>
<p>with regard to the promotion of gender equality in family law. 
</p>
<p>44. The first process is the elimination of discriminatory laws on the family and the 
</p>
<p>promotion of gender equality within secular law systems. This sort of legal reform took 
</p>
<p>place in some of these systems from the end of the nineteenth century, when many States 
</p>
<p>reformed their laws on the family by separating religion from the State and introducing 
</p>
<p>measures to promote women&#8217;s equality within marriage and the family, including the right 
</p>
<p>of married women to conclude contracts, own property, inherit, divorce, and have 
</p>
<p>guardianship and custody of children, on an equal basis with men. Secular family law 
</p>
<p>systems thus moved from being patriarchal to adopting a more egalitarian approach, which 
</p>
<p>now represents good practice in ensuring gender equality in the family. A recent example is 
</p>
<p>the Marriage Law in China, as amended in 2001, which nullified all bigamous marriages 
</p>
<p>and all marriages in which one of the parties had not reached the legal minimum age for 
</p>
<p>marriage, repealing traditionalist patriarchal laws on the family and affirming gender 
</p>
<p>equality in the family.32 
</p>
<p>45. The second process is the transition from patriarchal religious family law to a 
</p>
<p>secular family law system that provides for gender equality in the family. Several States 
</p>
<p>where family law was based on patriarchal religious codes have introduced equality for 
</p>
<p>women in the family by revoking religious laws and regulating family affairs under secular 
</p>
<p>codes. In many European countries, family law was based on religious, primarily Christian, 
</p>
<p>laws, and all marriages were thus placed under religious jurisdiction. At the end of the 
</p>
<p>nineteenth century, all matters relating to family were placed under the secular jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>of the State, thereby removing the religious hegemony in this area. 
</p>
<p>46. In some secular family law systems, elements of discrimination remain, for example 
</p>
<p>a lower legal minimum age for marriage for girls and discriminatory provisions on 
</p>
<p>inheritance rights, divorce and recognition of same-sex couples. 
</p>
<p>47. Moreover, some secular family law systems allow family matters to be decided in 
</p>
<p>parallel religious or customary law systems, whether formal or informal. The implications 
</p>
<p>for women&#8217;s right to equality of such systems are discussed in the sections on plural legal 
</p>
<p>systems. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. State-enforced religious family law systems 
</b></p>
<p>48. Several States have no secular family code and regulate personal status either by 
</p>
<p>integrating religious laws on the family into constitutional or legislative provisions or by 
</p>
<p>granting religious authorities or religious tribunals jurisdiction over personal status so that 
</p>
<p>they may apply the family codes derived from the sacred texts. Currently, a large number of 
</p>
<p>States that have Islam as their State religion, such as the Islamic and Arab republics, 
</p>
<p>regulate the personal status of all citizens by applying Islamic law from the Koran and the 
</p>
<p>Sunna. Although the notion of the equality of men and women before the law is often 
</p>
<p>incorporated in their constitutions, some States maintain that this equality does not apply in 
</p>
<p>the case of laws on the family and on marital or personal status. Some States that recognize 
</p>
<p>the legal competence of a majority religion in the State also grant non-majority religions 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction over their own communities of faithful, such as Lebanon (Muslim majority), 
</p>
<p>India (Hindu majority) and Israel (Jewish majority). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>GE.15-07003 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>49. Some States that apply religious or customary law to regulate personal status have 
</p>
<p>reinforced the traditional prohibitions on adultery by criminalizing it. Adultery, which is 
</p>
<p>defined as any sexual relation outside marriage, is severely punished and may even result in 
</p>
<p>a sentence of death by stoning in some States that apply Islamic law. The sanctions are 
</p>
<p>generally imposed on the women rather than the men. Interventions by foreign 
</p>
<p>Governments, civil society and special procedures mandate holders have sometimes led to 
</p>
<p>judgements that imposed stoning to be overturned. In some states in the United States of 
</p>
<p>America, adultery between married persons is a crime, but these provisions have not been 
</p>
<p>implemented in the last thirty years. The Working Group issued a statement calling for the 
</p>
<p>decriminalization of adultery33 and wishes to recall that criminalization of sexual relations 
</p>
<p>between consenting adults is a violation of their right to privacy and an infringement of 
</p>
<p>article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>50. Reforms to introduce a measure of equality for women in family law have come 
</p>
<p>about in two different ways in countries where family law was based solely on religious 
</p>
<p>law. The first involves reform based on religious interpretation (hermeneutics). The 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has argued, in several of 
</p>
<p>its concluding observations, that evolving customs and the variety of possible 
</p>
<p>interpretations of religious law offer potential for progress towards equality, while at the 
</p>
<p>same time encouraging States parties to move in that direction. 34 Reforms of religious 
</p>
<p>family codes, based on interpretations of sacred texts that favour equality, have taken place 
</p>
<p>in some Muslim-majority countries, which have carried out legislative reforms founded on 
</p>
<p>progressive interpretations of sharia. For example, Tunisia was one of the first countries 
</p>
<p>with Islam as the State religion to enact a progressive Personal Status Code guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>gender equality;35 in 2004, Morocco embarked on a far-reaching reform of its family law, 
</p>
<p>paving the way for significant progress towards gender equality;36 Tunisia, Turkey37 and 
</p>
<p>Benin have adopted legislation against polygamy; in Indonesia, Islamic tribunals 
</p>
<p>institutionalized the appointment of women judges in religious tribunals in 1989, thus 
</p>
<p>encouraging more gender-sensitive rulings. 
</p>
<p>51. The second way to reform patriarchal religious family law involves the replacement 
</p>
<p>of religious family law with secular law. In traditionally Christian States, such as Italy in 
</p>
<p>1970 and Greece in 1982, civil family codes were introduced to replace religious personal 
</p>
<p>laws. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Plural legal systems 
</b></p>
<p>52. Plural legal systems are systems in which various laws coexist. They may include 
</p>
<p>various combinations of codified civil law, religious law systems, indigenous or customary 
</p>
<p>legal codes, community arbitration or other dispute settlement procedures. Plural legal 
</p>
<p>systems may be formal or informal. They most often affect personal status law and family 
</p>
<p>law. In States with plural legal systems, the State legal system, which is generally civil and 
</p>
<p>codified, and the State courts address matters relating to the public sphere. 
</p>
<p>53. Several States have adopted this type of legal system as a way of acknowledging 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity. However, legal pluralism is also used by some actors to promote political 
</p>

</p>
<p>and ideological interests. Approximately 80 per cent of claims or disputes are resolved by 
</p>
<p>parallel justice systems, signifying that most women in developing countries access justice 
</p>
<p>in a plural legal environment.38 The existence of social, economic, institutional and cultural 
</p>
<p>barriers and the lack of confidence in formal systems may explain the widespread use of 
</p>
<p>these parallel systems. Poverty and a lack of information on accessing formal justice and 
</p>
<p>education are the main factors that lead women to use parallel justice systems. 
</p>
<p>54. Parallel justice systems apply religious, customary or indigenous laws, which, as 
</p>
<p>shown above, are patriarchal. These systems are mostly dominated by men and therefore 
</p>
<p>tend to perpetuate inequalities and patriarchal interpretations of culture, resulting in 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women. Regardless of whether the law is religious or customary, its 
</p>
<p>provisions are often interpreted differently for men and women. The rulings and procedures 
</p>
<p>of these legal mechanisms generally discriminate against women. Moreover, gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence is seldom punished and is sometimes downplayed by religious or customary law 
</p>
<p>courts. 
</p>
<p><i>  Formal legal pluralism 
</i></p>
<p>55. Legal pluralism is formal when the State, through its constitution, laws or judicial 
</p>
<p>decisions, has granted authority to a religious, indigenous or customary court, tribunal or 
</p>
<p>arbitrator to exercise jurisdiction over personal status matters for women. Such systems are 
</p>
<p>generally recognized in State legislation and some are regulated by the State, which may 
</p>
<p>establish appeals procedures, ensure compliance with State legislation or even provide 
</p>
<p>financial or material support. 
</p>
<p>56. Good practice in protecting women&#8217;s right to equality in formal plural legal systems 
</p>
<p>takes several forms. The adoption of constitutional laws that require autonomous courts, 
</p>
<p>tribunals or arbitrators to respect women&#8217;s right to equality in terms of both women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>representation in justice systems and the formulation and application of procedural and 
</p>
<p>substantive rules is a good practice implemented in several States. Since the 1980s, 11 
</p>
<p>Latin American States have formally recognized indigenous laws and courts in their 
</p>
<p>constitutional laws, requiring the legal systems of indigenous communities to respect and 
</p>
<p>enforce women&#8217;s rights.39 
</p>
<p>57. The right to appeal, before the State courts, discriminatory decisions of indigenous 
</p>
<p>courts, tribunals or arbitrators is another good practice. The commitment of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women in some countries, such as Mexico and Ecuador,<footnote name="4">1 Ibid., p. 25.  </footnote>0 to securing State recognition of 
</p>
<p>parallel systems has enabled them to challenge, in the State system, the discrimination they 
</p>
<p>suffered in indigenous legal systems. Women&#8217;s participation as legal arbitrators, and also as 
</p>
<p>lawmakers, is needed to draw attention to discrimination and to sensitive subjects such as 
</p>
<p>rape or domestic violence, most victims of which are women. 
</p>
<p>58. Affirming the primacy of international human rights law and constitutional laws 
</p>
<p>over religious, customary and indigenous laws is a key step towards ensuring women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>emancipation and autonomy. Customary, religious and indigenous laws and provisions on 
</p>
<p>family affairs must be consistent with the constitutional norms on equality. To ensure more 
</p>
<p>effective application of the principle of equality, State monitoring and oversight bodies 
</p>
<p>must be put in place, as has been done in Canada, Colombia and South Africa.<footnote name="4">0 Ibid., p. 77.

<p><i>  Informal legal pluralism 
</i></p>
<p>59. Jurisdiction is exercised informally when jurisdictional powers are not the result of 
</p>
<p>an express grant of judicial authority by the State. Such jurisdiction is generally not 
</p>
<p>recognized by the State. Such situations may arise when religious, indigenous or customary 
</p>
<p>authority is exercised by judges, arbitrators or other alternative dispute settlement 
</p>
<p>procedures that are not authorized or tolerated by the State and/or of which the State is 
</p>
<p>unaware. These systems operate without oversight by the State, and, while some may have 
</p>
<p>been recognized previously in law, often under former colonial systems, they are now 
</p>
<p>beyond State control. 
</p>
<p>60. When the State becomes aware of such informal systems, it must put in place 
</p>
<p>oversight mechanisms and procedures for appeals to the State justice system to quash 
</p>
<p>decisions that discriminate against women. The State must make an effort to provide 
</p>
<p>alternatives to these informal legal systems, for example, by rendering the formal State 
</p>
<p>system more accessible. 
</p>
<p>61. Plural legal systems create complex and confusing legal situations. Various United 
</p>
<p>Nations treaty bodies have sought to show how these systems limit women&#8217;s enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>the right to equality in their private and public lives, while acknowledging the richness of 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity.42 Even if there is no special recognition by the State of informal legal 
</p>
<p>systems or formal delegation of functions by the State to traditional chiefs, the State should 
</p>
<p>extend its protection, as referred to in article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The role of the State in ensuring respect for women and girls</b>&#8217;<b> right to 
equality in cultural and family life 
</b></p>
<p>62. The State has an obligation to respect women&#8217;s right to equality within the family 
</p>
<p>and should eliminate any laws, including customary or religious laws,43 that discriminate 
</p>
<p>against women and any discriminatory acts carried out by State authorities. The obligation 
</p>
<p>not to discriminate against women is direct and absolute. A State will be in violation of this 
</p>
<p>obligation if it has a law that discriminates against women, regardless of whether its family 
</p>
<p>law system is secular, religious or plural. 
</p>
<p>63. The State has a direct obligation to protect and respect women&#8217;s right to equality in 
</p>
<p>all the forms of family law considered above. It is held responsible for any breach of its 
</p>
<p>obligations, including in cases where it has, through its constitution, laws or judicial 
</p>
<p>decisions, assigned jurisdiction over family law matters to a religious, indigenous or 
</p>
<p>customary court, tribunal or authority. Moreover, the State has an obligation to exercise due 
</p>
<p>diligence to guarantee and protect women&#8217;s right to equality in informal plural legal 
</p>
<p>systems. 
</p>
<p>64. The State must refrain from adopting laws, policies, measures or regulations that 
</p>
<p>discriminate directly or indirectly against women and girls and must ensure that its 
</p>
<p>officials, and private actors, respect this obligation in all contexts, including those situations 
</p>
<p>where women are most vulnerable (as refugees, migrants or stateless persons, for example). 
</p>
<p>65. The obligation of the State to protect women and girls&#8217; right to equality in the family 
</p>
<p>compels the authorities to prevent discrimination by private actors. Due diligence as a

</p>
<p>principle of State action should result in a global model of prevention, protection, 
</p>
<p>prosecution, punishment and redress for acts of discrimination and violence against women 
</p>
<p>in cultural and family life. 
</p>
<p>66. To prevent any violation in cultural and family life, the State must challenge cultural 
</p>
<p>discourse and cultural norms that discriminate against women and perpetuate structural 
</p>
<p>discrimination, taboos or stereotypes based on gender. Attitudes and behaviours towards 
</p>
<p>women must be changed, and women&#8217;s access to employment, education and finance, as 
</p>
<p>well as the safety of their homes and children, must be ensured by the State in order to 
</p>
<p>reduce gender inequalities. 
</p>
<p>67. In terms of protection, the State must set up effective services that respond to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s needs in the short, medium and long term. Risks and factors that may lead to 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women must be identified proactively so that effective interventions 
</p>
<p>may be staged before violations are committed. 
</p>
<p>68. In the event of violations and discrimination against women, the State has an 
</p>
<p>obligation to investigate and prosecute. The State must take measures to guarantee privacy, 
</p>
<p>confidentiality and safety of victims, and to address women&#8217;s needs and fears, while 
</p>
<p>ensuring that they are not subject to stigmatization, social ostracism or reprisals. The State 
</p>
<p>must be able to foster confidence in the police and the judicial process, including within 
</p>
<p>plural legal systems. To this end, it must ensure that State bodies and courts systematically 
</p>
<p>apply the principle of equality when interpreting and enforcing the law and that they do so 
</p>
<p>in conformity with international standards. The Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women has pointed out that, where this is not possible, the State is 
</p>
<p>still liable and must take appropriate action.44 
</p>
<p>69. The State has an obligation to punish and to put an end to impunity and excuses or 
</p>
<p>justification that perpetuate gender-based discrimination in cultural and family life. The 
</p>
<p>State also has an obligation to afford redress for the harm suffered by women, including by 
</p>
<p>providing for compensation, restitution, guarantees of non-repetition and even preventive 
</p>
<p>measures. 
</p>
<p>70. Ensuring access to justice for women and girls who have suffered discrimination 
</p>
<p>within the family or in cultural life is part of the State obligation to protect and respect their 
</p>
<p>right to equality. This access must be guaranteed at the legislative and institutional levels. 
</p>
<p>This means, for example, revising all additional laws that affect family and personal status 
</p>
<p>matters, a process in which women must be involved. Also concerned are auxiliary 
</p>
<p>regulations, including special measures adopted, where necessary, in such areas as taxation, 
</p>
<p>social security, retirement benefits, survivors&#8217; benefits, rights relating to nationality and the 
</p>
<p>right to family reunification, to ensure women and girls&#8217; de facto equality in the various 
</p>
<p>types of family. Women must take part in the formulation and interpretation of national 
</p>
<p>laws, including those relating to family affairs. At the institutional level, they must be 
</p>
<p>involved, on an equal footing, in policy development and judicial bodies so as to ensure that 
</p>
<p>the principle of equality is effectively applied and that decisions handed down demonstrate 
</p>
<p>respect for gender equality. Improving access to justice for women also requires gender-
</p>
<p>equality training for State authorities and non-State officials responsible for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement, social services and education and for medical and forensic personnel.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The cultural construction of gender makes women</b>&#8217;<b>s subjection to gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination and violence appear to be inherent and immutable. The patriarchal 
</b></p>
<p><b>family is the product of this construction and the most important social mechanism 
</b></p>
<p><b>for its perpetuation. Women and girls</b>&#8217;<b> human potential is restricted in families. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognition that women</b>&#8217;<b>s rights are human rights and that they are universal and 
</b></p>
<p><b>indivisible has laid bare the adverse impact of this gender construction on women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls in families and communities. The need for a paradigm shift has been clearly set 
</b></p>
<p><b>out in international human rights law, which, since 1948, has established women</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to equality in all spheres of life, in culture and in the family. As Eleanor 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roosevelt said as far back as 1958: </b>&#8220;<b>Where, after all, do universal human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>begin? In small places, close to home </b>&#8211;<b> so close and so small that they cannot be seen 
</b></p>
<p>on any maps of the world. [&#8230;] Such are the places where every man, woman, and 
</p>
<p><b>child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.</b>&#8221;45 
</p>
<p>72. <b>The State must act as an agent of change as regards women</b>&#8217;<b>s place in cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>and family life, by fostering and creating a culture free of all forms of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women.</b>46 <b>A transformative approach to women and girls</b>&#8217;<b> status in the family 
</b></p>
<p><b>is crucial. There needs to be awareness that, in the past, a patriarchal concept of 
</b></p>
<p><b>family pervaded all secular, religious, customary and indigenous laws and institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that some States and groups are now trying, in a retrograde manner, to subject 
</b></p>
<p><b>women to the most oppressive forms of patriarchy, particularly in the context of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious fanaticism. It should also be understood that the transition towards equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>between women and men, and girls and boys, in the culture and in the family is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>prerequisite for a decent society.</b> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establish a national legal framework recognizing gender equality in 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural and family life, in accordance with regional and international standards: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Recognize and enshrine, in their constitutions and laws, the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality, which should apply in all areas of life and have primacy over all 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious, customary and indigenous laws, norms, codes and rules, with no 
</b></p>
<p><b>possibility of exemption, waiver or circumvention; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) Promote access to, participation in and contributions by women to all 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of cultural life, including the definition, creation and interpretation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural and religious norms and practices, by providing equal resources, 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopting special measures and policies, and facilitating </b>women&#8217;s<b> access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making positions and policymaking processes, at all levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Develop national strategies to eradicate cultural practices that 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminate against women and girls, as well as gender stereotypes, through 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising campaigns, educational and informational programmes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholder mobilization. Engage men, as appropriate, in prevention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection efforts in respect of gender-based discrimination and violence;

<p><b> (iv) Develop effective mechanisms to combat the multiple and intersecting

</b></p>
<p><b>minority women, women living in poverty, women with disabilities, refugee and 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>women, older women and single women; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Promote a culture free of discrimination: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Establish an executive body that applies the due diligence framework

<p><b> (ii) Reject any cultural or religious practice that violates human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the principle of equality or prevents the establishment of an egalitarian society

<p><b>free of gender-based discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Punish institutions, State officials and non-State actors whose actions 
</b></p>
<p><b>threaten women</b>&#8217;<b>s rights, even where the grounds for such actions are the 
</b></p>
<p><b>preservation of culture and religion;

<p><b> (c) Guarantee women</b>&#8217;<b>s de jure and de facto right to equality in family 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Recognize and protect, in their constitutions and laws, all forms of

</b></p>
<p><b>diversity, by adopting and implementing appropriate measures to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>women from exploitation and discrimination in diverse families, particularly 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) Eliminate in law and in practice all forms of marriage that restrict 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or deny women and girls</b>&#8217;<b> rights, well-being and dignity, including early 
</b></p>

<p><b> (viii) In countries where several legal systems coexist, establish and implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>national mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation of guarantees of 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality and non-discrimination between men and women in all areas and at all 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels, offering women, especially rural and indigenous women, the possibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>of removing themselves from the arbitral authority and jurisdiction of 
</b></p>
<p><b>customary institutions. Bring parallel customary, religious and indigenous law 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems into line with international human rights law, particularly in respect of 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender equality, while acknowledging the importance of the wealth and 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity of culture and traditions. Grant women the right to appeal, in State 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts, decisions of religious, customary or indigenous authorities, whether 
</b></p>
<p><b>formal or informal, that have violated their right to equality; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (ix) Make the formal State legal system accessible to all women, regardless of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their social status, and address the shortcomings of the formal system. Formal 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice should be preferred to informal justice for the settlement of all family

</b></p>
<p><b> (d) According to general recommendation No. 29 of the Committee on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the family is a social and legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>construct and, in various countries, a religious construct. It also is an economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>construct. The Working Group recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Take measures to ensure that families allow girls to access education on 
</b></p>
<p><b>an equal basis with boys, by raising awareness in the community and providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>families with financial incentives to allow girls to finish their studies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) Ensure that women are free to participate in economic activities outside 
</b></p>
<p><b>the house or village, without the supervision of male relatives; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Ensure that women, on an equal footing with men, and girls, on an equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>footing with boys, have the right to at least half the family property and 
</b></p>
<p><b>inheritance in the event of divorce or widowhood. Facilitate the invalidation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>any waiver of these rights obtained from a woman as a result of pressure from 
</b></p>
<p><b>her family or community; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iv) Recognize the right of women living in polygamous marriages to end 
</b></p>
<p><b>their marriage when their husband takes another wife and grant them a share 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the family property, including the value of the house or land; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (v) Recognize women as heads of family on an equal basis with men so that 
</b></p>
<p><b>they may enjoy the same financial or social benefits; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (vi) Assess, quantify and take account of the impact of women and girls</b>&#8217;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>status in the family in all poverty-reduction policies. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group recommends that international and regional human rights
