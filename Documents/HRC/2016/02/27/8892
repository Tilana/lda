</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to resolution 6/30, 
in which the Council reaffirmed its commitment to effectively integrate the human rights of 
women, as well as a gender perspective, in its work and that of its mechanisms, in a systematic 
and transparent manner including in all phases of the universal periodic review, the Advisory 
Committee and the review of mandates. The extent to which the Council integrates a gender 
perspective into its work will have a significant impact beyond the Council itself, and potentially 
have a bearing on the lives of women and girls in every part of the world. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 6/30, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to report on the obstacles and challenges to the 
implementation of the resolution by the Council and to make concrete recommendations for 
action to address them. This marks a significant shift in focus with respect to previous requests 
from the Commission on Human Rights on the same theme which called, inter alia, for reporting 
on the &#8220;promotion and protection of human rights of women &#8230; into the United Nations system&#8221; 
(see A/HRC/4/104). However, 16 years after States at the World Conference on Human Rights, 
held in Vienna in 1993, called for the integration of the human rights of women into the 
United Nations system, the Human Rights Council called for a more critical analysis. 
Accordingly, this report focuses on identifying the obstacles and challenges as a starting point 
for possible future concrete recommendations for action to be made by the Council. 
</p>
<p>3. For the purpose of informing the content of the report a note verbale was sent to Member 
States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on 27 June 2008 
soliciting information and observations. Written contributions were received from 25 States<b>1</b> and 
6 NGOs.<b>2</b> Suggestions from stakeholders, including issues raised during plenary discussions of 
the Human Rights Council in conjunction with panels on the human rights of women and how to 
fully integrate a gender perspective, respectively, have also informed the content of this report. 
</p>
<p>4. Section II<b> </b>of the report provides a brief summary of the underlying legislative authority for 
the Human Rights Council to fully integrate the human rights of women and a gender 
perspective throughout its work. It also highlights the global policy framework developed by the 
United Nations system through world conferences and global summits. Section III examines the 
challenges and obstacles to integrating the human rights of women and a gender perspective in 
the United Nations system, including the Human Rights Council. Finally, section IV contains 
conclusions and recommendations for action to address those obstacles and challenges.

</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND GLOBAL POLICY FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. United Nations resolutions and policy framework - 
world conferences, special sessions and summits 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Human Rights Council has explicitly been called upon by the General Assembly &#8220;to 
integrate attention to gender perspectives into [its] consideration of all issues in [its agenda], 
including the development of [its] methods of work&#8221;.<b>3</b> Pursuant to this call, the Council adopted 
resolution 6/30. 
</p>
<p>6. In addition, several calls upon the United Nations system to integrate the human rights of 
women and a gender perspective into all policies and programmes have been made during the 
last decades at the international level. Gender mainstreaming is now a globally accepted strategy 
for achieving gender equality and includes ensuring that all United Nations activities integrate 
the human rights of women. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action historically 
recognized that violence against women and girls constitutes a severe violation of rights and that 
women&#8217;s rights are human rights. All States affirmed that the human rights of women and of the 
girl child are inalienable, integral and indivisible parts of universal human rights and that the 
equal status and human rights of women should be integrated into the mainstream of 
United Nations system-wide activity (see A/CONF.157/23). 
</p>
<p>7. In 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference 
on Women called upon all relevant organs, bodies and agencies of the United Nations 
system, all human rights bodies of the United Nations system, as well as the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, to give full, equal and sustained attention to the human rights of women in the 
exercise of their respective mandates (para. 231). Subsequently, the General Assembly, at its 
twenty-third special session entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for 
the twenty-first century&#8221;, reiterated the importance of mainstreaming as reflected in its outcome 
documents.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>8. Since 1997, the Economic and Social Council has passed an annual resolution entitled 
&#8220;Mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes of the United Nations 
system&#8221;. In resolution 2008/34, the Council took note with appreciation of the report of the 
Secretary-General (E/2008/53) and the recommendations contained therein. 
</p>
<p>9. At its last session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 63/159 in which the Assembly 
took note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the measures taken and 
progress achieved in follow-up to the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session (A/63/217), and called upon all parts 
</p>

</p>
<p>of the United Nations system to continue to play an active role in ensuring the full, effective and 
accelerated implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome of the 
twenty-third special session. 
</p>
<p>10. The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance held in Durban, South Africa, in 2001 urged States to incorporate a gender 
perspective in all programmes of action against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance and 
to consider the burden of such discrimination, which falls particularly on indigenous women, 
African women, Asian women, women of African descent, women of Asian descent, women 
migrants and women from other disadvantaged groups.<b>5</b> The Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action both make numerous references to multiple forms of discrimination and 
the intersection of discrimination on grounds of race and gender.<b>6</b> More recently, the 
Durban Review Conference, held in Geneva from 20 to 24 April 2009, evaluated progress 
towards the goals set by the World Conference and in doing so confirmed the importance of 
addressing multiple forms of discrimination.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration<b>8</b> called for the promotion of gender 
equality and the empowerment of women to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to achieve 
sustainable development (Millennium Development Goal 3), reduce child mortality (goal 4) and 
improve maternal health (goal 5). At the 2005 World Summit, States recognized the importance 
of gender mainstreaming as a tool for achieving gender equality. To that end, they undertook to 
actively promote the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the design, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and social 
spheres, and further undertook to strengthen the capabilities of the United Nations system in the 
area of gender.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights treaty obligations 
</b></p>
<p>12. There are also specific legal obligations for the 186 States that have ratified the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the 96 States 
that have ratified its Optional Protocol. Obligations also arise for the States parties not to

<p>discriminate in the enjoyment of rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, under article 2, and similarly under article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. CEDAW defines discrimination against women as &#8220;any distinction, exclusion or 
restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying 
the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a 
basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the 
political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field&#8221; (art. 1). States parties to the 
Convention have obligations to undertake a series of measures to end discrimination against 
women in all forms, including: to incorporate the principle of equality of men and women in 
their legal system, abolishing all discriminatory laws and adopting appropriate ones prohibiting 
discrimination against women; to establish tribunals and other public institutions to ensure the 
effective protection of women against discrimination; and to ensure the elimination of all 
acts of discrimination against women by persons, organizations or enterprises. The Convention 
provides the basis for realizing equality between women and men through ensuring women&#8217;s 
equal access to, and equal opportunities in, inter alia, political and public life, education, health 
and employment. It explicitly affirms reproductive choice and health as a human rights issue 
and also establishes the obligation of States parties &#8220;to modify the social and cultural patterns 
of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and 
customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the 
superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women&#8221; (art. 5 (a)). 
</p>
<p>14. In addition to CEDAW, all other fundamental human rights treaties explicitly refer to 
equality between men and women and the principle of non-discrimination and obligations of 
States parties in that regard. The Council in resolution 6/30 encouraged the efforts of all human 
rights treaty bodies to incorporate the human rights of women and a gender perspective in their 
work, particularly in their concluding observations, general comments and recommendations. 
Developments in this area include the adoption by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination in 2000 of general comment No. 25 on gender-related dimensions of racial 
discrimination; general comment No. 32 adopted by the Human Rights Committee in 2007 on 
the right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial; and general comment No. 20 
on non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights adopted in 2009 by the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Far-reaching reservations and/or interpretative declarations constitute a limitation to 
States&#8217; obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the rights contained in the treaties. CEDAW is 
the treaty with the highest number of reservations, presenting an obstacle to its effective 
implementation. Reservations have been entered to particular articles on the ground that the 
national law, tradition, religion or culture is not congruent with Convention principles. Some 
States have entered a reservation to article 2 (States parties&#8217; obligations), although their national 
constitutions or laws prohibit discrimination. Similarly, many reservations relate to article 16 
(equality of women and men in marriage and family relations) on national, traditional, religious 
or cultural grounds, while the family context is one in which women are most vulnerable to 
abuse of their human rights. In the view of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women, such reservations are incompatible with the Convention and therefore 
impermissible and should be reviewed and modified or withdrawn. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES TO INTEGRATING THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND A GENDER PERSPECTIVE INTO THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>16. Resolution 6/30 encourages organs, bodies, mechanisms and agencies of the 
United Nations system to work actively to integrate the human rights of all women and a gender 
perspective throughout their work, including through exchange of information, lessons learned 
and best practices. The following paragraphs highlight lessons learned from United Nations 
agencies, programmes and entities, including in the area of prevention and resolution of conflicts 
and peacebuilding, to inform the Human Rights Council in its efforts to strengthen the 
integration of the human rights of women and a gender perspective into its work. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Integration of a gender perspective in the work of United Nations 
agencies, programmes and other entities 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>17. The integration of a gender perspective and gender mainstreaming has presented a 
challenge for United Nations entities, and organizational gender policies, gender integration tools 
and gender units have become normal features throughout the United Nations system. While this 
has generated many good practices in gender equality programming, it has often been ad hoc, 
absent systems in place to ensure sharing of such experiences throughout the system. In light of 
the above, several United Nations entities and specialized agencies have undertaken in-depth 
gender evaluations in recent years, including the International Labour Organization, the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF). A similar gender evaluation by OHCHR is ongoing, the results of which are 
expected by the end of 2009. 
</p>
<p>18. The outcomes of the evaluations indicate certain commonalities with respect to existing 
challenges:<b>10</b> an under-resourced gender integration process (resources have decreased in recent 
decades); lack of effective accountability mechanisms; lack of senior-level and executive 
leadership; individual rather than institutional commitment; lack of time allocated for often 
complex gender analysis; misunderstanding of the concept of gender integration; lack of regard 
for competence in gender equality in recruitment; lack of structural stability of existing gender 
units; and designation of mainly junior staff as gender focal points. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  See for example UNICEF, <i>Evaluation of Gender Policy Implementation in UNICEF</i>, 
</p>
<p>Executive Summary, 2008, and UNDP, <i>Evaluation of Gender Mainstreaming in UNDP</i>, 
Executive Summary, 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. In light of the OHCHR commitment to the integration of gender and women&#8217;s rights, a 
Women&#8217;s Rights and Gender Unit was established at the end of 2006. The work of the unit 
includes elements related to the Office&#8217;s capacity to ensure adequate support on gender and 
women&#8217;s rights to the Human Rights Council, and particularly to its special procedures. 
</p>
<p>20. At the first gender integration panel discussion of the Human Rights Council, held on 20 
and 21 September 2007, OHCHR expressed the view<b>11</b> that stakeholders need to pursue a dual 
approach for the United Nations system: redoubling the mainstreaming effort throughout the 
system on the one hand, and providing support to the entities in the system in charge of gender 
issues, on the other. Integration requires both a process for the whole system as well as a 
dedicated United Nations entity with the mandate and resources to promote the rights of women. 
In this regard, there is great expectation around the enhanced, consolidated gender architecture 
that is being discussed with Member States at United Nations Headquarters. 
</p>
<p>21. In resolution 6/30 the Council welcomed cooperation between the Commission on the 
Status of Women and the Human Rights Council, and the cooperation and coordination between 
the Division for the Advancement of Women, OHCHR and the Special Adviser to the 
Secretary-General on Gender Issues. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Prevention and resolution of conflicts and peacebuilding 
</b></p>
<p>22. More specifically, resolution 6/30 also urges the United Nations system and Governments 
to make efforts to ensure and support the full participation of women at all levels of 
decision-making and implementation in development activities and peace processes, including 
conflict prevention and resolution, post-conflict reconstruction, peacemaking, peacekeeping and 
peacebuilding. Security Council resolutions 1820 (2008) and 1325 (2000) on women, peace and 
security provide guidance for needed action at the United Nations and governmental level in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>23. Challenges to the practical implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008)<b>12</b> 
remain, both at the level of the United Nations and in national contexts. While discrimination 
against women remains entrenched, and often legally permissible, women will continue to be

</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  The presentation of the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights may be found at 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  Such challenges are outlined in the recent study by the United Nations Development Fund 
for Women (UNIFEM) on women&#8217;s participation in peacebuilding, at www.unifem.org/ 
news_events/story_detail.php?StoryID=753. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>prevented from active and equal participation in efforts to maintain and promote peace and 
security. All States have responsibilities under the resolutions, in particular States in conflict and 
post-conflict situations, but also those States that provide post-conflict assistance. The use of 
special measures to promote greater equality, as well as awareness of the rights upon which the 
resolutions are based, are fundamental to their efficacy. 
</p>
<p>24. Few States have drawn up a national action plan on resolution 1325 (2000) and those that 
have face the challenge of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of their plan. It is 
important to disseminate resolution 1325 (2000), both in countries in a conflict and/or 
post-conflict situation and in countries that supply personnel for peacekeeping missions, to 
ensure awareness of its content and the rights it recognizes. Coordination of ministries is key to 
evaluating the activities conducted and to formulating additional measures if new needs arise, as 
is the inclusion of civil society in this process. OHCHR is also an active member of 
United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, an inter-agency initiative launched 
in 2007 to amplify and better coordinate the United Nations response to rape as a tactic of war 
(as identified in resolution 1820 (2008)). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Human Rights Council should be recognized for ensuring that efforts have been made 
to integrate the human rights of women and a gender perspective into its work from the outset. 
Resolution 6/30, which had 73 co-sponsors and was adopted without a vote, represents an 
important step forward in itself. However, the challenge that remains is how to ensure in 
practical terms that the Council addresses the rights of women and girls directly, and that it also 
applies a gender perspective across all its work. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>26. In resolution 6/30 the Council decided to incorporate into its programme of work 
two annual meetings to discuss each issue. The purpose of one annual meeting is to discuss the 
substantive issue of the human rights of women, including the question of violence against 
women. The purpose of the second is to discuss the methodology for how to integrate a gender 
perspective throughout the Council and its mechanisms. Evaluating its own work is an 
innovative feature of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Human rights of women, including the question of violence against women 
</b>27. On 5 June 2008, during its eighth session, the Council formally considered the human 
rights of women for the first time since its inception in 2006, pursuant to General Assembly 
resolution 61/143, in the form of an expert panel discussion entitled &#8220;Addressing violence 
against women: setting priorities&#8221;.<b>13</b> The panel called for, inter alia, greater State commitment to 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>providing resources for and implementing measures that will prevent and punish acts of 
violence. Advocates also called for the creation of a Human Rights Council gender focal point, a 
small, regionally balanced and self-selected group of States that would have a particular focus on 
violence against women. 
</p>
<p>28. The second part of the panel focused on &#8220;Maternal mortality and the human rights of 
women&#8221;,<b>14</b> which presented an important opportunity to consider maternal mortality not only as 
a health or development issue, but also as a human rights issue. Among the recommendations 
stemming from the debate was that the Council should consider the human rights implications of 
maternal mortality and consider establishing an independent mechanism, similar to a working 
group, which would be closely linked to the existing international human rights mechanisms, to 
enhance accountability. In March 2009, at the tenth session, New Zealand led a joint statement 
initiative of 85 States concerning the human rights implications of maternal mortality. At its 
eleventh session, the Council adopted without a vote resolution 11/8, which had 85 co-sponsors, 
on preventable maternal mortality in which the Council requested OHCHR to prepare a thematic 
study to identify the human rights dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in 
the existing international legal framework and recommend options for addressing them 
throughout the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>29. Also at the eleventh session, the second plenary panel discussion was held, focusing on 
&#8220;Equality before the law&#8221;. It considered, among other things, the establishment of a special 
mechanism of the Council. After the debate, a cross-regional joint statement<b>15</b> was made echoing 
the call of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the creation of a special mechanism to 
address the legalized inequality of women. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Integration of a gender perspective throughout the Council and its mechanisms 
</b>30. The initial panel, entitled &#8220;Integration of a gender perspective in the work of the Human 
Rights Council&#8221;, which preceded and laid the foundation for resolution 6/30,<b>16</b> was held on 20 
and 21 September 2007, during the sixth session. Its aim was to stress the concepts behind 
integrating a gender perspective and to offer concrete ideas for how the Council might do this

</p>
<p>throughout its mechanisms and programme of work. Thirty-one States made statements during 
the interactive dialogue, welcoming the discussion on gender integration and providing 
constructive proposals to that end.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>31. On 12 September 2008, during the ninth session, the Council, following on resolution 6/30, 
held its second panel discussion, on &#8220;Gender integration&#8221;, focusing on the work of the Council 
and its special procedures in order to have a more targeted and results-orientated discussion. 
The panel provided many practical recommendations for the special procedures to fulfil 
resolution 6/30, including specific recommendations relevant to the individual mandates. By 
ensuring that an annual meeting is held each year to evaluate progress and consider how it can 
improve its integration of a gender perspective, the Council has indicated its significant 
commitment to this issue. 
</p>
<p>32. What emerged from the panels already held as one of the more significant challenges is a 
lack of understanding on the part of Member States of how to integrate a gender perspective into 
the Council&#8217;s work. The &#8220;Gender integration&#8221; panel discussions produced an important set of 
practical recommendations,<b>18</b> some of which the Council could immediately implement with 
minimal effort, and others which would merit further consideration. 
</p>
<p>33. More fundamentally, while the meaning of &#8220;gender&#8221;, &#8220;gender mainstreaming&#8221;, &#8220;gender 
equality&#8221; and &#8220;gender parity&#8221; have been clearly spelled out in numerous United Nations policy 
documents, there continues to be a divergence of views and understanding among Member 
States as to the respective definitions, which sometimes hampers optimal effectiveness and 
debate. In this regard, the Deputy High Commissioner in her presentation at the first gender 
integration panel went to considerable lengths to explain the importance of language and the 
demystification of definitions.<b>19</b> When considering the human rights of women, it is important to 
add the phrase &#8220;and a gender perspective&#8221; in order to emphasize that adopting a human 
rights-based approach through a gender perspective affects not only women and girls, but 
necessitates an analysis also of the human rights impact upon men and boys; gender 
integration/mainstreaming is simply ensuring that women and girls&#8217; rights, perspectives and 
needs, as well as those of men and boys, are systematically considered.

</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;Gender&#8221; refers to the socially constructed roles of men and women or the social differences 
that are learned. Gender roles are deeply rooted in every culture, but they are changeable 
over time and have wide variations both within and between cultures. The presentation, 
of 20 September 2007, can be found at www.ohchr.org. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>34. The establishment of the universal periodic review (UPR) has reinforced cooperation 
between States, the Human Rights Council and the United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
The UPR process is particularly interesting for countries that have not ratified some of the 
international human rights treaties, including CEDAW. In fact, many States are now facing 
questions they would not otherwise address in any other forum, including the former 
Commission on Human Rights, and stakeholders hope that the universal periodic review can be 
used to explore human rights issues that tend to receive little attention.  
</p>
<p>35. Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 recognizes the importance of gender integration and 
specifically mandates the principle that UPR must &#8220;fully integrate a gender perspective&#8221; into all 
aspects of the review (annex, para. 3 (k)). Furthermore, resolution 6/30 urges all stakeholders to 
take into full account the human rights of women and a gender perspective and encourages States 
to prepare information through broad consultation at the national level with all relevant 
stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations active in addressing gender issues and 
the human rights of women and girls. 
</p>
<p>36. As the experience of the first three sessions of UPR in April, May and December 2008 
have shown, most States take their responsibility seriously, fully engaging in the preparation of 
national reports through consultation with relevant stakeholders and actively participating in the 
actual review at all levels. It should be noted that in the course of the review several States have 
made commitments to remove far-reaching and long-standing reservations to CEDAW.  
</p>
<p>37. However, the earliest outcomes of the first reviews with respect to women&#8217;s rights also 
suggest that there are challenges to integrating a gender perspective, and it should be noted that 
there is some discrepancy between what is raised during the review dialogue and the issues 
addressed in the final recommendations. Issues of women&#8217;s rights raised during the dialogue are 
mainly limited to general references to gender equality, education and domestic violence. In 
some instances intersectional or multiple forms of discrimination have been cited, but the final 
recommendations do not address these linked forms of discrimination. Other key issues that 
underpin the full enjoyment of women&#8217;s rights have generally not been addressed during the 
dialogue, such as access to adequate housing, land and political representation and the right to 
reproductive choice and family planning. There have been few or no recommendations on 
indigenous women, older women, women of the lower castes, women living in poverty or in 
slums or other forms of inadequate housing, gender budgeting, women&#8217;s right to education, and 
the right to development. During the plenary sessions of UPR, there was almost no discussion on 
the right to reproductive choice and family planning, although this trend seems to have been 
reversed during the fourth UPR round. 
</p>
<p>38. While the process is still developing its best practices, and it is arguably too early to make 
a full assessment of its effectiveness in integrating the human rights of women and a gender 
perspective, a practical approach would be to address and prioritize the full range of women&#8217;s 
rights issues; this necessarily would include the reproductive and sexual rights of women. As 
noted above, one challenge seems to be a lack of understanding of or consistency with respect to 
what &#8220;integrating a gender perspective&#8221; or &#8220;gender mainstreaming&#8221; means in practice. In 
addition, discussions of women&#8217;s rights issues have generally been limited to the context of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;victimized&#8221; women who experienced violations such as sexual abuse, rather than in the context 
of empowerment, such as in relation to access to education; health goods, services and facilities; 
political participation; and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and women&#8217;s 
contributions to this process. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>39. The special procedures should be commended for the great importance they have attached 
to integrating a gender perspective into the work of the Council. Even before the adoption of 
resolution 6/30, the majority of the special procedures mandate holders had taken important 
initiatives to integrate a gender perspective into their work,<b>20</b> and had identified women&#8217;s human 
rights and a gender perspective as a cross-cutting priority theme.<b>21</b> Numerous special rapporteurs 
have participated as expert panellists during the panels at the Council, and in late July 2008, 
14 mandate holders made a joint written submission (A/CONF.211/PC/WG.1/5) to the Durban 
Review Conference Preparatory Committee outlining the main issues which, in their view, 
should be integrated or strengthened in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. That 
extensive reference was made to the need to strengthen the provisions on multiple forms of 
discrimination illustrates the collective recognition given by the special procedures to the 
importance of addressing multiple forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>40. The remaining challenge resides in implementing resolution 6/30 in a systematic way. The 
resolution requests all special procedures to regularly and systematically integrate a gender 
perspective into the implementation of their mandate, including to examine the multiple forms of 
discrimination against women and girls, and to include in their reports information on the 
qualitative analysis of the human rights of women and girls. With this request the Human Rights 
Council has shown leadership, emphasizing that gender is not synonymous with mandates that 
deal explicitly with women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
represents the primary mandate in the area of the human rights of women. However, increased 
focus among special procedures on the intersectionality of rights, including collaboration in the 
form of joint missions, regional consultations and communications, as well as on thematic issues, 
has resulted in the integration of violence against women in the work of many other mandates. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  Beginning in 2002 the Commission on Human Rights invited the special procedures to 
</p>
<p>regularly and systematically take a gender perspective into account in the implementation of 
their mandates and to include in their reports information on and qualitative analysis of the 
human rights of women and girls (resolution 2002/50). The review, rationalization and 
improvement of all mandates undertaken as part of the institution-building of the Human Rights 
Council resulted in nearly all special procedures being required to mainstream a gender 
perspective into their work. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  See www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/gender.htm. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. Indeed, several special procedures mandate holders have addressed the intersections 
between the focus of their mandate and violence against women in the course of their work.<b>22</b> 
These efforts have contributed to an expansion of the normative understanding of women&#8217;s 
human rights as well as of the avenues for addressing violence against women in different 
contexts. This work could be further encouraged by the Council by addressing violence against 
women during interactive dialogues with States and special procedures mandate holders, and by 
encouraging greater dialogue and collaboration between mandate holders on issues of violence 
against women.  
</p>
<p>43. While the application of a gender perspective by special procedures is welcome, it should 
be noted that to date it has resulted primarily in highlighting interlinkages between forms of 
violence against women, while a broader gender perspective or analysis with respect to any 
given mandate is largely absent. In addition to encouraging synergy between mandates, and with 
the violence against women mandate in particular, the Council could also encourage all 
mandates to mainstream a gender perspective into their work, as well as to periodically consider 
dedicating their reports or other activities to the specific intersections between their mandate and 
the human rights of women and girls. Given the diversity of the existing mandates, this would 
enrich the body of knowledge on the multiple forms of discrimination and human rights 
violations against women and girls, identify important intersections, and provide valuable 
qualitative analysis of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  For example: the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment addressed various forms of violence against women as forms of torture 
in a recent report to the Council (A/HRC/7/3). Through this report, the Special Rapporteur 
contributed towards an understanding and an application of the torture protection framework 
which is gender-inclusive, with a view to strengthening the protection of women from violence 
by recognizing that violence against women is a form of torture. The former Special Rapporteur 
on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living 
and on the right to non-discrimination in this context addressed the intersections between 
violence against women and the denial of the right to adequate housing. The Special Rapporteur 
documented the greater vulnerability to various forms of violence which women face as a result 
of a lack of access to housing. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2002/49 on 
women&#8217;s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and equal rights to own property 
and to adequate housing, entrusted the Special Rapporteur with the additional task of preparing a 
study on women and adequate housing. The Special Rapporteur presented his main findings, 
stemming from thematic research, country missions, regional consultations and replies received 
to a questionnaire, in three reports (E/CN.4/2003/55, E/CN.4/2005/43 and E/CN.4/2006/118). 
The former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders recognized the particular vulnerabilities of women human rights defenders to 
gender-based and gender-intensified violence because of their gender as well as the nature of the 
work they often do which defies social and cultural norms (E/CN.4/2002/106 and subsequent 
reports). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Human Rights Council in resolution 6/30 requested the Advisory Committee to 
integrate regularly and systematically a gender perspective into the implementation of its 
mandate, including when examining the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination against 
women, and to include in its reports information on and qualitative analysis of human rights of 
women and girls.  
</p>
<p>45. At its first session, in August 2008, the Advisory Committee requested five of its members 
to prepare draft guidelines on methods to operationalize gender mainstreaming at all levels 
(recommendation 1/4). These were discussed by the Advisory Committee at its second session, 
held in January 2009 (A/HRC/AC/2/CRP.4). At the latter session, the Advisory Committee also 
recommended (recommendation 2/4) that the Council authorize the Committee to prepare draft 
guidelines on methods to enhance implementation of gender mainstreaming, including 
action-oriented mechanisms within the Council and all other organs within the United Nations 
system, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. At its tenth session, the Council noted that 
the Committee&#8217;s recommendation with regard to gender mainstreaming might be addressed in 
the context of the work of the Council at its future sessions (President&#8217;s statement PRST 10/1). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Special sessions 
</b></p>
<p>46. General Assembly resolution 60/251 which created the Human Rights Council states in 
paragraph 10 that the Council &#8220;shall be able to hold special sessions when needed at the request 
of a member of the Council with the support of one third of the membership of the Council&#8221;. In 
2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, during his interactive dialogue with the Council, urged 
member States to hold the first thematic special session on maternal mortality, noting that the 
figures of women who die during or after giving birth dwarf the numbers of extrajudicial and 
summary executions and disappearances each year. Although the Council did not respond to the 
choice of theme, it has held two thematic special sessions, concerning the global food crisis and 
the impact of the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>47. At the seventh special session, held in May 2008, on the negative impact on the realization 
of the right to food of the world food crisis, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food pointed 
out that reactions to the increase in the global prices of food included the withdrawal of children, 
particularly girls, from school and malnutrition among preschool-age children, with possible 
dramatic and irreversible consequences. At the ninth special session, held in February 2009 and 
devoted to the global financial crisis, speakers referred to the need to take the impact of the crisis 
on women into account. Yet, aside from these general references, none of the sessions provided 
for in-depth gender analysis. 
</p>
<p>48. An obvious test for the Human Rights Council as to how well it integrates a gender 
perspective was its eighth special session, held in November/December 2008, on the situation of 
human rights in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in her opening statement noted that of particular concern was &#8220;the unparalleled 
violence against women, including rape&#8221;. The Council adopted resolution S-8/1. While it is </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>noted that the Council condemned sexual violence and the recruitment by the militia of child 
soldiers (para. 5), it did not specifically refer to Security Council resolution 1820 (2008), which 
calls for the &#8220;immediate and complete cessation by all parties to armed conflict of all acts of 
sexual violence against civilians&#8221;, nor to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) calling for 
women to be active participants in peace processes. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Resolutions and decisions 
</b></p>
<p>49. Human Rights Council resolutions are increasingly making explicit references to gender 
dimensions, albeit still in a general manner. States tabling an initiative could first consider how 
the subject matter of the resolution can make more specific references to the differential impact 
on women, men, girls and boys, and to the potential for discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> With regard to the human rights of women, the United Nations system has been 
working on violence against women for almost two decades, beginning with the Declaration 
on Violence against Women, including through the work of the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women and relevant resolutions adopted since. A clear set of 
internationally agreed standards on the prevention, investigation and punishment of 
violence against women now exists; the role of the Human Rights Council should therefore 
now be to contribute to the implementation of those standards.  
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> In order to do so effectively and from a human rights perspective, it is essential that 
women be seen as rights holders, and not only as a &#8220;vulnerable group&#8221; in need of 
protection, assistance and care; otherwise, solutions tend to focus only on the affected 
women and usually consist of adopting &#8220;protective&#8221; measures that may in reality restrict 
the full enjoyment of the women&#8217;s rights. If violence against women is seen as a human 
rights violation and an entrenched social problem that affects both men and women, it is 
more likely that the solutions to address it will involve all actors, including perpetrators 
and the community itself, and be empowering as well as rights-enhancing. 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> According to General Assembly resolution 61/143, the Council&#8217;s debate on 
priority-setting for its work on violence against women should address how to integrate the 
issue into its full agenda. In this context, the task becomes a question of planning how most 
effectively to integrate the issue within the Council&#8217;s existing work and how best to 
contribute to the implementation of the recommendations contained in various 
United Nations reports on this topic, including the special procedures and, most 
particularly, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women.23

</b>  Recommendation by Alejandra Sard&#225;, on behalf of CLADEM - Latin American and 
</p>
<p>Caribbean Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s Rights and Mulabi (Argentina), speaking on 
the gender panel at the eighth session of the Human Rights Council, 5 June 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53.<b> Resolution 6/30, which was adopted without a vote in December 2007, represents an 
important step forward and a tool to ensure that a gender perspective is included in the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s work from the outset. What needs to be explored further is how 
to ensure in practical terms that the Council addresses the rights of women and girls 
directly, and that it applies a gender lens across all its work, including the universal 
periodic review, the new and revised special procedure mandates, and its working groups 
and the Advisory Committee. To this end, the following recommendations are made for the 
consideration of the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cooperation between United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> There is great expectation surrounding the enhanced, consolidated gender 
architecture that is being discussed with Member States at United Nations Headquarters. 
The Human Rights Council could encourage cooperation and coordination between 
OHCHR and the future consolidated gender architecture. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> A preliminary analysis indicates that the State reports and the compilation reports 
prepared by OHCHR for UPR reflect little of the human rights of women or a gender 
perspective. Stakeholders have been calling for greater effort by global actors to seize this 
window of opportunity to strengthen the protection gap with regard to gender-related 
discrimination and violence, and engage more fully with UPR. The United Nations entities 
whose main purpose is advancing women&#8217;s status and rights can provide a valuable 
contribution to the compilation reports.24 In turn, that information will assist States, both 
members of the Council and observers, to ask questions that are timely and specific, and 
can lead to the identification of practices or areas in need of further attention by the State 
under review and to assistance from the international community. The Human Rights 
Council could recommend that such United Nations entities provide as much detailed 
information as possible on women&#8217;s human rights, including sex-disaggregated data 
wherever possible, to enhance the quality of the UPR process, and encourage them to do so. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> When preparing their reports, States should consult with NGOs active in addressing 
gender issues and use disaggregated data to identify gender issues. A paragraph could be 
included in the &#8220;normative framework&#8221; section indicating the efforts the State has made to 
ensure that women are represented in executive decision-making positions, as well as the 
judicial and legislative areas. Reference could be made throughout the rest of the report to 
how the domestic policies and programmes described take into account the differential 
effects on women, men, girls and boys.  
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  For example, UNIFEM, the United Nations Population Fund, the Office of the Special 
</p>
<p>Adviser on Gender Issues, the Division for the Advancement of Women and the United Nations 
International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57.<b> An evaluation of how the State under review has met its obligations to eliminate 
violence against women could be made a standing item on the list of issues that are 
included in each State report. It is essential that the report provide data disaggregated by 
sex, ethnicity, geography, income and other relevant social factors with respect to the 
situation of violence against women, as well as the legal and institutional frameworks in 
place to address it. A standardized set of questions could be produced to that end, as well as 
additional contextualized questions for each country under review.  
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> During the session, the State under review could be asked how it integrated a gender 
perspective in the preparation of the report. Such an exchange could help identify policies 
and programmes described in the State&#8217;s report that might benefit from applying a gender 
perspective. The UPR process should assess progress made by States in terms of ensuring 
gender integration in their national policies as well as the practical enjoyment of human 
rights by women in the societies in which they live. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> It is expected that as part of the outcome of State reviews under UPR, the 
international community will have an important role to play, including by assisting States 
in implementing conclusions and recommendations. This could potentially have a crucial 
effect in the area of women&#8217;s rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> Mandate holders could develop guidelines on how to effectively integrate a gender 
perspective into their work which could be incorporated in the Manual of Operations of 
the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.25 A list of analytical questions should 
be developed to ensure that adequate gender-based considerations underlie the 
examination of any topic within any and every mandate. Reports to the Council should 
include information on the extent to which women&#8217;s groups, government agencies 
responsible for gender policies and other relevant agencies have been consulted in the 
process.  
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> It is equally important for special procedures to incorporate a gender perspective in 
the planning, preparation and carrying out of country visits. Mandate holders should seek 
information from a wide variety of sources during country visits, including women&#8217;s 
NGOs, government offices for women&#8217;s affairs, professional organizations, academic 
institutions, etc. All individuals and institutions, including those not working on gender or 
women&#8217;s issues, should be asked about gender issues in order to show how the issue under 
consideration affects men and women differently. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The Coordination Committee of Special Procedures should aim to facilitate gender 
integration in all aspects of the work of the special procedures by focusing on and 
discussing this topic on a regular basis, including at their annual meeting, inter alia to 
promote sharing of effective strategies and best practices for integrating a gender 
perspective.  
</b></p>
<p>

<p><b>25
</b>  Recommendations from the gender panels of 20 September 2007 and 12 September 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>63.<b> In addressing the gender balance of the special procedures mandate holders 
concerted efforts are still required to encourage applications from qualified and 
internationally recognized female candidates. Approximately one third of the current 
mandate holders are women. While this is an increase from previous years, Governments 
should make deliberate efforts to nominate women candidates to the list of eligible mandate 
holders and due consideration should be given by the Consultative Group and the 
President of the Council to the importance of ensuring an overall gender balance when 
proposing candidates. The Consultative Group, in reviewing and selecting candidates, 
should also emphasize whether candidates have demonstrated experience with and are 
committed to addressing a gender perspective and issues pertaining to the human rights of 
women in their work.   
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> In paragraph 58 (d) of resolution 5/1, the Human Rights Council signals its intention 
to address thematic gaps in the context of the review of mandates. As part of that task, the 
Council could consider the creation of additional special mechanisms addressing other 
areas of women&#8217;s rights, such as equality before the law.   
</b></p>
<p><b>Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> It is recommended that the members of the Advisory Committee consult broadly with 
all stakeholders, including NGOs active in addressing gender issues and the human rights 
of women and girls, for their input in the preparation of the guidelines to integrate 
regularly and systematically a gender perspective into the implementation of mandates. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Governments should make a deliberate effort to present women candidates and 
persons with gender expertise for the Advisory Committee. Council members should give 
due consideration to the importance of ensuring an overall gender balance when electing 
members of the Committee. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The Advisory Committee should give due consideration to gender balance when 
designating Committee members to prepare draft proposals or reports pursuant to a 
request from the Council.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Programme of work, special sessions, resolutions, etc. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> With regard to special sessions, there is a need to raise awareness, especially around 
what integrating a gender perspective is in areas that may seem to have other primary 
goals, or where a gender perspective does not seem obvious. It has been suggested that the 
Secretariat could play a role by contributing to both knowledge and capacity-building. 
Easily available information on the OHCHR home page and the development of a toolkit 
for gender integration in thematic resolutions could be considered.  
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> Dissemination of the recommendations of all the gender panels and the annual 
meeting on the human rights of women could be vastly improved with easier access from 
both the Human Rights Council Extranet and the OHCHR website. OHCHR should be 
requested to prepare a summary of the deliberations of future gender panels. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>70.<b> Resolutions are increasingly making explicit references to gender dimensions, which 
is encouraging; however, it is important that references be substantive, with details 
regarding the specific application of a gender perspective in the precise case. States tabling 
an initiative could consider how the subject matter of the resolution reflects the different 
ways in which the issue affects men and women, boys and girls.  
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The gender integration panel discussions have produced an important set of practical 
recommendations that the Human Rights Council could immediately implement with 
minimum effort. However, there is a lack of continuous stocktaking of such 
recommendations, and the Council may wish to reflect on the suggestion to create a 
Council &#8220;gender focal point&#8221;, in the form of a group of self-identified States.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> Further, the Human Rights Council may wish to ensure that all its plenary panels 
reflect a gender balance and perspective, not just those explicitly discussing women&#8217;s 
human rights or gender integration, and to encourage all panellists to apply a gender 
perspective in their presentations.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Prevention and resolution of conflicts and peacebuilding 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Challenges remain to the implementation of many of the commitments contained in 
Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). All States have responsibilities, 
in particular those in conflict and post-conflict situations, but also those that provide 
post-conflict assistance. The use of special measures to promote greater equality as well as 
awareness of the rights upon which the resolutions are based is fundamental to their 
efficacy. Coordination of ministries is indispensible to evaluate the activities being 
conducted and to formulate additional measures if new needs arise, and it is equally 
important to work with and include civil society in the process.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Human Rights Council is not mandated to make any decisions regarding treaty 
bodies&#8217; modus operandi; however, the Council can support their work by contributing to 
the implementation of their concluding observations and recommendations, particularly in 
the context of UPR. Options may include systematically making recommendations to ratify 
CEDAW and its Optional Protocol and encouraging the withdrawal of reservations, and 
the taking of particular steps to implement international human rights obligations and
