<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>its resolution 3/2 of 8 December 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> General Assembly resolution 61/149 of 19 December 2006 by which it decided 
to convene a review conference in 2009, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring </i>the surge and sharp increases in xenophobic and racial tendencies in certain 
regions of the world, particularly towards those categories of victims already identified in the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action such as migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, 
people of African descent, people of Asian descent and national and ethnic minorities, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Regretting </i>the lack of political will to take decisive steps to combat racism in all its forms 
and manifestations and to concretely move away from denials about the persistence of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i>, in the above context, the imperative need to end posturing about racism and 
calling on all States to resolutely end impunity for acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and to face the everyday realities and challenges of these 
scourges, 
</p>
<p><i> Absolutely convinced </i>that the lack of political will remains the core factor prompting the 
failure by States to translate the Durban commitments into concrete action and tangible results, 
in particular with respect to honouring the memory of the victims of historical injustices and past 
tragedies caused by slavery, the slave trade, the transatlantic slave trade, apartheid, colonialism 
and genocide, and also underlining that Africans and people of African descent, Asians and 
people of Asian descent and indigenous peoples were victims of these injustices and tragedies 
and continue to be victims of their consequences, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>in the above context, the importance of closing these dark chapters in history 
through reconciliation and healing, and calling on all concerned States to assume their moral 
obligation to halt and reverse the lasting and cascading consequences of these practices prior to 
the convening of the 2009 Durban Review Conference, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the efforts of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action since its inception in 2002, 
by upholding and promoting the spirit of Durban, and registering some progress in spite of the 
obvious challenges, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to realign the work and name of the Anti-Discrimination Unit in the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights consistent with its mandate and 
that henceforth, this Unit shall be known as &#8220;The Anti-Racial Discrimination Unit&#8221;, and that its 
operational activities shall focus exclusively on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, as defined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Durban Declaration; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages </i>closer collaboration between the Intergovernmental Working Group and 
the Eminent Independent Experts on ways and means of achieving enhanced political will and 
commitment to combating all the contemporary manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance of demonstrating goodwill to humanity and the primacy 
of reconciliation, by taking concrete steps towards the implementation of key issues of concern 
to the victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which relate 
to the restoration of their dignity and equality as envisaged in paragraphs 98 to 106 of the 
Durban Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Regrets </i>that the commitments made in paragraphs 157 and 158 of the Durban 
Programme of Action remain unfulfilled; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides </i>to remain seized of this important issue. 
</p>
