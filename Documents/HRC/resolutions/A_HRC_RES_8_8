<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/8.</b>  <b>Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment    
</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that no one should be subjected to torture as defined in article 1 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment is a non-derogable right that must be protected under all 
</p>
<p>circumstances, including in times of international and internal armed conflict or internal 
</p>
<p>disturbance, and that the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed in the relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>also that the prohibition of torture has been recognized as a 
</p>
<p>peremptory norm of international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>that a number of international, regional and domestic courts 
</p>
<p>have held the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to 
</p>
<p>be customary international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that, under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, torture and inhuman 
</p>
<p>treatment are a grave breach and that, under the Statute of the International Criminal 
</p>
<p>Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal 
</p>
<p>for Rwanda and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, acts of torture 
</p>
<p>can constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes, 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Acknowledging the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearances by the General Assembly in its resolution 
</p>
<p>61/177 of 20 December 2006, as well as Council resolution 7/26 on the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, and 
</p>
<p>recognizing that the entry into force of the Convention, as soon as possible, through its 
</p>
<p>ratification by 20 States, and its implementation will make a significant contribution to 
</p>
<p>the prevention of torture, including through prohibiting places of secret detention, 
</p>
<p><i>Commending </i>the persistent efforts by civil society, in particular non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, to combat torture and to alleviate the suffering of 
</p>
<p>victims of torture, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 
</p>
<p>18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic 
</p>
<p>and Social Council and reaffirming the Commission on Human Rights resolutions on the 
</p>
<p>subject, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Condemns </i>all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any 
</p>
<p>place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all Governments to 
</p>
<p>implement fully the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns in particular </i>any action or attempt by States or public officials to 
</p>
<p>legalize, authorize or acquiesce in torture under any circumstances, including on 
</p>
<p>grounds of national security or through judicial decisions; </p>

<p>3. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
</p>
<p>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for a further period of 
</p>
<p>three years: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To seek, receive, examine and act on information from Governments, 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, individuals and

<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To conduct country visits with the consent or at the invitation of 
</p>
<p>Governments; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To study, in a comprehensive manner, trends, developments and challenges 
</p>
<p>in relation to combating and preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, and to make recommendations and observations concerning 
</p>
<p>appropriate measures to prevent and eradicate such practices;

<p>(<i>d</i>) To identify, exchange and promote best practices on measures to prevent, 
</p>
<p>punish and eradicate torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To integrate a gender perspective throughout the work of his or her mandate; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To continue to cooperate with the Committee against Torture, the 
</p>
<p>Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture and relevant United Nations mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and bodies and, as appropriate, regional organizations and mechanisms, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, national preventive mechanisms and civil society, including 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) To report on his or her activities, observations, conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations to the Council, in accordance with its programme of work, and 
</p>
<p>annually on the overall trends and developments with regard to his or her mandate to 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/7/3) and the </p>

<p>recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges </i>States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of 
</p>
<p>his or her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to react 
</p>
<p>appropriately and expeditiously to his or her urgent appeals, and those Governments 
</p>
<p>that have not yet responded to communications transmitted to them by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to answer without further delay; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To give serious consideration to responding favourably to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also urges </i>States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To implement effective measures to prevent torture and other cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, particularly in places of detention and 
</p>
<p>other places where persons are deprived of their liberty, including education and 
</p>
<p>training for personnel, who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment 
</p>
<p>of any individual subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have  all allegations 
</p>
<p>of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and 
</p>
<p>impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold persons who 
</p>
<p>encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought 
</p>
<p>to justice and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of 
</p>
<p>detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed, and to take note, in 
</p>
<p>this respect, of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul 
</p>
<p>Protocol) as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of </p>

<p>torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
</p>
<p>torture as evidence that the statement was made; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other way transfer a 
</p>
<p>person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the 
</p>
<p>person would be in danger of being subjected to torture; the Council recognizes in 
</p>
<p>this respect that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not release States from their 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in 
</p>
<p>particular the principle of non-refoulement; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment obtain redress and are awarded fair and adequate 
</p>
<p>compensation and receive appropriate socio-medical rehabilitation, and in this regard 
</p>
<p>encourages the development of rehabilitation centres for victims of torture; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To ensure that all acts of torture are offences under domestic criminal 
</p>
<p>law, and emphasizes that acts of torture are serious violations of  international  
</p>
<p>human rights law and humanitarian law and can constitute crimes against humanity 
</p>
<p>and war crimes and that the perpetrators are liable to prosecution and punishment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) Not to punish personnel for not obeying orders to commit acts amounting 
</p>
<p>to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) To protect medical and other personnel for their role in documenting torture 
</p>
<p>or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and in treating 
</p>
<p>victims of such acts; 
</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) To ensure appropriate follow-up to conclusions and views on individual 
</p>
<p>communications of the relevant treaty bodies, including the Committee against 
</p>
<p>Torture and the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture; 
</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) To adopt a gender-sensitive approach in the fight against torture and 
</p>
<p>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, paying special 
</p>
<p>attention to violence against women; </p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) To become parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a matter of priority as well as to 
</p>
<p>give early consideration to signing and ratifying its Optional Protocol and, once parties, 
</p>
<p>to designate or establish truly independent and effective national preventive 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Reminds </i>States that: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Corporal punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Intimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the 
</p>
<p>physical integrity of the victim or of a third person, can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or to torture; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
</p>
<p>facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
</p>
<p>respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes </i>the reports of the Committee against Torture, submitted in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 24 of the Convention; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Takes note </i>of the reports of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and calls upon the Board of the Fund to report to 
</p>
<p>the Council in accordance with the annual programme of work; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to ensure, within the overall budgetary 
</p>
<p>framework of the United Nations, the provision of an adequate and stable level of 
</p>
<p>staffing, as well as the necessary technical facilities for the bodies and mechanisms 
</p>
<p>involved in combating torture and assisting victims of torture, in order to ensure their 
</p>
<p>effective performance commensurate with the strong support expressed by Member 
</p>
<p>States for combating torture and assisting victims of torture; </p>

<p>11. <i>Recognizes </i>the global need for international assistance to victims of 
</p>
<p>torture, stresses the importance of the work of the Board of Trustees of the Fund and 
</p>
<p>appeals to all Governments, organizations and individuals to contribute annually to the 
</p>
<p>Fund, preferably with a substantial increase in the contributions, and encourages 
</p>
<p>contributions to the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>to help finance the implementation of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee 
</p>
<p>on Prevention, as well as education programmes of national preventive mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon </i>all Governments, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as relevant 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to commemorate, on 26 June, 
</p>
<p>the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, as proclaimed by 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly in its resolution 52/149 of 12 December 1997; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides </i>to continue to consider this matter in conformity with its annual 
</p>
<p>programme of work. 
</p>
