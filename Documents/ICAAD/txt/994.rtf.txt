TARIFF

04. 

1.      
Aggravated Robbery attracts a maximum sentence of 17 years imprisonment Pursuant to section 313 of the Crimes Degree.

2.      
Theft attracts a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment pursuant to section 291 of the Crimes Degree 2009.

05. The Tariff for both aggravated robbery and theft was discussed in the recent case of State v Jese Driu High Court Criminal Case No: HAC 143/2010 where Hon. Justice Nawana stated the following remarks in paragraphs 3-5 of his sentencing remark.

3. The tariff for the offence of burglary as founded on the basis of the provisions of the old Penal Code, was 18 months to 3 years in imprisonment (State Vs Mikaele Buliruarua) [2010] FJHC 384;(Tomasi Vs State) [2002] HAA 086/02.The tariff set out for the offences involving burglary and larceny under the Penal Code was 1-4 years of imprisonment. (Cavuilagi Vs State [2004] FJHC 92)

4. In Buliruarua"s case (supra) the tariff for the offence of Burglary under the penal Code, was made applicable in relation to the offence of Burglary under the Degree.

5. I would accordingly adopt the same tariff for the offence of Burglary and of Theft under the Degree in this case. 

6.      
The accused is 18 years of age. Currently he is serving a prison term of two years.

7. I have carefully considered these submissions in light of the provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree No: 42 of 2009 especially those of the sections set out below in order to determine the appropriate sentence.

8. Section 15(3) of the Sentencing Decree provides that:

"as a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in Section 4, and sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in the General Sentencing Provisions of the decree".

9. The objectives of sentencing, as found in section 4(1) of the Decree, are as follows:

(a)     
To punish offenders to an extent and a manner, which is just in all the circumstances;
(b)     
To protect the community from offenders;
(c)     
To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature;
(d)     
To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;
(e)     
To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences; or
(f)     
Any combination of these purposes.

10. Section 4(2) of the Decree further provides that in sentencing offenders, aCourt must have regarded to:

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;
(b) Current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable gridline Judgments;
(c) The nature and gravity of the particular offence;
(d) The defender's culpability and degree of responsibly for the offence;
(e) The impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;
(f) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the  stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an  intention to do so;
(g) The conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;
(h)     
Any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for that a court may consider under this Decree;
(i)     
The offender's previous character;
(j)     
The presence of any aggravating pre mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and
(k)     
Any matter stated in this decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option. 

11.     
Now I consider the aggravating factors:

(a)     
Burglary committed with another,
(b)     
Removing the window blades of the house,
(c)     
Ransacking the bedroom of the complainant.

12.     
Now I consider the mitigating circumstances:

(a)     
The accused pleaded guilty before the commencement of the trial.
(b)     
Accused was 17 years old young person at the time of committing the offence..
(d)     
He co-operated with the Police and helped to recover stolen items.
(e)     
He is remorseful.

13.     
Considering all aggravated and mitigating circumstances I impose sentences as follows.

(a)     
For 1st count of Aggravated Burglary I impose 2 years imprisonment as starting point. I add one year for the aggravated factors and I deduct one year for mitigating factors.
(b)     
For 2nd count of Theft I impose 2 years Imprisonment as starting point and add one year for aggravating factors and deduct one year for the mitigating factors.
(c)     
For the 3rd count of Theft I impose 2 years imprisonment as starting point and add one year for the aggravated factors and deduct 1 year for the mitigating factors.

14.     
I order all the sentences to run concurrently. 

15.     
30 days to appeal.
