Judgment

Introduction

The accused is charged as follows: "Idecently Annoying Any Person, contrary to Section 213 (1) (a) of Crimes Decree 2009". 

The particulars of the offence reads: "Tevita Kuruvakadua between 14th and 15th April 2011 at Sigatoka in the Western Division intending to insult the modesty of a girl namely Sulueti Kavu uttered words intending that such words shall be heard by Sulueti Kavu." 

The Law

Section 213 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009 provides for Indecently insulting or annoying any person. It states that:

"(1) A person commits a summary offence if he or she, intending to insult the modesty of any person  

(a) utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by the other person; or 

(b) intrudes upon the privacy of another person by doing an act of a nature likely to offend his or her modesty. 

Penalty  Imprisonment for one year."

The Elements 

The Elements of the charge ofinsulting or annoying any person under Section 1 (a) are:

(i) The accused on the dates as per the charge (identification and date),
(ii) uttered any word, or
(iii) made any sound or gesture, or
(iv) exhibited any object, 
(v) intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by the other person (the victim  Sulueti Kavu)

Burden and Standard of proof 

The burden of proof in this case is on the Prosecution, the State. The Prosecution is required to prove all the elements of the charge the accused is charged with beyond reasonable doubt. If the defence establishes to the Court's satisfaction that there is reasonable doubt, then the prosecution fails. 

Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions, in commenting on the proof beyond reasonable doubt stated: "it need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable,' the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.".

No Re-examination. 

Analysis of the Evidence

The Court has scrutinized all the evidence of all the witnesses in this case. The Court has also noted the demeanor of all witnesses. 

In this case apart from the elements of offence. The other issue is the credibility of witnesses. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the defence is opposed and the Court needed to scrutinise the credibility of the witnessess in addition to the elements of the offence. 

The Court has noted some inconsistencies in the evidence of some of the prosecution witness's evidence. For instance the complainant in her examination in chief stated "I went towards vatudradra police post after getting of vehicle. Met policeman went into police post. I told police in-charge what happened with Tevita." Later in cross-examination she stated "I did not seek assistance at Vatudradra. Accused in front of police at Maro Mosque gave me his phone #. A police was there. Officer heard accused give me phone #."

The 2nd Prosecution witness gave as evidence in examination in chief that "At 0020 hrs at Vatudradra Police Post. On duty. Heard a vehicle go to a shop. I came outside and saw police vehicle beside temple roadside. Saw police vehicle. After 5 minutes saw a fijian girl standing opposite police post. Stopping vehicles towards Nadi. I approached the girl and asked her to come to Post. She agreed." 

The inconsistency the Court notes is in the version by the complainant that she went towards the Police post, whereas PW-2 states that "I approached the girl and asked her to come to Post". These are two diametrical evidences. 

The other evidence by the complainant is that the "Accused in front of police at Maro Mosque gave me his phone #. A police was there. Officer heard accused give me phone #.". The evidence by the officer who was there is "Cannot hear conversation from police vehicle. Could not hear people talk at the vehicle. Did not hear accused and victim converse." This again is inconsistent evidence of the complainant and another prosecution witness.

The other notable issue is that those who came across the complainant described her to be normal following the incident. Whereas she said she was frightened and if she had the chance she would hit the accused with stick or steel. The Court finds that if something as serious and is alleged by the complainant, she surely would have been distressed and have her demeanour would not have been normal as was noted by the other witnesses. 

The Court also noted that there was no evidence by the complainant that she talked to Officer Josevata while she was at the Vatudradra Police Post. The other important consideration by this Court is the lies by the victim when she met the officer at the Vatudradra Police post that she came by taxi and that she was from Semo. These evidences by the complainant go to her credibility. The Court does not believe her for her lies and the inconsistencies with other prosecution witnesses.

The Court has noted and analysed all the evidence and finds the accused is to be believed. He was credible even in tough cross-examination by the Prosecution Counsel. 

The Court notes that such cases will not arise if the Police Force adopts proper practices when female complainants/accuseds are dealt with. There clearly is a need to have female officers providing company during interviews, any travel to and from the Police Station in police vehicle. Similarly The Police must quickly be able to realise deviant behaviour of persons and be able to get parents involved and guide and counsel the person and the parents and follow up until the police is satisfied that things are under control. 

The Court is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence tendered as to the accused's guilt. 

The accused is acquitted of the charge. 

28 Days to appeal.
