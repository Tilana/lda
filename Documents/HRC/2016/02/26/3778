</p>
<p> The Council adopts the general guidelines below.  
</p>

for the preparation of information provided under the universal periodic review;  
</p>
<p> B. Developments since the previous review in background of the State under 
review and framework, particularly normative and institutional framework, for the

</p>
<p>  
&#8727; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
the Council on its seventeenth session (A/HRC/17/2), chap. I. 
 
</p>

<p>national jurisprudence, human rights infrastructure including national human rights 
institutions and scope of international obligations identified in the &#8220;basis of review&#8221; in 
resolution 5/1, annex, section IA; 
</p>
<p> C. Promotion and protection of human rights on the ground: implementation of 
international human rights obligations identified in the &#8220;basis of review&#8221; in resolution 5/1, 
annex, section IA, national legislation and voluntary commitments, national human rights 
institutions activities, public awareness of human rights, cooperation with human rights 
mechanisms &#8230;;  
</p>
<p> D. Presentation by the State concerned of the follow-up to the previous review; 
</p>
<p>  E. Identification of achievements, best practices, challenges and constraints in 
relation to the implementation of accepted recommendations and the development of 
human rights situations in the State;  
</p>
<p>  F. Key national priorities, initiatives and commitments that the State concerned

improve human rights situations on the ground;  
</p>
<p>  G. Expectations of the State concerned in terms of capacity-building and 
requests, if any, for technical assistance and support received. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Duration of the review in the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review</b> 
</p>
<p> 3. The duration of the review shall be extended to three hours and thirty minutes 
for each country in the Working Group, so as to be within existing resources and with no 
additional workload, during which the State under review shall be given up to 70 minutes to 
be used for initial presentation, replies and concluding comments in line with President&#8217;s 
statement PRST/8/1 of 9 April 2008. 
</p>
<p> 4. The allocation of time during the working group shall be in accordance with 
annex II. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. List of speakers in the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p> 5. The established procedures, which allow three minutes speaking time for 
Member States and two minutes for observer States, will continue to apply when all 
speakers can be accommodated within three hours and thirty minutes available to Member 
and observer States. 
</p>
<p> 6. Should it be impossible to accommodate all speakers within three hours and 
thirty minutes based on three minutes speaking time for Member States and two minutes for 
observer States, the speaking time will be reduced to two minutes for all.  
</p>
<p> 7. If all speakers still cannot be accommodated, the speaking time will be 
divided among all delegations inscribed so as to enable each and every speaker to take the 
floor. 
</p>
<p> 8. Steps for drawing up the list of speakers: 
</p>
<p> (a) The list of speakers will open at 10 a.m. on the Monday of the week 
preceding the beginning of the session of the Working Group and will remain open for a 
period of four days. It will close on the Thursday at 6 p.m.. A registration desk will be set 
up at the Palais des Nations. The exact location will be communicated to all permanent 
missions by the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> (b) In all cases, regardless of speaking times, the delegations inscribed on the list 
of speakers will be arranged by alphabetical order of the country names in English. On the 
Friday morning preceding the beginning of the session, the President, in the presence of the </p>


<p>Bureau, will draw by lot the first speaker on the list. The list of speakers will continue from 
the State drawn onward. On Friday afternoon, all delegations will be informed of the 
speaking order and of the speaking time available to delegations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Speaking time limits during the review will be strictly enforced. Speakers 
who exceed speaking time will have their microphones cut off. Speakers may therefore 
wish to deliver the essential part at the beginning of their statements; 
</p>
<p> (d) All speakers will retain the possibility of swapping places on the speaker&#8217;s 
list under bilateral arrangement between speakers. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Voluntary funds 
</b></p>
<p> 9. The Secretariat is requested to revise the terms of reference of the Voluntary 
Fund for participation in the universal periodic review and to provide an annual written 
update to the Human Rights Council, starting from the eighteenth session, on the operations 
of the funds and the resources available to it. 
</p>
<p> 10. The Secretariat is requested to revise the terms of reference of the Voluntary 
Fund for financial and technical assistance in the implementation of the universal periodic 
review and to provide an annual written update to the Human Rights Council, starting from 
the eighteenth session, on the operations of the fund and the resources available to it. A 
board of trustees shall be established by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 
accordance with the rules of the United Nations and taking into consideration equitable 
geographic representation.&#8221;
