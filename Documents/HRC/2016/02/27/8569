<p><b>  Mission to Tunisia</b>&#8727;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism 
conducted a visit to Tunisia from 22 to 26 January 2010. He wishes to thank the 
Government for the invitation and the good cooperation extended to him. In this report, the 
Special Rapporteur examines the current terrorist threats and the legal and institutional 
frameworks that form the backdrop for the country&#8217;s counter-terrorism efforts. He 
concludes that the current definition of terrorism is vague and broad, hence deviating from 
the principle of legality and allowing for wide usage of counter-terrorism measures in 
practice. He therefore discusses the importance of a strict definition of the concept of 
terrorism, also since the latter impacts on other legal provisions relating to membership 
in/support for terrorist organizations and incitement to terrorism. He is concerned that some 
of the existing provisions may lead to undue restrictions of other human rights, e.g. 
freedoms of expression, religion and association.

<p> Recognizing that, in principle, the law provides for some basic safeguards against 
arbitrary and secret detention as well as against torture and ill-treatment, the Special 
Rapporteur points to a considerable gap between the legal framework and what happens in 
reality in relation to arrest and detention of terrorist suspects. On the basis of the evidence 
he gathered, he observed a pattern of unacknowledged detention being used vis-&#224;-vis 
terrorist suspects. During the period of secret detention, terrorism suspects are at high risk 
of being subjected to torture and ill-treatment. The secrecy that surrounds custody and 
interrogations by the unit of the &#8220;Police Judiciare&#8221;, which is in charge of interrogating 
terrorism suspects (commonly referred to under its previous name &#8220;Directorate for State 
Security&#8221;, DSS), renders investigations into abuses improbable and, consequently, leads to 
a lack of accountability and to impunity. The Special Rapporteur further concludes that the 
judiciary does not effectively act as a safeguard against these practices, and that the 
restrictions on access to lawyer during police custody aggravate his concerns. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Special Rapporteur refers to international aspects of the country&#8217;s 
involvement in the fight against terrorism and applauds its efforts to prevent terrorism 
through a multi-pillar strategy, which includes combating poverty and discrimination and 
measures in the field of education, not without cautioning, however, that these doubtlessly 
positive policies are easily undermined by violations of the law which, as always, have a 
counterproductive effect in the fight against terrorism 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations, which would help to 
address the gaps identified at the legal and policy levels, including to revise the definition 
of terrorism, amend some other provisions of the counter-terrorism law regarding 
incitement, membership and financing of terrorism, end secret detention and thereby render 
safeguards effective, allow for independent monitoring and establish effective complaints 
mechanisms, reinforce accountability, strengthen the independence of the judiciary and 
ensure the right to a fair trial.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism visited Tunisia from 22 
to 26 January 2010, at the invitation of the Government. During his visit the Special 
Rapporteur met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice and Human 
Rights, Ministry of Interior officials, judges, parliamentarians and the High Committee on 
Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties. He also benefited from meetings with 
representatives of the international community, lawyers, academics and non-governmental 
organizations, including human rights organizations and organizations of victims of 
terrorism. In addition, he visited the Bouchoucha police detention facility and the 
Mornaguia Prison, where he interviewed several persons suspected of, or convicted for, 
terrorist crimes. All this allowed him to learn about the situation in order to make an 
assessment of compliance with human rights in the context of counter-terrorism in Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses appreciation for the invitation and cooperation 
extended by Tunisia, including by granting him access to official detention facilities. He 
stresses that every State has the obligation to protect the life and integrity of its citizens and 
residents, including from threats emanating from terrorism. At the same time, international 
human rights norms have to be fully respected, including the rights of persons suspected of 
being involved in terrorist crimes. Tunisia has repeatedly made commitments to that effect, 
including by ratifying most international conventions related to human rights or to 
terrorism. He interprets the invitation extended to him as a significant step on the way to 
fulfilling these commitments. The Special Rapporteur thanks all his interlocutors, including 
victims of terrorist acts and their families, and detainees and their families, for speaking to 
him. 
</p>
<p>3. While Tunisian authorities in many respects operated in the spirit of transparency 
during the visit, despite repeated requests, the Special Rapporteur was not allowed access to 
the interrogation facilities of the Sub-directorate for Criminal Affairs of the &#8220;Police 
Judiciaire&#8221;, also known as &#8220;Directorate of State Security&#8221;, DSS. This is all the more 
troubling, as the overwhelming majority of the allegations of torture or ill-treatment 
received by the Special Rapporteur focus on the role of the &#8220;police judiciaire&#8221; in what 
happens prior to officially registered police custody, during investigation and interrogation, 
or when a detainee awaiting trial is taken out of the prison for further investigation  
</p>
<p><b> II.  The context and legal framework for the fight against 
terrorism 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Terrorist threats 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, in both Tunisia and neighbouring countries, 
Islamist movements which were perceived as threatening the concept of a secular state 
emerged and gained in popularity. A number of violent acts in 1990 and 1991 were 
attributed to Ennahda (Renaissance), although the leadership of Ennahda repeatedly 
condemned the use of violence. Many persons were sentenced to up to three years in prison 
in the early 1990s for membership of Ennahda. In 1992, 265 alleged organizers and leaders 
of the organization were tried in military courts on charges of plotting to overthrow the 
Government<i>. </i>Human rights organizations that observed the proceedings described the 1992 
trials as unfair and concluded that the charges of a plotted coup had not been proven. Most </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>of the defendants in those trials were not convicted of carrying out any acts of violence.1 
Most have since been released, but some remain in prison, and even in isolation. 
</p>
<p>5. The Tunisian Combatant Group (TCG), also known as the Jama&#8217;a Combattante 
Tunisienne, was founded in 2000 and reportedly seeks to establish Islamist regime in 
Tunisia. Its members allegedly have links to Al-Qaida and radical Islamist networks in 
Western Europe. Belgian authorities arrested one of the founders in late 2001 and sentenced 
him to six years in prison in 2003 for his role in the assassination of an anti-Taliban 
commander in 2001. TCG was suspected of plotting, but not carrying out, attacks on the 
embassies of Algeria, Tunisia and the United States of America in Rome in December 
</p><p>2001. The organization was put on the Al-Qaida and Taliban Consolidated List of the 
United Nations Security Council's 1267 Sanctions Committee in October 2002. 
</p>
<p>6. Many of the official interlocutors of the Special Rapporteur, as well as the 
representatives of victims of terrorism heard by him, pointed out two past terrorist attacks 
within Tunisia, namely a bomb attack outside the Ghriba synagogue in Djerba in April 
2002, which killed 21 people including several foreigners and for which Al-Qaida claimed 
responsibility; and secondly, in December 2006, a clash between security forces and an 
armed group later identified by the authorities as the Soldiers of Assad Ibn Fourat (aka the 
&#8220;Soliman Group&#8221;), in which 14 people died. According to the authorities, this group was 
linked to Al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM), which &#8220;aimed to terrorize the population and 
provoke chaos&#8221;. It was stressed by several of his interlocutors that AQIM remains a threat 
in the region. AQIM claimed responsibility for kidnapping two Austrian tourists in Tunisia 
in February 2008. The authorities also referred to the overall regional context and the 
terrorism threats and past acts of terrorism in neighbouring countries. The Special 
Rapporteur shares the concern about the threat of terrorism and is fully cognizant of the fact 
that any Government has to take decisive measures to prevent criminal acts endangering the 
life and physical and mental integrity of its population or parts of its population. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. Tunisia has ratified a wide range of international treaties on counter-terrorism as 
well as in the human rights field. The Special Rapporteur also notes that article 1 of Law 
2003-75 of 10 December 2003 refers to the need for international cooperation and explicitly 
proclaims that the fight against terrorism is to be conducted in the framework of 
international, regional and bilateral conventions ratified by Tunisia and by respecting 
constitutional provisions. However, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, some of the 
current legal provisions do not comply with international human rights norms 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The definition of terrorism and its scope of application 
</b></p>
<p>8. A first, extremely broad, definition of terrorism was included into Tunisian 
legislation  in 1993, namely article 52 bis of the Penal Code, which read: &#8220;any crime 
relating to an individual or collective initiative (&#8220;enterprise&#8221;) aimed at damaging persons or 
property for the purpose of intimidation or causing alarm shall be categorized as terrorist. 
Acts of incitement to hatred or racist or religious fanaticism shall also be dealt with as 
terrorist offences, whatever the means used.&#8221; This provision was replaced by the definition 
contained in article 4 of Law 2003-75, which defines terrorism as &#8220;every crime, regardless 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See Amnesty International, Tunisia: Heavy sentences after unfair trials (AI Index: MDE 30/23/92, 
</p>
<p>September 1992) and Amnesty International, Tunisia: Rhetoric versus reality, the failure of a human 
rights bureaucracy (AI Index: MDE 30/01/94, January 1994). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>of its motives, connected to an individual or collective initiative (&#8220;enterprise&#8221;) aiming at 
terrorizing one person or a group of people and spreading fear among the population, for 
the purpose of, among other things, influencing State policies and compelling it to act in a 
particular way or preventing it from so acting; or disturbing public order or international 
peace and security, or attacking people or facilities, damaging buildings housing diplomatic 
missions, prejudicing the environment, so as to endangering the life of its inhabitants, their 
health or jeopardizing vital resources, infrastructures, means of transport and 
communications, computer systems or public services.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>9. Whereas the provision constituted an improvement over the previous definition, 
several issues arise:  
</p>
<p>(a) It does not fulfil the legality requirement contained in article 15 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or article 13 of the Tunisian 
Constitution which say that all elements of a crime need to be encapsulated in the law in 
explicit and precise terms. In particular, it fails to describe what &#8220;terrorizing people&#8221;, 
&#8220;influencing State policies&#8221; or &#8220;harming public facilities&#8221; means in concrete terms of 
actions, and does not identify a threshold in relation to the damage resulting that would 
render the act a crime of terrorism;  
</p>
<p>(b) Deadly or otherwise serious physical violence against members of the general 
population or segments of it should be a central element of any definition of terrorism, as 
systematically emphasized by the Special Rapporteur. In Tunisia this is not the case as the 
law in its present shape does not limit the definition of the act to the use of violent means 
against human persons; 
</p>
<p>(c) In addition, due to the lack of a clear definition of the terms used, acts 
punishable under regular criminal law can easily be categorized as acts of &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. The current wide definition clearly carries the risk of broad application of 
counterterrorism legislation, which in turn means that the term &#8220;terrorism&#8221; may become 
diluted and lose its distinguishing stigma. This may have possibly far-reaching 
consequences for the rights to freedoms of expression, association and assembly &#8211; an issue 
also raised by the Human Rights Committee in 2008. Despite certain changes made to the 
law (cf. infra) the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Committee remain valid: &#8220;The 
Committee is concerned at the lack of precision in the particularly broad definition of 
terrorist acts contained in the Terrorism and Money-laundering Act (Act No.2003-75) &#8230; 
The definition of terrorist acts should not lead to interpretations allowing the legitimate 
expression of rights enshrined in the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] to be violated 
under the cover of terrorist acts. The State party should ensure that the measures taken to 
combat terrorism are in conformity with the provisions of the Covenant (arts. 6, 7, 14)&#8221;.2 
</p>
<p>11. The wide application of terrorism related charges was confirmed by the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s observations in terms of arrests. When he visited the Bouchoucha police 
station in Tunis, through which terrorism suspects usually pass before being transferred to 
pre-trial detention, the custody record showed that, between 1 and 25 January 2010 alone, 
25 persons had been registered as being in custody in connection with terrorist offenses. 
This frequency of one person per day supports the conclusion that counter-terrorism 
legislation does not only apply to a small group of very dangerous individuals but also to a 
considerable number of people. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The same applies to trials under the 2003 Law: the official statistics that the Special 
Rapporteur received during his visit on the number of cases under the 2003-75 Law show 
that overall 214 cases have been brought in the seven years since its adoption, in which 
1,123 individuals were involved (see table).

</p>
<p><i>Totals </i>214 1,123 
</p>
<p>13. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received information about a number of cases, 
where the main &#8220;crime&#8221; seems to have been to have visited certain countries or even 
mosques, downloaded or watched certain programmes online, having held prayers together, 
or having met with others to discuss religious issues. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Membership and support to terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>14. Article 13 of Law 2003-75, which seems to be the basis for many of the terrorism 
related convictions, provides for imprisonment for between 5 and 12 years for &#8220;adhering to 
an organization or entity, whichever their form and the number of its members, which has, 
even if coincidentally or incidentally, used terrorism as a means of action in the realization 
for its objectives&#8221;. This formulation is of concern to the Special Rapporteur because the 
entities covered remain vaguely defined and the required &#8220;coincidentally or incidentally&#8221; 
link with terrorism &#8211; especially in the context of the wide terrorism definition &#8211; leaves too 
much leeway to the authorities when qualifying an organization as &#8220;terrorist&#8221;. Furthermore, 
no proscription procedure for organizations is provided by law; therefore no remedies are 
available to challenge such a qualification of an organization. The article also does not 
include any requirement that the person must be aware of the terrorist nature of the group or 
must have had the intention to adhere to an organization which uses terrorism. 
</p>
<p>15. Article 22 criminalizes the failure, even where bound by professional secrecy, to 
notify immediately the competent authorities of any acts, information or instructions which 
may have emerged concerning a terrorist offence. Whereas close relatives are exempted, 
this provision fully applies to medical personnel, clergy and defence lawyers and may 
therefore have serious implications for the confidentiality requirement, which is key to the 
right to legal assistance during a fair trial and to the right to health care. As a minimum, this 
provision should therefore provide exceptions for lawyers, clergy and members of the 
medical profession. 
</p>
<p>16. Articles 14 to 18 of the Law 2003-75 criminalize acts related to terrorism, such as 
the preparation or commission of terrorist acts abroad, the procurement and supply of 
weapons, training of terrorists, the act of putting a meeting place at the disposal of 
terrorists, of housing or hiding them or of helping them to escape, or lending of one&#8217;s 
expertise to a terrorist group. In combination with the overly broad definition of terrorism </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>contained in article 4, these provisions allow for targeting as &#8220;terrorists&#8221; people who simply 
hold radical and unpalatable views without posing a real danger in terms of planning any 
violent acts. Article 18 does not specify any intent requirement on the part of the person 
who provides the support. 
</p>
<p>17. Article 68 of Law 2003-75 prohibits the provision of any form of direct or indirect 
support or financing for individuals, organizations or activities connected with terrorist 
offences or other illegal activities through any type of natural or legal entity, including not-
for-profit organizations. Article 69 sets out a list of actions from which any moral person 
has to abstain, such as receiving donations or subsidies where the origin is unknown or 
which stems from illicit and unlawful acts or from any person or organization &#8220;notoriously 
involved in activities linked to terrorist offences&#8221;; donations or financial aid if it is not 
authorized by a special legal provision or, even if authorized by law, any funds coming 
from abroad if no official Tunisia-based intermediary is involved, etc.  They carry the risk 
of placing the stigma of terrorism on lawful activities. In addition, according to article 45 of 
the Penal Code, the court may confiscate the financial assets of the accused, regarded as the 
product of the criminal action, even when those assets are in the hands of members of the 
family concerned, unless those prove otherwise. Unless carefully scrutinized by the 
judiciary, these provisions may lead to restrictions of freedom of association in the sense 
that they may be used to restrict foreign funding for entirely legitimate organizations. 
</p>
<p>18.  Article 83 of the 2003 Law stipulates that the Tunisian Commission on Financial 
Analyses has to put in place a database on persons and legal entities suspected of having 
links with operations on financing relating to terrorism or money-laundering, declarations 
gathered that relate to suspect operations or transactions, demands for information that it 
has received from authorities responsible for the application of the law or its foreign 
counterparts and the follow-up to these.&#8221; The breadth of this provision raises concerns in 
terms of the right to privacy, in particular since there does not seem to be any obligation to 
notify concerned persons. Moreover, the law does not seem to provide for judicial 
authorizations or for any oversight mechanism to ensure that the database is not abused or 
used for other purposes. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Incitement 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the legal amendments adopted in 2009 that 
eliminated the previous article 6 from Law 2003-75, a vaguely formulated provision 
regarding incitement, which conflated the propagation of racial hatred and the incitement of 
terrorism. However, he notes that article 11, criminalizing incitement, conspiring or 
intention to commit a terrorist act, and article 12, criminalizing calls to commit terrorist 
offences or to adhere to an organization or entity connected with terrorist offences, as well 
as using a name, a term, a symbol or any other sign to promote (&#8220;faire l&#8217;apologie&#8221;) a 
terrorist organization, one of its members or its activities, are still not precise enough to 
meet the legality requirement of article 15 of the International Covenant for Civil and 
Political Rights. Especially with regard to the latter offence, the envisaged penalty of 
imprisonment for 5&#8211;12 years seems excessive. The criminalization of the mere use of 
names, terms, symbols and signs carries the risk of causing undue restrictions on freedom 
of expression. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur regrets that Decree No. 246 of 15 August 2007, which 
clarifies the structure of the internal security forces under the Ministry of Interior, is not a 
public document. He was told that the main entity under the immediate authority of the 
Ministry of Interior, under which all counter-terrorism (and many other) activities fall is the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;General Directorate for National Security&#8221; (Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale de la s&#251;ret&#233; nationale). 
Underneath it is the General Directorate for Public Security&#8221; linked directly to day-to-day 
activities, such as community policing, neighbourhood patrolling, traffic, etc. One entity 
under this General Directorate is called the Directorate of the &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221;, the 
criminal police section tasked with judiciary matters and under supervision of the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office. The &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221; has its own specialized structures, such as the 
police for minors and a brigade for special inquiries and is inter alia in charge of crime 
investigation. One unit, the &#8220;Subdirectorate of Criminal Affairs&#8221; is closely linked to the 
Tunis Court of First Instance and in charge of investigating terrorism-related cases.  
</p>
<p>21. Elements rendering the practical operation of counter-terrorism policing opaque are 
the use of several common names for what appears to be the same entity, namely the 
Subdirectorate of Criminal Affairs, formerly known as &#8220;DSS&#8221;, standing for the &#8220;Directorate 
of State Security&#8221; and the lack of publicly available information on its status and 
organization. Furthermore, there are two additional entities involved in counter-terrorism 
measures, with their tasks and organizational relationship to the &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221; 
remaining unclear, namely the &#8220;Directorate of Special Services&#8221; that supervises several 
structures such as the Directorate of General Intelligence, but does not make inquiries or 
launch criminal procedures; and the General Directorate for Terrorism. Although the 
Special Rapporteur has requested the authorities to provide him with the legislative basis 
for the relevant police structure, he has not received anything beyond a reference to Chapter 
I of the Criminal Procedure Code, which sets out the mandate and tasks of the &#8220;Police 
Judiciaire&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Detention and trial 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Back-dating of arrest dates resulting in secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>22. Article 12 of the Constitution stipulates that &#8220;police custody shall be subject to 
judicial review and a court order shall be required for pretrial detention. No one may be 
placed arbitrarily in police custody or detention&#8221; Article 13bis of the Criminal Procedure 
Code details the safeguards available to any person in the custody of the &#8220;Police 
Judiciaire&#8221;. They include: notifying a family member, informing the suspect about the 
reason for arrest and that he/she has the right to a medical examination during police 
custody, and issuing a detailed record (&#8220;proc&#232;s verbal&#8221;) including the exact date and time of 
the beginning of police custody. It is also laudable that legislative amendments adopted in 
2008 rendered safeguards relating to the prolongation of the period of police custody more 
precise. 
</p>
<p>23. However, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, these provisions are routinely 
disregarded. Numerous testimonies collected by him indicated &#8211; and it was admitted by the 
authorities &#8211; that dates of arrest are routinely post-dated, thereby circumventing the rules 
about the allowed length of police detention and taking detainees out of the protection 
framework. When the Special Rapporteur visited Bouchoucha, the police station in Tunis 
through which terrorism suspects pass before being transferred to pretrial detention, he 
discovered that all of the 25 detainees whose names were contained in the custody record in 
relation to terrorist crimes had been brought there by members of the &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221; in 
the late afternoon or evening and taken out once during the following night for an 
unspecified period (the officials present during the visit explained that such temporary 
transfers were indicated in pencil only and erased once the person returned) before finally 
being transferred before a judge in the morning of the next day. The recorded practice of 
very short official police custody in terrorism cases is in stark contradiction with reports by 
detainees and families about interrogations ranging from several days to a number of weeks </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>before being brought before a judge. The police officers in Bouchoucha also denied 
knowing where the &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221; holds the suspects before bringing them to 
Bouchoucha for registration into official detention. This pattern appears to be compatible 
with the many allegations received by the Special Rapporteur that people under 
investigation are typically in terrorism cases first held in unacknowledged police custody. 
</p>
<p>24. The evidence brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur indicated that 
suspected terrorists are routinely held in secret in a building of the Ministry of Interior in 
Tunis. Detainees allegedly sleep either on the ground floor in rudimentary conditions in a 
number of cells grouped around a larger room, or in smaller cells in the basement. 
Interrogations also take place on upper floors. No person from the outside has access to 
these premises, so detainees are at the mercy of their custodians, which, in itself, puts 
pressure on them and may constitute inhuman treatment. The authorities, however, continue 
to deny that the Ministry of Interior detains persons within or close to its official premises. 
Despite repeated requests, they did not allow the Special Rapporteur access to the 
interrogation facilities of the Ministry. 
</p>
<p>25. Practices of secret and unacknowledged detention are not only problematic because 
they give detainees the feeling that they are in a situation of total dependence on their 
interrogators, but also because by taking them out of the legal protection framework they 
render all the safeguards ineffective that they would enjoy if they were subject to official 
custody. Hence, the situation in high likelihood results in a culture of torture and impunity. 
The fact that the authorities deny that any person is held in unacknowledged premises 
makes any external monitoring impossible. Overall, the practices described above clearly 
constitute serious violations of the detainees&#8217; human rights. 
</p>
<p>26. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is very concerned at the impact of these 
practices on family members of the detainees. Secret detention has serious consequences 
for families, given the lack of knowledge of what happens to their loved one and the 
resulting fear for their physical and mental integrity and life. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Torture and the use of confessions obtained under torture 
</b></p>
<p>27. Tunisian law prohibits torture (articles 5 and 13 of the Constitution and articles 101 
and 101 bis of the Penal Code), and Tunisia is a party to the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The law provides for the possibility to file 
complaints either with officers of the &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221; or the Prosecutor (who supervises 
and carries the responsibility for the former). However, this means that, in cases of torture 
or ill-treatment, complaints would be addressed to the same body that is alleged to have 
perpetrated or condoned the ill-treatment. Therefore, the mechanisms will not appear 
credible to the victims. The Superior Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental 
Liberties indicated that, while in principle they could, they do not receive complaints about 
detention at the Ministry of Interior. Moreover, it appears that no provision in Tunisian 
legislation requires judges to open investigations ex officio into torture allegations 
presented in court, to motivate the rejection of a torture complaint or to exclude any 
evidence or statements obtained under torture. Theoretically a victim would also be able to 
file a complaint to other non-judicial bodies such as the human rights units of the Ministry 
of Justice and Human Rights and the Ministry of Interior and Local Development. 
</p>
<p>28. In practice, numerous cases of terrorism suspects brought to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s attention indicate that ill-treatment and/or torture is perpetrated during initial, 
unacknowledged police custody or interrogations by what is commonly referred to as 
&#8220;DSS&#8221;, in particular if the suspects refuse to confess. The details of these accounts suggest </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>that these practices occur under the direct control of the Ministry of Interior and possibly 
even within or next to the premises of the Ministry. According to consistent allegations, 
suspects are regularly subjected to severe beatings on different parts of the body, including 
genitals, with fists, cables and batons, kicking, slapping, often combined with stripping of 
their clothes and suspensions (including in the so-called <i>poulet r&#244;ti</i> (&#8220;roast chicken&#8221;) 
position), even in ordinary offices of the Ministry. Some reports also described 
electroshocks and mock-drowning taking place in one particular room in the basement, 
especially in cases, where suspects resisted to making confessions. Other methods used 
included extended periods of sleep deprivation, burning with cigarettes, threats with rape, 
threats to family members and anal rape. The treatment was allegedly perpetrated by plain-
clothes officers of DSS. 
</p>
<p>29. The main purpose of the torture was to extract confessions, and sometimes 
testimonies about third persons. It normally stopped with the signing of papers that most 
suspects had not been allowed to read. However, the Special Rapporteur received 
allegations about instances of reprisals occurring in official places of detention in terms of 
beatings, threats and solitary confinement, for instance, for prisoners that had made calls for 
prayer or submitted complaints. In several cases, detainees were transferred from prisons 
back to the premises of the Ministry of Interior for interrogation and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>30. The testimonies also indicated that existing safeguards are ineffective in practice. 
Apart from the fact that the ill-treatment normally happens prior to the registration of police 
arrest, access to independent medical examinations, although provided for by law upon 
authorization by a judge, is practically never granted, and can therefore not be considered 
an effective safeguard. If at all, medical examinations take place months after the ill-
treatment was perpetrated, and therefore fail to produce evidence that can be used in court. 
The resulting &#8220;lack of proof&#8221; is then used by prosecutors and judges to ignore claims about 
torture and ill-treatment and, on that basis to reject requests for investigations. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur notes that there have been several cases of prosecutions of 
officials involved in ill-treatment that the authorities have brought to his attention: 
</p>
<p>(a) On 6 March 2009, two policemen were sentenced by the Tunis Appeal Court 
to 20 years of imprisonment for injuries resulting from beatings leading to the death of a 
suspect; and two others to 15 and 10 years respectively; 
</p>
<p>(b) On 25 January 2002, three officers from the penitentiary administration were 
sentenced to four years of imprisonment for &#8220;use of force&#8221; (<i>voie de fait</i>) against a detainee. 
</p>
<p>(c) On 2 April 2002, one police officer was sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment for beatings resulting in injuries ; 
</p>
<p>(d) On 11 June 2009, two policemen were sentenced to two years of 
imprisonment for &#8220;use of force&#8221; against two citizens in the fulfilment of their functions 
(<i>voie de fait</i>). 
</p>
<p>32. While noting the importance of at least some trials and convictions, the Special 
Rapporteur considers that the number of prosecutions or other clear findings related to 
torture remains disturbingly low when compared to the frequency and severity of the 
allegations he received. He is concerned that there are remnants of a climate of impunity 
within law-enforcement structures. This is all the more troubling in light of allegations that 
confessions are frequently used as evidence in court. He is therefore concerned that the lack 
of effective investigations into allegations of torture may have led and continue to lead to 
unfair trials and illegitimate court judgements, on the basis of which persons may be 
deprived of their liberty &#8211; one of the most severe interferences with fundamental freedoms 
&#8211; for years, sometimes decades. He therefore calls upon the authorities to reopen cases </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>where torture allegations have not been adequately addressed and to exclude questionable 
evidence from the proceedings in accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Trials 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Judiciary 
</b>33. Article 43 of the 2003 Law gives exclusive competence over investigations and 
prosecutions of terrorism-related cases in Tunisia to the &#8220;Police Judiciaire&#8221;, under the 
public prosecutors and investigating judges attached to the Tunis Court of First Instance. 
The latter has the power to try people charged with such offences and, therefore, although it 
technically is not a specialized court, de facto operates as such. With regard to the legal 
framework relevant to fair trials, the Special Rapporteur welcomes some recent 
amendments, in particular the abolition of &#8220;faceless judges&#8221; (previous article 51 of Law 
2003-75). 
</p>
<p>34. Overall, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the judiciary appears to fail to act 
as an effective remedy when it comes to allegations of torture or ill-treatment. Numerous 
persons indicated that raising such allegations during trial practically never leads to any 
action by the judges. Unfortunately, the Special Rapporteur's meetings with judges of the 
Appeals Court in Tunis did not take away his concern of that protocols that mention torture 
allegations and other written submissions on the issue are routinely ignored by the court. 
This raises serious concerns in terms of the independence of the judiciary, guaranteed by 
article 65 of the Constitution and the Law No. 29 of 1967, exacerbated by indications that 
the Executive Branch, through the Supreme Council of the Judiciary (which is composed of 
the President, who is the Chairman, and the Minister of Justice as Vice-chairman, plus a 
majority of members either representing or appointed by the Executive Branch) controls 
many aspects of the judiciary, including appointments, promotions, transfers and 
disciplinary measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Military courts 
</b></p>
<p>35. Pursuant to article 123 of the Code of Military Justice of 1957 amended in 19794, 
which gives military courts jurisdiction over civilians charged with serving a terrorist 
organization that operates abroad, the military courts have dealt since the 1990s with a 
number of cases of Tunisians who were believed to be active in terrorist organizations 
abroad. Following the entry into force of the 2003 Counter-Terrorism Law, the focus of the 
military courts&#8217; terrorism-related cases changed to cases which had a link with 
&#8216;international terrorism&#8217; or international money laundering.  If alleged perpetrators of 
terrorist acts, sentenced in absentia by a military court, return to Tunisia from abroad, the 
retrials take place in front of military courts as well. About 15 such cases are still pending. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that Tunisia has gradually limited its military 
justice system since 2000 through the transfer of jurisdiction to civilian courts, especially in 
relation to crimes that have no relation to military matters and in which the parties involved 
are not a part of the military. 
</p>
<p>36. Trials in military courts in Tunisia are conducted before a presiding judge, who is a 
civilian, and four counsellors, all of whom are serving military officers. Whereas the 
magistrates of the Military Court assured the Special Rapporteur that defendants enjoy the 
same safeguards as in ordinary courts, and pointed to article 40 of the Code of Military 
Justice to stress that all military court proceedings must be conducted in public, concern has 
been raised that, owing to the locations of military tribunals, public access may be de facto 
restricted. Moreover, defendants, if convicted, have no right of appeal other than to seek a 
review before the military Court of Cassation, which can annul a verdict only on the 
grounds of error in procedure or in application of the law without reconsidering the merits. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>This is incompatible with article 14, paragraph 5, of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the consistent jurisprudence by the Human Rights Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Access to lawyers 
</b>37. The right to prompt access to a lawyer of one&#8217;s choice is a vital component of any 
fair trial. The Special Rapporteur therefore is concerned that such access is not provided by 
the &#8220;safeguards&#8221; list in article 13 bis of the Criminal Procedure Code during the <i>garde &#224; 
vue</i> (police custody) period. According to article 57, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, during the hearing before the <i>juge d&#8217;instruction</i> (investigating judge) (which, 
according to the law has to take place not later than six days after the beginning of the 
<i>garde &#224; vue</i>), the suspect has the right to be assisted by a lawyer of his choice. An 
amendment to article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2000 stipulates that a 
lawyer has to assist in cases of crime dealt with before the Court of First Instance and 
appeal courts. If the suspect does not designate a lawyer him/herself, the presiding judge 
assigns one. That means that lawyers are excluded from the first stage of police custody, 
where their presence would constitute an important safeguard against undue pressure, 
procedural violations or/and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur received a number of allegations regarding obstruction of 
the work of defence lawyers, e.g. concerning restrictions on access to their clients and their 
clients&#8217; files, but also about harassment in more general terms, in particular vis-&#224;-vis those 
who defend terrorism suspects. This can take the form of interference with their 
correspondence, non-issuance of passports for international travel, but also go further to not 
allowing them to enter certain places, pressuring family members, etc. Lawyers also 
referred to article 22 of Law 2003-75, indicating that it puts them at risk of being accused 
of being complicit with terrorist crimes. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government 
has denied the existence of these practices. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Servicing of sentences 
</b></p>
<p>39. Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors confirmed that, although overall 
prison conditions have improved over recent years, including in terms of infrastructure, 
overcrowding remains a problem. Detainees interviewed by the Special Rapporteur 
indicated that the regular visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross and their 
confidential interaction with the Government has resulted in piecemeal improvements of 
prison conditions. However, some problematic practices vis-&#224;-vis persons detained in 
connection with alleged terrorist offences were reported  in relation to corporal punishment; 
solitary confinement for prolonged periods and to restrictions on access to health care. The 
Special Rapporteur also received many reports about actual torture within prisons until up 
to 2007&#8211;2008. 
</p>
<p>40. Many of the witnesses, including family members, complained about frequent 
transfers between prisons, which are widely perceived as constituting an additional 
punishment and which punish families by making it impossible or difficult to visit their 
relatives in prison, since the distances may be considerable. An aggravating factor is that 
the food offered by the prison is largely considered insufficient and prisoners are therefore 
dependent on additional food supplied by their families. 
</p>
<p>41. Capital punishment is still foreseen in the county&#8217;s Penal Code (article 5). However, 
a de-facto moratorium on executions has been in force since 1991, and generally death </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>sentences are commuted after a decision of the official commutation commission, taking 
into account the time that has elapsed since the death sentence was pronounced.3 The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that at least in one case a person who was sentenced to 
death was held in solitary confinement, which may last indefinitely for those whose 
sentences are not commuted. They are also denied contact with their family, which, 
according to one person sentenced to death and interviewed by the Special Rapporteur, 
makes the current moratorium worse than the execution of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 5(b) of the Penal Code also provides for administrative surveillance as a 
supplementary penalty. Article 23 specifies that this means that the administrative authority 
can determine and modify the place of residence of a convict following the completion of 
the prison term. According to the law, the period of administrative surveillance must not 
exceed 5 years in general, and 10 years in relation to the gravest crimes. Many of the 
terrorism convicts are sentenced to this supplementary penalty. What seems problematic is 
that the State Security Department officials with authority in the district to which a former 
prisoner is assigned, determine the frequency, often even the exact timing, of the reporting, 
which may, in some cases, mean several times per day. Such onerous requirements may 
prevent former prisoners from obtaining paid employment or continuing their studies, and 
therefore obstruct their reintegration into society. Also the refusal to issue passports, and 
restrictions on the freedom of movement may have a negative impact on former prisoners&#8217; 
ability to earn money, and in some cases even on their access to medical treatment. 
According to the Government these extra administrative surveillance measures can be 
contested on the basis of article 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in front of a court, 
but to the knowledge of the Government no legal challenge to these measures has ever been 
brought before a Court. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that such measures, which constitute 
serious interferences with human rights, e.g. with the rights to privacy, freedom of 
movement or electoral rights, are unacceptable if they are not ordered by a judicial 
authority and subject to effective judicial review. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is 
very concerned at the economic and other effects of post-imprisonment surveillance and 
control. In particular, the effect that such measures have on obtaining paid employment 
may mean poverty and exclusion, not only for the former prisoner, but often also for his/her 
families. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  International cooperation in the combat against terrorism 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Refoulement in Tunisian law 
</b></p>
<p>44. Under article 59 of Law 2003-75, terrorism is not considered a political offence, and 
a perpetrator may not, therefore, benefit from the right of asylum. Article 60 governs some 
technicalities concerning extradition. Domestic legislation does not include a counterpart to 
the strict non-refoulement clause of article 3 of the Convention against Torture, by which 
Tunisia is bound.  
</p>
<p>  
 3 In its concluding observations in March 2008, the Human Rights Committee expressed concern 
</p>
<p>regarding this procedure, which can take several years, and called on the Tunisian authorities to take 
the necessary measures to commute death sentences as soon as possible, with a view to abolishing the 
death penalty: CCPR/C/TUN/CO/5, para.14; Amnesty International, <i>Tunisia: Continuing abuses in 
the name of security</i>, (London, Amnesty International Publications, 2009), p. 9. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned about the impact that articles 59 and 60 
may have on the asylum procedures, in particular in view of the fact that, although the 
Tunisian Constitution (1959) prohibits the extradition of political refugees, no national 
refugee law has been enacted, no specific administrative measures have been established to 
govern asylum and refugees matters, and no national asylum system has been put in place. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Returns to Tunisia from other countries 
</b></p>
<p>46. The authorities of a number of other States continue to forcibly return terrorism 
suspects holding Tunisian nationality to Tunisia. Among the cases brought to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s attention, there were many who had been transferred to Tunisia from other 
countries, such as Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic. While 
there are reports of many of them having been tortured before being returned to Tunisia, no 
rehabilitation seems to have been provided to them. It is also unclear what mechanisms are 
in place to ensure that evidence tainted by torture or ill-treatment is not used in proceedings 
within Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>47. Also a number of European countries returned Tunisians suspected of terrorist 
crimes to Tunisia, often requesting assurances against torture and other ill-treatment. In 
response, the Tunisian authorities repeatedly asserted that its domestic legislation and 
international human rights obligations provide for protection and safeguards against torture 
and other ill-treatment and therefore refused to give such diplomatic assurances.4 Italy has 
been found to have violated the European Court of Human Rights by forcibly returning 
several Tunisian nationals by disregarding interim orders of protection issued by the 
European Court of Human Rights.5 
</p>
<p>48. According to non-governmental sources, most of the suspected terrorists who were 
forcibly returned from abroad were arrested upon arrival in Tunisia. They were then 
reportedly held up to several months, during which the detention was not acknowledged, or 
the fate or whereabouts of the detainee disclosed. Several of the returnees reported having 
been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during that period, but none of their 
allegations are known to have been investigated by the Tunisian authorities. 
</p>
<p>49. Given the many reports of violations of the Convention against Torture and of article 
7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by Tunisian authorities, 
combined with the lack of transparency and independent monitoring, the Special 
Rapporteur urges Tunisia to starts fulfilling its international obligations in terms of 
effective investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment, exclusion from 
evidence of any information obtained by torture in Tunisia or elsewhere, prosecutions of 
alleged perpetrators and in allowing access to independent outside monitoring mandated to 
issue public reports. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  The country&#8217;s counter-terrorism efforts at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>50. At the prevention level, as the Tunisian authorities consider that terrorism poses a 
global threat which needs to be addressed collectively, they have called for the 
reinforcement of international cooperation and for devising a uniform international 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See e.g. ECHR, <i>Saadi v. Italy</i> (Application No. 37201/06), 28 February 2008, para. 55. 
 5 Sami Ben Khamais Essid in June 2008, Mourad Trabelsi in December 2008, Mehdi Ben Mohamed 
</p>
<p>Khalaifia and Ziad Ben Mabrouk Ben Maftah in April 2009 and Ali Ben Sassi Toumi in August 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>approach in order to harmonize the reaction of states when faced with certain threats. As in 
country&#8217;s view any terrorism prevention strategy must be multi-dimensional and address 
issues such as political injustice, unresolved conflicts, economic disparities, exclusion and 
religious defamation, which lead to hatred and extremism and, ultimately, facilitate the 
recruitment to terrorism, it has launched calls for the consolidation of the international legal 
framework through the elaboration of an international convention that is to contain an 
action plan and provide for control and cooperation mechanisms, including on mutual 
information exchange and targeted technical cooperation. Tunisia has also suggested 
holding a world conference under United Nations auspices to elaborate a code of conduct to 
shed light on the points on which the international community converges. Over the years, 
Tunisia has launched a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening dialogue at the regional 
and international levels.6 
</p>
<p>51. Concerning Tunisia&#8217;s participation in illegal forms of cooperation in 
counterterrorism, the Special Rapporteur has received allegations that Tunisian authorities 
were involved in holding a detainee sent to Tunisia by the United States&#8217; Central 
Intelligence Agency, who was then transferred to other countries. Laid Saidi was reportedly 
seized in the United Republic of Tanzania, transferred to Malawi, then rendered to 
Afghanistan and further to Tunisia, where he was held for 75 days before being returned to 
his home country Algeria (see A/HRC/13/42, para. 133). According to the Government 
however Laid Saidi had arrived with a &#8220;special flight&#8221; on the 9 June 2004, where he was 
presented by four foreign security officials to Tunisian authorities at the airport of Tunis 
Carthage under the name of Ramzi Ben Fredj. The Tunisian security services conducted an 
audit and concluded that the person had usurped the identity of the real Ramzi Ben Fredj. 
The person then acknowledged that he was actually Laid Saidi. The next day, on the 10 
June 2004, Said was sent back with the same special flight to a &#8220;foreign country&#8221;; he was 
then still accompanied by the same foreign agents. Similarly, it has been alleged that 
Tunisian intelligence officials participated in interrogations of terrorist suspects in 
Afghanistan (see interview with Bisher Al-Rawi, A/HRC/13/42, annex II, case 4). The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that, according to his information, the Government of Tunisia 
has not started any investigation into these allegations. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Prevention of terrorism &#8211; The four pillar approach 
</b></p>
<p>52. In the framework of a multi-dimensional approach to combating terrorism, Tunisia 
has identified four principal areas to address terrorism at its roots: 
</p>
<p>53. The so-called &#8220;political pillar&#8221; has at its centre a national pact, according to which 
different political formations spread a message categorically rejecting any violence and 
racial, cultural or religious discrimination, and political parties commit themselves to ban 
any form of violence, fanaticism, racism and discrimination. Further, parties based 
</p>
<p>  
 6 For instance the 2001 Tunis Appeal for Dialogue among Civilizations; the introduction of 
</p>
<p>international prizes for Islamic studies to encourage enlightened reflection and for Solidarity in 
2003/4; the establishment of the Tunis Forum for Peace of 2005; the 2006 International Symposium 
on Human Civilizations and Cultures: from Dialogue to Alliance; the 2007 conference under United 
Nations auspices on &#8220;Terrorism: dimensions, threats and counter-measures&#8221;; and an international 
workshop on &#8220;Youth and the Future: current challenges, the development of capacities and 
participation mechanisms&#8221; in January 2010, which culminated in the Tunis Declaration. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>fundamentally on one religion, one language, one race, one sex or one region are 
prohibited.7 
</p>
<p>54. The so-called &#8220;socio-cultural pillar&#8221; embraces the educational sphere, as defined by 
the Law on Education and School Training of 2002, which should root in the pupils the 
&#8220;values shared by Tunisians&#8221;, founded on the &#8220;primary role of knowledge, work, solidarity, 
tolerance and moderation&#8221; and on the most noble universal values, including dialogue and 
cultural, civilizational and religious open-mindedness. School education is a legitimate 
right for all Tunisians, obligatory and free of charge. In line with these principles, human 
rights education has been widely introduced, including through human rights curricula at all 
levels of education and professional training and through the revision of manuals. Training 
and re-training of judges, lawyers, law-enforcement personnel, prison staff, health staff etc 
integrates the &#8220;culture of human rights&#8221;. Religious manuals, in particular those targeting 
pupils of the second cycle, stress topics such as how to avoid religious conflicts, knowledge 
as a &#8220;wall&#8221; against fanaticism, etc. 
</p>
<p>55. The &#8220;human development pillar&#8221; is based on the premises that marginalization, 
exclusion and poverty may cause feelings of injustice and despair and, consequently, a 
tendency towards radicalization and extremist reactions. Tunisia has therefore actively 
sought to respond to the essential needs of the person and to eradicate poverty along two 
main lines: priority treatment to strengthen economic growth with the aim of integrating 
vulnerable populations in the production cycle, and measures in the social sphere to assure 
that the poorest benefit from special assistance. These policies have led to a reduction in the 
level of poverty (to 3.8 per cent in 2009). These remaining 3.8 percent benefit from direct 
State assistance. In addition, vulnerable categories have access to free or subsidized health 
care. 
</p>
<p>56. Moreover, the National Solidarity Fund 26-26, created in 1993 has the task of 
promoting zones that do not directly benefit from economic reforms and thereby allows 
their inhabitants to gain access to housing, sanitary infrastructure, education, 
communication, electricity and drinking water, and helps them create revenue channels. 
Between 1993 and 2009, more than 255, 000 families (more than 1.3 million persons) in 
1,800 localities benefited from the Fund. Similarly, the Tunisian Solidarity Bank (created in 
1997) manages a system of microcredits (since 1999) and the National Employment Fund, 
established in 1999, helps to create employment opportunities for people with higher 
education. As a result of these efforts, the human development index has improved &#8211; at 6 
years, 99 per cent of all children attend school; and the middle class now represents more 
than 81 percent of the population. Almost 90 percent of the population is covered by social 
insurance and life expectancy is now more than 74 years. In parallel, being conscious that 
real progress is tied to the promotion of women&#8217;s rights, Tunisia has invested in improving 
women&#8217;s lives, inter alia through legal measures eliminating the discrimination of women 
in all spheres.

<p>57. The legal pillar functions along four main axes: combating terrorism; combating 
money-laundering; the creation of special judicial mechanisms to combat terrorism through 
the centralization of prosecutions and trials related to terrorism, and reinforced cooperation 
between the various counter-terrorism bodies; and, counter-terrorism through respect for 
human rights, in particular the presumption of innocence, the right to a lawyer and a the 
right to a fair trial.

</p>
<p>58. Without being able fully to assess the impact of the four pillars, the Special 
Rapporteur is convinced that the multi-dimensional approach to preventing terrorism 
through social, educational and anti-discrimination measures is a good example that is 
worth further exploring. However, many of the areas of prevention described above raise 
sensitive issues, in terms of human rights (freedom of religion, freedom of expression, 
freedom of association, electoral rights, etc). In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
that, in accordance with international law, all state interference with these freedoms must 
always be tested against the proportionality and necessity requirements. 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the cooperation extended by the 
Government of Tunisia. He welcomes that Tunisia has repeatedly made commitments 
to upholding human rights in the context of counter-terrorism, including by ratifying 
most international conventions related to human rights or to terrorism. The Special 
Rapporteur regards these commitments, together with the invitation to him as 
significant steps on the way to fulfilling international human obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>In the view of the Special Rapporteur, it appears that the scope of application 
of the terrorism provisions in the law has grown too wide and should be reduced. Any 
anti-terrorism law that is not properly confined to the countering of terrorism within 
the limits of human rights law is problematic, not only because an overly expansive 
scope of such a law weakens its own legitimacy and ultimately may prove to be 
counter-productive, but particularly because it may unjustifiably restrict the 
enjoyment of human rights pertaining to the exercise of peaceful activities, including 
dissent and political opposition through legitimate associations. The Special 
Rapporteur identified the danger of a &#8221;slippery slope&#8221; which not only results in 
persons being convicted of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; who do not deserve that stigma, but also 
endangers the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism by trivializing the 
phenomenon. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>While recognizing some progress when it comes to the legal framework relating 
to countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur has identified a number of important 
shortcomings, most of which flow from the vague and overly broad definition of 
terrorism in force, which violates the legality requirement under international human 
rights law and allows for very wide usage of counter-terrorism measures in practice. 
The same concern regarding a lack of precision holds true for some of the provisions 
on incitement to, and financing of, terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Recognizing that, in principle, the law provides for some basic safeguards 
against arbitrary and secret detention as well as against torture and ill-treatment, the 
Special Rapporteur has identified considerable gaps between these provisions and 
what happens in reality in relation to arrest and detention of terrorist suspects. On the 
basis of the evidence gathered, he observed a pattern of unacknowledged detention, 
operating in the city of Tunis under the interrogation authority of the Ministry of 
Interior, being used to detain terrorist suspects. During this period that precedes 
detainees&#8217; official registration in police custody, they are also routinely subjected to 
torture and ill-treatment and denied access to a lawyer. Owing to the secrecy that 
surrounds custody by &#8220;DSS&#8221;, these activities occur outside any legal protection 
framework, render investigations improbable and, consequently, lead to a lack of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>accountability, with very few exceptions. The Special Rapporteur further concludes 
that the judiciary has not stood up as a safeguard against these practices. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>He also welcomes the multi-dimensional approach to preventing terrorism 
through social, educational and anti-discrimination measures, which, in his view, may 
constitute a best practice. However, whenever such measures interfere with human 
rights, they must be necessary and proportionate. Furthermore, he wishes to stress 
that the fruits of these doubtlessly positive policies are easily undermined by violations 
of the law which, as always, have a counterproductive effect in the fight against 
terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following 
recommendations to the Government of Tunisia: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Revise the definition of terrorism in Law 2003-75, so that it complies 
with the requirement of legality enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, which requires that all elements of a crime need to be 
encapsulated in legal definitions in explicit and precise terms, and secures that deadly 
or otherwise serious physical violence against members of the general population or 
segments of it becomes the central element of any definition of terrorism; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that legal provisions relating to membership in terrorist groups, 
incitement to and financing of terrorism are defined in precise terms and that, if they 
result in restrictions of other human rights, such as freedoms of expression, 
association, religion, etc., such restrictions comply with the requirements of necessity 
and proportionality; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) End immediately the practice of secret police custody, which takes the 
concerned detainees outside the legal protection framework and puts them in a 
situation of total dependence on their custodians; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d)  In order to strengthen the safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, 
allow to any detainee access to a lawyer immediately after apprehension, and the 
presence of a lawyer from the very first interrogation; ensure prompt access to 
independent medical examination; video-tape any interrogations before suspects are 
transferred to the prison; and establish an independent and accessible complaints 
mechanism, including the conduct of adequate and thorough ex-officio investigations 
whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that human rights violations have 
occurred; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Allow for independent monitoring of all places where people are 
deprived of their liberty, including all facilities of the Ministry of Interior; in this 
context, ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which measure, in addition 
to strengthening independent domestic and international control mechanisms over 
domestic detention facilities, would also contribute to the country&#8217;s unhindered 
counter-terrorism cooperation at the international level; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Many of the problems identified by the Special Rapporteur are linked to 
a lack of transparency, e.g. the anonymity of law-enforcement officials. Therefore, all 
officials who engage in arresting or detaining suspected terrorists should be carrying 
identification tags at all times while on duty, and statistics on the number of arrests 
and cases under consideration should be regularly published; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g)  Scrupulously respect the principle of non-refoulement; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that evidence obtained under torture is excluded from all 
proceedings in accordance with the Convention against Torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Ensure that all cases involving terrorism are tried in strict compliance 
with each of the guarantees spelled out in article 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, including full respect for the presumption of innocence at 
all stages; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Strengthen the independence of the judiciary; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Order retrials through proceedings that meet international fair trial 
standards in all cases where evidence obtained by means of torture or other ill-
treatment was admitted in the proceedings (except as evidence against a person 
accused of torture), or where evidence was obtained by torture or other ill-treatment 
were summarily or otherwise improperly dismissed; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Continue to pursue terrorism prevention efforts in various spheres, and 
document their impact in terms of preventing terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the international community will 
assist Tunisia in these endeavours, on the basis of an on-going evaluation of progress 
in terms of revising the legal framework, in particular in reformulating the definition 
of terrorism in accordance with international norms, increasing transparency in the 
implementation of counter-terrorism measures, investigating human rights</b> <b>violations 
and fighting impunity, and strengthening the independence of the</b> <b>judiciary.
