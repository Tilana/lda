NEWS RELEASE 
 
AngloGold Ashanti Trebles Free Cash Flow to $108m, Cuts Net Debt 32%
(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti said it more than trebled free cash 
flow generation in the first half of the year to $108m and lowered net debt by almost a third, as 
costs fell and it took advantage of a higher gold price. 
 
AngloGold Ashanti has delivered on a range of self-help measures over the past two years to 
reduce debt using internally generated funds. In focusing on improving the quality of its production, 
the Company has sold some mines, closed others and made significant reductions to all areas of 
cost as it prioritises sustainable improvements to free cash flow and returns. 
 
“We will continue to push hard to improve operational and cost performance, as well as our overall 
balance sheet flexibility, regardless of the gold price environment,” Chief Executive Officer 
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “Our focus remains to improve margins and grow cash flow and 
returns on a sustainable basis.” 
 
Net debt fell by 32% to $2.1bn as at June 30 of this year from $3.1bn at the end of June last year, 
significantly lowering interest payments. On 1 August 2016, AngloGold Ashanti also completed the 
redemption of the remaining 8.5%, seven year bonds outstanding, at a total cost of the $503m. 
This extinguished the Company’s most expensive debt and fulfilled a key strategic objective by 
further reducing its future interest payments. 
  
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) improved to an average of $911/oz in the six months through 30 
June, compared with the $924/oz recorded in the first half of 2015.  Production from continuing 
operations was 1.745Moz, versus 1.878Moz in the comparable period last year given the 
unforeseen challenges faced at the Kibali joint venture and planned reduction in output from the 
Tropicana, Geita and Obuasi mines. 
 
The Company’s International Operations produced 1.259Moz at AISC of $873/oz, accounting for 
almost three in every four ounces mined. The performance benefited from weaker currencies 
versus the dollar in Argentina, Australia and Brazil. There were especially strong cost 
performances from Sunrise Dam and Cerro Vanguardia, which posted significant efficiency gains 
during the first half of 2016. 
 
A number of brownfield expansion or mine-life extension projects are under way, including at 
Siguiri in Guinea, Sadiola in Mali, Tropicana in Australia and Geita, in Tanzania. Pre-feasibility 
studies of two key projects in Colombia are expected to be completed next year, potentially adding 
significant new reserves to the Company’s mineral inventory.

AngloGold Ashanti’s South African operations delivered 486,000oz of production at AISC of 
$958/oz, a 13% cost reduction from the first six months of last year. Mponeng, the largest of the 
local mines, continued its recovery with a 25% jump in output and a 28% reduction in AISC to 
$893/oz. Tragically, there were three work-related fatalities at the South African operations during 
the period under review, overshadowing safety improvements that have been made across the 
balance of the portfolio. The South African operations continue to face significant challenges due 
to safety-related stoppages, which have continued throughout the year. 
 
Adjusted headline earnings were $159m, or 39 cents per share in the first half of 2016, compared 
with $61m, or 15 cents per share, in the first half of 2015. Net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders during the first half of 2016 was $52m compared with a net loss from continuing 
operations of $23m a year earlier. 
 
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) 
decreased by $12m, or 2% from $793m in the six month period ended 30 June 2015 to $781m in 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. The lower production year-on-year was largely offset by cost 
improvements over the same period. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 
2016 was 1.44 times, compared with the 1.47 times recorded at the end March 2016, and 1.95 
times at the end of June 2015, highlighting the success of AngloGold Ashanti’s continued efforts to 
deleverage and sustainably improve cash flow.
