<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions conducted 
an official visit to India from 19 to 30 March 2012. This report presents his main findings 
and proposes recommendations to ensure better protection of the right to life in India. 
</p>
<p> India&#8217;s human rights situation has many positive elements. However, the level of 
extrajudicial executions in this country still raises serious concern. This includes deaths 
resulting from excessive use of force by security officers, and legislation that is permissive 
of such use of force and hampers accountability.  The role of various non-State actors in the 
violation of the right to life is also examined. This includes killings by armed groups and 
those in the context of communal violence. Vulnerable persons, including women, are at 
particular risk of killing. Impunity represents a major challenge. 
 
 The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations include a series of legal reforms and 
policy measures aimed at fighting impunity and decreasing the level of unlawful killings in 
India.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of India, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Mr. Christof Heyns, conducted an official 
visit from 19 to 30 March 2012. He travelled to New Delhi, and Ahmedabad (State of 
Gujarat); Thiruvananthapuram (State of Kerala); Jammu and Srinagar (State of Jammu and 
Kashmir); Guwahati (State of Assam); and Kolkata (State of West Bengal). The visit 
focussed on the protection of the right to life by State and non-State actors in India. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for the invitation. During 
this visit, he met with Secretaries from the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of 
Home Affairs (MHA), and the Ministry of Law and Justice, and high-level officials from 
the Ministry of Defence and other Ministries at Union level. At state level, he met the 
Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, state Chief Secretaries and other Secretaries; 
Commissioners, Directors General and other relevant officers of the Police; and other 
senior officials. He visited the Supreme Court, the National Human Rights Commission 
(NHRC) and the Assam Human Rights Commission. He also held meetings with the United 
Nations agencies, and a wide range of domestic and international non-governmental 
organizations, lawyers, witnesses, and victims and their families. However, the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that his official meetings scheduled in Gujarat were cancelled at the last 
minute. 
</p>
<p>3. This report covers the situation as it was during the visit, although some reference is 
made to subsequent developments. This report was finalized on 12 April 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General observations 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Indian Constitution guarantees a wide range of human rights. It is supported by 
broad public endorsement and enforced by a strong Supreme Court, whose human rights 
jurisprudence is widely recognized. The right to life, as protected in article 21 of the 
Constitution, has been given an extensive interpretation by the courts. There is a vigorous 
press in India, and a vibrant and engaged human rights civil society. India also 
accommodates a broad diversity in terms of religion, languages and culture, largely in a 
peaceful way. India manages to maintain a high level of protection for human rights while 
it faces significant challenges, including armed movements aimed at achieving various 
levels of autonomy, insurgencies, terrorism, and organized crime, who often do not hesitate 
to take innocent life. 
</p>
<p>5. The last few years appear to have registered a general drop in unlawful killings; 
however, extrajudicial killings remain a concern. To a large extent, the solution to these 
issues can be found within the existing mechanisms and standards established in India. 
Indeed, several issues raised by the Special Rapporteur during his visit have in the 
intervening period been recognized and addressed at the domestic level. 1  It should be 
emphasized that none of the concerns expressed in this report are new &#8211; they have been 
expressed by official organs within the structures of the State, and in many instances have 
also been raised by other international bodies. 
</p>
<p>6. In 2011, India extended a standing invitation to the mandate-holders of all thematic 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council. The mandate on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions was the first to visit the country under this standing invitation. This 
</p>
<p> 1 See e.g. Report of the Committee on Amendments to Criminal Law, headed by retired Supreme Court 
Justice J.S. Verma, 23 January 2013.  </p>

</p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p>may reflect a commendable willingness to engage with the international community on the 
issue of unlawful killings in a constructive manner. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur notes that some civil society representatives whom he met 
during the visit reported afterwards that they faced intimidation from the authorities for 
having cooperated with him. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Indian authorities to 
ensure that no intimidation or other type of reprisal takes place against any of the 
individuals or groups met. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from excessive use of force  
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur received a series of complaints regarding deaths resulting 
from the excessive use of force by security officers with little adherence to the principles of 
proportionality and necessity as defined under international human rights law standards. 
According to these principles, use of force by security officers should be proportional to the 
legitimate objective to be achieved, and lethal force may only be used as a last resort in 
order to protect other life.  
</p>
<p>9. The official statistics of India&#8217;s National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) indicate 
that 109 civilian deaths occurred in the country due to police firing in 2011. The largest 
number of civilian casualties were found in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, mostly in the 
context of riot control, as well as during alleged anti-extremism and anti-terrorist activities.  
</p>
<p>10. Section 46 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) authorizes law 
enforcement officials to use &#8220;all means necessary&#8221; to perform an arrest which is forcibly 
resisted. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, these provisions are broadly formulated and may 
grant law enforcement officers powers to use force in response to resistance which go 
beyond those powers permitted under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>11. Disproportionate use of force during demonstrations has also caused many deaths in 
various parts of the country. The Special Rapporteur received reports that, while many 
demonstrations occur without casualties, this is not always the case. For example, at least 
100 deaths were caused due to excessive use of force against demonstrators in Jammu and 
Kashmir in 2010. 2  The Special Rapporteur recalls in this regard that the international 
human rights standards on the use of force in line with the principles of necessity and 
proportionality, as explained in paragraph 8, also apply in the context of policing 
assemblies, including the dispersal of violent assemblies.  
</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to a practice known as 
&#8220;fake encounters&#8221; in parts of the country, which was widespread in the 1990s. While the 
extent thereof has dissipated, evidence shows that it still occurs. According to the NHRC, 
2,560 deaths during encounters with police were reported between 1993 and 2008. Of this 
number, 1,224 cases were regarded by the NHRC as &#8220;fake encounters&#8221;. The police, the 
central armed police forces, and the armed forces have been accused of &#8220;fake encounters&#8221;. 
Complaints have been lodged, particularly against the Central Reserve Police Force, the 
Border Security Forces, and the armed forces acting under the Armed Forces (Special 
Powers) Act (AFSPA). The existence of this practice was recently acknowledged in the 
courts.3

</b></p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p>13. Where they occur, &#8220;fake encounters&#8221; entail that suspected criminals or persons 
alleged to be terrorists or insurgents, and in some cases individuals for whose apprehension 
an award is granted, are fatally shot by the security officers. A &#8220;shootout scene&#8221; is staged 
afterwards. The scene portrays those killed as the aggressors who had first opened fire. The 
security officers allege in this regard that they returned fire in self-defence. 
</p>
<p>14.  After the incident, the security officers register a First Information Report (FIR) 
which often reflects their account of events. The Special Rapporteur heard concerns that the 
content of these reports is frequently undisputed, which eventually leads to the swift closure 
of the case. Along the same line, it appears that few, if any, encounter cases have been 
brought to the point of conducting investigations and, where applicable, prosecuting alleged 
perpetrators. Where inquiries are undertaken, the results are frequently not disclosed. 
Another difficulty in the investigation of encounters lies in the lack of witnesses, often due 
to the fact that encounters take place mostly during the early hours of the morning. 
Alternatively, witnesses fear coming forward with testimonies. In some cases, such a 
situation is further complicated by a reported practice of offering gallantry awards and 
promotions to security officers after the encounters, 4  as well as of pressuring law 
enforcement officers, who face already heavy workloads due to understaffing, to 
demonstrate results.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur heard <i>inter alia</i> of the encounter case that occurred on 30 
April 2010, in the Machil Sector, Kupwara District of Jammu and Kashmir, where three 
young individuals were killed by the armed forces. Alleged to be terrorists, the individuals 
were later identified as civilians who went missing from their village Nadihal in 
Baramullah and had allegedly been exchanged for money to some members of the Army so 
they could be killed in a fake encounter for which awards were offered. The outcomes of 
the criminal case launched against the security officers involved are still pending.  
</p>
<p>16. According to information received, encounters have been used <i>inter alia</i> as a means 
to target specific groups. In Gujarat, a series of encounters specifically targeting Muslims 
were carried out. It is noteworthy that in 2012 a Special Task Force was consequently 
appointed to investigate them. 
</p>
<p>17. Several victims who made presentations to the Special Rapporteur on this issue 
emphasized the need to know the truth, and to &#8220;clear the names&#8221; of loved ones who had 
been labelled &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and killed in &#8220;fake encounters&#8221;. The NHRC also acknowledged 
the problem of encounters in India, and expressed its agreement with the view that 
encounter killings &#8220;have become virtually a part of unofficial State policy&#8221;.5 The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates therefore the importance of shedding light on the acts committed 
during encounters and of bringing the perpetrators to justice in all cases.  
</p>
<p>18.  The Special Rapporteur takes note of a number of positive measures undertaken by 
the Indian authorities to address the problem of fake encounters, and stresses the need for 
their implementation. He commends the NHRC for the adoption on 2 December 2003 of 
Guidelines on Encounter Deaths. These Guidelines require that (a) police officers record 
information about an encounter and a FIR must be registered; (b) encounter cases should be 
investigated by an independent investigating agency; (c) a magisterial inquiry must be 
undertaken in instances where deaths have occurred and compensation is awarded to the 
dependents of the deceased; and (d) disciplinary action should be taken against delinquent 
police officers and no out-of-turn promotions should be made. The Special Rapporteur is

</p>
<p>concerned that, in the majority of incidents of encounter killings, the NHRC Guidelines 
appear not to be complied with. 
</p>
<p>19. At the time of drafting this report, a seminal case from the State of Andhra Pradesh 
is pending before the Supreme Court. The Andhra Pradesh High Court, on 13 July 2007 in 
the case <i>Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties vs. State of Andhra Pradesh</i>, held that, in situations 
where deaths occur in cases of alleged returning of fire by the police, a FIR must be 
registered, the case investigated and the claim of self-defence by the police proven in a trial 
before the court.   
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps taken by the Government to address 
excessive use of force in a more general context, such as the MHA decision of 22 
September 2010 to establish a Task Force to recommend Standard Operating Procedures to 
handle public disturbances in a non-lethal manner.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and related legislation 
</b></p>
<p>21. The situation regarding the use of force in India is exacerbated by what in effect 
though not in law could constitute emergency measures. In this regard, AFSPA, enacted in 
1958, regulates instances of use of special powers by the Armed Forces in so-called 
&#8220;disturbed areas&#8221; of the country. In order for AFSPA to be applied in an area, the area must 
be defined disturbed or dangerous to the extent that the use of armed force is deemed 
necessary. 6  AFSPA first found application in the north-eastern States of Manipur and 
Assam as a way to address the continued unrest in the area, and was also extended to other 
areas, including in Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. In 
1990, the Jammu and Kashmir Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, containing nearly 
identical provisions to those stipulated in AFSPA7, was enacted in Jammu and Kashmir.8  
</p>
<p>22. AFSPA provides wide-ranging powers to the Indian armed forces in respect of using 
lethal force in various instances, and fails to provide safeguards in case of excessive use of 
such powers, which eventually leads to numerous accounts of violations committed in areas 
where AFSPA is applied. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to two main 
concerns to which he was constantly alerted. Firstly, concerns were raised regarding 
AFSPA provisions regulating the use of lethal force. Section 4 of AFSPA provides: &#8220;Any 
commissioned officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer&#8230;may, in a disturbed 
area, (a) if he is of opinion that it is necessary to do so for the maintenance of public order, 
after giving such due warning as he may consider necessary, fire upon or otherwise use 
force, even to the causing of death, against any person who is acting in contravention of any 
law or order for the time being in force in the disturbed area...&#8221; Such provisions clearly 
violate the international standards on use of force, including lethal force, and the related 
principles of proportionality and necessity.  
</p>
<p>23. Secondly, Section 6 of AFSPA and 7 of the Jammu and Kashmir AFSPA, grant 
protection to the officers acting under these Acts and stipulate that prosecution of members 
of the armed forces is prohibited unless sanction to prosecute is granted by the central 
Government. Sanction is rarely granted in practice. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p> 6 Article 3, AFSPA. 
 7  In this report, reference to AFSPA will encompass the Jammu and Kashmir AFSPA, unless otherwise 
</p>
<p>specified. 
 8  India has deployed more than 500,000 members of the armed forces. Official data suggests that 
</p>
<p>between 1988 and 2009, 42,657 people died in the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir. Other sources 
suggest the number of deaths is approximately 80,000; see <i>inter alia</i> &#8220;State Terrorism: Torture, extra-
judicial killings and forced disappearances in India&#8221;, Human Rights Law Network, New Delhi, 2009, 
p. 132. </p>

</p>
<p>was informed of an application submitted in India under the Right to Information (RTI) Act 
in November 2011, requesting information on the number of sanctions for prosecution 
granted from 1989 to 2011 in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The response received from 
the authorities revealed that in none of the 44 applications brought was sanction not 
granted. In addition to AFSPA, the CPC also protects members of the armed forces from 
being prosecuted without prior sanction being granted, which will be examined in 
chapter V.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Supreme Court of India held that the 
declaration of a &#8220;disturbed area&#8221; under AFSPA must be &#8220;for a limited duration and there 
should be periodic review of the declaration before the expiry of six months&#8221;.9 He found, 
however, that this procedure is not followed in practice, and AFSPA remains effective for 
prolonged periods without a review of the context in the respective area. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that several international bodies have 
called for the repeal or reform of AFSPA,10 including the former United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 11  Furthermore, Indian 
authorities at various levels have also expressed their support for the repeal of AFSPA. In 
this context, the Indian Government set up a special committee in 2004, tasked with 
examining the provisions of AFSPA and advising the Government on whether to amend or 
repeal the Act. The special committee found that AFSPA should be repealed &#8211; that it was 
&#8220;quite inadequate in several particulars&#8221; and had &#8220;become a symbol of oppression, an 
object of hate and an instrument of discrimination&#8221;.12  The need to repeal AFSPA was 
reiterated by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission in its fifth report, published 
in June 2007.13 Finally, the NHRC shared with the Special Rapporteur its views in support 
of AFSPA&#8217;s repeal during a meeting held in New Delhi.  
</p>
<p>26. The Supreme Court of India ruled, however, in 1997 that AFSPA did not violate the 
Constitution. The Special Rapporteur is unclear about how the Supreme Court reached such 
a conclusion. The Special Rapporteur, however, notes that in the same case the Supreme 
Court declared as binding the list of &#8220;Dos and Don&#8217;ts&#8221; elaborated by the Armed Forces, and 
containing a series of specifications on the manner of applying AFSPA in practice. 
Although the list contains more precise guidelines on the use of lethal force under AFSPA, 
the Special Rapporteur believes that they still fail to bring AFSPA in compliance with the 
international standards in this regard.  
</p>
<p>27. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the powers granted under AFSPA are in reality 
broader than that allowable under a state of emergency as the right to life may effectively 
be suspended under the Act and the safeguards applicable in a state of emergency are 
absent. Moreover, the widespread deployment of the military creates an environment in 
which the exception becomes the rule, and the use of lethal force is seen as the primary 
response to conflict. This situation is also difficult to reconcile in the long term with India&#8217;s 
insistence that it is not engaged in an internal armed conflict. The Special Rapporteur is 
therefore of the opinion that retaining a law such as AFSPA runs counter to the principles 
of democracy and human rights. Its repeal will bring domestic law more in line with 
international standards, and send a strong message that the Government is committed to 
respect the right to life of all people in the country.

</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to hear from several Government officials 
that AFSPA is in the process of being amended, which will lead to reduced powers 
provided to the armed forces acting under this Act. This is a welcomed first step. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>29. According to the NCRB data for 2011, over 100 deaths occurred in police custody in 
India.14 In this regard, formal accusations were brought against a total of 14 police officers; 
none of them have been convicted.  
</p>
<p>30. A report released by the Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) 15  presented 
statistics gathered by the NHRC on deaths in custody in terms of which 1,504 cases of 
deaths in police custody and 12,727 cases of deaths in judicial custody were reported from 
2001 to 2010.16 ACHR suggested that in the majority of deaths in police custody, the death 
was preceded by torture and occurred within the first 48 hours of arrest. These statistics 
may not reflect the full extent of custodial deaths in India, given that not all deaths may be 
reported to the NHRC. The Armed Forces are, for instance, not required to convey such 
information to the NHRC.  
</p>
<p>31. During confidential interviews held throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed of several cases of individuals unlawfully taken into custody, severely beaten and 
taken to hospital where they subsequently died. He was informed that no steps had been 
taken to bring perpetrators of these acts to account.17  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur, however, welcomes a series of steps undertaken in India to 
regulate the treatment of persons in custody with the aim of ensuring their rights. In this 
regard, in 1997 the Supreme Court of India elaborated directives on arrest and detention, 
following its judgement in the <i>D.K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal</i> case. The NHRC has also 
laid down Guidelines on Custodial Deaths and Rapes, including on the period within which 
a death is to be reported, the procedure to be followed and the methods to conduct 
autopsies. The guidelines also provide that a magisterial inquiry must be held in cases of 
deaths in custody, and, should a police officer be found responsible, prompt prosecution 
and disciplinary action must be taken. Judicial inquiries in cases of custodial deaths have 
been made mandatory through the adoption of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
(Amendment) Act in 2005. The Special Rapporteur found, however, that the mentioned 
provisions are not sufficiently complied with in practice. He heard that relatives are not 
informed immediately of the death, representatives of human rights organizations may not 
be present during the autopsy, and relatives are pressured to cremate the body, thereby 
destroying valuable evidence. In addition, autopsies are carried out by executive rather than 
judicial magistrates, who are not qualified to oversee such inquiries.  
</p>
<p>33. In 1997, India signed the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). In an effort to facilitate accession to this 
treaty, the Prevention of Torture Bill (PTB) was passed by the Lower House of the Indian 
Parliament on 6 May 2010. The Parliament&#8217;s Upper House referred it to the Parliamentary 
Select Committee for review. Since December 2010, the revised PTB with amendments 
proposed by the Upper House Select Committee has been pending before the MHA. In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, India must bring its national legislation in line with CAT to

<p>allow for its ratification, and thus strengthen the framework to protect individuals against 
deaths in custody. He invites the Indian authorities to take prompt action in the process of 
adopting the related domestic legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Imposition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>34. The death penalty may still be imposed in India, although a <i>de facto</i> moratorium on 
executions had been in place since 2004. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern, 
however, that this situation changed several months after his visit. In this regard, India 
voted in November 2012 against a General Assembly draft resolution calling for a 
moratorium on the death penalty18 and executed the first person since 2004.  
</p>
<p>35. Following the judgement of the Supreme Court of India in the case of <i>Bachan Singh 
v. State of Punjab</i> from 9 May 1980, Indian law provides that the death penalty may be 
imposed in the &#8220;rarest of rare&#8221; cases only. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, such a 
provision may be broader than the &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; requirement under international 
human rights law, stipulating that, in countries which have not abolished the death penalty, 
capital punishment may be imposed only for intentional killing. Certain legislative 
provisions in India provide for the imposition of the death penalty for offences that do not 
comply with the &#8220;the most serious crime&#8221; provision under international law, for example, 
for such offences as kidnapping not resulting in death,19 sabotage of oil and gas pipelines,20 
and drug-related offences.21  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned that India has recently moved to extend, 
rather than reduce, offences for which the death penalty may be imposed. For instance, the 
Anti-Hijacking (amendment) Bill, adopted in 2010, makes provision for the death penalty 
in respect of aircraft hijacking. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations of the right to life by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from attacks by armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>37. A range of non-State actors in various parts of India, including in Jammu and 
Kashmir, resort to deadly violence which threatens the lives and security of civilians as well 
as the security of the State. The State has a duty to protect its people and the right to defend 
itself against such acts, in accordance with international human rights standards. The 
callous nature in which lives are taken by these non-State actors is strongly condemned. At 
the same time, the State must refrain from and act against any unlawful means to counter 
such violence, such as &#8220;fake encounters&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>38. The attention of the Special Rapporteur was drawn particularly to the loss of life in 
areas reportedly affected by the Naxalite-Maoist insurgencies. The Naxalite insurgencies 
arose in the poor, tribal and rural areas in 1967. The Naxalite movement claims to protect 
marginalized groups while simultaneously engaging in armed activities against the State.22 
The violence appears at present to increasingly spill over into the cities. Maoist activities

<p>are spread across several states, the most affected being Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, 
Orissa and Maharashtra. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur was informed that in 2005, in response to Naxalite violence, 
a vigilante group called &#8220;Salwa Judum&#8221; was established, supported by the central and local 
authorities. The group has been reportedly responsible for significant acts of violence. It has 
been frequently accused of targeting civilians, who are forced to take sides, and thus 
exposed to violations from all sides involved in the violence occurring in the affected areas. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 2011 Supreme Court decision that held that the 
creation of the &#8220;Salwa Judum&#8221; violates the Constitution.23 
</p>
<p>40. Maoist insurgents are also responsible for killing innocent civilians. They reportedly 
target the families of alleged deserters, as well as persons believed to support &#8220;Salwa 
Judum&#8221;. Moreover, Naxalites are known to conduct trials of suspected police informants or 
alleged traitors who if found guilty are executed.  
</p>
<p>41. India is faced with the serious challenge of terrorism, as one of the countries most 
affected by it.24 According to data provided by non-governmental sources, alleged terrorist 
violence between 1994 and 2009 resulted in 58,288 deaths in India. More than 50 per cent 
of these were civilians and members of the security forces.25  
</p>
<p>42. As mentioned in paragraph 37, the Special Rapporteur strongly condemns the 
callous killing of ordinary citizens and members of the security forces. He takes note of the 
Government&#8217;s efforts, under the &#8220;Central Scheme for Assistance to Civilian Victims of 
Terrorists&#8221;, to pay compensation to the families of victims of terrorist, communal and 
Naxalite violence which has resulted in death or permanent incapacitation. He welcomes 
the extension of this scheme in 2010 to the victims of Naxalite violence.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings related to communal violence 
</b></p>
<p>43. Tension between representatives of various communities remains an ever-present 
concern in India. Reports by official Commissions of Inquiry, Committees and civil society 
organizations have, regarding many major incidents of communal violence, indicated that 
the State and its agents, particularly the police forces, wilfully did not exercise diligence in 
its duty to protect, and thus tolerated attacks on the life and rights of religious minorities, 
and, in some cases engaged, in active support.26 
</p>
<p>44. According to the MHA, 580 communal incidents occurred in India in 2011, with 91 
lives lost.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur was informed that attacks of communal violence are often 
planned in order to target members of a particular group or acquire its property. For 
instance, Hindu fundamentalists reportedly carried out attacks against Dalits, who had 
changed religion to escape the degrading treatment associated with being a Hindu Dalit. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed of the severe communal violence against Dalit and 
Adivasi Christians in Orissa, between 2007 and 2008 when, according to non-governmental

<p>sources, approximately 100 individuals were killed.27  In this regard, the Government of 
India commented that, in the communal violence between Hindus and Christians, three 
persons were killed in 2007, and 40 persons were killed in 2008. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was particularly drawn to the high level of 
communal violence in Gujarat. The most serious incident dates to 2002, as a consequence 
of the burning of a train which caused the death of 58 Hindu pilgrims in February 2002. It 
was alleged that Muslims perpetrated the incident, which resulted in retaliatory acts and, 
eventually, communal violence. According to the data provided by the Government of 
India, the police records indicate 1,071 persons killed and 228 persons reported missing in 
the ensuing violence. Non-governmental organizations reported approximately 2,000 
individuals killed and several hundred persons missing.28 The Special Rapporteur heard 
several testimonies from survivors of the 2002 events on violence occurred against them, 
and their family members. He was informed of widespread allegations that the violence was 
fuelled by members of the Government of the State of Gujarat.29 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur notes some progress, albeit slow, in respect of holding 
perpetrators of the 2002 Gujarat communal violence to account. 30  He is concerned, 
however, about the lengthy and less than effective conduct of the current inquiries into 
these events. In particular, the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, which was appointed the same 
year to investigate the 2002 events in Gujarat, has not yet published its final report. At the 
time of drafting this report, the Commission&#8217;s term was extended for the 19th time in 
December 2012 and was required to publish its findings on 30 June 2013. The Special 
Rapporteur will follow the outcome in this regard. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the information received that the judicial 
investigations into the 2002 events are being hampered by destruction of evidence, refusal 
to investigate and witness intimidation. 31  Furthermore, a large number of the accused 
standing trial for the 2002 violence appear to have been released on bail, thus living in the 
areas where they allegedly committed serious violations. The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that the MHA released funds to the Government of Gujarat to ensure 
payment of compensation to the victims of the 2002 killings. He also notes the comments 
of the Government of India that the authorities have been sensitive to the issue of witness 
and victim protection, and provided protection when required. He encourages the Indian 
authorities to treat witness and victim protection as a crucial element specifically in the 
process of shedding light on the 2002 events. 
</p>
<p>49. In a broader context, several Governmental bodies are charged with investigating 
and addressing communal violence. In this regard, the Prevention of Communal and 
Targeted Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill was elaborated in 2011, with 
the aim of preventing communal violence and ensuring accountability of those in positions 
of power and authority for failure to prevent it and protect life and property. The Bill also 
introduces the principle of command and/or superior responsibility, and stipulates the rights 
of victims to reparations and remedies.

</p>
<p>50. It is also noteworthy that mechanisms have been put in place for investigating and 
prosecuting those responsible for violence motivated by religious tensions, namely through 
the creation of Special Investigative Teams (SIT)32 and Fast Track courts.33 The Special 
Rapporteur nevertheless was informed of concerns that high levels of corruption, religious 
bias and the inconsistent application of investigations impede effective progress in such 
cases, thus fostering a culture of impunity.34 
</p>
<p><b> C. Practices affecting women&#8217;s right to life 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Government of India has actively sought to introduce mechanisms to ensure that 
men and women are placed on equal footing, such as the enactment of gender-sensitive 
legislation, the development of campaigns to generate awareness, and the creation in 1992 
of the National Commission for Women, responsible for protecting and promoting the 
rights of women. In 1993, India ratified the Convention on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Yet, it has not ratified the Optional Protocol to 
CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>52. Women in India remain vulnerable and are too frequently victims of lethal violence. 
Sexual violence also occurs in the context of other forms of violence against women. 
Concern surrounding the violence exercised against women, in all its forms, has been 
expressed by a variety of international bodies.35 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur stresses that beyond creating laws and policies to ensure the 
protection of women, these must also be properly implemented. It is therefore important 
that gender-sensitization programmes are undertaken, particularly insofar as the law 
enforcement forces are concerned. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that in Kerala 
more women have been recruited into the police force, which has led to positive results in 
encouraging women to report cases and in strengthening efforts to seek justice in cases of 
violations.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Dowry deaths 
</b></p>
<p>54. Dowry-related deaths are a country-wide concern. The obligation to pay dowry rests 
on the family of the woman who is married. Where this is not done, or the amount is 
deemed unsatisfactory, there are a number of reported instances when the woman is killed 
by her husband or his family.  
</p>
<p>55. The official statistics indicate that the number of dowry deaths amounted to a 
staggering 8,618 in 2011.36 The figure increased since 2010 and may still not fully reflect 
the scope of the problem due to apparent underreporting in respect of this particular 
offence.  
</p>
<p>56. The Government has taken steps to curb the problem of dowry deaths, including 
through the enactment of the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 and codification of &#8220;dowry 
deaths&#8221; as a separate offence in section 304B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  
</p>
<p>57. In 2010, in the <i>Rajbir Raju and Another vs. State of Haryana</i> case, the Supreme 
Court ordered prosecutors, in cases of dowry deaths, to include a charge of murder in 
</p>
<p> 32 SITs conduct investigations and may register FIRs.  
 33 These courts are designed to deal expeditiously with specific matters of concern.  
 34 See e.g. Saumya Uma, &#8220;Kandhamal: The Law Must Change its Course&#8221;, 2010, Multiple Action

<p>addition to one of dowry death. A conviction for murder in terms of section 300 of the IPC 
may be punishable with the death penalty,37 while that of a dowry death may result at most 
in a sentence of life imprisonment. The Court stated that persons guilty of such an offence 
should face capital punishment. While the attempt by the Supreme Court to seriously 
address the concern of dowry deaths is commended, the Special Rapporteur does not 
encourage the imposition of the death penalty in such cases, in particular for a problem with 
such complex social roots.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. &#8220;Honour&#8221; killings 
</b></p>
<p>58. So-called &#8220;honour&#8221; killings are committed against persons believed to have sullied 
the honour of a family. They are almost always directed against women, usually for having 
exercised their right to choose a partner whom the family does not approve of. There are 
reports of a strong correlation between &#8220;honour&#8221; killings and inequalities of castes and 
gender. 
</p>
<p>59. Although the NHRC regards the number as low, 38  other sources estimate that 
approximately 1,000 to 1,200 deaths occur every year in honour-related killings.39 Most of 
them reportedly occur in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh States. 
</p>
<p>60. Honour killings are not regulated under separate legislation in India, and fall under 
the broader crime of murder.40 In order to address honour killings, the IPC and Certain 
Other Laws (Amendment) Bill of 2010 proposed amendments to, <i>inter alia</i>, the IPC to 
create penalties for &#8220;honour&#8221; killings. Meetings of the Group of Ministers were convened in 
2010 to discuss the matter of introducing amendments to the IPC or enacting separate 
legislation in order to address &#8220;honour&#8221; killings. Despite such steps, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed that there remains a lack of ensuring effective prosecution and prevention of 
such killings.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Witch killings 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur observed the phenomenon of witch killings in parts of India, 
which appears to be largely directed against women. It is reportedly prevalent among 
poorer members of the population. Various reasons exist for accusing individuals of being 
witches, including superstitions and attempts to obtain property.  
</p>
<p>62. The NCRB reported 240 deaths due to witchcraft in 2011, an increase from 2010. 
The actual figure is likely higher due to possible underreporting. The Special Rapporteur 
heard from the Indian authorities that witch killings did not warrant his concern. Yet, 
authorities in Assam acknowledged that this was a valid concern and a growing one, as 
there was a trend of the practice&#8217;s spill-over beyond tribal groups. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur noted that a draft Act on matters of witchcraft was 
elaborated in Rajasthan, while legislation concerning witchcraft already exists in Bihar, 
Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The legal provisions provide punishment for labelling a person 
a witch. However, such conduct results in light sentences, not commensurate with the long-
term negative impact of labelling individuals as witches. The Special Rapporteur was also 
informed that when prosecutions occur witnesses are often unwilling to provide 
testimonies, either due to their fear of being associated with the alleged witch, or because 
they regard the death as an appropriate punishment.

</p>
<p><b> V. Other challenges  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>64. Impunity represents a challenge in India not only in cases of recent violations of the 
right to life, but also of those perpetrated in the past in respect of which effective 
investigations and prosecutions still have not been conducted. Complaints were widely 
raised that the wheels of justice, when they turn, do so too slowly. Legal proceedings drift 
for years, while alleged perpetrators remain at large in the community, often on bail.  
</p>
<p>65. The fight against impunity in India is faced with challenges at various stages of the 
accountability process. At the stage of reporting a crime, the Special Rapporteur has heard 
numerous allegations that the security forces refuse to register FIRs, including those related 
to killings or death threats. Persons attempting to register FIRs are often subjected to 
threatening treatment or to the fact that their complaints are not given serious consideration. 
The Special Rapporteur heard that in particular the Dalits, the representatives of lower 
castes, tribes and poorer communities, as well as women are exposed to difficulties in 
registering FIRs. Individuals who wish to report violations by security officers face similar 
challenges which dissuade them from complaining and impede the accountability of State 
agents. 
</p>
<p>66. The burden of initiating civil, criminal or writ proceedings in cases of unlawful 
killings is frequently placed on the victim&#8217;s family. Their vulnerable status often cripples 
their ability to seek and secure accountability. Families of victims are not always aware of 
their rights in respect of the investigation of the death of the victim. The lack of knowledge 
of such rights forecloses the very opportunity to enjoy these rights themselves.  
</p>
<p>67. Delay in judicial proceedings constitutes one of India&#8217;s most serious challenges and 
has clear implications for accountability. For example, lengthy and ineffective proceedings 
exist in Punjab where large-scale enforced disappearances and mass cremations occurred 
between the mid-1980s and 1990s. The lack of political will to address these 
disappearances is evident in a context where steps to ensure accountability have been 
reportedly inconclusive.  
</p>
<p>68. The slow pace of proceedings is another feature of the various public commissions 
created to investigate violations of the right to life. The slow progress of the Nanavati-
Mehta Commission of Inquiry in Gujarat, mentioned in the previous chapter, is a vivid 
example of the challenge. The Commission has been functioning for more than 10 years 
without reaching any conclusive results. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur is concerned with the obstacles to hold public servants, 
including members of the security forces, accountable, particularly due to statutory 
immunities provisions. Section 197 of the CPC requires prior sanction from the concerned 
government before cognizance can be taken of any offence by a public servant for criminal 
prosecution. This provision effectively renders a public servant immune from criminal 
prosecution. It has led to a context where public officers evade liability as a matter of 
course, which encourages a culture of impunity and further recurrence of violations. 
</p>
<p>70. The situation is aggravated by the fact that security officers who committed human 
rights violations are frequently promoted rather than brought to justice. The Special 
Rapporteur has heard of the case of Mr. Sumedh Singh Saini, accused of human rights 
violations committed in Punjab in the 1990s, who was promoted in March 2012 to Director 
General of Police in Punjab. Promoting rather than prosecuting perpetrators of human rights 
violations is not unique to Punjab. The Special Rapporteur heard this complaint from 
families of victims throughout the country. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1

<p><b>15 
</b></p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur regards the absence of deterrent punishment and lack of 
prosecution to be main contributors to impunity of State actors. Laws requiring sanction to 
arrest and prosecute must be repealed. It is important that the leaders of various security 
forces are held to account. 
</p>
<p>72. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes the directive of the Supreme Court of 
India, issued in the 2006 case of <i>Prakash Singh and Others vs. Union of India and Others</i>, 
to establish Police Complaints Authorities with the aim of creating oversight mechanisms 
for the acts of the law enforcement agents. The Special Rapporteur regrets that these 
mechanisms have not yet been established throughout the country or, where they have been 
created, are not fully functional.  
</p>
<p>73. The practice of paying compensation to victims or their respective families in cases 
of unlawful killings, while not pursuing criminal investigation and prosecution of the 
perpetrators in their cases further perpetuates impunity due to an absence of individual 
accountability. The Special Rapporteur stresses that, while compensation of the victim is a 
crucial element to redress violations, it cannot replace the judicial process of bringing a 
perpetrator to justice.  
</p>
<p>74. Families of victims face further difficulties as they lack full and easy access to 
autopsy reports, death certificates and other relevant documentation. Several accounts were 
given to the Special Rapporteur of post-mortem examinations taking an unnecessarily long 
time before being conducted and the subsequent deterioration of evidence, their inadequate 
conduct, as well as of an inability of the families to obtain death certificates for a very long 
period. The Special Rapporteur was informed <i>inter alia</i> of autopsies being performed by 
members of the Dom community instead of trained medical practitioners, casting doubts on 
the quality of the conclusion reached after the medical examination.  
</p>
<p>75. Autopsies play a crucial role in the investigation and prosecution of murder cases. 
The system of autopsies and release of death certificates should be reformed to bring it in 
line with internationally accepted standards and allow families to have closure of cases.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur notes the NHRC&#8217;s comments that the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR-OP1) 
does not constitute a vital concern, given that India has a strong judiciary as well as 
commissions that hear individual complaints.41 While the work of the Indian judiciary is 
acknowledged, the Special Rapporteur stresses that the ratification of the ICCPR-OP1 will 
enable individuals to hold the State responsible for all potential failures of ensuring 
accountability in all cases of violations, thus strengthening efforts to fight against impunity. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings of vulnerable persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Scheduled castes and tribes and other marginalized communities 
</b></p>
<p>77. Discrimination on the basis of caste is prohibited in India, and some positive steps 
have been taken to improve the situation, although the impact on lower castes and tribes in 
practice so far is limited. According to NCRB, there were 35 murders registered in 2011 
due to caste-related reasons. Non-governmental organizations indicate that 3,593 murders 
against scheduled castes or tribes occurred between 1995 and 2007.42

Nations Special Rapporteur Mr.Christof Heyns.

<p> 42  See National Coalition for Strengthening Schedules Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of 
Atrocities) Act, &#8220;20 Years Scheduled Castes &amp; Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act:

</p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur heard a number of cases on the killings of persons belonging 
to scheduled castes or tribes, as well as to other marginalized communities. The violence 
against them is more prevalent in rural areas, largely due to prejudices that are still firmly 
entrenched. Patterns of killings relate to condemnation of intermarriage between higher 
castes and scheduled castes, or witchcraft accusations. Tribal individuals may also be killed 
in the armed exchanges between the Government forces and armed groups, by any of the 
sides. In such contexts, members of tribes are sometimes labelled &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and killed, 
although later it becomes clear that they were ordinary civilians. Adivasis were moreover 
killed in ethnic violence in the 1990s, while their killing at present appears to be largely due 
to issues concerning land disputes and attacks in insurgency-affected areas.  
</p>
<p>79. The low social status of these persons renders them vulnerable to violations of all 
their rights, including the right to life, and hampers their access to justice and redress 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur notes the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, adopted in 1989, which aims at dissuading violence by 
providing harsher punishment for persons committing offences against individuals 
protected under this Act. He is, however, concerned that Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians 
have not been incorporated into the definition of scheduled castes under this Act, and thus 
do not benefit from its provisions. In addition, he wishes to underline the importance of 
ensuring the protection of all marginalized communities in practice through proper 
implementation of the related legislation, as well as the conduct of relevant education and 
awareness-raising campaigns.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>81. Human rights defenders are increasingly targeted by both State and non-State actors. 
Especially vulnerable are RTI activists, those exposing mining corruption, environmental 
and poverty issues, land rights of marginalized communities, and accountability concerns.  
</p>
<p>82. While the adoption of the RTI Act in 2005, aiming at ensuring access to information 
and transparency on violations of human rights, is a welcome measure, it is alarming that 
those who lodge requests for information are often targeted for doing precisely that and are 
sometimes killed. According to information received from non-governmental sources, it is 
estimated that 12 RTI activists were killed in 2010 and 2011.43 For instance, on 20 July 
2010, Mr. Amit Jethwa, an RTI activist, was killed by unidentified assailants near the 
Gujarat High Court, due to his exposing political involvement in illegal mining activities. 
</p>
<p>83. Human rights defenders and journalists regularly are victims of violence between 
armed groups and Governmental forces, in a context where both sides suspect human rights 
defenders and journalists of supporting the other side.  
</p>
<p>84. The Government has attempted to address the concerns related to the protection of 
human rights defenders, including through its invitation to the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders in 2011. Her 2012 report to the 
Human Rights Council 44  provided a range of recommendations which could assist in 
curbing violence against human rights defenders. The Government is therefore invited to 
make a concerted effort to implement these recommendations.

<p><b> 3. Protection of victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur found that witnesses are often intimidated and threatened. 
However, there is no witness and victim protection programme in India. Interlocutors met 
explicitly stated that several investigations by commissions have been compromised due to 
the refusal of witnesses to testify. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, India must ensure that 
witnesses who may be exposed to intimidation and death are adequately protected. He was, 
for instance, informed of the case of <i>Zahaira Habibulla H. Sheikh vs. State of Gujarat</i>, 
concerning the deaths of 14 persons during the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat. In this 
case, 21 accused were acquitted due <i>inter alia</i> to the reported refusal of 37 witnesses for the 
prosecution to testify. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that the Supreme Court of India 
reversed the acquittals in this case, ordered a retrial outside Gujarat, and emphasized the 
crucial role of witness protection programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings and enforced disappearances in Jammu and Kashmir 
</b></p>
<p>86. Concerns have been voiced to the Special Rapporteur on unmarked graves found in 
Jammu and Kashmir containing bodies of victims of extrajudicial executions from the 1990 
to 2009 period. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a total of 2,700 unmarked graves 
containing over 2,943 bodies have been discovered, some of these graves containing more 
than one body. While the Government expressed its intention to conduct investigations into 
unmarked graves, this has not yet been done.  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur was presented with several cases of enforced disappearances 
in Jammu and Kashmir, and the difficulties to seek accountability and redress in those 
cases. The Government has estimated that 4,000 people have gone missing, and claimed in 
exchanges with the Special Rapporteur that a large portion of those allegedly missing 
crossed the border to join armed groups in Pakistan. Other sources have estimated the 
number to be 5,000&#8211;10,000. India has signed, but not yet ratified, the International 
Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. The role of Human Rights Commissions  
</b></p>
<p>88. The record of the NHRC includes important steps in protecting the right to life in 
India. The NHRC has, for instance, delivered several important guidelines on a variety of 
topics including deaths in custody and encounter killings and played a prominent role in 
ordering compensation in situations of &#8220;fake encounters&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur, 
however, had the impression that currently the NHRC could be taking a too legalistic and 
deferential approach, and that the NHRC should take a more proactive view, and where 
appropriate, should be willing to take a critical stance towards the decisions of courts. 
</p>
<p>89. The effective functioning of the NHRC is partially hampered by its mandate, and 
specifically by its competence to only investigate matters within one year from the date of 
the incident, which may constitute a serious impediment in efforts to shed light on past 
violations. Another difficulty lies in the lack of clarity on the NHRC&#8217;s powers to examine 
alleged human rights violations by members of the armed forces. Specifically, section 19 of 
the Protection of Human Rights Act authorizes the NHRC to request in such situations a 
report from the central Government and enables the NHRC to make recommendations to 
the Government. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, section 19 is formulated in a manner 
that does not provide express authorization to the NHRC to investigate members of the 
armed forces for alleged human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>90. With regard to the functioning of State Human Rights Commissions (SHRCs), the 
Special Rapporteur found they inspire little confidence, in terms of lack of independence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>from the authorities, limited resources and subsequent limited effectiveness. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the Manipur SHRC was for all practical purposes closed 
down after it challenged excess of power by the police. Interlocutors further revealed that 
they would refer no matters to the Assam SHRC in 2012, as it would be futile. The Assam 
SHRC mentioned to the Special Rapporteur that it was subordinate to the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>While India is to be commended for several positive aspects in its human rights 
record, there is reason for serious concern, specifically about extrajudicial executions. 
The main patterns of unlawful killings in India at present involve, <i>inter alia</i>, killings 
resulting from various instances of excessive use of force by the security forces, those 
occurring in the context of attacks by various armed groups, and killings of 
vulnerable persons.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Impunity is the central problem. The obstacles to accountability, especially the 
need for prior sanction of prosecutions of civil servants, should be removed.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>To a large extent, the required structures to decrease extrajudicial executions 
are already in place. The steps to be taken have also largely been identified within the 
system. A concerted and systematic effort is required by the State, civil society and 
others concerned to eradicate the occurrence of unlawful killings. In this process, 
some best practices that are already followed in the country should be used as models 
for reform elsewhere.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>There is a strong need for victims to speak about their experiences. A credible 
national process under the form of transformative justice is called for. Justice for 
victims, accountability and punishment of the perpetrators are essential elements of 
such a process. Specific attention should be given to the following issues: (a) 
challenging the general culture of impunity; (b) addressing the practice of &#8220;fake 
encounters&#8221; to ensure that it is eliminated; and (c) ensuring swift, decisive action, with 
concrete outcomes, is taken in cases of large-scale killings. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>A public commitment to the eradication of the phenomenon of unlawful killings 
is needed.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>A credible Commission of Inquiry into extrajudicial executions in India, or at 
least the areas most affected by extrajudicial executions, which inspires the confidence 
of the people, should be appointed by the Government. The Commission should also 
serve a transitional justice role. It should (a) investigate allegations concerning past 
and recent violations of the right to life; (b) propose relevant measures to tackle them; 
and (c) work out a plan of action for the future to eradicate practices of extrajudicial 
executions. The Commission should submit recommendations on (a) legal reform; (b) 
the reform of State structures, including security bodies; and (c) the fight against 
impunity. It must complete its work within a reasonably short period. The scale of the 
task may require some priority areas of investigation to be determined. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Ratification of the following treaties should take place promptly: (a) the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and its Optional Protocol; and (b) the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>19 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Ratification of the following instruments should be considered: (a) the two 
Optional Protocols to the ICCPR; (b) the Optional Protocol to CEDAW; (c) the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court; and (d) the two Optional Protocols to the 
Geneva Conventions.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>India should swiftly enact the Prevention of Torture Bill and ensure its 
compliance with CAT.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>India should repeal, or at least radically amend, AFSPA and the Jammu and 
Kashmir AFSPA, with the aim of ensuring that the legislation regarding the use of 
force by the armed forces provides for the respect of the principles of proportionality 
and necessity in all instances, as stipulated under international human rights law. It 
should also remove all legal barriers for the criminal prosecution of members of the 
armed forces.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>While waiting for the necessary amendment or repeal of AFSPA, it should be 
ensured that the status of a &#8220;disturbed area&#8221; under AFSPA is subject to regular 
review &#8211; for example, every six months &#8211; and a justified decision is made on its further 
extension. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Section 46 of the Criminal Procedure Code and legislation in all states 
regarding use of force, including the exceptional use of lethal force, by all security 
officers should be reviewed to ensure compliance with international human rights law 
principles of proportionality and necessity. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code should be reviewed in order to 
remove any legal barriers for the criminal prosecution of a public servant, including 
the need for prior sanction from the government  before cognizance can be taken of 
any offence by a public servant for criminal prosecution. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 
should be reviewed with the aim of extending its scope to Dalit Muslims and Dalit 
Christians. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The criminal legislation should be reviewed to ensure that all gender-based 
killings, as well as killings of any member of a tribe or lower caste receive high 
sentences, possibly under the form of life imprisonment.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Indian legislation regarding the imposition of the death penalty should be 
reviewed to provide that the death penalty may be imposed for the most serious 
crimes only, namely only for those crimes that involve intentional killing. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>India should consider placing a moratorium on the death penalty in accordance 
with General Assembly resolutions with a view to abolishing it.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>India should put in place a mechanism of regular review and monitoring of the 
status of implementation of the directives of the Supreme Court and the NHRC 
guidelines on arrest, encounter killings, and custodial violence and death. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The establishment and effective functioning of the independent Police 
Complaints Authorities should be made a priority in all states. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>India should ensure that FIR registration is prompt and made mandatory in all 
cases of unlawful killings and death threats. The authorities should put in place an 
independent mechanism to monitor FIR registration following any request to do so, as 
well as of punishment of those law enforcement officials who refuse to register a FIR.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Compensation in cases of killings cannot play the role of replacement for 
criminal prosecutions and punishment. Alongside payment of compensation to the 
victims or their families, India should ensure that criminal investigations, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>prosecutions and trials are launched and conducted in a swift, effective and impartial 
manner in all cases of unlawful killings, irrespective of the status of the perpetrator. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Promotions and other types of awards for security officers suspected to have 
been involved in unlawful killings, including through encounters, should not be 
granted until a proper clarification of facts. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>India should ensure that command and/or superior responsibility is applied for 
violations of the right to life by security officers.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>All vigilante groups and civilians recruited to perform military or law 
enforcement tasks, and who are not part of the regular security forces, should be 
dissolved and prohibited with immediate effect. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The protection of civilians in all instances of violence should constitute the 
ultimate priority. All sides involved in armed activities should immediately cease 
attacking civilians, including members of tribes and castes, human rights defenders 
and journalists. While having the duty to protect its people from the attacks 
perpetrated by various non-State actors, the Indian authorities should ensure its acts 
do not target civilians by any means, and are directed in a very precise manner at 
neutralizing violent non-State actors. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>An effective witness and victim protection programme should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Autopsies should be carried out in conformity with international standards and 
families of victims should have full and easy access to autopsy reports, death 
certificates and other relevant documentation to allow them to proceed with the 
closure of the cases.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Information and awareness-raising campaigns should be launched to raise the 
level of knowledge of human rights and access to justice of the public at large, with a 
particular focus on vulnerable persons such as women and members of tribes and 
lower castes. Legal aid mechanisms for these vulnerable persons should be devised to 
enable them to seek protection, justice and redress in cases of violation of their rights. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Increased sensitization and orientation programmes in respect of all forms of 
killings of women should be undertaken for the police, judiciary and the public at 
large, especially in areas of the country which are most affected. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Section 19 of the Protection of Human Rights Act should be amended to 
provide the NHRC with the express authorization to investigate members of the 
armed forces for alleged human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>A legal basis should also be put in place to enable the extension of the period of 
one year under which the NHRC can consider cases.  
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The NHRC should issue guidelines on the conduct of inquests and autopsies in 
all cases of unlawful killings.  
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The independence and functioning of state human rights commissions should be 
reviewed to ensure compliance with the United Nations Principles relating to the 
Status of National Institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Nanavati-Mehta Commission, and all currently functioning Commissions 
of Inquiry on various violations of the right to life, should ensure that their findings 
are published in a swift and transparent manner. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>India should consider launching a process of reflection upon the need to reform 
its judiciary with the aim of reducing the length of judicial proceedings and 
strengthening the independent functioning of the judiciary. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>21 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The practice of inviting United Nations special procedures should continue, 
especially in areas where international concern has been expressed, such as torture, 
counter-terrorism measures, enforced disappearances and minority rights. The 
recommendations made in 2012 by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders should be given serious consideration with a view to their 
implementation.
