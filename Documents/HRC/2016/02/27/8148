<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/1. 
It briefly outlines the activities of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, from 1 July 2011 to 29 February 2012, and contains a 
thematic analysis of the integration of a human rights-based approach in the administration 
of criminal justice in cases of trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>2. With regard to the activities carried out from 1 March to 31 July 2011, the Special 
Rapporteur refers to her most recent report submitted to the General Assembly (A/66/283). 
Her activities from 1 August 2011 to 29 February 2012 are briefly outlined below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Participation in conferences and consultations 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 4 July 2011, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert meeting on the theme, 
&#8220;Prosecution of trafficking in persons cases: integrating a human rights-based approach in 
the administration of criminal justice&#8221; in Geneva. Fifteen experts, mostly from prosecution 
</p>
<p>and law enforcement backgrounds, participated in the one-day meeting to discuss progress, 
challenges and lessons learned in prosecuting trafficking in persons cases while ensuring 
respect for the human rights of trafficked persons. The outcome of the consultation is 
contained in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/20/18/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>4. From 5 to 7 October 2011 the Special Rapporteur participated in the Human 
Dimension Implementation Meeting organized by the Office for Democratic Institutions 
and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OCSE), to 
discuss the OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings in Warsaw. She 
also opened a panel discussion on the theme, &#8220;Enhancing child protection and preventing 
</p>
<p>child trafficking&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>5. From 10 to 12 October 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in the fourth 
session of the Open-ended Interim Working Group on the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, held in Vienna. The 
Special Rapporteur delivered a keynote speech on the importance of the identification of 
trafficked persons. By participating in the activities of the Working Group, she was able to 
increase her engagement with Member States and interact directly with the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Global Initiative to Fight Human 
Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>6. From 12 to 14 December 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in the launch of 
the Arabic version of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking.1 
</p>
<p>7. On 17 and 18 January 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the dialogue 
between special procedures mandate holders and the African Commission on Human and 
</p>
<p>  
 1 E/2002/68/Add.1. </p>


<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights, organized by OHCHR in cooperation with the African Commission, in 
Addis Ababa.  
</p>
<p>8. On 2 and 3 February 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Informal 
Network of European National Rapporteurs and Equivalent Mechanisms, organized by the 
European Commission and the European Union Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur visited Thailand from 8 to 19 August 2011, and Australia 
from 17 to 30 November 2011, at the invitation of the respective Government (see 
A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 and Add.2). 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also visited the United Arab Emirates from 11 to 17 April 
2012, at the invitation of Government, and plans to visit Gabon in May 2012. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks all Governments for their cooperation with her in the planning and 
conduct of these missions. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Integration of a human rights-based approach in the 
prosecution of cases of human trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>11. International law requires States to prosecute trafficking and related offences.2 The 
Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the prosecution of anti-trafficking responses is a 
broad category that includes not only the investigation and adjudication of trafficking cases 
but also encompasses a number of related spheres of activity, including the applicable legal 
framework, international legal cooperation and asset confiscation. Prosecution should 
therefore be seen as only a part of a strategy of criminalization.  
</p>
<p>12. For any effective criminalization strategy, the Special Rapporteur notes the need for 
a rights-based approach to trafficking.3 Such an approach has been widely endorsed by the 
international community, including the General Assembly4 and Human Rights Council.5 
The commentary on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking explains that a human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework 
for dealing with a phenomenon such as trafficking that is normatively based on 
international human rights standards and that is operationally directed to promoting and 
protecting human rights. It affirms that such an approach requires analysis of the ways in 
which human rights violations arise throughout the trafficking cycle, as well as of States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law. It seeks to both identify and redress the 
  
</p>
<p> 2 Most States have ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. Article 5 of the Protocol requires the establishment of trafficking as a 
criminal offence. The duty to criminalize has also been outlined in various regional treaties, including 
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention on Preventing and 
Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, art. III; Council of Europe 
Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, art. 18; and Directive I 2011/36/EU of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking 
in human beings and protecting its victims.  </p>
<p> 3 See A/HRC/10/16. 
 4 Such as the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. 
 5 For example, Human Rights Council resolution 11/3, paras. 1, 3 (<i>f</i>), 6, 7, 8, and General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 63/156, preamble and paras. 5 and 18. </p>


<p>discriminatory practices and unjust distributions of power that underlie trafficking, maintain 
impunity for traffickers and deny justice to victims of trafficking.6 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that all aspects of national, regional and 
international responses to trafficking should be anchored in the rights and obligations 
established by international human rights law. A human rights-based approach identifies 
rights-holders and their entitlements (for example, trafficked persons, individuals at risk of 
being trafficked, or individuals accused or convicted of trafficking-related offences), and 
the corresponding duty-bearers (usually States) and their obligations. This approach 
strengthens the capacity of rights-holders to secure their rights and of duty-bearers to meet 
their obligations. Core principles and standards derived from international human rights law 
should guide all aspects of the response at all stages. 
</p>
<p>14. Over the past decade, many States have made important progress in the development 
of effective and rights-based criminal justice responses to trafficking that are consistent 
with these principles and standards. It is nevertheless important to acknowledge that both 
commitment and capacity vary widely, and many challenges to implementing a rights-
based approach remain.  
</p>
<p>15. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur thus seeks to contribute to a better 
understanding of the criminal justice response to trafficking by exploring examples of good 
practices and analysing some of the challenges faced by States. The Special Rapporteur will 
draw on the responses of States to her questionnaire (annex I). She thanks the States that 
submitted responses to her questionnaire (annex II) for their involvement.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Criminalization of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>16. The criminalization of human trafficking is an essential aspect of any programme to 
combat and prevent trafficking in persons. The obligation on States to criminalize 
trafficking is clear; it is contained in all specialist trafficking treaties7 and its importance has 
been repeatedly confirmed through international and regional policy instruments,8 including 
by the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.9  
</p>
<p>17. It is important to emphasize that the relevant legislation must be clear, enforceable 
and comprehensive to ensure effective protection of the victim. States must criminalize 
trafficking as it has been defined by international law.10 This means that criminalization 
must cover a range of end purposes, including forced and exploitative labour; it must 
recognize the possibility of women, men and children being victims of trafficking; and that 
the trafficking in children must be defined differently to trafficking in adults. A trafficking 
law that covers only one of these aspects would fall short of this standard.  
</p>
<p>18. In formulating the criminal offence of trafficking, States must not criminalize only 
those offences that have been committed intentionally;11 they must also ensure that the

<p>victim&#8217;s consent does not alter the offender&#8217;s criminal liability.12 States are further required 
to criminalize related offences, such as attempted trafficking offences or complicity in their 
commission,13 and ensure that criminal (and civil) liability can be extended to legal as well 
as natural persons.14 This obligation is important in ensuring the legal accountability of 
corporations and businesses engaging in trafficking, such as labour contractors, adoption 
agencies and entertainment venues.  
</p>
<p>19. The information received by the Special Rapporteur indicated that a significant 
majority of States have criminalized trafficking in persons. As the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons is not self-executing, States will need to take 
proactive action to ensure its implementation in domestic law. Some States already had 
laws that met the requirements of the Protocol: Finland, for example, has had long 
established laws on trafficking, and its legislation met the standard of the Protocol, even 
before the Convention came into force. 15  In recent years, a number of other States, 
including Lesotho,16 Lebanon17 and Romania,18 have passed new anti-trafficking laws. 
</p>
<p>20. In Asia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia<b> </b>and Viet Nam19 have also enacted new laws 
on trafficking following a thorough review of relevant national legislation. 20  Thailand, 
despite not having ratified the Trafficking Protocol, defines exploitation in a manner very 
close to its language.21  
</p>
<p>21. The information received indicated that only a minority of States do not have laws 
criminalizing human trafficking. For example neither Estonia22 nor Panama23 has an anti-
trafficking law, although relevant cases have reportedly been prosecuted under other 
criminal offences. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to learn that, a bill and an amendment 
to the criminal code are respectively pending adoption.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur observes, however, that legislation is not an end in itself. 
Even in States with strong anti-trafficking measures, laws are sometimes not enforced or 
there is a lack of implementing regulations. Indeed, certain countries with strong legal

<p>platforms are sometimes described as safe havens because they do not enforce their own 
laws.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-criminalization of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>23. Trafficked persons are often arrested, detained, charged and even prosecuted for 
such unlawful activities as entering illegally, working illegally or engaging in prostitution. 
The vulnerability of trafficked persons to such treatment is often directly linked to their 
situation: their identity documents may be forged or have been taken away from them, and 
the exploitative activities in which they are or have been engaged, such as prostitution, 
soliciting or begging, may be illegal in the State of destination. Criminalization is also 
possible in countries of origin, where returned victims of trafficking may be penalized for 
unlawful or unauthorized departure. 
</p>
<p>24. In many cases, criminalization is tied to a failure of the State to identify the victim 
correctly; trafficked persons arrested, detained and charged not as victims of trafficking, but 
as smuggled or undocumented workers. The Special Rapporteur notes that efforts to 
identify trafficked persons as victims deserving of protections are often complicated by the 
problem of &#8220;imperfect&#8221; victims. 24  Some victims may have committed crimes, whether 
willingly or as a result of force, fraud or coercion, prior to becoming or in conjunction with 
becoming a trafficking victim, thereby making it hard to distinguish victims from 
perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>25. While trafficked persons are not entitled to wholesale immunity from crimes they 
commit, the Special Rapporteur observes that the increasingly recognized standard is that 
they should not be prosecuted for offences relating to their status as trafficking victims.25 
Indeed, criminalization and/or detention of victims of trafficking is incompatible with a 
rights-based approach to trafficking because it inevitably compounds the harm already 
experienced by trafficked persons and denies them the rights to which they are entitled.  
</p>
<p>26. There are further severe consequences of criminalizing victims. Victims who 
develop a criminal record may have difficulties in recovery and reintegration.26 In addition, 
the criminalization of victims is counterproductive to prosecutions because it destroys trust, 
retraumatizes victims and reinforces what traffickers may have told victims about law 
enforcement authorities. 
</p>
<p>27. International bodies, including the Open-ended Interim Working Group on 
Trafficking in Persons, have confirmed non-prosecution of trafficked persons as the 
relevant international legal standard.27 The Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking also provide that trafficked persons &#8220;are not to be 
prosecuted for violations of immigration laws or for the activities they are involved in as a

<p>direct consequence of their situation as trafficked persons&#8221;. 28  Both the Human Rights 
Council 29  and the General Assembly 30  have made similar recommendations, as have 
regional bodies and instruments.31  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur observes that, while numerous States do not have a specific 
law designed to minimize the criminalization of trafficking victims, many note that, as a 
matter of policy, trafficking victims are not prosecuted for status-related crimes. 32 The 
Special Rapporteur observes, however, that some States have passed specific legislation in 
this regard.33 For example, a Moldovan law provides that trafficked persons who have 
committed unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked will not be prosecuted for 
such offences. 34  In the United States, New York State recently passed a law to allow 
trafficking victims with prostitution-related convictions to vacate their judgements.35 
</p>
<p>29. Other laws provide more limited protection for trafficked persons. For example, in 
Azerbaijan, trafficked persons are exempt from liability only for deeds committed under 
coercion or intimidation while being trafficked.36 In Jamaica, the law provides for immunity 
from prosecution if a victim of trafficking breaches immigration or prostitution laws.37 In 
Slovakia, while criminal liability for victims is not explicitly excluded, being a victim of 
trafficking is considered to be a mitigating circumstance. 38  Lithuanian law currently 
provides that victims of trafficking not be punished for engaging in prostitution; draft 
amendments to the Penal Code exempt victims of trafficking from any criminal act 
committed as a direct consequence of their situation.39  
</p>
<p>30. In other States, however, statutes criminalize activities associated with trafficking 
without proper safeguards to identify victims of trafficking. For example, in India, the 
Ministry of Home Affairs issued a memorandum in 2009 instructing law enforcement to 
focus on the aspects of the Trafficking Act that criminalize exploiters. 40  Reports 
nonetheless indicate that the Act, which criminalizes the act of solicitation for prostitution, 
continues to be used to detain and penalize prostitutes, including those who are victims of 
trafficking.41

<p><b> C. Identification of victims 
</b></p>
<p>31. Timely and efficient identification of victims is central to the criminalization of 
trafficking, as it affects the ability of law enforcement officials to prosecute traffickers 
effectively and is fundamental in terms of being able to provide trafficked persons with the 
necessary support services. The Special Rapporteur observes, however, that the issue of 
identification raises a number of complex pragmatic questions, in particular concerning 
how, where and by whom identification should be performed.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the fact that each victim of trafficking has a 
unique story and experience, which makes it difficult to create categorical rules about 
identification of victims. Yet while there is no one clear formula for best identifying 
victims, a number of examples and already existing practices may provide guidance on the 
issue. 
</p>
<p>33. Indicators, including those developed by the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are increasingly being used as a tool to identify trafficked 
persons.42 The Special Rapporteur encourages law enforcement agencies, including police 
and immigration, to draw on existing indicators in the identification processes.43  
</p>
<p>34. Police are often at the forefront when identifying victims, and thus play a critical 
role in this process. While they may be experienced in law enforcement in general, they 
may not have specific expertise in trafficking in persons; for this reason, the Special 
Rapporteur highlights the importance of ensuring that they are given appropriate training to 
identify victims of trafficking accurately and with sensitivity.  
</p>
<p>35. In response to Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire on specific actions taken by 
Governments to facilitate quick and accurate identification of trafficking victims, numerous 
responses, in particular from Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, Malta, 
the Netherlands, Romania, and Sweden, indicated that task force or agencies coordinating 
in country anti-trafficking work have organized specialized training sessions to enhance the 
capacity of front-line officers, especially the police, immigration, border guards and labour 
inspectors, to identify actual and potential trafficking victims and to make referrals to 
appropriate services. Most of the sessions were carried out in collaboration and/or with 
funding from international organizations, including IOM, ILO, UNODC, the European 
Union, the United States Agency for International Development, the Asia Regional 
Trafficking in Persons Project and the Swedish International Development Cooperation 
Agency. Some Governments have gone even further to develop national referral 
mechanisms, standard operating procedures or brochures, manuals, handbooks and/or other 
tool kits to build capacity and raise awareness to facilitate rapid and accurate identification 
of victims.44  
</p>
<p>36. Jamaica, for example, through its National Task Force against Trafficking in 
Persons, and in collaboration with non-governmental organizations, has developed 
trafficking indicators, protocols and referral mechanisms for agencies involved in the 
identification, counselling and protective care of rescued or potential victims.45 Bulgaria has 
a comprehensive list of indicators for identifying victims of trafficking as part of its

 44 For instance, Germany makes indicators for victim identification known by distributing brochures to 
</p>
<p>the relevant target groups. Submission by Germany, p. 3. 
 45 Submission by Jamaica, p. 4. </p>


<p>national referral mechanisms developed in cooperation with non-governmental 
organizations. Bulgaria also provides training on trafficking in human beings and victim 
identification to diplomats, consular and military attaches through the Diplomatic Institute 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.46 The National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force in 
Sri Lanka is currently developing and implementing standard operating procedures that 
would assist in the accurate and timely identification of victims of trafficking, and establish 
a referral mechanism to provide assistance and protection.47 Similarly, in April 2011, in the 
Republic of Moldova, the National Committee for Combating and Prevention of 
Trafficking in Persons approved the draft of an interdepartmental regulation on the 
identification of victims and potential victims of trafficking. The draft, which is awaiting 
final adoption and publication by the Ministry of Justice, will be an operational tool for 
organizations engaged in the national referral system and is aimed at streamlining and 
standardizing the identification process.48  
</p>
<p>37. Community-based organizations and victim support agencies are also becoming 
increasingly important in the identification of victims of trafficking. For example, in 
Australia, non-governmental organizations accounted for 13 per cent of all referrals in the 
period 2009&#8211;2010. 49  In keeping with a human rights-based approach, the Special 
Rapporteur observes that victims identified by non-governmental organizations should only 
be referred to the police if they give their consent. Importantly, Government financial 
support for victim support agencies should not make such funding contingent on requiring 
them to pass on information about identified victims.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. Other mechanisms include agreements and partnerships between Government and 
non-government agencies, including victim service providers, to ensure that victims 
identified by non-State actors have access to Government support services.50 
</p>
<p><b> D. Support for victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>39. There is growing recognition for the need to provide victims of human trafficking 
with support services, which, however, must be designed and delivered in a manner that is 
compatible with a human rights-based approach.  
</p>
<p>40. Some States have introduced reflection and recovery periods in order to provide 
immediate support and protection to victims not conditional on cooperation with criminal 
justice processes. During these periods, trafficking victims receive assistance, including 
shelter, health care and legal advice to enable them to make informed decisions about 
whether to participate in the criminal justice process. Such periods of reflection have the 
added advantage of giving investigators and prosecutors time to gather evidence.51  
</p>
<p>41. For example, Canada provides trafficking victims with a 180-day period of 
reflection and options for obtaining temporary residence permits, including for stays of up 
to three years.52 The Netherlands offers a period of reflection of three months that is not 
conditional on participation in the justice process and provides immigration remedies to 
foreign trafficking victims, including, in certain circumstances, options for permanent

<p>residence status.53 In accordance with measure No. 7 of its Action Plan to Combat Human 
Trafficking (2006-2009), Norway affords victims a six-month period of reflection free of 
conditions, which includes access to assistance and services. Italy does not limit the time 
given to trafficking victims to recuperate and to decide whether to assist authorities. In 
addition, foreign child victims receive an automatic residence permit until the age of 18.54  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur notes that other States have linked the provision of 
assistance and protection to cooperation with national criminal justice agencies. For 
example, in Norway, in accordance with measure No. 5 of its Action Plan to Combat 
Human Trafficking, permanent residency permits are available for trafficking victims who 
face retribution or hardship in their country of origin as long as they give a statement to 
police outside of court and for those victims who testify in court. In some legal systems, the 
issue of conditional assistance is complicated by a legal requirement on victims to 
cooperate in an investigation or prosecution if that cooperation is deemed necessary. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that, in accordance with international law, support and protection 
should not be made conditional on the victim&#8217;s capacity or willingness to cooperate in legal 
</p>
<p>proceedings. 55  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, by practices where victims of 
trafficking are mandatorily detained in shelters. Although the Special Rapporteur 
recognizes that the motivation for this may be to protect victims, she notes that the routine 
detention of victims of trafficking violates, in some circumstances, the right to freedom of 
movement and, in most, if not all, circumstances, the prohibitions on unlawful deprivation 
of liberty and arbitrary detention. 56  International law absolutely prohibits any 
discriminatory detention of victims, including detention that is linked to the sex of the 
victim. The routine detention of women and of children in shelter facilities, for example, is 
clearly discriminatory and therefore unlawful.  
</p>
<p>44. In Thailand, concerns persist that children and women identified as victims of 
trafficking are automatically placed in Government-run shelters, pursued if they &#8220;escape&#8221; 
and, in some cases, forced to spend years awaiting processing. Such detention not only 
impedes the rights of victims but also discourages and diminishes the quality of victim 
cooperation with authorities. Above and beyond the infringement of victims&#8217; human rights, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur observes that such an approach can serve as a disincentive for 
victims to report cases to authorities.57 
</p>
<p><b> E. Cooperation between criminal justice and victim support agencies 
</b></p>
<p>45. Numerous international legal and policy instruments agree that any effective anti-
trafficking effort must involve close collaboration between criminal justice agencies and 
victim support agencies, including non-governmental organizations.58

<p>46. Working at the forefront and on the ground, victim support agencies will often be 
the first to come into contact with trafficked persons; they thus serve a fundamental 
function by referring victims to the appropriate authorities for assistance, helping to file 
complaints and reporting illegal activity to law enforcement. Moreover, in States where 
resources may be limited for anti-trafficking programmes, such agencies can provide 
valuable support by operating shelters, giving free legal assistance or offering medical or 
psychological care. Even where resources are abundant, the provision of assistance by 
victim support agencies remains invaluable, because victims may be more likely to trust a 
non-governmental organization than criminal justice agencies.  
</p>
<p>47. Partnerships may suffer, however, if there is a lack of trust between criminal justice 
agencies and victim support agencies, in particular if those supporting victims are not 
provided adequate funding, not trusted to participate in legal processes, or excluded from 
anti-trafficking efforts. Where such relationships are properly developed, however, the 
results can be very fruitful.  
</p>
<p>48. It should also be acknowledged, however, that there are limits to the services that 
victim support agencies may be able to provide. States remain responsible for ensuring the 
well-being of victims, and it is important that they are cognizant of the mandates, resources 
and capacity of non-governmental organizations and victim service providers to administer 
necessary assistance to victims.  
</p>
<p>49. The conclusion of memorandums of understanding laying out cooperation 
mechanisms and delineating roles and responsibilities between criminal justice agencies 
and victim service agencies has been one way to foster understanding and increase 
communication. 59  Various provinces in Thailand have adopted internal memorandums 
signed by Government officials, the Royal Thai Police and victim support agencies. The 
memorandums clarify the roles and responsibilities of each entity, elucidate working 
principles and definitions, and are intended to introduce systems to improve the working 
relationship between the parties. 60  In the Republic of Moldova, a memorandum of 
understanding was signed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Office, the Ministry of Social Protection, IOM and a number of non-governmental 
organizations and service providers. As a result, the organizations and other service 
providers in the country offer an array of services for victims, including medical and legal 
assistance, case monitoring, special assistance for children and services to help with re-
integration, such as vocational training, employment counselling, grants for business 
development and social welfare assistance. 61  
</p>
<p>50. Even in the absence of formalized cooperation agreements, increased cooperation 
can yield important results. For example, although no formal cooperation mechanisms exist 
between non-governmental organizations and criminal justice agencies in Belarus, in recent 
years there has been an increase in practical cooperation between them in providing

<p>assistance to trafficking victims. 62  As a result, non-governmental anti-trafficking 
organizations have reported that communication with officials has improved and, in some 
instances, the relevant agencies have permitted specialists from the organizations to attend 
police interviews and closed court hearings upon victims' requests.63 More recently it was 
reported that non-governmental organizations had assisted in the training of Government 
officials in victim identification.64  
</p>
<p>51. In the Netherlands, the Co-ordination Centre on Human Trafficking, La Strada 
(CoMensha), is an independent organization that works with the national government by 
preparing reports to inform the recommendations and actions of the Dutch National 
Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings. CoMensha also registers trafficking victims, 
makes referrals to partner organizations or authorities, maintains regional networks to 
coordinate shelter, legal services, medical care and other forms of assistance for victims and 
provides capacity building trainings to practitioners.65 
</p>
<p>52. Government agencies and non-governmental organizations may collaborate in other 
innovative ways, as seen in the development of a new reporting mechanism in the 
Philippines. Recognizing that Filipinos are some of the most prolific users of short message 
service (SMS) technology in the world, a plan entitled &#8220;SOS SMS for Overseas Filipino 
Workers in Distress was created in 2006. For Filipinos abroad, SOS SMS is an all-hours 
text-based ICT mechanism implemented in coordination with non-governmental 
organizations and Government agencies to enable trafficked persons to solicit help via any 
SMS-enabled telephone system. The programme allows for instantaneous and inexpensive 
reporting, and facilitates counselling, guidance and emergency assistance. 66  
</p>
<p>53. In India, non-governmental organizations play a significant role both in rescuing 
victims of trafficking and in providing them with assistance and reintegration services. A 
judgement made by the fifth Additional Metropolitan Session Judge Court in Hyderabad, 
Andhra Pradesh, involving a trafficked child illustrates how collaboration resulted in the 
conviction of two traffickers and support for the minor-victim. In this case, the victim was 
able to escape her traffickers and contact a non-governmental organization, Prajwala, based 
in Hyderabad. Prajwala filed a complaint on behalf of the victim, which led to a criminal 
investigation conducted jointly by police, the Forensics Department and the organization. 
The traffickers were arrested and the victim was given safe shelter. Prajwala provided 
psychological counselling and organized a mock trial, with the help of the Public 
Prosecutor, to prepare the victim to give testimony in court. The case was adjudicated in 
less than one year and the traffickers were sentenced to a prison term and fined. 67

Organizations, 2008. </p>


<p><b> 1.  The role of victims of trafficking in investigations and prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>54. Victims of trafficking play a critical role in the criminal prosecution of traffickers 
and their accomplices. The Special Rapporteur is well aware that the complexity of the 
crime of trafficking and related evidentiary complications can make investigations and 
prosecutions difficult, if not impossible, without the cooperation and testimony of victims. 
It is, however, important to clarify that a human rights approach to trafficking does not 
preclude the active involvement of victims in the investigation and prosecution of their 
exploiters. Rather, such an approach confirms that States, through their national criminal 
justice agencies, should be working towards recognizing victims of trafficking as an 
essential resource who are provided with the protection and support they need to participate 
safely and effectively in criminal justice processes.  
</p>
<p>55. It should be recalled that these persons are first and foremost victims of trafficking 
who, by virtue of that status, are entitled to immediate protection and support. International 
law clearly states that all trafficked persons have a right to protection from further harm, a 
right to privacy, and a right to physical and psychological care and support. Trafficked 
persons also have a right to be informed of their legal options and given the time, space and 
help required to consider those options carefully. In some cases, this may require the 
regularization of the trafficked person&#8217;s legal status to allow them access to services and to 
protect them from deportation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Safety and privacy of victims 
</b></p>
<p>56. During trials, challenges persist when ensuring safety and privacy for victims, 
minimizing unnecessary delay and ensuring that victims receive appropriate treatment. In 
response to such concerns, prosecutors in the United States have prepared redacted court 
filings, devoted attention during interviews to avoid disclosing potentially identifying 
information about victims and made special arrangements, including with members of the 
media, to address privacy concerns in public court proceedings.68 Certain South-east Asian 
countries, such as Viet Nam and Thailand, have provisions in their laws to protect the 
privacy of victim-witnesses; however, implementation remains a challenge, and more 
analysis is needed to assess whether certain protections, in particular provisions that allow 
children to be examined in court by social workers or psychologists rather than by 
attorneys, comply with minimum fair trial standards.69  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Corroborative evidence 
</b></p>
<p>57. Proactive investigations that seek to collect evidence to obviate or support victim 
testimony are another way for States to realize their due diligence obligation to prosecute 
trafficking without unduly burdening victims. The Special Rapporteur notes that alternative 
or corroborative evidence may be difficult to collect in trafficking cases because of limited 
resources and a lack of trained officials, particularly in States most affected by trafficking. 
The situation may also be compounded by the hidden nature of the crime and the lack of 
concrete records or indicators of criminal activity. It is important to acknowledge that 
substituting victim testimony with alternative evidence may not allow for full and effective

<p>prosecution. Nevertheless, the added value of such evidence merits attention, not least 
because the discovery of additional or corroborative evidence may alleviate some of the 
pressure put on victims during the prosecution process. 
</p>
<p>58. The development of alternative evidence-gathering techniques has received some 
attention from States, particularly in recent years. In 2009, a memorandum issued by the 
Government of India (see also paragraph 30 above) stated that, in order to increase 
conviction rates, States should build cases based on documentary, forensic and material 
evidence and lessen the degree of reliance on victim-witness testimony. In the United 
States, at both the State and federal levels, experts have commented on the value of 
bolstering a victim&#8217;s testimony with alternative forms of evidence through such methods as 
surveillance exercises, subpoenas of phone records, interviews of numerous witnesses and 
victims, public record searches, information received from confidential informants and 
warrants to search cars, homes and e-mail.68 Similarly, reviewing potential sources of 
evidence, such as transportation receipts, phone records and social websites, has been 
reported as helpful in bolstering victim testimony.70  
</p>
<p>59. Another good practice is where States have taken measures to provide victim-
witnesses with important information about participation in the justice process and to 
address privacy and safety concerns during trials. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland, the Crown Prosecution Service has a policy of keeping victims 
informed about case developments, hearing dates, verdicts and sentences.71 In order to help 
agencies provide victim-witnesses with information in a language they understand, 
UNODC and the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) have developed 
a tool, &#8220;VITA&#8221;, to identify the nationality and language of trafficked persons.72  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Success of specialized institutions 
</b></p>
<p>60. Given that the complexity of the trafficking crime requires specialization and 
expertise, a number of States have established specialized agencies or institutions on 
trafficking. Many national police forces have specialized trafficking units. Some of these 
units operate on the national level; in other countries, such as Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic and Myanmar, have decentralized the specialist response to the 
provincial level.73 
</p>
<p>61. Success has been achieved in Nigeria through the creation of a national agency for 
the prohibition of traffic in persons and other related matters.74 The agency&#8217;s mandate is 
two-fold: law enforcement and providing victims with assistance. It recently reported that it 
had secured convictions against 111 individuals for trafficking violations and rehabilitated

<p>more than 4,000 victims since it began its work in 2003.75 The agency works with other 
federal agencies, civil society and international organizations to coordinate victim 
assistance and centralize information on anti-trafficking activities, and has helped to 
establish State-level anti-trafficking committees.76  
</p>
<p>62. In Pakistan, the Federal Investigation Agency has set up specialized anti-trafficking 
units.77 India has also developed anti-human trafficking units in a number of its police 
departments designed to investigate trafficking cases. While reports have indicated that 
many of the units lack resources, India has earmarked funding to establish new ones as part 
of its efforts to strengthen its national law enforcement response.78 
</p>
<p>63. Another important issue is the extensive backlog of trafficking cases in the courts. 
The establishment of specialized courts could help to remedy this; for example, Argentina 
and Uruguay have created specialized courts to deal exclusively with trafficking cases.79 
More recently, the Chief Judge of Edo State in Nigeria granted approval to develop two 
special courts to try human trafficking cases.80 The United States81 and Mexico82 have each 
made efforts to develop specialized units to prosecute cases of trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>64. Insufficient data and accompanying analysis on patterns of criminal activity 
continue to hinder efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases. To address this 
problem, Peru has developed a database system for its national police force to record and 
manage trafficking cases, which can be used to generate statistical reports and qualitative 
intelligence information to enhance investigative capacity.83 In Colombia, an operational 
anti-trafficking in persons centre coordinates and tracks investigations, prosecutions and 
victim assistance programmes.84 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Rights of the accused 
</b></p>
<p>65. The strength of criminal justice responses to trafficking are partly reflected by the 
incorporation of internationally accepted procedural guarantees for the accused. The 
provision of protection and support for victims must be balanced against respect for the 
rights of those accused of trafficking crimes. Failure to provide for the rights of the accused 
could compromise the integrity of proceedings and undermine trust in the justice process.

<p><b> 6. Punishments 
</b></p>
<p>66. International law places an obligation on States to impose effective and 
proportionate punishments for trafficking and related offences. 85  When considering the 
appropriate standard, it is important to recognize that punishments that are disproportionate 
to the harm caused will create distortions that can only hinder effective criminal justice 
responses. For example, inadequate penalties can fail to deter future crimes and to deliver 
justice to victims, and potentially impair the effectiveness of international cooperation 
procedures, such as extradition, which are triggered by a severity test linked to the gravity 
of sanctions. On the other hand, rigid or extremely severe punishments, such as mandatory 
minimum custodial terms or provisions for capital punishment, may not meet the required 
human rights and criminal justice standards.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur notes that the proportionality requirement may demand the 
imposition of more stringent penalties for aggravated offences. Egyptian law has codified 
aggravated circumstances to include involvement in an organized crime network or 
transnational activity; death threats, serious harm, torture or the use of weapons; instances 
where the perpetrator was related to the victim or responsible for the victim&#8217;s care; the 
</p>
<p>involvement of a public official; where the death of a victim, permanent disability or 
incurable disease occurred; or where the victim was a child, incapacitated or disabled.86 
Argentina has introduced certain aggravating circumstances in its law, including when the 
perpetrator is related to the victim; the crime is committed by more than three people; and 
the crime involved more than three victims or where certain recruitment methods were used 
if the crime involved a victim under the age of 13.87  
</p>
<p><b> F. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>68. Given the transnational nature of human trafficking, acts may often take place across 
borders, creating jurisdictional issues. For this reason, a number of States have given their 
courts jurisdiction over the crime of trafficking even if the crime takes place in a foreign 
jurisdiction. 88  Others have legislated that if at least one of the acts of trafficking (for 
example, recruitment, accommodation or exploitation) is committed on national territory, 
prosecution may be pursued even if the act was carried out abroad.89  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur notes that international cooperation and collaboration in the 
investigation process is also important; for example, Malta grants investigators the legal 
authority to take all measures they would be entitled to take in a domestic case if so 
requested by a foreign judicial authority.90 The Special Rapporteur also recalls the positive 
example noted at the expert meeting, where the collaboration of law enforcement 
authorities from Nigeria and other European destination countries regarding the trafficking 
of persons from Nigeria into the Netherlands and Europe led to the arrest of traffickers in 
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well

<p>as in the United States and Nigeria.91 The Netherlands built on the experience by providing 
the Nigerian agency for the prohibition of traffic in persons (see paragraph 61 above) with 
training and technical assistance for detectives, prosecutors and border police.92Another 
example of cross-border collaboration can be seen in Rwanda, whose national police Aanti-
trafficking unit has collaborated with police in Burundi to rescue victims. In addition, 
Rwanda has set up the Isange Centre to rehabilitate victims and has made efforts to train 
law enforcement officials, including by sending them abroad.93 
</p>
<p>70. Extradition is another important legal mechanism for ensuring the effective 
prosecution of suspects, precluding the ability of traffickers to flee to a &#8220;safe haven&#8221; State.94 
The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime requires States 
parties to treat offences established in accordance with the Protocol as extraditable offences 
under domestic law, and to ensure that such offences are included as extraditable offences 
in current and future extradition treaties. A number of regional instruments, such as the 
Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors, in its article 10, specifically 
identify trafficking as an extraditable offence. A number of States have explicitly provided 
that trafficking is an extraditable offence.95 
</p>
<p>71. While extradition is instrumental in ensuring the efficient prosecution of suspected 
traffickers, thereby upholding the interests of both the victim and the State, the Special 
Rapporteur notes the importance of ensuring a rights-based approach to extradition, which 
would require consideration of the human rights implications of action at all stages of the 
extradition process. Such safeguards include an evidentiary test to protect individuals from 
being extradited on the basis of groundless allegations and/or from requests made in bad 
faith or to punish a person on account of their race, sex, religion, nationality, ethnic origin 
or political opinions.96 The Special Rapporteur also emphasizes the fact that the right to a 
fair trial, as provided for in articles 9, 14, 15 and 16 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, must apply to all extradited persons. Similarly, the principle of non-
refoulement prohibits the return of a person where she or he would suffer discrimination or 
where this would result in the extradited individual being subjected to torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.97  
</p>
<p><b> G. Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>72. A corollary of the fact that States have a responsibility to investigate, prosecute and 
adjudicate trafficking crimes with due diligence is the development of criminal justice 
agencies and institutions equipped to handle trafficking and other crimes. Integrated 
training that promotes a rights-based approach and provide technical skills is of critical 
value in the fight against trafficking.98  </p>

<p>73. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn from the responses received that a 
majority of States provided training programmes to raise awareness of officials in a wide 
range of Government agencies, including the judiciary, the police, the health sector and 
within specific ministries. These programmes are sometimes arranged by specialized 
officials within Governments, while at other times are supported by multilateral and 
bilateral partnerships, including with international organizations such as IOM and 
UNODC.99 
</p>
<p>74. In addition to training, efforts to organize, empower and coordinate the activities of 
criminal justice officials and agencies are important in building the capacity of national 
responses. Lack of commitment or knowledge on the part of prosecutors and judges may 
result in poorly prepared legal arguments and briefs, improper application of the law, 
inappropriate sentencing, ineffective use of witnesses or evidence and insufficient attention 
to protection for victims. Lastly, lack of cooperation between police and prosecutors 
diminishes the effectiveness of the criminal justice response.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to learn that States have begun to create 
specialized law enforcement, prosecutorial and adjudicative units to combat trafficking. 
Funding and resource allocation remain important issues.100  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur notes the important role that non-governmental 
organizations can play in training officials. For example, in Australia, they are invited to 
give presentations to investigators.101 In Nicaragua, Casa Allianza Nicaragua has organized 
workshops for both journalists and police to raise awareness about trafficking and to stress 
the need to protect victims and to improve investigations.102 
</p>
<p>77. Based on the responses administered, the Special Rapporteur notes that foreign 
Government donors and also international organizations make important contributions 
through the design, implementation and evaluation of law enforcement development 
programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Asset seizure 
</b></p>
<p>78. By undermining the financial gain of traffickers, asset recovery plays an important 
role in the criminal justice response to trafficking. The financial information obtained in 
asset recovery can also serve as corroborative evidence and, by strengthening the 
prosecution, protect the rights of present and potential victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>79. Articles 12 to 14 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime requires States parties to have sufficient powers to facilitate the seizure of assets, and 
sets out the requirements and procedures for it. Article 23, paragraph 3 of the Council of 
Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings states that each party to 
the Convention should adopt &#8220;such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to 
enable it to confiscate or otherwise deprive the instrumentalities and proceeds of criminal 
offences&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>  
 99 For example, in Belarus, Nigeria, Peru, Sri Lanka, the Syrian Arab Republic, Viet Nam and Zambia. 
 100 For example, Guatemala has created a small prosecutorial unit for trafficking offences, although it has 
</p>
<p>only three staff members and lacks sufficient funding; see United States Department of State, 
Trafficking in Persons Report 2011 (footnote 23), Guatemala, p. 176.  
</p>
<p> 101 Submission by Australia, p. 17.  
 102 See www.covenanthouse.org/news/view/nicaragua-fights-human-trafficking. </p>


<p>80. The Special Rapporteur notes that linking asset seizure to victim support is in line 
with a rights-based approach to human trafficking. Recovered assets can be a key source of 
funds when providing victims with compensation.103 The Special Rapporteur reminds States 
that trafficking victims have a right to compensation for the harm committed against 
them.104 Indeed, article 6, paragraph 6 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children provides that States parties legal 
systems must take measures that offer the possibility of compensation to victims.105  
</p>
<p>81. In some States, laws explicitly provide that restitution and compensation be made to 
victims of trafficking out of the proceeds of assets seizure. In Cambodia, for example, 
articles 46 and 47 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual 
Exploitation afford victims &#8220;preference over property confiscated by the State&#8221; for the 
payment of damages. Other schemes have been established to allow the direct transfer of 
funds to victims; for example, in Nigeria, the Victim of Trafficking Trust Fund manages the 
proceeds of confiscated assets for the welfare and rehabilitation of the victim.106 In 2008, in 
England and Wales (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), in the matter 
of <i>AT v Dulghieru</i>, the High Court awarded compensation of &#163;611,000 to four trafficking 
victims of the &#163;786,000 that had been confiscated.107  
</p>
<p>82. A number of States have established funds for victims in which seized assets are 
deposited; for example, in Egypt, article 27 of the Anti-Trafficking Law provides for the 
creation of a fund to assist victims of human trafficking sourced from proceeds of 
confiscated assets, fines and donations from foreign or national entities. Similarly, in 
Lesotho, the Anti-Trafficking Act 2011 provides for assets to be forfeited and confiscated, 
to be deposited in a trust fund for victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur notes that there are other instances where, despite laws 
allowing for the seizure of assets, the proceeds of funds confiscated have reportedly failed 
to be distributed to victims. For example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has a 
comprehensive anti-trafficking law,108 in a landmark case in 2009, a trafficking ringleader 
was sentenced to 12 years in prison, fined $14,286, and over $204,600 in assets were 
seized. There is, however, no evidence that these funds went to the victims.109 Similarly, in 
the Czech Republic, following the successful prosecution of eight gang members for 
trafficking, the assets of the accused, estimated at more than $1.5 million, were seized. 
</p>
<p>Again, no evidence was found that the funds had been distributed to the victims.110  
</p>

trafficking. </p>


<p>84. Other laws allow for the confiscation of assets from convicted trafficking offenders 
but do not directly support victims. For example, in Armenia, although article 266 of the 
Criminal Code provides for the confiscation of assets from convicted trafficking offenders, 
it does not specify where those funds would go. Thus, in 2010, although the Government 
provided partial funding of $17,000 for a shelter for 21 trafficking victims, it was not clear 
whether the funding was derived from the proceeds of asset confiscation.  
</p>
<p>85. A better alternative would be for confiscated assets to be allocated specifically to 
programmes supporting victims of trafficking; for example, the Government of Australia 
has committed funds allocated under the Proceeds of Crime Act from confiscated assets of 
criminals to key non-governmental anti-trafficking organizations.111  
</p>
<p>86. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes that, since traffickers often operate on an 
international basis, their assets may be located in another State than the one where 
trafficking is organized. She therefore urges States to cooperate to develop and enforce 
laws on international asset recovery. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>A review of national criminal justice responses to trafficking reveals that, while 
States have begun to incorporate and implement elements and standards found in 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law, much remains to be done. Low prosecution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>conviction rates around the world confirm that even those States with advanced 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal justice systems and sophisticated anti-trafficking strategies must look to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve their performance. Of particular concern is the need to ensure that the rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of all persons, most particularly but not exclusively victims, are respected.</b>  
</p>
<p><b> A. Proper identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>States must take proactive steps to build the capacity of front-line officials from 
all agencies that might encounter trafficking crimes or victims for quick and accurate 
</b></p>
<p><b>identification of trafficking victims. Governments should establish national referral 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms for identifying and assisting victims, in close cooperation with all actors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially victim service providers and non-governmental organizations. States, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>part of efforts and cooperation at the subregional level, should consider the adoption 
</b></p>
<p><b>of transnational referral mechanisms for trafficked persons. This would encourage 
</b></p>
<p><b>law enforcement cooperation in investigation, arrest and prosecution.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring the non-criminalization of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Laws and policies that do not contain adequate safeguards to prevent the 
prosecution of trafficking victims for status-related offences must be revised, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular by taking steps to ensure that they are not prosecuted for offences related 
</b></p>
<p><b>to their status as trafficked persons, including sex crimes, begging, working or 
</b></p>
<p><b>immigration violations. In addition, it is important that States provide post-conviction 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies, such as the possibility to quash judgements for status-related offences.</b>  
</p>
<p>  
 111  A/HRC/20/18/Add.1. </p>


<p><b> C. Criminalization of crimes relating to trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In addition to criminalizing trafficking in persons in conformity with the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>Organized Crime, States must ensure the criminalization of other crimes relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking in persons, including </b>&#8211;<b> but not limited to </b>&#8211;<b> corruption, money-laundering, 
</b></p>
<p><b>debt bondage, obstruction of justice and participation in organized criminal groups.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Facilitating the safe and productive involvement of victims in 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Victims of trafficking are legally entitled to take an active and meaningful role 
in efforts to convict their exploiters, and should be supported to that end. This would 
</b></p>
<p><b>therefore require the adoption of reflection and recovery periods accompanied by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision of assistance not conditional on cooperation with the authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> States should protect the safety and well-being of victim-witnesses, in particular 
in view of the fact that victims may be subject to threats or reprisal from traffickers. </b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to extend protection and assistance to 
victim-witnesses in cases of trafficking in person pretrial, during trials and post-trial. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Experience has shown that victim-witnesses are most vulnerable post-trial, when they 
</b></p>
<p><b>usually no longer benefit from witness protection programmes.</b>  
</p>
<p>94. <b>In addition, judges and lawyers involved in trafficking cases should be trained 
to recognize the sensitive nature of trafficking cases, and be provided with tools to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure effective and respectful trials, especially to protect victims of sex trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to speed up the access of victims to justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Promoting cooperation between criminal justice and victim support 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The role of victim support agencies in identifying trafficking cases and victims, 
providing information on trends in human trafficking and delivering services and 
</b></p>
<p><b>support should be recognized and facilitated by States. Efforts should be made to 
</b></p>
<p><b>build confidence and to encourage greater coordinated collaboration. The conclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of bilateral agreements and memorandums of understanding on key areas of delivery 
</b></p>
<p><b>will aid communication and build trust. In partnering victim support agencies or 
</b></p>
<p><b>other civil society organizations, States must not delegate the responsibility to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the well-being of victims and must remain vigilant to ensure respect for human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights.</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Improving investigations and prosecutions  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Training is an important component of anti-trafficking strategies, and the 
development of specialized anti-trafficking units may assist States to strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity to investigate and prosecute trafficking. Such units must be bound by clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandates to address anti-trafficking matters, and be adequately equipped and 
</b></p>
<p><b>funded.</b> 
</p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to engage in proactive investigation, 
employing new technologies and methods that focus on gathering evidence to prove </b></p>


<p><b>culpability for trafficking crimes without heavy or sole reliance on the testimony of 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims. Trafficked persons should not be used as instruments for criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations. In all cases, it is imperative that States integrate gender and aged-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>perspectives into investigations and prosecution.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> G. Appropriate penalties 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Punishment for trafficking in persons must be effective, appropriate and 
dissuasive. Again, it must be proportionate to the offence committed, and proceeds 
</b></p>
<p><b>from the crime should be confiscated.</b>  
</p>
<p>99. <b>States are urged to disaggregate data on prosecution for trafficking offences by 
sex, age, year, nationality of convicted persons, form of exploitation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctions/penalties and terms of imprisonment, as well as other indicators that would 
</b></p>
<p><b>assist in gathering intelligence on understanding the phenomenon of trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons.</b>  
</p>
<p><b> H. Preventing unintended negative consequences 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>As States work to adopt a rights-based approach, they should be cognizant of 
the fact that certain laws and policies may have unintended negative consequences for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of trafficking. Laws or policies that infringe the right to movement for victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>or that impose mandatory detention or rehabilitation in the name of protection are in 
</b></p>
<p><b>violation of human rights laws and may deny victims the right to a proper remedy.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Care should be taken to enact clear and enforceable legal frameworks that comply 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international standards and principles. Such frameworks must take practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>constraints into account and be tailored to the S</b>tate&#8217;s legal system in order to provide 
</p>
<p><b>protection and assistance to trafficked persons during the criminal justice process.</b>  
</p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that political pressure to prosecute traffickers 
may lead to over-enforcement, shortcuts and unacceptable trade-offs. It is important 
</b></p>
<p><b>that efforts by States to end impunity for traffickers should include appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>safeguards in the criminal justice responses that protect victims, witnesses and 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspects, and integrate gender and aged-based perspectives into investigations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution.</b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur urges States to intensify efforts to strengthen the 
technical capacity of criminal justice administrators, in particular, that of judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and the police. A comprehensive curriculum on trafficking in persons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including online courses, should be mainstreamed in ongoing education training 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes.</b> </p>
