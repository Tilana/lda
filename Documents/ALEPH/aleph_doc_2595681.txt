The  information  provided  under  headings  1  to  4  above  includes  remuneration  disclosures  that  are  required  under 
Accounting Standard AASB 124, Related Party Disclosures.
1.  PRINCIPLES USED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION
The  objective  of  the  Group’s  executive  reward  framework  is  to  ensure  reward  for  performance  is  competitive  and 
appropriate for the results delivered.  The framework which has been set out in detail under the remuneration structure 
in this Remuneration Report aligns executive reward with achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value 
for shareholders, and conforms to market best practice for delivery of reward.  The Board ensures that executive reward 
satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices:
competitiveness and reasonableness;
aligns shareholders and executive interests; 
  performance based and aligned to the successful achievement of strategic and tactical business objectives;
and
transparency.
Executive Directors
Remuneration to Executive Directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of the Executive 
Directors.  Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually to ensure it is appropriate and in line with the market.   
There are no retirement allowances or other benefits paid to Executive Directors other than superannuation guarantee 
amounts as required.
The executive remuneration and reward framework has three components:
base pay; 
 
  other remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.
share-based payments; and
The combination of these comprises the Executive Director's total remuneration.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Annual Report 2016
Directors Report (cont)
Remuneration Report (audited) (cont)
Fixed  remuneration,  consisting  of  base  salary  and  superannuation  will  be  reviewed  annually  by  the  Remuneration  & 
Nomination Committee, based on individual contribution to corporate performance and the overall relative position of 
the Group to its market peers.
Non - Executive Directors
Remuneration to Non-Executive Directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of, the Non-
Executive Directors.  Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually.  For the period ended 30 June 2016, 
exclusive of superannuation guarantee the annual remuneration for the Non-Executive Director was $45,000 per annum 
with the Chairman receiving $75,000 per annum.
Company Performance
As an exploration company the Board does not consider the operating loss after tax as one of the performance indicators 
when implementing an incentive based remuneration policy. The Board considers that the success of exploration and 
feasibility  programs,  safety  and  environmental  performance,  the  securing  of  funding  arrangements  and  responsible 
management of cash resources and the Company’s other assets are more appropriate performance indicators to assess 
the performance of management at this stage of the company’s development.
Short-term incentives
To align the remuneration of employees with the company aim of responsible management of cash resources, there were 
no short-term incentives paid or proposed to be paid for the period ended 30 June 2016.  The company’s approach in 
regards to the use of short term cash incentives will be assessed by the Remuneration & Nomination Committee on an 
ongoing basis as the company evolves.
Long-term incentives
To align with market practices of peer companies and to provide a competitive total remuneration package, the Board 
introduced a long-term incentive (“LTI”) plan to motivate and reward executives and non-executive directors. The LTI is 
provided as options over ordinary shares of the Company under the rules of the Employee Share Option Plan and the 
Directors Option Plan as approved in September 2015.
The quantum offered under the LTI is determined by the Remuneration & Nomination Committee using a comparison to 
a peer group of companies similar to S2 Resources Ltd in terms of market capitalisation and sector.  The peer group were 
companies  in  the  Materials  sector  of  the  ASX  with  a  market  capitalisation  of  $50-$100  million  that  issued  options  in 
relation to the FY 2015.

Annual Financial Report (cont)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the period ended 30 June 2016
S2 Resources Ltd (“Company” or “S2”) is a company incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the 
Australian Securities Exchange. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the period ended to 30 
June 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group” or “consolidated entity” and 
individually as a “Group entity”).
The separate financial statements of the parent entity, S2 Resources Ltd, have not been presented within this financial 
report as required by the Corporations Act 2001.  Summary parent information has been included in note 23.
The financial statements were authorised for issue on 19 August 2016 by the Directors of the Company.
NOTE 1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a)
Basis of preparation
The financial report is a general purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting 
Standards,  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian  Accounting 
Standards Board (“AASB”) and the Corporations Act 2001.
Australian Accounting Standards set out accounting policies that the AASB has concluded would result in a financial report 
containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and conditions to which they apply. The financial 
statements  and  notes  also  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  issued  by  the  International 
Accounting Standard Board (IASB). Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this financial report are 
presented below. They have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
The Group is a for-profit entity for financial reporting purposes under Australian Accounting Standards.  The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business 
activities and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
The Company was incorporated on 29 May 2015 and accordingly the financials for the period ended 30 June 2016 have 
not disclosed comparatives.
Historical cost convention
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the  historical  cost  convention,  except  for,  where  applicable,  the 
revaluation  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss, 
investment properties, certain classes of property, plant and equipment and derivative financial instruments.
Critical accounting estimates
The  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting  estimates.  It  also  requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the consolidated entity's accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
financial statements, are disclosed in note 1(a)(iii).
(i)
Operating segments
Operating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same 
basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). The CODM is responsible for the 
allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.

Annual Financial Report (cont)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
NOTE 1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a) 
(ii)
Basis of preparation (continued) 
Adoption of new and revised Accounting Standards
The Group has adopted all of the new, revised or amending Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB 
that are mandatory for the current reporting period.  The adoption of these Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
did not have any material impact on the financial performance or position of the consolidated entity.
Any new, revised or amending Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early 
adopted.
(iii) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates 
in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates 
and  assumptions  on  historical  experience  and  on  other  various  factors,  including  expectations  of  future  events, 
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates 
will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the 
next financial year are discussed below.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes model taking 
into  account  the  terms  and  conditions  upon  which  the  instruments  were  granted.  The  accounting  estimates  and 
assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact profit or loss and equity.  Refer to note 15.
Estimation of useful lives of assets
The  Group  determines  the  estimated  useful  lives  and  related  depreciation  and  amortisation  charges  for  its  property, 
plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets. The useful lives could change significantly as a result of technical 
innovations or some other event. The depreciation and amortisation charge will increase where the useful lives are less 
than previously estimated lives, or technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold will be 
written off or written down.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised in an identifiable area of interest upon announcement of a JORC 2012 
compliant  resource  and  costs  will  be  amortised  in  proportion  to  the  depletion  of  the  mineral  resources  at  the 
commencement  of  production.  Key  judgements  are  applied  in  considering  costs  to  be  capitalised  which  includes 
determining expenditures directly related to these activities and allocating overheads between those that are expensed 
and  capitalised.  In  addition,  costs  are  only  capitalised  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  either  through  successful 
development or sale of the relevant mining interest. Factors that could impact the future commercial production at the 
mine  include  the  level  of  reserves  and  resources,  future  technology  changes,  which  could  impact  the  cost  of  mining, 
future legal  changes and changes in commodity prices.  To the extent that capitalised costs are determined not to be 
recoverable in the future, they will be written off in the period in which this determination is made.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
NOTE 1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a) 
(iv)
Basis of preparation (continued) 
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of entities controlled by S2 at the end 
of the reporting period. A controlled entity is any entity over which S2 has the ability and right to govern the financial and 
operating policies so as to obtain benefits from the entity’s activities.
Where controlled entities have entered or left the Group during the year, the financial performance of those entities is 
included only for the period of the year that they were controlled.  A list of controlled entities is contained in note 24 to 
the financial statements.
In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  all  intragroup  balances  and  transactions  between  entities  in  the 
consolidated Group have been eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests, being the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent, are reported 
separately within the equity section of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the Consolidated Statement 
of  Profit  or  Loss  and  Other  Comprehensive  Income.    The  non-controlling  interests  in  the  net  assets  comprise  their 
interests at the date of the original business combination and their share of changes in equity since that date. 
 
(b)
Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).  The consolidated financial statements 
are presented in the Australian dollar ($), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions.    Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of  such  transactions  and  from  the 
translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally 
recognised in profit or loss.  They are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net 
investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.
Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  that  relate  to  borrowings  are  presented  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss,  within 
finance costs.  All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit or loss on a net basis 
within other income or other expenses.
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchanges rates at the 
date  when  the  fair  value  was  determined.    Translation  differences  on  assets  and  liabilities  carried  at  fair  value  are 
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.  For example, translation difference on non-monetary assets and liabilities 
such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss 
and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Foreign currency translation (continued)
(b) 
(iii) Group companies 
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency 
as follows:
•
•
•
assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the 
date of that statement of financial position, 
income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing  on  the  transaction  dates,  in  which  case  income  and  expenses  are  translated  at  the  dates  of  the 
transactions), and 
all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  any  net  investment  in  foreign  entities,  and  of 
borrowings  and  other  financial  instruments  designated  as  hedges  of  such  investments,  are  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive  income.    When  a  foreign  operation  is  sold  or  any  borrowings  forming  part  of  the  net  investment  are 
repaid, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
(c)
Revenue Recognition
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.
(d)
Income Tax
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the 
national income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial 
statements, and to unused tax losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the 
assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted for 
each jurisdiction.
The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure 
the  deferred  tax  asset  or  liability.    An  exception  is  made  for  certain  temporary  differences  arising  from  the  initial 
recognition  of  an  asset  or  a  liability.    No  deferred  tax  asset  or  liability  is  recognised  in  relation  to  these  temporary 
differences if they arose in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not 
affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that 
future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

(d) 
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  offset  current  tax  assets  and 
liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.  Current tax assets and tax liabilities 
are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in 
equity.
(e)
Acquisition of entities under common control
The Group adopts the pooling of interest method to account for acquisition of entities under common control.
The pooling of interest method involves the following:
The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts prior to the combination;
No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities, that would other be done under 
the acquisition method.  The only adjustments that are made are to harmonise accounting policies;
No ‘new’ goodwill is recognised as a result of the combination; and
The only goodwill that is recognised is any existing goodwill relating to either of the combining entities.  Any difference 
between the consideration paid/transferred (including liabilities assumed) and the entity ‘acquired’ is reflected within 
equity.
The  Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  or  Loss  and  Other  Comprehensive  Income  reflects  the  result  of  the  combining 
entities  from  the  date  that  the  combination  occurred.    Financial  information  for  the  periods  prior  to  the  date  the 
combination occurred is not restated.
(f)
Impairment of Assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset being 
the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to the asset’s carrying value.
Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed to the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.  Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
(g)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial 
institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

(h)
Trade and Other Receivables
A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of  receivables.   The amount of the provision is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate.  Cash flows relating to short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is 
immaterial.    The  amount  of  any  provision  is  recognised  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  or  Loss  and  Other 
Comprehensive Income.
(i)
Trade and Other Payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year 
which are unpaid.  The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
(j)
Exploration and Evaluation
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  comprise  of  acquisition  of  mineral  rights  (such  as  joint  ventures)  and  fair  value  (at 
acquisition date) of exploration and expenditure assets from other entities.  As the assets are not yet ready for use they 
are not depreciated.  Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if:
• 
•
sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability; or 
other facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the assets are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets 
are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to mine properties as development assets.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is expensed in respect of each identifiable area of interest until such a 
time where a JORC 2012 compliant resource is announced in relation to the identifiable area of interest.  These costs are 
only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area 
or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of 
economically recoverable reserves.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource have been demonstrated then 
any capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is reclassified as capitalised mine development.
Prior  to  reclassification,  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  assessed  for  impairment  annually  in 
accordance  with  AASB  6.    Where  impairment  indicators  exist,  recoverable  amounts  of  these  assets  will  be  estimated 
based on discounted cash flows from their associated cash generating units.
The  Statement  of  Profit  or  Loss  and  Other  Comprehensive  Income  will  recognise  expenses  arising  from  excess  of  the 
carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets over the recoverable amounts of these assets.
In the event that an area of interest is abandoned or if the Directors consider the expenditure to be of reduced value, 
accumulated costs carried forward are written off in the period in which that assessment is made.  Each area of interest 
is reviewed at the end of each accounting period and accumulated costs are written off to the extent that they will not 
be recoverable in the future.

Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement 
Items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated 
impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.  The cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working 
condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they 
are located and capitalised borrowing costs.
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.  
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds 
from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within other income in 
profit or loss.  When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in the revaluation reserve are transferred to retained 
earnings.
(ii) Subsequent costs 
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be 
measured reliably.  The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.  The costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
(iii) Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for 
cost, less its residual value.
Depreciation is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset.  Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful 
lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
The depreciation rates used for each class of asset are:
buildings 
fixtures and fittings 
leasehold improvements 
plant and equipment

• 
• 
•  motor vehicles
16.67%

appropriate.

(l)
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and 
requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets 
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A distinction is made between finance leases, which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the 
risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased assets, and operating leases, under which the lessor effectively retains 
substantially all such risks and benefits.
Finance leases are capitalised. A lease asset and liability are established at the fair value of the leased assets, or if lower, 
the present value of minimum lease payments. Lease payments are allocated between the principal component of the 
lease liability and the finance costs, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leased assets acquired under a finance lease are depreciated over the asset's useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s 
useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the consolidated entity will obtain ownership at the 
end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
(m)
Interest in Joint Ventures
The  Group  accounts  for  100%  of  the  assets,  liabilities  and  expenses  of  joint  venture  activity.  These  have  been 
incorporated in the financial statements.
(n)
Financial Instruments
Recognition 
Financial instruments are initially measured at cost on trade date, which includes transaction costs, when the related 
contractual rights or obligations exist. Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are measured as set out below.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market and are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, comprising original debt less principal payments and 
amortisation.
Fair value 
Fair value represents the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, 
willing parties.
Impairment 
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a  financial  instrument  has  been 
impaired.

(n) 
De-recognition 
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expires or the asset is transferred 
to  another  party  whereby  the  entity  no  longer  has  any  significant  continuing  involvement  in  the  risks  and  benefits 
associated  with  the  asset.  Financial  liabilities  are  derecognised  where  the  related  obligations  are  either  discharged, 
cancelled or expired.  The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to 
another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer or non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is 
recognised in profit or loss.
(o)
Provisions
General 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the  obligation.  When  the  Group  expects  some  or  all  of  a  provision  to  be 
reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income 
net of any reimbursement.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
present obligation at the reporting date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from 
the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
(p)
Employee Benefits
(i) Equity Settled Compensation 
The Group operates equity-settled share-based payment employee share and option schemes. The fair value of the equity 
to which employees become entitled is measured at grant date and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding increase to an equity account. The fair value of shares is ascertained as the market bid price. The 
fair value of options is ascertained using a Black–Scholes pricing model which incorporates all market vesting conditions. 
The number of shares and options expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at each reporting date such that the amount 
recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of 
equity instruments that eventually vest.
(ii) Short-term obligations 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to 
be settled within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised 
in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be 
paid when the liabilities are settled.
The liability for annual leave and accumulating sick leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits. All other 
short-term employee benefit obligations are presented as payables.

Employee Benefits (continued)
(p) 
(iii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations 
The liability for long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of 
the period in which the employees render the related service is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and 
measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up 
to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage 
and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted 
using market yields at the end of the reporting period on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency 
that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
(iv) Share-based payments 
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Employee Option Plan.
The fair value of options granted under the Employee Option Plan is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
options granted, which includes any market performance conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions but 
excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The 
total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions 
are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected 
to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company transfers the appropriate amount of shares to the employee. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited directly to equity.
(v) Termination benefits 
Termination  benefits  are  payable  when  employment  is  terminated  before  the  normal  retirement  date,  or  when  an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when 
it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal 
plan without possibility of  withdrawal or to providing termination benefits as a result  of an offer made to encourage 
voluntary redundancy.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.
Issued Capital
(q) 
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs associated with capital raisings (exclusive of GST) directly attributable to 
the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds. If the entity reacquires its own 
equity instruments, e.g. as the result of a share buy-back, those instruments are deducted from equity and the associated 
shares are cancelled.  No gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss and the consideration paid including any directly 
attributable costs associated with capital raisings (net of income taxes) is recognised directly in equity.
(i) Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit / (loss) attributable to equity holders of the Group, excluding 
any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account 
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and 
the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential 
ordinary shares.
(r)
Goods and Services Tax
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  associated  GST,  unless  the  GST  incurred  is  not 
recoverable from the taxation authority.  In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as 
part of the expense.
Receivables  and  payables  are  stated  inclusive  of  the  amount  of  GST  receivable  or  payable.    The  net  amount  of  GST 
recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of 
financial position.
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis.  The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities 
which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flow.

New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted
Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  Interpretations  that  have  recently  been  issued  or  amended  but  are  not  yet 
mandatory, have not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for period ended 30 June 2016. The consolidated 
entity's assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to 
the consolidated entity, are set out below.
•  AASB 2015-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Annual Improvements to Australian Accounting
Standards 2012-2014 Cycle, and
•  AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 101.
As these amendments merely clarify the existing requirements, they do not affect the Group’s accounting policies or any 
of the disclosures.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments 
These amendments must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.   Therefore application 
date for the Company will be 30 June 2019. The Company does not currently have any hedging arrangements in place.
AASB 9 addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.  Since 
December 2013, it also sets out new rules for hedge accounting. There will be no impact on the Company’s accounting 
for  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  as  the  new  requirements  only  effect  the  accounting  for  available-for-sale 
financial assets and the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the 
Company does not have any such financial assets or financial liabilities. The new hedging rules align hedge accounting 
more closely with the Company’s risk management practices.  As a general rule it will be easier to apply hedge accounting 
going forward.  The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.

AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
These  amendments  must  be  applied  for  annual  reporting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2018.    Therefore 
application date for the Company will be 30 June 2019.
An entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This means 
that revenue  will be recognised when control of goods or  services is transferred, rather than on transfer of risks and 
rewards as is currently the case under IAS 18 Revenue. Due to the recent release of this standard the Company has not 
yet made an assessment of the impact of this standard.
AASB 16 Leases 
IFRS 16  eliminates the operating and finance lease classifications for lessees currently accounted for under AASB 117 
Leases.  It instead requires an entity to bring most leases onto its statement of financial position in a similar way to how 
existing finance leases are treated under AASB 117.  An entity will be required to recognise a lease liability and a right of 
use asset in its statement of financial position for most leases.
There are some optional exemptions for leases with a period of 12 months or less and for low value leases. The application 
date of this standard is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Due to the recent release of 
this standard, the group has not yet made a detailed assessment of the impact of this standard.
AASB 2014-3 (issued August  2014) -  Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Accounting for Acquisitions  of 
Interests in Joint Operations 
When an entity acquires an interest in a joint operation whose activities meet the definition of a ‘business’ in AASB 3 
Business  Combinations,  to  the  extent  of  its  share  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  as  specified  in  the 
contractual arrangement, the entity must apply all of the principles for business combination accounting in AASB 3, and 
other IFRSs, to the extent that they do not conflict with AASB 11 Joint Arrangements.
This  means  that  it  will  expense  all  acquisition-related  costs  and  recognise  its  share,  according  to  the  contractual 
arrangements, of:
• 
Fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities, unless fair value exceptions included in AASB 3 or other IFRSs, and 
•  Deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability as required by AASB
3 and AASB 112 Income Taxes.
•  Goodwill  will  then  be  recognised  as  the  excess  consideration  over  the  fair  value  of  net  identifiable  assets
acquired.
Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
There  will  be  no  impact  on  the  financial  statements  when  these  amendments  are  first  adopted  because  they  apply 
prospectively to acquisitions of interests in joint operations.

between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 
Removes the inconsistency between AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 128 Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures in accounting for transactions where a parent loses control over a subsidiary that is not a business 
under AASB 3 Business Combinations, by selling part of its interest to an associate or joint venture, or by selling down 
part of its interest so that the remaining investment becomes an associate or joint venture. Requires that:
•  Gain or loss from measuring the retained interest in the former subsidiary at fair value, as well as gains or losses 
to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss, only be recognised to the extent of the 
unrelated investor’s interest in that associate or joint venture, and
•  Remaining gains or losses to be eliminated against the investment in associate or joint venture.
Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. 
 
There  will  be  no  impact  on  the  financial  statements  when  these  amendments  are  first  adopted  because  they  apply 
prospectively to sales or contributions of assets occurring after the application date. 
 
NOTE 2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks and accounts receivable and payable.
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; market risk (including fair value interest rate risk and price 
risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.  The Group's overall risk management program focuses on 
the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of 
the Group. Risk management is carried out by the Board of Directors under policies approved by the Board. The Board 
identifies and evaluates financial risks and provides written principles for overall risk management.
The  main  risks  the  Group  is  exposed  to  through  its  financial  instruments  are  interest  rate  risk,  foreign  currency  risk, 
liquidity risk, credit risk and price risk.

NOTE 2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
Interest Rate Risk
Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  financial  instruments  will  fluctuate  because  of 
changes in market interest rates.  The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily 
to the Group’s Australian Dollar current and non-current debt obligations with floating interest rates.  The Group is also 
exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and short term deposits.

Sensitivity 
As shown in the table above, the Group is primarily exposed to changes in EUR/$exchange rates.  The sensitivity of profit 
or loss to changes in the exchange rates arises mainly from EUR-dollar denominated financial instruments and the impact 
on other components of equity arises from translation of foreign operations.

NOTE 2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) 
 
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise meeting 
its obligations related to financial liabilities. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash reserves on the 
basis of expected development, exploration and corporate cash flows. This ensures that the Group complies with prudent 
liquidity risk management by maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through 
the equity markets to meet obligations when due.  For the period ended 30 June 2016, the Group has no contractual 
financial liabilities.
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and other receivables. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal 
to the carrying amount of these instruments.  The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution 
counterparties, which are rated AA- based on Standard and Poor’s rating agency.
The credit risk on other receivables is limited as it is comprised of prepayments and GST recoverable from the Australian 
Taxation Office and tax authorities in Scandinavia. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counter party is a 
bank with high credit rating. There are no receivable balances which are past due or impaired.
Price risk
The Group is not currently exposed to commodity price risk.
NOTE 3. SEGMENT INFORMATION
For management purposes, the Group has three reportable segments as follows:
•
Scandinavian exploration activities, which includes exploration and evaluation of mineral tenements in Finland 
and Sweden.
•  Australian exploration activities, which includes exploration and evaluation of mineral tenements in Australia.  
•  Unallocated, which includes all other expenses that cannot be directly attributed to either segments above.
Segment information that is evaluated by the CODM is prepared in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for 
preparing the financial statements of the Group.

Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001

financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error. In Note 1, the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101
Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International
Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
