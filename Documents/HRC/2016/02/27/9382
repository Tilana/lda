<p> During the discussion of agenda item 10, &#8220;Technical assistance and capacity-building&#8221;, at 
the first part of the sixth session of the Human Rights Council, held from 10 to 
28 September 2007, the President of the Council issued a statement reading as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. The Human Rights Council welcomes the return to the rule of constitutional law in 
the Republic of Haiti, as evidenced by the election of the President of the Republic, 
the restoration of an elected Parliament, the appointment, endorsed by Parliament, of a 
Prime Minister, and the holding of municipal elections. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;2. The Council commends the Haitian authorities on their commitment and efforts to 
improve living conditions for Haitians through measures such as greater regard for human 
rights and cooperation between the Haitian National Police and the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in curbing violence. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;3. The Council is nonetheless aware of the many challenges that Haiti is facing. 
</p>
<p>It encourages the international community to continue supporting the efforts of the elected 
authorities, and encourages those authorities to make use of the resources and expertise 
placed at their disposal. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;4. The Council takes note of the difficulties encountered and the efforts made by the 
Haitian authorities. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;5. While still concerned at the persistent criminal activity in some parts of the 
country, the Council notes with satisfaction the steps taken to counter corruption and 
drug-trafficking. It welcomes current efforts to correct irregularities in the police and 
justice systems, and encourages the Haitian authorities to continue them, bringing to 
fruition their plans for stronger inspection units within the police and justice systems, 
regulations to govern the judiciary, the establishment of a High Council of the Judiciary 
and the reopening of the Judicial Training College, an end to prolonged detention and 
improved conditions in detention, the introduction of a legal aid scheme and better staffed 
forensic science and forensic medical services. It notes with satisfaction the proposal for a 
steady improvement in relations between the Office of Citizen Protection and the 
MINUSTAH Human Rights Section. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;6. The Council also welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; plans to pass a series of laws on 
the status of women and reforms of the civil registry and land registry systems. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;7. The Council encourages the international community to step up its activities in all 
</p>
<p>these areas and in human rights training and education for the security forces. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;8. The Council thanks the independent expert appointed by the Secretary-General to 
consider the human rights situation in Haiti for his report (A/HRC/4/3). It encourages the 
expert to continue his mission and report thereon to the Council at its eighth session.
