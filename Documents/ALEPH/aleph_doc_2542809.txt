Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements for Royal Standard Minerals Inc. have been prepared by management in
accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied.    The  most  significant  of    these

dependent upon future events.  Therefore, estimates and approximations have been made using careful judgment.  Recognizing
that the Company is responsible for both the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements, management is satisfied that
these financial statements have been fairly presented.
Auditors' involvement

Basic and diluted (loss) income per share
Basic (loss) income per share has been determined by dividing net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted (loss) income per share is the
same as basic (loss) income per share.  The Company's stock options, warrants and agent warrants were not included in
the diluted (loss) income per share calculation because it would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
The estimated taxable income for the period ended is $nil. Based upon the level of historical taxable income it cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time if it is more likely than not that Royal will realize the benefits from future income tax assets
or the amounts owing from future income tax liabilities.
Consequently, the future recovery or loss arising from differences in tax values and accounting values have been reduced
by an equivalent estimated taxable temporary difference valuation allowance.
The estimated taxable temporary difference valuation allowance will be adjusted in the period that it is determined that it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the future tax assets or future tax liabilities will be realized.

Income taxes
For  further  information  on  Royal's  actual  losses  for  tax  purposes,  refer  to  the  January  31,  2005  audited  consolidated
financial statements.

Subsequent Events
(a)  The Company entered into a 5-year purchase option agreement with a private individual for all of his patented and
unpatented  mining  claims  in  the  Manhattan  Mining  District  located  in  Nye  County,  Nevada.  The  land  package  totals
approximately 1600 acres (4 patented, 700 unpatented claims). This property position adjoins the Company's Goldwedge
Mine.   The land package includes a number of exploration targets which are of interest to the Company.   In addition, the
Company's option includes the Dixie Comstock claim group located in Churchill County, Nevada.  The Dixie Comstock is a
1500 acre property containing an epithermal gold system that has been explored by a number of major mining companies
over  the  past  20  years.  It  is  considered  to  be  an  attractive  advanced  exploration  project.  The  Company  is  currently
engaged in the completion of a 43-101 property report.  Annual option payments of $48,000 are to be applied to a total
purchase price of $600,000 – there are no royalties.
(b)    The  Company  signed  an  Exploration  and  Option  Agreement  with  Metallic  Ventures  ("Metallic")  to  explore  the
Mustang Canyon Project in Esmeralda County, Nevada.
The  agreement  gives  the  Company  the  exclusive  option  to  acquire  50%  interest  in  the  Mustang  Canyon  Project  by
spending $20,000 per year in exploration expenditures with the objective to identify a measured resource by June 30, 2010.
Upon identification of a measured resource and completion of a 43-101 report, the Company will earn a 50% interest in the
project.
The Company may terminate the Agreement at any time after spending the initial $20,000 by providing 30 days written
notice to Metallic.  When the Company has exercised its option to acquire a 50% interest in the project,  Metallic and the
Company will establish a Joint Venture in respect to the project, on a 50/50 basis.   Further expenditures on the Mustang
