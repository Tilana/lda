</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders conducted a country visit to Indonesia from 5 to 12 June 2007 during which she met 
with senior Government officials as well as a broad range of human rights defenders. The 
purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in Indonesia in the light 
of the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms<b>1</b> (Declaration on Human Rights Defenders). 
</p>
<p> Following an introductory chapter I, in chapter II the Special Representative describes the 
positive steps taken by the Government since 1998 to strengthen the legal and institutional 
framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. She notes the adoption of a set of 
laws and the establishment of State institutions that may create awareness on the role of human 
rights defenders and facilitate their work. 
</p>
<p> In chapter III, the Special Representative examines several gaps and shortcomings in the 
above-mentioned framework, both at the legal and institutional level, which result in diluting any 
benefits that human rights defenders could draw from the positive developments. The greatest 
flaw lies in the absence of concrete measures dealing directly with the protection of human rights 
defenders by giving recognition to the legitimacy of their work or by ensuring accountability for 
violations or arbitrary action against them. 
</p>
<p> In chapter IV, the Special Representative presents the changing situation of human rights 
defenders in Indonesia. She first undertakes a general appraisal of the situation. She concludes 
that despite visible progress in the country&#8217;s democratic development, human rights defenders 
continue to experience serious constraints in conducting their activities for the protection of 
human rights. Such constraints are imputable to the continuing activities of the police, the 
military and other security and intelligence agencies as well as religious fundamentalist groups 
that are aimed at harassing and intimidating defenders or restricting their access to victims and to 
sites of human rights violations. Then, the Special Representative highlights the plight of 
vulnerable groups of defenders, i.e. those defending the rights of women, of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and intersex and HIV/AIDS persons, and of indigenous peoples, as well as 
church workers. Finally, she assesses the situation of human rights defenders in the West Papua 
and Aceh provinces. She concludes that a climate of fear undeniably prevails in West Papua, 
especially for defenders engaged with the rights of the Papuan communities to participation in 
governance, control over natural resources and demilitarization of the province. The situation of 
these defenders does not seem to have eased and, despite the adoption of the Special Autonomy 
Law in 2001, their legitimate activities for the protection of human rights continue to be targeted. 
The series of concerns of the Special Representative regarding the situation of human rights 
defenders in West Papua, articulated in this report, persist despite the assurances given to her by

</p>
<p>the police and military authorities in Papua that there was no institutional policy to target 
defenders. As for Aceh province, the Special Representative welcomes the improvement of the 
situation, although concerns remain with regard to surveillance activities by law enforcement 
authorities, stigmatization of defenders, restrictions that affect the work of women human rights 
defenders, and the score of unresolved cases. 
</p>
<p> Finally, in chapter V the Special Representative formulates her conclusions and 
recommendations for consideration by the Government. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/61 and 2003/64 and Human 
Right Council decision 1/102, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders conducted an official visit to Indonesia from 5 to 
12 June 2007 at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in the light of 
the principles set forth in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the 
United Nations General Assembly in 1998.<b>2</b> An examination of the legal framework in the 
country, the institutional policies and the mechanisms for promotion and protection of human 
rights were of particular importance to this assessment. The Special Representative also sought 
further information on cases brought to her attention of human rights defenders who were, 
reportedly, targeted for carrying out activities in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Representative would like to thank the Government of Indonesia for the good 
cooperation extended to her in preparation of and during her mission. She wishes in particular to 
acknowledge the support she received from the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU). During her visit, she was able to meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the 
Minister for Law and Human Rights, the Director-General for Human Rights, the 
Director-General for Corrections, the Director-General for Kesbangpol and the Director-General 
from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court, the Deputy 
Chief Justice on Judiciary Matters, the Attorney-General on General Crimes, the Chief of 
Military Armed Forces, the Chief of the National Police, the Chairman of the National 
Commission on Human Rights, the Chairperson of the National Commission on Women, and 
members of the People&#8217;s Legislative Assembly (Parliament). She regrets that she did not have an 
opportunity to meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition to Jakarta, the Special Representative visited the Aceh and West Papua 
provinces, where she had an opportunity to meet with local authorities, members of provincial 
legislatures and the judiciary, and law enforcement agencies. She also met with a broad 
cross-section of civil society and with human rights defenders engaged with a wide range of 
human rights issues. She thanks all organizations and individuals who worked hard to coordinate 
her meetings with the defender community. She is also grateful to the Office of the 
United Nations Resident Coordinator for its valuable assistance with the logistics and the 
programme of the visit.

</p>
<p><b>II. STRENGTHENING OF THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL 
FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>5. The situation the Special Representative has observed indicates that the prospects for the 
promotion of human rights had been considerably improved in the recent past. Since the 
downfall of President Suharto in 1998, several positive steps have been taken to strengthen the 
legal and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Representative was briefed by the Ministry of Home Affairs on the normative 
framework conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights. She was informed that 
in 2002, major changes to the 1945 Indonesian Constitution were carried out. A whole chapter 
on human rights was introduced, enshrining basic human rights and fundamental freedoms such 
as the right to life (art. 28A), the right to be free from torture or inhuman, degrading treatment 
(art. 28G (2)), the right to be free from discriminatory treatment based upon any grounds 
whatsoever (art. 28I (2)), the right to freedom of expression, assembly and association 
(art. 28E (3)), the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (art. 28E (2)), the right to 
recognition as a person and right to equal treatment before the law (art. 28D (1)), the right to 
respect cultural identities and traditional communities (art. 28I (3)), the right to work 
(art. 28D (2)), and the right to education (art. 28C (1)). 
</p>
<p>7. Following the end of President Suharto&#8217;s regime, a series of laws on human rights and 
fundamental freedoms were adopted: Law 9/1998 on freedom of expression in public places 
containing regulations for implementing rights (art. 5) and obligations (art. 6) of persons, 
individually and in association with others as well as obligations on public authorities (art. 7); 
Law 39/1999 on human rights setting out the fundamental rights and duties of citizens of 
Indonesia, including a section on women&#8217;s rights, and stipulating that the Government has a 
responsibility to protect, promote and implement all human rights and freedoms; Law 26/2000 
on human rights courts establishing courts for judging gross human rights violations;<b> 
</b>Law 32/2004 on local government affairs stipulating that authorities of provincial governments 
and regencies/municipalities have the obligation to promote and protect human rights in the 
course of decentralization (arts. 13 and 14); Law 12/2006 on citizenship; Law 13/2006 on 
witness protection providing protection for witnesses and victims and establishing a witness and 
victim protection agency; Law 23/2006 on population administration; and Law 21/2007 on the 
elimination of human trafficking and the Circular Letter of the Ministry of Home Affairs 
in 2006, which serve as guidance for the implementation of Law 32/2004. The Ministry of Home 
Affairs further indicated that it issued instruction 4/2005 on the institution of national unity and 
politics in provinces and regencies defining the promotion of human rights as one of its 
priorities. The Special Representative was finally informed that Law 8/1985 on 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) affairs setting rights (art. 6) of and obligations (art. 7) 
on such organizations was still in place. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>8. In 2004, the National Plan of Action on Human Rights Promotion (hereinafter the Plan) 
was adopted by Presidential Decree 40/2004. It is implemented by the Ministry for Law and 
Human Rights, and is designed to improve people&#8217;s awareness and protection of human rights 
across the country over the next five years. It includes the ratification of international human 
rights instruments,<b>3</b> the dissemination of and education on human rights, the harmonization of 
human rights regulations, the implementation of human rights norms and standards, and the 
monitoring, evaluation and reporting concerning the respect of human rights. Special attention is 
reportedly given to women, children, elderly, disabled persons, culture-based communities, 
minorities, poor communities, peasants and fisheries. Under the Plan, local governments 
coordinate local institutions in delivering services related to human rights promotion and 
protection, and may facilitate the revision of local regulations that may hinder efforts related to 
the promotion of human rights. Furthermore, 426 local human rights committees comprised of 
local leaders have reportedly been set up to disseminate information and educate bureaucrats and 
professional groups on human rights as well as to compile information on the human rights 
situation in the provinces and to report to the Ministry for Law and Human Rights. Thirty more 
committees are reportedly to be established. 
</p>
<p>9. Several ministerial regulations were adopted in order to guide local governments in their 
tasks: the joint regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs 8/2006 and the Minister of Religious 
Affairs 9/2006 on guidance in promoting interfaith harmony at local level; the regulation of the 
Minister of Home Affairs 34/2006 on guidance in promoting intercultural harmony at local level; 
and the regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs 7A/2007 on procedures for proposition on 
information and response or recommendation of community to reports of local governments. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Komnas HAM 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Representative met with the Chairman of the National Human Rights 
Commission (Komisi Nasional Hak Asasi Manusia - hereinafter Komnas HAM), who presented 
the work of the Commission. Komnas HAM was established under Presidential Decree 50/1993 
and renewed as an independent institution upon the adoption of Law 39/1999, which defines its 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  As of July 2007, Indonesia had ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention 
Against Torture, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Indonesia has signed the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the first and 
second Optional Protocols of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In June 2006, Indonesia was elected to the 
United Nations Human Rights Council and it pledged to ratify the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court by 2008. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>mandate, objectives, functions, organs and membership. There are currently 20 Commissioners 
whose terms of office will expire on 30 August 2007. Conditions of eligibility for appointment 
as members of Komnas HAM are Indonesian citizenship; experience in promoting and 
protecting individuals or groups whose human rights have been violated; experience in 
the-judiciary, legislative, or executive; or activities as a religious figure, a member of 
non-governmental organizations or a higher education establishment. 
</p>
<p>11. The goal of Komnas HAM is to promote the implementation and protection of human 
rights mechanisms based on the 1945 Constitution, the United Nations Charter and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. It holds the functions of carrying out research and study, 
education, monitoring and mediation of human rights. Komnas HAM has branch offices in Aceh, 
West Papua, Maluku, West Kalimantan and West Sumatra provinces. 
</p>
<p>12. Komnas HAM is also mandated to bring cases of human rights abuse to the Government, 
but has no legal enforcement power of its own. In order to deal with gross violations of human 
rights, Law 26/2000 on human rights courts was promulgated. Under this law, Komnas HAM is 
conferred with a mandate as a <i>pro justicia</i> inquirer. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Komnas Perempuan 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Representative met with the Chairwoman of the National Commission on 
Violence Against Women (Komisi Nasional Anti Kekerasan Terhadap Perempuan - hereinafter 
Komnas Perempuan), and eight commissioners. Komnas Perempuan was established under 
Presidential Decree 181/1998. It is partly funded by the Government and partly by national and 
international organizations, and is composed of 13 commissioners who are members of civil 
society, judiciary and religious groups, and former law enforcement officials. 
</p><p>14. The first task of Komnas Perempuan was to investigate the sexual violence, mainly 
suffered by ethnic Chinese women, during the 1998 riots. Today, Komnas Perempuan focuses on 
the protection of women suffering domestic violence, women migrant workers, women victims 
of sexual violence undertaking court proceedings, women in armed conflict areas, and women 
heads of families living in poverty in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>15. It conducts annual reporting and monitoring of gender-based human rights violations, and 
has appointed three experts (called &#8220;Special Rapporteurs&#8221;) respectively on sexual violence on the 
events of May 1998, on Aceh regarding displacement caused by conflict and tsunami, and on 
Poso. Komnas HAM also advocates for the enactment of legislation and Government policies 
that support the prevention of violence against women. Komnas Perempuan was one of the key 
stakeholders behind Law 23/2004 regarding the abolition of domestic violence and the Draft 
Law for the protection of witnesses. In addition, the organization provides support to nine 
women&#8217;s crisis centres throughout Indonesia. Results of fact-finding missions and other inquiries 
by Komnas HAM are in the public domain. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Representative met with the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court and was 
apprised on the core functions of the Court, namely to test the constitutionality of laws; to decide </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>disputes between State organs; to decide disputes regarding general elections; to decide upon the 
dissolution of political parties; and to take a decision regarding the People&#8217;s Legislative 
Assembly&#8217;s opinion on alleged violations committed by the President and/or the Vice President. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Representative was pleased to hear that the Constitutional Court supports 
fundamental rights, especially the right to freedom of expression. She welcomes the repeal on 
6 December 2006 of articles 134, 136 bis and 137 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (Kitab 
Undang-undang Hukum Pidana, KUHP), which punished &#8220;insulting the President or 
Vice-President&#8221; with up to six years&#8217; imprisonment. In its landmark judgement, the Court had 
held that these three articles negated the principle of equality before the law and diminished 
freedom for expressing thought and opinion, freedom of information, and the principle of legal 
certainty.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>18. At the time of the drafting of the report, the Special Representative was informed that 
on 17 July 2007, the Constitutional Court had rendered a judgement against the constitutionality 
of articles 154 and 155 of the Criminal Code (KUHP), which criminalized &#8220;public expression of 
feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government&#8221; and prohibited &#8220;the expression 
of such feelings or views through the public media&#8221;. The Special Representative was told that 
those provisions had been used to silence human rights defenders, notably in West Papua. The 
Special Representative welcomes that positive development and expects that the decision will 
preclude any adverse action of the kind reported to her to penalize human rights defenders 
(HRDs) for exposing or criticizing human rights violations by the Government, in conformity 
with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.<b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4. Human rights courts 
</b></p>
<p>19. Law 26/2000 established four permanent human rights courts, in Jakarta, Surabaya, 
Makasar and Medan. Ad hoc human rights courts were set up to judge gross human rights 
violations before Law 26/2000 was passed, namely crimes against humanity, war crimes and 
genocide. Ad hoc human rights courts are composed of members of the judiciary and of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  In its comments on the report, the Government of Indonesia asserted that &#8220;the removal of 
</p>
<p>several articles from the [Criminal] Code on the defamation of the State by the Constitutional 
Court has in fact strengthened the legal basis of the democratization process in Indonesia, 
particularly in assuring the free movement of human rights defenders at all levels, ranging from 
Government to non-Government areas, in order to allow for the voicing of their concerns without 
any legal misapprehension or consequences&#8221;. 
<b>5
</b>  Article 6 (b) and (c) of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders states that &#8220;[e]veryone has 
</p>
<p>the right, individually and in association with others: (b) As provided for in human rights and 
other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others 
views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; (c) To study, 
discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public 
attention to those matters&#8221;.<b> </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>academia. In order for an ad hoc court to sit, a case must first be investigated by Komnas HAM 
upon authorization of the People&#8217;s Legislative Assembly; then the findings of the initial 
investigation are passed to the Attorney-General, who decides whether the case is deemed 
relevant to be judged by an ad hoc human rights court. 
<b>5. Ministry for Law and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Representative was apprised by the Minister for Law and Human Rights, the 
Director-General for Human Rights and the Director-General for Corrections on initiatives 
aimed at promoting and protecting human rights. She was briefed on the National Plan of Action 
on Human Rights Promotion, for which leadership has been entrusted to the Minister, and on the 
empowerment of local human rights committees set up under the Plan. She was further informed 
of human rights training conducted for the State apparatus, i.e. the police, military and executive, 
reportedly with the assistance of several NGOs, the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to increase human 
rights understanding. Finally, she was told that a coordination team for human rights issues in the 
Aceh region undertaking restorative justice was deployed. She takes note of the conclusion of the 
Minister that &#8220;human rights are part of the Indonesian culture&#8221;, and hopes that this statement will 
find resonance in the practices of the Government and in its cooperation with efforts of human 
rights defenders to eliminate violations of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>6. Law enforcement authorities 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Representative was informed by heads of police and military in the capital and 
in the provinces she had visited of initiatives and programmes on human rights to sensitize police 
and military officials at both academy and field levels. Her attention was, in particular, drawn to 
the issuance of a book on human rights to each soldier, a curriculum on local cultures, and a 
workshop on respect of human rights by the police organized reportedly by the IOM. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Representative was informed that a National Police Commission holds a 
mandate to monitor the activities and performance of police officers on the ground. It is 
composed of nine members: three from the Ministry for Law and Human Rights and six 
independent experts. These members are selected by an independent body which includes the 
President of the country. The Commission reports directly to the President. 
</p>
<p><b>III. GAPS AND SHORTCOMINGS IN THE LEGAL 
AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>23. While the legal and institutional framework for the protection of human rights has been 
progressively strengthened since 1998, it is however marred by several gaps and shortcomings 
that result in diluting any benefits that human rights defenders could draw from the positive 
developments. By far the greatest flaw is the absence, at both legal and institutional levels, of 
concrete measures dealing directly with the protection of human rights defenders. Many of the 
measures that relate to human rights in general may create awareness on the role of human rights 
defenders and facilitate their work, but they do not address the crucial issue of their protection. 
The Special Representative acknowledges the relevance of some of the laws introduced after 
1998 and mentioned in this report to this aspect of protection. However, there is neither 
legislation nor procedures and mechanisms that are dedicated to the protection of human rights </p>

</p>
<p>defenders by giving recognition to the legitimacy of their work or by ensuring accountability for 
violations or arbitrary action against them. During her meeting with the Director-General for 
Human Rights, the Special Representative raised the issue; she notes that he acknowledged this 
shortcoming and remarked that this was a flaw that should be addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Gaps in the legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Law 8/1985 on NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>24. NGOs acknowledged that the State institutions linked with human rights initiatives are 
improving on their engagement with NGOs, and their involvement in the planning and execution 
of governmental human rights programmes has increased. At the same time, there are serious 
concerns regarding the freedom of association of NGOs. The attention of the Special 
Representative was drawn to Law 8/1985 on registration of NGOs, which contains several 
provisions that run contrary to the objective of creating an enabling environment for the work of 
NGOs. 
</p>
<p>25. According to this law, registration of NGOs is compulsory, and criteria for registration 
contain ideological elements and adherence to a subjective code of morality that appear to be 
unjustified and intrusive. Further, it was alleged that the Government uses the registration regime 
to allow the creation of organizations that are more compliant and can be used for countering 
NGO criticism of any aspects of Government performance on human rights. The law also places 
undue restrictions on international funding to NGOs. The Special Representative has raised these 
issues with concerned authorities during her visit. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Representative was informed that the Ministry of Home Affairs has asked the 
People&#8217;s Legislative Assembly (PLA) to reform Law 8/1985; however, according to PLA 
Commission No. 3 on Human Rights, the reform of the law is not in its agenda for the moment. 
Members of the Commission told the Special Representative that it will meet the Government in 
January 2008 to discuss priority laws, and Law 8/1985 will reportedly be deemed a priority. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Witness Protection Act 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Representative welcomes the adoption of the Witness Protection Act. 
However, she questions the adequacy of the scope of protection of the Act because of an 
incomplete definition of &#8220;witnesses&#8221;. Indeed, the Act oddly denies protection to individuals who 
provide information on non-criminal cases (such as corruption cases) or who are consulted as 
experts. Both categories can fear reprisals following their interventions. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Representative has further concerns regarding the independence of the witness 
protection agency, which reportedly functions under the supervision of the police. She is mindful 
of the many cases brought to her attention in which the involvement of the police in human 
rights violations is strongly indicated. This lack of independence reduces the confidence that 
such an agency must enjoy for encouraging witnesses to come forward and for giving them 
effective protection. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p><b>3. Truth and Reconciliation Law 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Representative notes that the Constitutional Court annulled Law 27/2004 
which established the Indonesian Commission of Truth and Reconciliation, holding provisions of 
the Law to be unconstitutional. Some provisions of the Law were severely criticized by human 
rights activists since they permitted amnesty for perpetrators of gross human rights violations 
and impeded the ability of victims to obtain compensation. The Special Representative observes 
that a large section of the defenders&#8217; community is engaged with advocacy on accountability for 
past abuses. It is in this context that she recommends the review of the previous law to bring it in 
conformity with the judgement of the Constitutional Court and urges PLA Commission No. 3 to 
undertake this task on a priority basis. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Gaps in the institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Representative is of the opinion that judicial reform is crucial for the 
protection of human rights defenders, notably the orientation of judges towards the issue of 
defenders. She is disturbed at the large number of prosecution of human rights defenders aimed 
at their harassment for conducting activities that are legitimately a part of their function for the 
defence of human rights. Therefore, it is important to sensitize the judicial and prosecutorial 
officials at local level on the role and activities of human rights defenders so that judges and 
prosecutors can clearly distinguish between activities of human rights defenders and 
security-related or public order offences that are generally used to repress human rights activities 
through judicial procedures. For this purpose, the Special Representative wants to stress the 
leading role that the Constitutional Court may play. The Court has a central role in 
accompanying the transition of Indonesia. It has a responsibility towards the 1945 Constitution, 
but also towards the core international human rights instruments the country has ratified. To this 
end, she welcomes the statement of the Chief of the Constitutional Court that the Court wants to 
set an example. 
</p>
<p>31. Concerns were conveyed to the Special Representative that the office of the 
Attorney-General impedes and fails to accommodate cases of human rights violations. The 
Special Representative was told that for the last three years in West Papua, no case of gross 
human rights violations has been transmitted by the Attorney-General to the Prosecutor. 
According to a judge of an ad hoc human rights court, not everybody in the judiciary knows 
exactly what a case of gross human rights violations is. Furthermore, it was reported that cases of 
disappearances are categorized as past abuses by the office of the Attorney-General. The Special 
Representative stresses that disappearances are ongoing violations until resolved and should be 
dealt with accordingly. 
</p>
<p>32. The establishment of ad hoc human rights courts is a positive development, but the 
jurisdiction of these courts is limited to gross violations amounting to genocide, war crimes and 
crimes against humanity. There is no mechanism to deal with other serious violations. The </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>existing system, therefore, does not effectively eliminate impunity for human rights violations. 
There are also concerns that lack of credible and effective procedures for witness protection as 
well as gathering of evidence has marred the functioning of these courts. A lack of political will 
may also impede the work of the courts. For instance, if the People&#8217;s Legislative Assembly 
determines that a case does not deal with a gross human rights violation, then the Court is not 
competent to judge the case. 
<b>2. Komnas HAM 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Representative is of the opinion that the work of Komnas HAM is crucial. 
However, serious reservations have been expressed before her regarding the composition and 
mandate of the national institution. It has been said that the number of Commissioners (20 at the 
time of drafting this report) is too large and that the Commission is burdened by an unwieldy 
bureaucracy. These two factors impede rather than promote effective and expeditious resolution 
of cases. 
</p>
<p>34. She further wishes to echo concerns expressed by other international human rights 
mechanisms about the insufficient levels of impartiality and independence of Komnas HAM. In 
this regard, she would like to refer to the concluding observations of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child<b>6</b> and the Committee against Torture.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>35. Another problematic aspect of the mandate of Komnas HAM on past abuses is the 
ineffectiveness of its power of enquiry. In order to conduct an initial investigation on past 
abuses, the People&#8217;s Legislative Assembly must have declared that the crime concerned is a 
gross human rights violation. 
</p>
<p>36. Another area of concern is that once the initial investigation on a case is completed by 
Komnas HAM, the findings are transmitted to the Office of the Attorney-General, who can reject 
them on substantive grounds and has sole authority to initiate criminal proceedings. This last 
point creates difficulties since the findings of Komnas HAM are not published. There is, 
therefore, no public knowledge of why a case did not proceed after the initial enquiry. Since 
2000, Komnas HAM has carried out its inquiry function in nine cases of alleged gross violations 
of human rights. Three have been or are being examined by a human rights court. The six other 
cases where inquiries have been completed are still with the Attorney-General at present.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. Another weakness of Komnas HAM is that it only takes up cases of gross human rights 
violations. The Commission is not mandated to investigate common human rights violations, and 
must instead recommend the police to investigate such violations. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  A/57/144, para. 43 (c). </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Representative finally noted that the institutional relationship between 
Komnas HAM, the office of the Attorney-General and the human rights courts still lacks clarity. 
The parameters of the jurisdiction of each of the institutions and the linkages that create the 
chain of procedures for the completion of a case are not sufficiently defined to ensure systematic 
coordination of work.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Komnas Perempuan 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Representative expresses great satisfaction at the work performed by 
Komnas Perempuan since its establishment. Even though it has a limited mandate, this body has 
built its legitimacy. Its work has had an impact on the situation of women&#8217;s human rights 
defenders in particular. However, lack of priority with the Government has left many of its 
findings unimplemented. The Special Representative understands that the report of 
Komnas Perempuan on women human rights defenders was sent to President Yudhoyono but 
that no response to this report had been received by the time of the visit of the Special 
Representative. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Local human rights committees 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Representative welcomes the establishment of local human rights committees 
under the National Plan of Action but regrets that she was not given an opportunity to meet some 
of these bodies during her trips to Aceh and West Papua. Furthermore, she raises concern 
regarding the visibility of such committees among civil society since she was not apprised of 
their existence during her meetings with human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Law enforcement authorities 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Representative was troubled at the apparent resistance from both the police 
and the military to changing attitudes and institutional culture, as evidenced by the large number 
of complaints she received concerning ongoing acts of harassment and intimidation committed 
by both police and military forces, notably intrusive activities of intelligence agencies which 
clearly obstruct the work of human rights defenders. This constitutes the main hurdle to the 
enjoyment of a satisfactory environment for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p><p>42. The Special Representative has a strong reservation on the accountability of military courts 
when the military is involved in abuses committed against human rights defenders. Military

</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  In its comments on the report, the Government of Indonesia informed the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative that &#8220;[w]ith regard to the status of [Komnas HAM], efforts have been undertaken 
to upgrade the status of the Commission at the regional level into that of a &#8216;representative&#8217;s 
office&#8217;. This has become part of the Commission&#8217;s agenda for the period of 2007-2012 &#8230;&#8221;. The 
Special Representative hopes that the promised enhancement of status will resolve the 
coordination issue and allow the Commission more authority to bring cases it has investigated to 
fruitful conclusion. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>justice does not meet international standards, namely the principles of due process and fair trial. 
A number of military officers who have been involved in criminal activities reportedly enjoy 
immunity. Military officers who violate civil law should be tried before a non-military criminal 
court. The principles of civilian courts should be fully upheld. 
</p>
<p>43. Concerns were expressed to the Special Representative regarding the accountability of 
police officers for violations against human rights defenders because of an alleged lack of 
impartiality of the National Police Commission, its members being close to the Head of the 
Police. She requested statistics on cases dealt by the Commission on handling cases of violations 
and/or misconduct by police officers, and hopes she will receive these figures in the near future. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Representative is nevertheless encouraged by the willingness of many within 
the Government to acknowledge the gaps and to continue efforts to remove the obstacles in 
implementing human rights as well as the systemic problems that have prevented a faster pace of 
progress in achieving the objectives of the reforms. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. THE CHANGING SITUATION OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN INDONESIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General appraisal 
</b></p>
<p>45. Until 1998, human rights defenders in Indonesia faced severe restrictions on fundamental 
freedoms - namely freedoms of opinion and expression, assembly and association - that 
jeopardized their legitimate activities throughout the country. The downfall of President Suharto 
in May 1998 opened up a new space for human rights defenders. Several human rights 
organizations emerged, and have since been instrumental in addressing civil and political rights 
as well as economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>46. In the course of her visit, the Special Representative held meetings with a broad 
cross-section of civil society and human rights defenders engaged with a wide range of human 
rights issues. She was particularly struck by the vibrancy and the growing capacity of this 
community to address issues of human rights, particularly those arising from Indonesia&#8217;s 
transition to democracy and those resulting from current economic and social policies.  
</p>
<p>47. It is, however, regrettable that despite visible progress in the country&#8217;s democratic 
development, human rights defenders continue to experience serious constraints in conducting 
their activities for the protection of human rights. The Special Representative is deeply 
concerned by the testimonies she has heard in the capital and the Aceh and West Papua 
provinces indicating the continuing activities of the police, the military and other security and 
intelligence agencies as well as religious fundamentalist groups that are aimed at harassing and 
intimidating defenders or restricting their access to victims and to sites of human rights 
violations. She participated in a public hearing in Jakarta on 7 June 2007 entitled &#8220;Violence 
against Human Rights Defenders in Indonesia&#8221; which brought together defenders from all parts 
of the country. They delivered testimonies on abuses they have suffered, drawing a general 
picture of the situation of human rights defenders in the country. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>48. Violations suffered by human rights defenders range from extrajudicial, summary and 
arbitrary execution, enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, to arbitrary detention and 
restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, association and movement. The Special 
Representative voices special concern at the trend of stigmatization of human rights defenders, 
and takes note of alleged comments made by the Head of State Intelligence Agency who labelled 
as radical the following NGOs: Imparsial, Kontras and Elsham. These organizations were 
reportedly accused of receiving foreign aid and assisting separatist movements. Such statements 
must be strictly discouraged. This trend is exacerbated in the West Papua province. 
</p>
<p>49. Human rights defenders promoting or protecting civil and political rights are the prime 
victims of intimidations and harassment. However, defenders working on economic, social and 
cultural rights are also targeted. The Special Representative gathered a number of cases of abuses 
pertaining to corruption within the State apparatus, rights of national and migrant workers, rights 
of indigenous peoples over natural resources, and land rights of farmers. 
</p>
<p>50. For instance, in September 2005, the local police of Lombok reportedly fired into a crowd 
of more than 700 unarmed peasants who had come peacefully together to commemorate 
Indonesia&#8217;s National Peasants&#8217; Day and discuss land issues. In all, 33 peasants were reportedly 
injured, 27 of them by gunshot - including one child - and the others from police beatings. 
According to reports, more than 10 peasants were either arrested at the scene of the incident or 
from their beds at the local hospital later in the day. The peasants were opposing the planned 
construction of a new international airport on 850 hectares of fertile land in Lombok on which 
the peasants were living and cultivating the land to sustain their livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Representative has taken particular interest in the progress regarding the 
killing of Munir Said Thalib, a prominent human rights defender who died on 7 September 2004 
on the second leg of a Jakarta-Singapore-Amsterdam Garuda flight. During her visit, she met 
with Suciwati, Munir&#8217;s widow, and a member of the Solidarity Action Committee for Munir as 
well as other members of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Representative notes that there are recent developments indicating the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to bring perpetrators to justice, in particular the charging of two senior 
Garuda suspects following another investigation into this crime by the police as well as the 
announcement by the office of the Attorney-General requesting the Supreme Court to review its 
decision in the Pollycarpus case through a process called case review (<i>peninjauan kembali</i>). 
53. However, she is deeply concerned at apprehensions expressed by defenders that the course 
of justice may be influenced to protect the perpetrators of this crime. She notes the absence of 
police investigation of the high-ranking intelligence officials implicated by evidence (such as 
phone records), as concluded by the presidential fact-finding team (<i>Tim Pencari Fakta</i>, TPF) in </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>its report. TPF was established in December 2004 and ended its six-month mandate on 
23 June 2005, producing a lengthy report with detailed findings and recommendations. Similarly 
to Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions,<b>9</b> she 
calls on the Government to release the report of TPF and to act on the recommendations laid 
down in the report. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Representative reminds the Government that this case is generally seen as a 
test of the Government&#8217;s will to protect defenders in the country. She advises the Government to 
ensure that justice is done to the satisfaction of all concerned, and fears that any lapses in the 
conclusion of this case would make all human rights defenders throughout the country insecure. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Vulnerable groups of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Defending the rights of women 
</b></p>
<p>55. In the course of her visit, the Special Representative had an opportunity to meet with 
several women human rights defenders, in the capital and in the provinces of Aceh and 
West Papua. She was impressed by their courage and tireless commitment in promoting and 
defending human rights. These women are human rights activists, humanitarian workers, 
counsellors of women victims of violence, social workers, and community organizers. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Representative appreciates the initiative of Komnas Perempuan, which 
instigated a specific programme on women human rights defenders. In 2005 and 2006, 
Komnas Perempuan set up focus group discussions on women human rights defenders working 
in different situations to identify vulnerabilities and types of violence suffered by women human 
rights defenders in Indonesia. Women defenders were then defined as women working not only 
on women&#8217;s rights, but also on land rights, indigenous rights, conflict areas, fundamentalism and 
poverty. Based on the testimonies of 58 human rights defenders from which 436 cases of human 
rights violations were recorded, 10 specific vulnerabilities and types of violence suffered by 
women defenders were categorized: rape; sexual abuse; sexual terror; sexual harassment; sexual 
stigmatization; attack on women&#8217;s role as mother, wife and children; corrosion of credibility 
based on marital status; marginalization and rejection based on morality, religion, custom, 
culture, and family reputation; belittlement of women&#8217;s capacity and issues; and exploitation of 
women&#8217;s identity.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  In March 2007, Philip Alston issued a statement, noting that &#8220;[i]t is encouraging that the 
</p>
<p>President has reaffirmed that the government continues to work to find those who are guilty of 
Munir&#8217;s murder. But it is disturbing that it has still not taken the obvious step of releasing the 
fact-finding report and acting on its recommendations&#8221;, (&#8220;Expert on Extrajudicial 
Executions Urges Indonesia to Release and Act on Report of Presidential Fact-Finding 
Team&#8221;, 28 March 2007). 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;Women Human Rights Defenders: Struggling under Pressure&#8221;, Komnas Perempuan&#8217;s 
documentation on the situation of women human rights defenders in Indonesia, 2006. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Representative noticed that the activities and safety of women human rights 
defenders have been adversely affected by laws, policies and a social environment that place 
restraints on their fundamental freedoms. For instance, Ms. Ellen from Bhinneka Tunggal Ika 
Group received death threats and was publicly discredited in the media (&#8220;dirty woman&#8221;) after 
demonstrating in Jakarta against the Anti-Pornography Law which is said to have a negative 
gender impact. Similarly, Ms. Ismawati Gunawan from the Coalition of Indonesian Women was 
insulted and assaulted during a demonstration in Tanggerang against a local regulation on 
&#8220;immoral&#8221; acts also believed to have a negative gender impact, by supporters of the regulation 
and in front of police officers present at the rally. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Representative was disturbed by the case of Ms. Wa Ode Habibah, KPI Muna, 
Sulawesi Tenggara who was advocating for the right of women to be free from domestic 
violence and whose house in Muna was burnt down because of her activities. A complaint was 
reportedly filed with the police, but the investigation did not lead to any arrest; instead, the 
defender was accused by the police of having burnt down her own house. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Defending the rights of LGBTI and HIV/AIDS persons 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Representative is particularly concerned about the lack of protection for 
defenders who are engaged with issues that are socially sensitive such as the rights of lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons or public awareness on HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>60. She received credible reports of violations against such defenders. For instance, 
Ms. Maria, Gaya Nusantara, East Java, who advocated for equal rights for LGBTI persons in 
East Java, was subsequently assaulted and intimidated. The victim filed a complaint with the 
police, but they reportedly did not register her complaint, allegedly in the absence of national 
legislation on LGBTIs. She further sought legal counselling from lawyers, but they refused to 
take up her case because of the apprehension of the issue of LGBTI in the country as a &#8220;foreign 
product&#8221;. In another case, Mr. Hartoyo, an advocate for women&#8217;s rights in Aceh, was subjected 
to torture and degrading treatment by police officers while in custody because of his sexual 
orientation. The Special Representative was further informed of intimidation directed at 
Ms. Baby Jim Aditya in Jakarta, who was warned in 2003 not to attend the funeral of a patient 
who had died from AIDS. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Defending the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>61. Activists engaged in defending the rights of indigenous peoples are at particular risk, 
especially in West Papua. The Special Representative was informed of cases where indigenous 
peoples had been arrested when raising publicly the issue of their cultural flag or threatened 
when struggling for the preservation of their natural habitat. One defender received death threats 
and blackmails as a result of her advocacy work on the rights of indigenous peoples over natural 
resources. She reported the threats to the police, but the case was reportedly not taken up. The 
threats continued and she was forced to leave her place with her entire family. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b>4. Church workers 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Representative was distressed by the plight of church workers in West Papua 
who have repeatedly voiced concerns regarding human rights violations suffered by the local 
population and have as a result been publicly accused of being linked to the separatist Papua 
Free Movement (OPM). She gathered several cases of church workers who had been physically 
assaulted, threatened or had their homes searched by the military and the police. The situation of 
religious defenders is relatively safe in Jayapura; however, in remote and isolated areas of the 
province, serious violations occur. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Situation of human rights defenders in West Papua and Aceh provinces 
</b></p>
<p>63. Since the establishment of her mandate to 1 December 2006, the Special Representative 
has sent 35 communications to the Government on 99 individual defenders and several other 
activists of human rights and humanitarian non-governmental organizations. Fifteen cases relate 
to the situation of women human rights defenders or activities related to the promotion and 
protection of the human rights of women. With the exception of a few cases on human rights 
violations in Papua, virtually all the communications transmitted by the Special Representative 
relate to alleged killing, disappearance, attacks, arrest, detention (often incommunicado), 
intimidation and harassment of defenders in Aceh. In many cases, the police or the military were 
reportedly involved or failed to protect defenders from attacks by non-State entities. The Special 
Representative has also sent jointly with other mandate holders communications on general 
allegations related to massive human rights violations in Aceh. While acknowledging the 
response of the Government to a few communications, the Special Representative regrets the 
absence of replies to most of the communications. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Climate of fear in West Papua 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Representative visited Jayapura, capital of the West Papua province, 
on 8 and 9 June 2007. She had the opportunity to meet with the Secretary of Province, officials 
from related provincial government offices, the Provincial Prosecutor, the Provincial Chief of 
Police, the Provincial Chief of Military Command, members of the People&#8217;s Representative 
Council of Papua, representatives of MRP (Papua People&#8217;s Council), religious leaders belonging 
to the Consultative Forum of Religious Leaders of Papua, members of Komnas HAM-Papua, and 
individual human rights activists. 
</p>
<p>65. A climate of fear undeniably prevails in West Papua, especially for defenders engaged with 
the rights of the Papuan communities to participation in governance, control over natural 
resources and demilitarization of the province. The situation of these defenders does not seem to 
have eased, and despite the adoption of the Special Autonomy Law in 2001, their legitimate 
activities for the protection of human rights continue to be targeted. The Special Representative 
heard credible reports of incidents involving arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment through 
surveillance. She was also informed of cases where human rights defenders had been threatened 
with prosecution by members of the police and the military. It was alleged that when defenders 
had attempted to register their complaints, that had been denied and they had been threatened. 
Instances of excessive and disproportionate use of force when policing peaceful demonstrations 
were also brought to her attention. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Representative is particularly disturbed by allegations that when defenders 
expose abuse of authority or other forms of human rights violations committed by the security 
apparatus, they are labelled as separatists in order to undermine their credibility. The Special 
Representative believes that this trend places human rights defenders at greater risk and must be 
discouraged by the concerned authorities. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Representative is also concerned about complaints that defenders from 
West Papua working for the preservation of the environment and the right over land and natural 
resources (deforestation and illegal logging) frequently receive threats from private actors with 
powerful economic interests but are granted no protection by the police. Some old and recent 
cases concern direct involvement of the police and military. Complaints were made to the police, 
but no action was reportedly taken. Sometimes, the police did not even make the effort to 
examine the facts. The Special Representative reminds the Government that it has a 
responsibility to protect its citizens against the harmful activities of non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>68. This climate of fear has reportedly worsened since the incident of Abepura in March 2006, 
where five members of the security forces were killed after clashes with protesters demanding 
the closure of the gold and copper mine, PT Freeport. Lawyers and human rights defenders 
involved with the trial received death threats. The harassment of these lawyers and defenders 
around the trial was interpreted as a warning to the community of human rights defenders, who 
have decreased their activities out of fear of harsh treatment. 
</p>
<p>69. Interference with freedom of movement and with defenders&#8217; efforts to monitor and 
investigate human rights violations was also reported. The Special Representative was perturbed 
to hear that Komnas HAM is prevented by law enforcement authorities from carrying out its 
official duties. She was particularly disconcerted by reports that Mr. Albert Rumbekwan, 
Director of the branch of Komnas HAM in West Papua, was intimidated and threatened on 
several occasions by the police and unidentified persons in the course of his fact-finding 
activities. For instance, in March 2006, following the Abepura incident, Komnas HAM tried to 
conduct an investigation into the incident but the Chief of the local police reportedly warned 
Mr. Rumbekwan and his colleagues that &#8220;if they continue the investigation, the police will kill 
them&#8221;. Mr. Rumbekwan tried to explain the mandate of Komnas HAM to the officer, but this 
latter threw away the documents Mr. Rumbekwan was handing to him. Mr. Rumbekwan 
reported all the cases to Komnas HAM in Jakarta, but according to him, no assistance was 
provided. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Representative was disturbed by reports that international human rights 
monitors and journalists entering West Papua are subject to tight restrictions and only a few are 
permitted to operate, resulting in a scarcity of information on the human rights situation in 
West Papua, mostly with regard to allegations of human rights abuses occurring in remote areas. 
It is worth noting that, despite guarantees given by the capital to allow visits to West Papua, local 
authorities often deny access. 
</p>
<p>71. The concerns of the Special Representative regarding the situation of human rights 
defenders in West Papua persist, despite the assurance to her by the Military Commander and the 
Chief of Police in Papua that there was no institutional policy to target defenders. According to 
various credible sources, an increase of military presence has been witnessed on the island, 
despite an official statement alleging the opposite. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>72. According to reliable sources, a number of human rights defenders with whom the Special 
Representative met during her visit in West Papua were threatened and intimidated during and 
after the end of the mission. On 8 June, shortly after the arrival of the Special Representative 
in Jayapura, the vehicle in which Ms. Frederika Korain and Rev. Perinus Kogoya, and 
Mr. Barthol Yomen, members of the Peace and Justice Commission for the Diocese of Jayapura 
(SKP Jayapura), were driving was hit by a car driven by intelligence officers. The Special 
Representative sent a communication about this incident on 11 July 2007. The Government 
however responded that &#8220;this incident was evidently a misunderstanding that led to no injuries of 
those involved. However, the perpetrators fled the scene with only a weak excuse to exonerate 
culpability, but apparently not before one of them had given his name and his telephone 
number&#8221;.<b>11</b> The Government later gave a detailed account of the incident, concluding that &#8220;the 
exact details of the incident [had] been changed and the events dramatized to politicize them&#8221;.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>73. On 9 June 2007, Mr. Yan Christian Warinussy, Director of LP3BH (Lembaga Penelitian, 
Pengkajian dan Pengembangan Bantuan Hukum or Institute of Research, Analysis and 
Development of Legal Aid) of Manokwari, was subjected to surveillance, and on 29 July he 
received threatening text messages on his mobile phone linking his human rights work to the 
separatist movement. The Special Representative alerted the Government about this situation in 
two communications sent on 11 July and 28 August 2007. The Government replied that &#8220;nothing 
malefic came of this incident and investigations thereafter have not thus far been able to establish 
either a clear description or the whereabouts of the alleged perpetrators&#8221;.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>74. The most worrying case is that of Mr. Albert Rumbekwan, who on 11 June 2007 received 
death threats on his mobile reportedly stating: &#8220;You who are reporting about the human rights 
situation in Papua are trying to destroy the people. You want evidence of people being killed, I 
will kill your tribe, your family and your children will become only bones to show that there is 
only a zone of peace in Papua&#8221;. The Special Representative expressed her grave concern in two 
communications addressed to the Government on 11 July and 10 August 2007. The Government 
responded that &#8220;[w]hile it is most unfortunate that these incidents should occur during the 
official visit of the Special Representative [&#8230;], it must be stressed that such incidents are not the 
norm &#8230; over the years, [Mr. Rumbekwan] has undertaken an increasingly high profile role as a 
campaigner for peace, justice and human rights in his region of West Papua &#8230; [t]his is 
something he continues to do to date as head of Komnas HAM in Papua and it should be noted 
that he has in fact received police protection and escort since he reported he was being 
harassed&#8221;.<b>14</b> While the Special Representative welcomes the granting of police protection 
following these threats, she remains concerned at reports that threats against Mr. Rumbekwan 
and his family persist, indicating that the measures taken by the police are ineffective and should 
be reinforced.

<p><b>2. Human rights defenders in Aceh: remaining concerns 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Representative visited Banda Aceh, capital of the Aceh province, on 10 
and 11 June 2007. She had the opportunity to meet with the Governor, the Provincial Chief of 
Police, the Provincial Chief of Military Command, the Provincial Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, and 
individual human rights activists. She also took part in a public forum on the human rights 
situation of women in Aceh. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Representative was greatly encouraged by the improvement in the situation of 
human rights defenders in Aceh since the signing of a peace agreement and Memorandum of 
Understanding between the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (<i>Gerakan 
Aceh Merdeka</i> - GAM) in August 2005. She was informed that the number of human rights 
organizations has since increased, that there is generally now more scope for human rights 
defenders to carry out their activities and that defenders&#8217; participation in peacebuilding 
initiatives was sought, even though it is still as a formality. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Representative, nevertheless, voices concern at the continuous interference 
with activities of human rights defenders through surveillance by intelligence agencies and 
wrongful application of law on public meetings by the police who require permission, together 
with statutes, from NGOs for organizing workshops and seminars. When permission is not 
sought, the police reportedly conduct an investigation to know the content of the meeting. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Representative stressed with the Chief of Police in Aceh the necessity to 
strictly supervise the issuance and monitoring of weapons fired in the course of policing 
demonstrations. The Special Representative requested a copy of records of violations by police 
officers during demonstrations and compensation given to victims for the last two years, and 
hopes to receive it in the near future. 
</p>
<p>79. In addition to interference, human rights defenders in Aceh are victims of stigmatization: 
in a public forum, a military commander stated that human rights defenders are &#8220;those who sell 
their own country&#8221;. Such statements should be discouraged. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Representative is further concerned at the situation of women human rights 
defenders. An overzealous implementation of sharia law has led to the delegitimization of the 
activities of women defenders. For instance, in the phase of post-tsunami reconstruction, voices 
of women regarding adequate housing were perceived as not in conformity with sharia law. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Representative is deeply perturbed by the scores of unsolved cases of human 
rights violations between 2000 and 2005. Fifteen human rights defenders in Aceh are believed to 
have been executed extrajudicially and at least five were subject to enforced disappearance. 
Several others were subjected to torture, unlawful arrest and detention, false charges and other 
forms of harassment and intimidation. No perpetrator was reportedly brought to justice. 
</p><p>82. The Special Representative is mindful that justice for past abuses is crucial for the spirit of 
human rights defenders in Aceh and throughout the country. To this end, she calls for the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>establishment of a Human Rights Court in Aceh, as provided in the peace agreement. She 
welcomes the commitment of the Chief of Military in Aceh to respect human rights, and hopes 
that such commitment will be translated into genuine cooperation in the investigations of past 
violations of human rights where the military was, allegedly, the prime perpetrator in most cases. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Representative was told by the Attorney-General in Aceh that after the signing 
of the Memorandum of Understanding, no cases of human rights violations were reported to his 
office. She deduces that the absence of such cases must imply that there is no reporting 
mechanism available for human rights defenders. Furthermore, she was surprised to hear that the 
office of the Attorney-General has had no interaction with Komnas HAM. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Since 1998, Indonesia has achieved remarkable progress towards democracy by 
notably strengthening the legal and institutional framework for the promotion of human 
rights. However, this progress has been marred by the absence of concrete measures 
dealing directly with the protection of human rights defenders as well as flaws in the 
existing legislation .There are also serious constraints on the functioning of many of the 
institutions in place and their ability to fulfil their mandates effectively. The Special 
Representative is nevertheless encouraged by the willingness within the State apparatus to 
address these shortcomings. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In the vast majority of cases of violence against human rights defenders, police and 
military forces are the perpetrators of such violence. This widely documented pattern is 
due to the strong resistance from both entities to change attitude and institutional culture. 
Human rights defenders in Indonesia and the international community are expecting that 
the Government will ensure justice in the case of Munir and that the perpetrators of this 
crime will be brought to justice. 
</b>86. <b>The Special Representative remains concerned about the situation of human rights 
defenders in West Papua and believes that their ability to defend human rights is adversely 
affected by the political conditions generated by the increased military presence in the 
province. The non-implementation of the Special Autonomy Law has heightened tensions 
that result in protest against repressive policies and targeting of human rights defenders 
who raise such issues. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>As for the situation of defenders in Aceh, the Special Representative welcomes the 
improvement of this situation, although concerns remain with regard to surveillance 
activities by law enforcement authorities, stigmatization of defenders, restrictions that 
affect the work of women human rights defenders, and the score of unresolved cases. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Representative looks forward to a sustained dialogue with the 
Government, notably by improving the ratio of responses to communications sent, and 
hopes that there will be a more uniform progress on the protection of human rights 
defenders in all parts of the country. Given its size, its population and its rich cultural 
diversity, Indonesia could set an inspiring example in the region. </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/28/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>With a view to improving the legal framework of NGOs, the Special Representative 
urges PLA Commission No. 3 on Human Rights and the Government to discuss the reform 
of Law 8/1985 as a priority. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Representative recommends that legislation and procedures be instituted 
to prevent the prosecution of human rights defenders aimed at their harassment for 
conducting activities that are legitimately a part of their function for the defence of human 
rights. For this purpose, it is important also to sensitize judicial and prosecutorial officials 
as well as the police so that human rights activities are not criminalized. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Representative notes that several cases of gross human rights violations 
brought before the Supreme Court ended up in acquittals. Prospects for successful 
prosecution of gross human rights violations would be greatly strengthened if guidelines 
and standards are laid down by the Supreme Court for effective investigation, with 
directions that compel investigation and prosecution agencies to ensure that cases are 
based on investigations conducted under those guidelines. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Representative particularly recommends that better system of 
coordination and support be created within Komnas HAM in order to ensure that regional 
representatives are able to operate effectively. They must receive full and timely support of 
the Commission if there is interference in their functioning or they are at risk in their 
regions. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Representative notes that there are no standard operating procedures 
that ensure interaction with civil society in the work of Komnas HAM. By involving civil 
society and using its expertise in inquiries, national human rights institutions would 
endorse the legitimacy of the work of human rights defenders and contribute to recognition 
of their role. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Representative further urges Komnas HAM to disseminate the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in Bhasa Indonesia throughout the country. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Representative urges the authorities to endorse the findings and 
recommendations of Komnas Perempuan, which is in need of greater visibility among the 
State apparatus. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Representative urges the Ministry for Law and Human Rights to give 
more visibility to local human rights committees and to allow interaction with human 
rights defenders whose voices should be heard before these committees. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>As regards law enforcement authorities, there is an acute need to train military and 
police officers specifically on the content of the Declaration of Human Rights Defenders. 
Heads of military and police may consider issuing clear instructions to prevent future cases 
of violations against human rights defenders and instructing commanders in the field not to 
make irresponsible comments about defenders which discredit their activities and put them 
at risk of reprisals. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Representative calls on the military to create special complaint cells for 
registering and redressing incidents of harm or threats to human rights defenders. She 
particularly welcomes the commitment made by the Chiefs of Military in West Papua and 
Aceh to establish such a mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>In the context of the Special Representative&#8217;s concern regarding surveillance 
activities against defenders carried out by intelligence personnel, she observes that in Aceh, 
many military officers are not aware that under the terms of the Memorandum of 
Understanding, surveillance of civilian activities is no longer within their sphere of 
authority. A similar trend was reported in West Papua, where the military is heavily 
engaged in surveillance activities. Democratic oversight of intelligence under laws and 
regulations fully respectful of human rights standards may protect human rights defenders 
against any abuse of law and authority. The Special Representative is concerned that the 
draft Intelligence Act may not sufficiently address the lack of accountability of intelligence 
services in order to ensure prevention of abuse. She therefore urges a review of the draft 
law to ensure its efficacy in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Representative also urges the Government to review administrative 
procedures in order to remove restrictive regulations that impede the right of defenders to 
freedom of assembly and of association. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Finally, the Special Representative calls on the Government to release the report of 
the TPF presidential fact-finding team on the killing of Mr. Munir Said Thalib and act on 
the recommendations laid down in the report.
