<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
</p>
<p>lawyers examines the protection of children&#8217;s rights in the justice system and analyses the 
essential role that must be played by judges, prosecutors and lawyers in upholding 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s human rights and applying international human rights norms, standards and 
principles at the domestic level. The Special Rapporteur endeavoured to go beyond the 
</p>
<p>more limited notion of juvenile justice, so as to reflect the diverse experiences of children 
</p>
<p>when they encounter the justice system as victims or witnesses, because they are in conflict 
</p>
<p>with the law, or as parties to judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p> Following a brief outline of the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur in 
</p>
<p>2014-2015, the thematic section of the report consists of five parts. The first sets the legal 
</p>
<p>framework and fundamental principles upon which the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s analysis of the 
requirements for a child-sensitive administration of justice is based. The second part 
</p>
<p>discusses access to justice and legal aid from the perspective of children. The safeguards 
</p>
<p>necessary to respect, protect and fulfil children&#8217;s rights at the different stages of judicial 
proceedings, including sentencing, are addressed in the third part. The fourth part touches 
</p>
<p>on the importance of providing children with alternatives to judicial proceedings. In the last 
</p>
<p>part, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the essential need for quality and specialized 
</p>
<p>education, training and capacity-building for judges, prosecutors and lawyers. Sections IV 
</p>
<p>and V contain conclusions and a number of recommendations. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that investing in child-sensitive justice is 
</p>
<p>indispensable to strengthening the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights by all, as 
</p>
<p>well as to building flourishing democratic societies. In all the aspects of the justice system, 
</p>
<p>children have special rights, needs and interests that must be given primary consideration.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the last submitted for the consideration of the Human Rights 
Council, in accordance with its resolution 26/7, by the current Special Rapporteur, Gabriela 
</p>
<p>Knaul. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur decided to focus her report on the fundamental role that 
must be played by judges, prosecutors and lawyers in protecting children&#8217;s rights. Despite 
the quasi-universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, children still 
</p>
<p>count among the most vulnerable to human rights violations and other types of abuse. For 
</p>
<p>this reason, the importance of child-sensitive justice&#8212;justice that respects, protects and 
fulfils the rights of children&#8212;cannot be overemphasized. An administration of justice that 
fails children ultimately also fails society. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that 
</p>
<p>investing in child-sensitive justice is indispensable to strengthening the rule of law and the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by all, as well as to building flourishing democratic societies. 
</p>
<p>3. After summarizing, in section II of the report, the activities she carried out in 2014 
and 2015, including country visits undertaken, communications sent and events attended, 
</p>
<p>she introduces the international legal framework and fundamental principles that form the 
</p>
<p>basis of her analysis of the requirements for a child-sensitive administration of justice 
</p>
<p>(section III, part A). In section III, part B, she discusses access to justice and legal aid from 
</p>
<p>the perspective of children. In part C, she addresses the role of judges, prosecutors and 
</p>
<p>lawyers in relation to the basic requirements necessary to respect, protect and fulfil 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights at the different stages of judicial proceedings, including sentencing. In part 
D, she touches on the importance of providing alternatives to these judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p>Before concluding and presenting her recommendations in sections IV and V, she draws 
</p>
<p>attention to the cross-cutting need for quality and specialized education, training and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building for judges, prosecutors and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>4. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers have an essential part to play in upholding 
children&#8217;s human rights and applying international human rights norms, standards and 
principles&#8212;in particular those specific to children&#8212;at the domestic level and in 
compliance with the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations. In accordance with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and for the purpose of this report, the terms &#8220;child&#8221; 
or &#8220;children&#8221; refer to every human being, male and female, under the age of 18 years. 
Further, the terms &#8220;child-friendly&#8221; and &#8220;child-sensitive&#8221; are used interchangeably and 
understood as &#8220;that takes into account children&#8217;s specific needs, views and rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities in 2014 and 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits and communications with member States 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur carried out official visits to Qatar, from 19 to 26 January 
2014 (A/HRC/29/26/Add.1), the United Arab Emirates, from 28 January to 5 February 
</p>
<p>2014 (A/HRC/29/26/Add.2), Tunisia, from 27 November to 5 December 2014 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/26/Add.3) and Portugal, from 27 January to 3 February 2015 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/26/Add.4), at the invitation of the respective Governments. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Governments of France, Germany, 
Greece, Iraq, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Spain and the United States of America for inviting 
</p>
<p>her to conduct official visits in their respective countries. She regrets that she was unable to 
</p>
<p>undertake the visits before the end of her mandate and encourages these Governments to 
</p>
<p>continue engaging with her successor. </p>


<p>7. Between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015 inclusive, she sent a total of 117 
communications alleging violations of human rights in the context of her mandate to 54 
</p>
<p>Member States. Of these communications, 86 were urgent appeals and the remaining 31 
</p>
<p>were letters of allegation. Details of the communications and responses from Governments 
</p>
<p>are included in the communications reports of special procedures (A/HRC/27/72, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/28/85 and A/HRC/29/50). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>8. From 27 April to 1 May 2014, the Special Rapporteur attended the sixty-third 
session of the General Assembly of the Latin American Federation of Judges and the 
</p>
<p>annual meeting of the Ibero-American Group of the International Association of Judges in 
</p>
<p>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where she delivered a statement on the current 
</p>
<p>challenges to the independence of the judiciary and the importance of promoting capacity-
</p>
<p>building activities in international human rights law for judges. 
</p>
<p>9. On 8 and 9 May 2014, she participated in an international symposium on justice and 
the rule of law organized by the Y&#252;kselKark&#305;nK&#252;&#231;&#252;k Attorney Partnership in Istanbul, 
Turkey, at which she delivered a speech on the various forms of interference, pressures and 
</p>
<p>attacks against the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>10. On 11 June 2014, she participated as a panellist in a side event of the Human Rights 
Council session entitled &#8220;Strengthening the rule of law in Venezuela&#8221;, organized by the 
International Commission of Jurists and the International Bar Association&#8217;s Human Rights 
Institute. 
</p>
<p>11. On 13 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur presented her annual thematic report to the 
Human Rights Council, which addressed judicial accountability (A/HRC/26/32) and the 
</p>
<p>report on her official visit to the Russian Federation (A/HRC/26/32/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>12. On 18 June 2014, she participated in an event entitled &#8220;Independence of the

Phnom Penh. 
</p>
<p>14. On 23 October 2014, she presented her annual thematic report to the Third 
Committee of the General Assembly. The report highlighted the need to promote justice 
</p>
<p>and the rule of law in the post-2015 development agenda and called for explicit references 
</p>
<p>to access to and the administration of justice in the post-2015 sustainable development 
</p>
<p>goals and targets. 
</p>
<p>15. From 29 October to 2 November 2014, she participated in the 58th Congress of the 
International Association of Lawyers, in Florence, Italy. 
</p>
<p>16. On 24 November 2014, she took part in an expert consultation entitled &#8220;Human 
rights considerations relating to the administration of justice through military tribunals and 
</p>
<p>role of the integral judicial system in combating human rights violations&#8221;. At the 
consultation, which was organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/4, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur presented the findings of her 2013 report to the General Assembly on the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice through military tribunals (A/68/285).  
</p>
<p>17. On 12 December 2014, she was the keynote speaker at the International Human 
Rights Day Lecture, which was organized in Harare by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO 
</p>
<p>Forum and Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights. </p>


<p><b> III. </b>Protecting children&#8217;s rights in the justice system<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework and fundamental principles 
</b></p>
<p>18. A number of international human rights treaties and instruments address issues 
related to access to justice and to an effective remedy, the treatment and rights of persons 
</p>
<p>before the courts and in judicial and administrative proceedings, and the independence of 
</p>
<p>the judicial system and the legal profession. Some of these instruments are applicable to all 
</p>
<p>without distinction, including on the basis of age. A number of them provide child-specific 
</p>
<p>guarantees and protection. Other instruments are exclusively dedicated to children. 
</p>
<p>19. The instruments referred to throughout the present report, and which form the basis 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s analysis, are mentioned below. They do not represent an 
exhaustive list. Special attention is given to the provisions of the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child and the fundamental principles it contains. The rights and principles contained 
</p>
<p>in the Convention should always be taken into account by judges, prosecutors and lawyers 
</p>
<p>alike when performing any of their professional functions where children are concerned. 
</p>
<p>20. Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights establishes that 
&#8220;all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals&#8221; and that &#8220;everyone shall be 
entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 
</p>
<p>established by law&#8221;. Article 14 also details a series of due-process guarantees for persons 
charged with a criminal offence and, in this context, it explicitly stipulates that &#8220;in the case 
of juvenile persons, the procedure shall be such as will take account of their age and the 
</p>
<p>desirability of promoting their rehabilitation&#8221;. In its general comment No. 32, the Human 
Rights Committee recognized that &#8220;juveniles need special protection&#8221; and recommended 
that States take measures &#8220;to establish an appropriate juvenile criminal justice system, in 
order to ensure that juveniles are treated in a manner commensurate with their age&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p>21. Other relevant international human rights instruments include the following: Basic 
Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary (1985); United Nations Standard Minimum 
</p>
<p>Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (1985) (the Beijing Rules); Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles on the Role of Lawyers (1990); Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors (1990); 
</p>
<p>United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (1990) (the 
</p>
<p>Havana Rules); Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System (1997); 
</p>
<p>Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (2002); Basic Principles on the Use of Restorative 
</p>
<p>Justice Programmes in Criminal Matters (2002); Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving 
</p>
<p>Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (2005); United Nations Rules for the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (2010) (the Bangkok 
</p>
<p>Rules); and the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in 
</p>
<p>Criminal Justice Systems (2012). 
</p>
<p><b>  Convention on the Rights of the Child and its four fundamental principles 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines a series of guarantees relevant 
to the specific protection due to children who come into contact with the justice system. Of 
</p>
<p>particular relevance to the present report is article 40 of the Convention, which recognizes 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal 
law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child&#8217;s sense of dignity 
and worth&#8221; and that takes into account &#8220;the child&#8217;s age&#8221;. Article 40 lists a series of due-
process guarantees, some of which provide for additional protection due to children. In 
</p>
<p>addition, article 12 states that children shall be provided &#8220;the opportunity to be heard in any 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 General comment No. 32 (2007) on the right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, 
</p>
<p>paras. 42 and 43. </p>


<p>judicial and administrative proceedings affecting&#8221; them. Finally, article 3 underlines that 
&#8220;the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration&#8221; in all actions concerning 
children, including when undertaken by courts of law. As far as it grants broader protection 
</p>
<p>to children, the Special Rapporteur considers that the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>should be considered and applied as <i>lex specialis</i>. 
</p>
<p>23. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has identified four general principles 
enshrined in the Convention2 which must be taken into account for interpreting and 
</p>
<p>implementing all the rights of the child, in particular when judges, prosecutors and lawyers 
</p>
<p>are considering matters affecting children. They are the rights to non-discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>right to life and development, the right to be heard and the primary consideration of the 
</p>
<p>child&#8217;s best interests. In its general comment No. 10 on children&#8217;s rights in juvenile justice, 
the Committee explained that these, together with the notion of dignity, are leading 
</p>
<p>principles essential to a comprehensive policy on juvenile justice. 
</p>
<p>24. The principle of non-discrimination is especially relevant when justice systems are 
dealing with particularly vulnerable groups of children, such as street children, children 
</p>
<p>belonging to minorities, migrant children or asylum seekers, children with disabilities, or 
</p>
<p>child soldiers, who may require particular attention, protection and skills from the 
</p>
<p>professionals interacting with them, especially lawyers, prosecutors and judges. 
</p>
<p>25. The best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in all decisions 
taken within the context of the administration of justice for children. Concretely, this  
</p>
<p>means that those with decision-making power in the justice system&#8212;in particular lawyers, 
prosecutors and judges&#8212;must be aware of this obligation and comply with it by evaluating 
what the best interests of the child are in each individual case presented to them. As pointed 
</p>
<p>out by the Committee, &#8220;the protection of the best interests of the child means, for instance, 
that the traditional objectives of criminal justice, such as repression/retribution, must give 
</p>
<p>way to rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in dealing with child offenders&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>26. The child&#8217;s right to life and development is particularly pertinent when judges are 
considering sentences in criminal cases involving children. Indeed, deprivation of liberty 
</p>
<p>&#8220;has very negative consequences for the child&#8217;s harmonious development and seriously 
hampers his/her reintegration in society&#8221;.4 For this reason, the Convention dictates that it 
should be used only as a measure of last resort. Other types of sanctions can also seriously 
</p>
<p>affect children&#8217;s development and, for this reason, in these cases too, prosecutors and 
judges should bear in mind the necessity to respect the development of the child. 
</p>
<p>27. Finally, the Committee explained that &#8220;the right of the child to express his/her views 
freely in all matters affecting the child should be fully respected and implemented 
</p>
<p>throughout every stage of the process of juvenile justice&#8221;.5 Lawyers have an essential part 
to play in facilitating children&#8217;s right to be heard, provided they have the required skills to 
listen to children&#8217;s views and represent them appropriately. The justice system itself 
nevertheless needs to be designed in such a way as to provide adequate opportunities for 
</p>
<p>children to be heard and express their views. Judges also should be sensitized to this 
</p>
<p>fundamental principle, as they are often on the receiving end of information provided 
</p>
<p>during judicial proceedings and make their decisions based on this information.  
</p>

<p><b> B. </b>Children&#8217;s access to justice and legal aid<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to justice for children 
</b></p>
<p>28. As defined by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), access to 
justice is the ability of people to seek and obtain remedy through formal or informal 
</p>
<p>institutions of justice, and in conformity with human rights standards.6 Access to justice 
</p>
<p>constitutes both a fundamental human right in itself and the means of enforcing or restoring 
</p>
<p>the exercise of rights that have been disregarded or violated (A/69/294, para. 50 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/8/4, para. 17). 
</p>
<p>29. As previously underlined by the Special Rapporteur, the lack of access to justice has 
serious consequences for the full enjoyment of human rights. In turn, fair and effective 
</p>
<p>justice systems, able to provide people with effective redress and adequate remedies, 
</p>
<p>constitute the most efficient way to ensure a sense of safety, stability and prosperity, by 
</p>
<p>reducing the risks associated with violence and abuses of rights and by deterring 
</p>
<p>perpetrators from committing further violations (A/69/294, para. 52). 
</p>
<p>30. As children are particularly vulnerable to violations of their rights and to abuses of 
all sorts, their access to justice should be facilitated and reinforced. In reality, while many 
</p>
<p>obstacles impede both adults&#8217; and children&#8217;s access to justice, children are often 
disproportionately affected. They also face specific barriers owing to their status as minors. 
</p>
<p>31. Various factors and circumstances impede appropriate and equal access to justice for 
children; they can be clustered in six categories. First, children can face physical barriers, 
</p>
<p>which include geographical distance from courts or other relevant institutions or lack of 
</p>
<p>adequate facilities at those institutions&#8217; premises. Second, psychological factors can also 
play an important role in undermining children&#8217;s access to justice. Children may be unable 
or reluctant to seek justice because they are too young or too traumatized to articulate what 
</p>
<p>happened to them; or they are afraid of, dependent on or love the alleged perpetrator(s); or 
</p>
<p>they do not perceive what happened to them as a violation of their rights. Third, children 
</p>
<p>also face social and/or cultural barriers when trying to access justice; these can be related to 
</p>
<p>their difficulties to communicate, fear of social stigma associated with the formal justice 
</p>
<p>system, dependency on adults, or mistrust of the justice system. 
</p>
<p>32. Fourth, barriers relating to information also seriously hamper access to justice for 
children. Information on fundamental rights, available remedies and procedures to follow to 
</p>
<p>claim their rights is not always available and, when available, often difficult to understand, 
</p>
<p>even for adults. Fifth, while children lack financial autonomy and means, court proceedings 
</p>
<p>often represent a heavy financial burden, as can the costs of initiating and pursuing 
</p>
<p>proceedings, including lawyers&#8217; fees. Lastly, children encounter legal obstacles on their 
path to justice, such as lack of legal capacity or standing, lack of legal identity (especially 
</p>
<p>relevant for children who are unregistered migrants, refugees or asylum seekers, or street 
</p>
<p>children), or dependence on parents or a legal guardian. Dependence on adults often 
</p>
<p>compounds the other obstacles for children trying to access justice. 
</p>
<p>33. Guaranteeing children the right to equal access to justice means making special 
provisions for them and offering them differentiated protection. As stated by the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;children&#8217;s special and dependent status creates real difficulties for them in 
pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights. So States need to give particular 
</p>
<p>attention to ensuring that there are effective child-sensitive procedures available to 
</p>
<p>children and their representatives. These should include the provision of child-

<p>and other assistance&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur wishes to point out that, while this report focuses mainly on 
issues related to the formal justice system, in its broadest sense, the concept of access to 
</p>
<p>justice involves not only access to the judicial system, but also access to other procedures, 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and institutions able to assist individuals to claim their rights, including 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions, ombudsmen or mediation institutions (A/69/294, 
</p>
<p>para. 53 and A/62/207, para. 38). Concerns and recommendations formulated with regard to 
</p>
<p>the administration of the formal justice system are often relevant, mutatis mutandis, when it 
</p>
<p>comes to these other avenues for redress and remedy. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child-friendly legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>35. The right to access justice is inextricably connected to the right to legal assistance. 
As highlighted in previous reports, the purpose of legal aid is &#8220;to contribute to the 
elimination of obstacles and barriers that impair or restrict access to justice by providing 
</p>
<p>assistance to people who would otherwise be unable to afford legal representation and 
</p>
<p>access to the court system&#8221; (A/HRC/23/43, para. 27). Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur 
has advocated for a definition of legal aid that is as broad as possible, including &#8220;not only 
the right to free legal assistance in criminal proceedings, as defined in article 14 (3) (d) of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but also the provision of effective 
</p>
<p>legal assistance in any judicial or extrajudicial procedure aimed at determining rights and 
</p>
<p>obligations&#8221;(ibid). A broad definition and application of legal aid is all the more important 
when dealing with children and children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>36. As already noted by the Special Rapporteur, legal systems can be immensely 
confusing and difficult, if not impossible, to navigate for children, especially without the 
</p>
<p>help of a legal professional. &#8220;Legal assistance provides children with the means to 
understand legal proceedings, to defend their rights and to make their voices heard&#8221; 
(A/HRC/23/43, para. 84). The right of children to have access to legal assistance is 
</p>
<p>recognized in a number of international instruments, including the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child (in particular, in articles 12 and 40), and the Principles and Guidelines 
</p>
<p>on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems.  
</p>
<p>37. In its general comment No. 10, the Committee on the Rights of the Child further 
explained that, when preparing his/her defence, a child in conflict with the law must be 
</p>
<p>guaranteed free and appropriate legal and other appropriate assistance.8 Indeed, by virtue of 
</p>
<p>their age, dependent status and economic circumstances most children are unable to pay for 
</p>
<p>legal aid. The Special Rapporteur considers that given this reality, &#8220;children must have 
access to free legal assistance in criminal and in civil proceedings and administrative fees 
</p>
<p>must be waived&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p>38. As noted in a 2011 study, &#8220;the provision of timely, competent, and developmentally 
appropriate legal assistance directly advances a child&#8217;s right to a fair, just, and participatory 
legal process. Child-friendly legal aid also has the potential to promote children&#8217;s 
substantive rights&#8221;.10 In this respect, lawyers have a professional responsibility towards 
children and should therefore acquire the special skills to be able to take into account the 
</p>
<p>unique attributes and needs of child clients and effectively deliver child-friendly legal aid. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 8 General comment No. 10 (2007), para. 49.

(UNODC), <i>Child-Friendly Legal Aid in Africa</i> (2011), p. 11. 
</p>
<p> 10 Ibid, p. 24. </p>


<p>39. The Special Rapporteur believes it is essential that States adopt special measures to 
ensure children&#8217;s meaningful access to legal aid that address their special needs and take 
into account their best interests.11 Such measures should prioritize legal aid for children and 
</p>
<p>should render legal aid &#8220;accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary, effective and 
responsive to the specific legal and social needs of children&#8221;.
</p>
<p> 12 
</p>
<p>40. For this purpose, lawyers&#8217; codes of conduct should provide specific guidance 
regarding the representation of children (including concerning the nature of the relationship 
</p>
<p>between the lawyer and child and the possible conflict between the duty of representation 
</p>
<p>and the duty to act in the child&#8217;s best interest). Lawyers must be aware that they represent 
exclusively the interests of the child and not the interests of other persons, such as parents, 
</p>
<p>institutions or bodies. They should be trained in children&#8217;s law and in child and adolescent 
development and able to communicate effectively with children and their legal guardians. 
</p>
<p>41. As noted in a previous report, where there is a shortage of qualified lawyers, &#8220;the 
provision of legal aid services may also include non-lawyers or paralegals&#8221; (A/HRC/23/43, 
para. 56). According to the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal 
</p>
<p>Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, the role played by paralegals in providing legal aid 
</p>
<p>services where access to lawyers is limited should be recognized by the State. 
</p>
<p>42. Paralegals can complement the work of lawyers or work independently providing 
legal assistance that does not need to be provided by a lawyer. They could be paid 
</p>
<p>professionals, but in many societies they are volunteers. Paralegals can often provide an 
</p>
<p>essential link to the communities and groups they serve, as they often come from these very 
</p>
<p>communities and they often know first-hand the language, the culture and the conditions in 
</p>
<p>which the communities live and function, and the particular legal challenges they are 
</p>
<p>facing. Using paralegals to deliver legal services and supplement the work of lawyers can 
</p>
<p>prove extremely cost-effective. 
</p>
<p>43. Paralegals are often in a better position than lawyers to provide legal services 
tailored to the needs of specific communities and groups. In many countries, lawyers can be 
</p>
<p>unaware of those specific needs, or even worse they may be uninterested in dealing with the 
</p>
<p>specific communities. In a large number of countries, qualified lawyers are simply lacking. 
</p>
<p>Under all these circumstances and more, paralegals can play an important role in bridging 
</p>
<p>the gaps between the communities and the judicial system, thereby contributing to 
</p>
<p>increased access to justice. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that when use is made of paralegals, 
national legislation should ensure that minimum quality standards for their services are met 
</p>
<p>and that the types of legal services they may provide are specified. For this purpose 
</p>
<p>paralegals must be given appropriate training opportunities and, in some cases, operate 
</p>
<p>under the supervision of a qualified lawyer (A/HRC/23/43, para. 56). In particular, 
</p>
<p>paralegals &#8220;must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the various legal aspects 
of the process of juvenile justice and must be trained to work with children in conflict with 
</p>
<p>the law&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Informal justice systems 
</b></p>
<p>45. In many parts of the world, informal justice systems  &#8220;form a key part of 
individuals&#8217; and communities&#8217; experience of justice and the rule of law, with over 80 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems 
</p>
<p>include a list of special measures for the provision of legal aid to children, paras. 53&#8211;59.  
 12 Ibid. para. 35. 
</p>
<p> 13 General comment No. 10 (2007), para. 49. </p>


<p>percent of disputes resolved through informal justice mechanisms in some countries&#8221;.14 
Informal justice systems encompass many mechanisms of differing degrees and forms of 
</p>
<p>formality, whether or not their role is officially recognized by the State. These informal 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, whose role often includes the resolution of disputes and the regulation of 
</p>
<p>conduct by adjudication or assistance to a third party, include tribal, culture and religion-
</p>
<p>based courts and often exist side by side with the formal justice system. 
</p>
<p>46. In many contexts, such informal justice systems &#8220;deal with issues that have a direct 
bearing on the best interests of women and children, such as issues of customary marriage, 
</p>
<p>custody, dissolution of marriage, inheritance and property rights&#8221;.15 Yet, little research 
seems to have been done on the issues arising when children enter into contact with 
</p>
<p>informal justice systems.16 
</p>
<p>47. People reach out to informal justice systems rather than the formal one for diverse 
reasons. Informal justice systems are often more accessible, comprehensible, familiar and 
</p>
<p>affordable, and less formal. Informal justice systems are also often seen as providing for 
</p>
<p>potentially quicker and less expensive remedies, which are perceived as more in accordance 
</p>
<p>with specific cultural, religious or other traditional values and beliefs. Contrary to formal 
</p>
<p>justice systems, informal justice systems&#8217; outcomes are also often perceived as emphasizing 
reconciliation, restoration, compensation and reintegration rather than custodial sanctions. 
</p>
<p>48. Informal justice systems nevertheless present extremely worrying aspects, in 
particular when it comes to the treatment of children. In reality, many informal justice 
</p>
<p>systems reinforce existing societal or structural discrimination and power relations, in 
</p>
<p>particular to the detriment of children, women and various minorities. In particular, in many 
</p>
<p>societies, traditional values attribute little or no importance to the opinions and wishes of 
</p>
<p>children, and, as a result, many informal justice systems ignore the rights of children, 
</p>
<p>especially the rights to be heard in matters that affect them and to have their best interests 
</p>
<p>protected.  
</p>
<p>49. It is important to recall that &#8220;such courts cannot hand down binding judgements 
recognized by the State unless the proceedings are limited to minor matters, they meet the 
</p>
<p>basic requirements of fair trial and other procedural guarantees, and their judgements are 
</p>
<p>validated by State courts and can be challenged by the parties concerned in a procedure 
</p>
<p>meeting the requirements of article 14 of the Covenant&#8221; (A/HRC/8/4, para. 38).17 
Judgements that do not conform to international human rights standards are simply not 
</p>
<p>acceptable. It is essential to ensure that international human rights norms and standards 
</p>
<p>concerning children are known and applied by informal justice systems, as the obligation to 
</p>
<p>respect, protect and fulfil human rights extends to them as well. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Child-sensitive adjudication 
</b></p>
<p>50. Notwithstanding the abundance of international treaties, rules, guidelines and 
principles that exist to protect children&#8217;s rights, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
treatment of children in judicial proceedings, both civil and criminal, is generally 
</p>
<p>unsatisfactory. Justice systems are too often not adapted to integrate adequate consideration 
</p>
<p>of children&#8217;s rights. Judges and prosecutors often do not take children&#8217;s cases, views or best 
interests seriously, and children&#8217;s lawyers are often unequipped to represent them in a 
proper manner. It is unacceptable that children who come into contact with the justice 
</p>
<p>system are often victimized or re-victimized. 
</p>

</p>
<p> 16 Ibid., p. 12. 
</p>
<p> 17 See also Human Rights Committee general comment No. 32 (2007). </p>


<p>51. Against this backdrop, the importance of designing, developing and strengthening 
justice systems that are sensitive to children&#8217;s needs, rights, well-being and best interests 
cannot be overemphasized. A child-friendly or child-sensitive justice system must 
</p>
<p>guarantee the effective implementation of all children&#8217;s rights, while giving due 
consideration to the child&#8217;s level of maturity and understanding. In particular, child-
sensitive justice must be &#8220;accessible, age appropriate, speedy, diligent, adapted to and 
focused on the needs and rights of the child, respecting the rights of the child including the 
</p>
<p>rights to due process, to participate in and to understand the proceedings, to respect for 
</p>
<p>private and family life and to integrity and dignity&#8221;.18 
</p>
<p>52. In consonance with the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the opinion that the scope of child-sensitive justice should extend to &#8220;all 
relevant judicial proceedings affecting the child, without limitation, including, for example, 
</p>
<p>separation of parents, custody, care and adoption, children in conflict with the law, child 
</p>
<p>victims of physical or psychological violence, sexual abuse or other crimes, health care, 
</p>
<p>social security, unaccompanied children, asylum-seeking and refugee children, and victims 
</p>
<p>of armed conflict and other emergencies&#8221;.19 
</p>
<p>53. As the Special Rapporteur has recalled on countless occasions, judges, prosecutors 
and lawyers are in a privileged position and have a particular responsibility to ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of both human rights and the rule of law. In particular, judges 
</p>
<p>have a proactive duty to ensure that they uphold international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>standards at all stages of court proceedings. To be able to make appropriate decisions on 
</p>
<p>matters concerning children and uphold their rights, judges, lawyers and prosecutors must 
</p>
<p>have received specialized training. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Children in conflict with the law 
</b></p>
<p>54. While the State is entitled to seek justice from children alleged to or accused of 
having infringed the penal law, it still has obligations with regard to ensuring that their 
</p>
<p>treatment in the justice system is fair. The Special Rapporteur deplores that too often justice 
</p>
<p>systems, and in particular criminal justice systems, are designed for adults and have not 
</p>
<p>integrated the specific procedural safeguards due to children. 
</p>
<p>55. At a very minimum, every child alleged as or accused of having infringed the penal 
law shall be granted the guarantees enumerated in article 40, paragraph 2 (a) and (b), of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child. While some of these guarantees are generally 
</p>
<p>established in international human rights law, in particular in article 14 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, other guarantees are granted to children because of 
</p>
<p>their specific status as minors. 
</p>
<p>56. For instance, the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that a child has the 
right to be informed of the charges against him or her including &#8220;through his or her parents 
or legal guardians&#8221; and the right to legal &#8220;or other appropriate&#8221; assistance. It also provides 
that children must also be tried &#8220;without delay&#8221;, while the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights requires that they be tried &#8220;without undue delay&#8221;. This means that the 
swiftness of the proceedings is especially important and implies that children have 
</p>
<p>particularly prompt access to legal counsel. Parents or guardians of a child are normally 
</p>
<p>entitled to participate in the proceedings but, depending on the best interests of the child, 
</p>
<p>they may either be required to attend hearings or be excluded from participation.20 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>II (c). 
</p>
<p> 19 General comment No. 12, para. 32. 
</p>
<p> 20 Beijing Rules, rule 15.2. </p>


<p>57. There is also a particular need to protect children&#8217;s right to privacy. As stated in the 
Beijing Rules, &#8220;the juvenile&#8217;s right to privacy shall be respected at all stages in order to 
avoid harm being caused to her or him by undue publicity or by the process of labelling. In 
</p>
<p>principle, no information that may lead to the identification of a juvenile offender shall be 
</p>
<p>published&#8221; (rules 8.1 and 8.2). The right of children to privacy therefore justifies an 
exception to the fundamental principle that court proceedings shall be held in public. 
</p>
<p>58. States have an obligation to seek to &#8220;establish an effective organization for the 
administration of juvenile justice, and a comprehensive juvenile justice system&#8221; through 
&#8220;laws, procedures, authorities and institutions specifically applicable to children in conflict 
with the penal law&#8221;.21 The Committee on the Rights of the Child explained that &#8220;a 
comprehensive juvenile justice system further requires the establishment of specialized 
</p>
<p>units within &#8230; the judiciary, the court system, the prosecutor&#8217;s office&#8221;, inter alia, as well as 
&#8220;specialized defenders or other representatives who provide legal or other appropriate 
assistance to the child&#8221;.22 The Special Rapporteur notes that specialized juvenile courts 
improve consistency, efficiency, coordination and respect for children&#8217;s rights within the 
administration of justice. Specialized juvenile courts will not only improve how the justice 
</p>
<p>system works for children but also allow judges, prosecutors, lawyers and judicial 
</p>
<p>personnel to increase their expertise in working with children. 
</p>
<p>59. International human rights law requires that States establish a minimum age of 
criminal responsibility under which a child cannot be held accountable for his or her acts. 
</p>
<p>While the Convention on the Rights of the Child does not provide a specific age, it says that 
</p>
<p>the minimum age should reflect the mental capacity and moral competence of the child. 
</p>
<p>According to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the age of 12 years constitutes the  
</p>
<p>absolute minimum age of criminal responsibility.23 While the Special Rapporteur agrees 
</p>
<p>that 12 years is an absolute minimum, she strongly believes that States should seriously 
</p>
<p>consider increasing the minimum age of criminal responsibility as high as possible, in line 
</p>
<p>with the latest available scientific research carried out on the subject of child mental 
</p>
<p>development and competence. 
</p>
<p>60. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned about cases where 
children are tried as adults. Indeed, under some jurisdictions, for certain types of serious 
</p>
<p>offences, while there exist a juvenile justice system and a legal framework applicable to 
</p>
<p>child offenders, children can be tried as adults in the regular justice system. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur believes that the possibility of trying children as adults not only goes against the 
</p>
<p>essence of the rights contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but also allows 
</p>
<p>unacceptable room for arbitrariness. The decision to try a child as an adult is often left to 
</p>
<p>the discretion of the court or a judge, who are certainly not qualified to assess whether a 
</p>
<p>child has reached a level of mental development and discernment sufficient to be tried as an 
</p>
<p>adult. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Children</b>&#8217;s<b> participation as victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p>61. As highlighted by the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and 
Witnesses of Crime, &#8220;age should not be a barrier to a child&#8217;s right to participate fully in the 
justice process&#8221;.24  For that reason, &#8220;every child should be treated as a capable witness, 
subject to examination, and his or her testimony should not be presumed invalid or 
</p>
<p>untrustworthy by reason of the child&#8217;s age alone as long as his or her age and maturity 
allow the giving of intelligible and credible testimony, with or without communication aids 
</p>

</p>
<p> 24 Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20 of 22 July 2005, annex, para 18.  </p>


<p>and other assistance&#8221;.25 The right of a child to participate in the justice process is not 
limited to criminal trials, but extends to civil proceedings such as those relating to divorce 
</p>
<p>and separation, custody, care, adoption and inheritance matters. 
</p>
<p>62. The participation of children as either victims or witnesses in judicial proceedings 
can have a negative psychological impact on them, which is exacerbated when they have to 
</p>
<p>go through insensitive treatment and procedures that do not integrate respect for their well-
</p>
<p>being and dignity and do not take into account their special needs and rights. In addition, 
</p>
<p>participation in criminal proceedings often carries a non-negligible level of risk for both the 
</p>
<p>physical and psychological integrity of the child. Special measures must therefore be put in 
</p>
<p>place to protect child victims and witnesses from victimization or re-victimization in the 
</p>
<p>justice system. 
</p>
<p>63. As already explained by the Special Rapporteur in the context of an analysis of the 
rights of women in the criminal justice system, &#8220;at minimum, two sets of protection 
measures are necessary to enable witnesses and victims to come forward safely for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of collaborating with the criminal justice system: (a) measures and procedures put 
</p>
<p>in place by the judicial authorities while investigating crimes or taking testimony in the 
</p>
<p>courtroom; (b) protection measures and safeguards provided, when necessary, before, 
</p>
<p>during and after judicial proceedings through formal witness protection programmes&#8221; 
(A/66/289, para. 64). 
</p>
<p>64. The following are examples of measures that can be taken during trials concerning 
children:  
</p>
<p>(a) Limit the number of interviews and statements given by the child, including by 
using video recording; 
</p>
<p>(b) Have the child testify in a separate courtroom; excluding the public from the court 
for part or the entirety of a trial; 
</p>
<p>(c) Make separate waiting rooms available for children;  
</p>
<p>(d) Limit the direct cross-examination by the alleged perpetrator; 
</p>
<p>(e) Prohibit the publication or dissemination of information that might reveal the 
identity of a victim or witness; 
</p>
<p>(f)   Adjust questioning so as to eliminate unnecessary, intrusive, repetitive or 
embarrassing questions; 
</p>
<p>(g) Allow for frequent breaks during the testimony, altering the courtroom settings to 
make them less formal; 
</p>
<p>(h) Use a support person during testimony.  
</p>
<p>Needs may differ depending on the gender of the child, in which case measures will have to 
</p>
<p>be tailored to take the specificities into account. 
</p>
<p>65. The Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of 
Crime require that &#8220;where child victims and witnesses may be the subject of intimidation, 
threats or harm, appropriate conditions should be put in place to ensure the safety of the 
</p>
<p>child&#8221; (para.14). In this context, the existence of witness and victims protection 
programmes tailored to children&#8217;s needs will provide for a more enabling environment for 
the reporting of cases, encouraging cooperation with the justice system and avoiding the re-
</p>
<p>victimization of children throughout the judicial process. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 Ibid. </p>


<p>66. It is essential to remember that all processes in which a child is heard and 
participates must be voluntary, transparent, informative and respectful, be set in a child-
</p>
<p>friendly environment and use child-sensitive methods.26 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Deprivation of liberty and other types of sanctions 
</b></p>
<p>67. As seen above, because of their unique vulnerability, children in conflict with the 
law require higher standards and broader safeguards to be applied to them, particularly at 
</p>
<p>the sentencing stage in criminal proceedings. For instance, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>recognized that article 24, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, which grants children the right to special protection measures owing to their status 
</p>
<p>as minors, &#8220;entails the adoption of special measures to protect the personal liberty and 
security of every child, in addition to the measures generally required by article 9 for 
</p>
<p>everyone&#8221;.27 
</p>
<p>68. While criminal sanctions can encompass a broad range of measures, the Special 
Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the situation of children deprived of their liberty 
</p>
<p>as a result of a criminal trial. Indeed, in a recent report, the Special Rapporteur on torture 
</p>
<p>and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment highlighted that &#8220;children 
deprived of their liberty are at a heightened risk of violence, abuse and acts of torture or 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;. He further stated that &#8220;even very 
short periods of detention can undermine a child&#8217;s psychological and physical well-being 
and compromise cognitive development. Children deprived of liberty are at a heightened 
</p>
<p>risk of suffering depression and anxiety, and frequently exhibit symptoms consistent with 
</p>
<p>post-traumatic stress disorder&#8221;.28 Finally, he  noted that a number of studies had shown that, 
&#8220;regardless of the conditions in which children are held, detention has a profound and 
negative impact on child health and development&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>69. According to the Havana Rules, deprivation of children&#8217;s liberty should be limited to 
exceptional cases. The Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that a child may be 
</p>
<p>deprived of his or her liberty only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest period of 
</p>
<p>time possible (art. 37). It further stipulates that any decision to deprive a child of liberty 
</p>
<p>must be subject to periodic review of its continuing necessity and appropriateness.30 
</p>
<p>Finally, &#8220;the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in every decision to 
initiate or continue the deprivation&#8221;.31 
</p>
<p>70. It is essential, therefore, that judges in particular, but also prosecutors, be aware of 
the specific negative effects the criminal sanctions they can order may have on children, in 
</p>
<p>particular sanctions involving deprivation of liberty. Prosecutors and judges must primarily 
</p>
<p>consider the best interests of the child when requesting and imposing sanctions on children 
</p>
<p>and this includes making an individual analysis of the circumstances of both the offence 
</p>
<p>and the child. Prosecutors and lawyers should always first consider alternative measures to 
</p>
<p>detention, such as care, guidance and supervision orders, counselling, probation, foster care, 
</p>
<p>education and vocational training programmes, to ensure that children are treated with full 
</p>
<p>respect for their needs and rights, as well as for their well-being and development.32 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that some types of sanctions are forbidden 
under international law when it comes to their application to persons who were children at 
</p>
<p>the time of the offence. She concurs with the Special Rapporteur on torture, who pointed

<p>out that the sentencing to death of juveniles is not only forbidden under international law 
</p>
<p>but has also been accepted so universally as a serious violation of human rights that it must 
</p>
<p>be considered a norm of <i>jus cogens</i>.33 Life sentences with the possibility of release or parole 
</p>
<p>are also expressly prohibited under international human rights law.34 
</p>
<p>72. Judges and prosecutors must also apply the principle of the best interests of the child 
in the context of pretrial detention. On many occasions, the Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>observed that pretrial detention was the rule rather than the exception, in contradiction of 
</p>
<p>principles of international law. This situation is particularly worrying when children are 
</p>
<p>held in pretrial detention. She therefore calls on the competent authorities to be extremely 
</p>
<p>vigilant when imposing pretrial detention on children, which, as in instances of deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty ordered at the end of a trial, they must justify in writing, having shown that they 
</p>
<p>took into account the child&#8217;s special needs, rights and best interests. 
</p>
<p>73. Children are also detained for other reasons than as the result of a criminal trial. This 
is the case of migrant or asylum-seeking children. Article 9, paragraph 4, of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that anyone who is deprived 
</p>
<p>of their liberty by arrest or detention is entitled to have the lawfulness of their detention 
</p>
<p>reviewed before a court. Thus, in exercising this judicial oversight competence, judges also 
</p>
<p>have to take into account the best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Criminal sanctions against parents 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the situation of children whose 
parents have been sentenced to imprisonment. As recognized by the African Committee of 
</p>
<p>Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, children may face many violations of their 
</p>
<p>rights when their parents or primary care giver come into conflict with the law, including 
</p>
<p>stigmatization by association and harm caused by the separation.35 Children whose parents 
</p>
<p>are imprisoned also often experience deterioration in their living conditions, their 
</p>
<p>relationships with others and their community, and their physical and mental integrity. 
</p>
<p>75. For this reason, the Bangkok Rules provide that &#8220;non-custodial sentences for 
pregnant women and women with dependent children shall be preferred where possible and 
</p>
<p>appropriate&#8221; (rule 64). Article 30 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the 
Child states that &#8220;special treatment&#8221; should be provided to &#8220;expectant mothers and to 
mothers of infants and young children who have been accused or found guilty of infringing 
</p>
<p>the penal law&#8221;. In its general comment No. 1 (2013) on article 30, the African Committee 
of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child asserted that the provisions of article 30 
</p>
<p>apply not only to mothers, but also to the primary caregivers, who may be the father, 
</p>
<p>another member of the family or a foster parent.36 The Special Rapporteur considers that 
</p>
<p>prosecutors, when requesting sanctions against parents&#8212;and judges, when imposing such 
sanctions&#8212;have a responsibility to consider not only the individual circumstances of the 
defendant, but also the best interests of the defendant&#8217;s children. 
</p>
<p>76. Children who are living in prison with their parents, usually their mother, are 
particularly vulnerable to violations of their right to development, health care, education 
</p>
<p>and recreation. The Special Rapporteur recalls that decisions to allow children to stay with 
</p>
<p>their mothers in prison should always be based on a careful consideration of the best 
</p>
<p>interests of the children that includes an individual analysis of the circumstances of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 33  A/67/279, para. 62. 
</p>
<p> 34 See article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as general comment No. 10; 
</p>
<p>   and Human Rights Committee general comment No. 21 (1992) on humane treatment of persons 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty.  
</p>
<p> 35 African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child general comment No. 1 on 
</p>
<p>children of incarcerated and imprisoned parents and primary caregivers, para. 3. 
</p>
<p> 36 Ibid., para. 10. </p>


<p>case.37 It is also important that the child&#8217;s situation should regularly undergo judicial 
review, as circumstances may change and affect the analysis of the best interests of the 
</p>
<p>child. 
</p>
<p>77. Children of parents sentenced to death often suffer a particularly devastating ordeal. 
According to the Working Group on Children of Incarcerated Parents, &#8220;existing research 
has consistently connected a parent&#8217;s death sentence or execution with major psychological 
and emotional implications for children and families&#8221;, some children even present post-
traumatic stress disorder symptoms.38 The trauma caused by both the anxiety relating to the 
</p>
<p>anticipation of the execution and the actual execution itself must be taken into account by 
</p>
<p>prosecutors and judges before requesting or imposing the death penalty on defendants with 
</p>
<p>children. Despite the particular emotional and psychological distress of children of parents 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death&#8212;who also often experience social isolation and stigmatization&#8212;the 
Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned that these children are given little attention and 
</p>
<p>support. In this context, it is even more important for prosecutors and judges to consider the 
</p>
<p>best interests of the defendant&#8217;s children before requesting and ordering the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Alternatives to judicial proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>78. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the aim of juvenile justice 
is the child&#8217;s rehabilitation and social reintegration. The Beijing Rules provide that &#8220;the 
juvenile justice system shall emphasize the well-being of the juvenile and shall ensure that 
</p>
<p>any reaction to juvenile offenders shall always be in proportion to the circumstances of both 
</p>
<p>the offenders and the offence&#8221; (rule 5.1). Yet, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children has pointed out that &#8220;more than 1 million children are 
deprived of their liberty worldwide, and countless children face violent and degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment throughout the criminal justice process&#8221;.39 
</p>
<p>79. For these reasons, the Special Rapporteur considers that alternatives to criminal 
proceedings and trial should be available for children alleged as, accused of, or recognized 
</p>
<p>as having infringed penal law. The necessity to provide for alternatives to criminal 
</p>
<p>proceedings in juvenile cases has been underlined by both the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>and the Committee on the Rights of the Child.40 These alternative mechanisms can either 
</p>
<p>replace criminal proceedings or complement them, and they should be available at all 
</p>
<p>stages of criminal justice proceedings, from the moment of arrest until after the conviction, 
</p>
<p>when there is one. 
</p>
<p>80. The process of dealing with children alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having 
infringed penal law without resorting to criminal proceedings is known as &#8220;diversion&#8221; and 
serves to avoid the possible negative effects of criminal proceedings on children. Diversion 
</p>
<p>can involve different types of measures, including measures based on the principle of 
</p>
<p>restorative justice. 
</p>
<p>81. According to the basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in 
criminal matters, &#8220;restorative justice is an evolving response to crime that respects the 
dignity and equality of each person, builds understanding, and promotes social harmony 
</p>
<p>through the healing of victims, offenders and communities&#8221; (preamble)41. Restorative

executed&#8221;, August 2013, p. 3.

</p>
<p>justice for children&#8221;, 2013, p. 1. 
 40 See Human Rights Council general comment No. 32, para. 44, and Committee on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child general comment No. 10. 
</p>
<p> 41  Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/12. </p>


<p>justice aims to rehabilitate and reintegrate child offenders in their communities &#8220;through a 
non-adversarial and voluntary process, based on dialogue, negotiation and problem-
</p>
<p>solving&#8221; and by ensuring that they understand &#8220;the harm caused to the victim and the 
community&#8221; and acknowledge &#8220;accountability for criminal behaviour and reparation of its 
consequences&#8221;.42 
</p>
<p>82. Guideline 18 of the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors specifically provides that: 
</p>
<p>prosecutors shall give due consideration to waiving prosecution, discontinuing 
</p>
<p>proceedings conditionally or unconditionally, or diverting criminal cases from the 
</p>
<p>formal justice system, with full respect for the rights of suspect(s) and the victim(s). 
</p>
<p>For this purpose, States should fully explore the possibility of adopting diversion 
</p>
<p>schemes not only to alleviate excessive court loads, but also to avoid the 
</p>
<p>stigmatization of pretrial detention, indictment and conviction, as well as the 
</p>
<p>possible adverse effects of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>83. Guideline 19 stipulates that &#8220;prosecutors shall use their best efforts to take 
prosecutor action against juveniles only to the extent strictly necessary&#8221;. The Beijing Rules 
further provide that &#8220;prosecution or other agencies dealing with juvenile cases shall be 
empowered to dispose of such cases, at their discretion, without recourse to formal 
</p>
<p>hearings&#8221; (rule 11, para. 2). In some instances, judges can order diversion before the 
beginning of a trial at the stage of preparatory hearings. 
</p>
<p>84. Against this background, the Special Rapporteur considers that promoting strategies 
that provide alternatives to formal criminal proceedings, including measures based on the 
</p>
<p>principle of restorative justice, is as important as building and strengthening child-sensitive 
</p>
<p>administration of justice for juveniles. However, as noted by her predecessor, &#8220;the use of 
alternative mechanisms should not lead to substandard justice or obstruct the right to obtain 
</p>
<p>a court ruling&#8221; (A/HRC/8/4, para. 35). It is therefore essential that any alternative measures, 
including but not limited to measures applied in the context of diversion, provide children 
</p>
<p>with essential due-process guarantees to ensure their fairness. Moreover, the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child explained in its general comment No. 10 that diversion &#8220;should be 
used only when there is compelling evidence that the child committed the alleged offence, 
</p>
<p>that he/she freely and voluntarily admits responsibility, and that no intimidation or pressure 
</p>
<p>has been used to get that admission and, finally, that the admission will not be used against 
</p>
<p>him/her in any subsequent legal proceeding[s]&#8221; (para.27). Lastly, the child must freely and 
voluntarily give consent for any measures of diversion and be given access to legal 
</p>
<p>assistance to assess the alternative measure proposed. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children, who, in the context of discussing restorative justice 
</p>
<p>measures, noted that &#8220;to ensure that the rights of the child are respected at all times and that 
the process is lawfully conducted, a competent authority, such as a child justice court, 
</p>
<p>should have effective judicial overview&#8221;.43 
</p>
<p><b> E. Education, training and capacity-building for judges, prosecutors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>86. As seen throughout the preceding sections of this report, appropriate education, 
training and capacity-building are fundamental to ensure that those who come into contact 
</p>
<p>with children in the justice system, especially judges, prosecutors and lawyers, respect, 
</p>
<p>protect and fulfil children&#8217;s rights. A number of international instruments, including the 
Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the Basic Principles on the Role of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, op.cit., p. 2. 
</p>
<p> 43 Ibid., p. 20. </p>


<p>Lawyers, the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, and the Bangalore Principles of 
</p>
<p>Judicial Conduct, emphasize the necessity of quality education and proper training to 
</p>
<p>enable judges, prosecutors and lawyers to discharge their functions in a manner that ensures 
</p>
<p>equality of treatment of all before the courts. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that appropriate education and training is a 
determining factor in guaranteeing the competence, independence and impartiality of the 
</p>
<p>justice system. In her first report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>noted that the lack of appropriate capacity-building initiatives had a direct impact on 
</p>
<p>judges&#8217; capacity to render justice independently and impartially. As a consequence, judges 
and lawyers require opportunities to enhance their capacity to develop argumentation and 
</p>
<p>analyse issues from a human rights perspective (A/HRC/14/26, para. 24). 
</p>
<p>88. When it comes to children, understanding their development is fundamental to 
understanding their behaviour and their capacity to participate in legal proceedings, 
</p>
<p>including their ability to interact and communicate with those who assist them, comprehend 
</p>
<p>what is at stake, and make informed choices about their situation.44 Legal-assistance 
</p>
<p>providers have a duty &#8220;to understand how children communicate cognitively, linguistically, 
and emotionally and how this capacity changes over the course of childhood&#8221;, and that duty 
requires &#8220;training in how to communicate with children&#8221;.45 Within their respective 
functions, lawyers, prosecutors and especially judges have an obligation to uphold 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, including with respect to children&#8217;s rights. Moreover, as 
one of the three branches of power, the judiciary is directly bound by the international 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations of the State. 
</p>
<p>89. Building a child-friendly justice system, therefore, requires institutionalized and 
sustained efforts in the form of specialized training programmes, on-the-job education and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building that focus on international human rights norms and standards,  
</p>
<p>fundamental principles and related obligations. It also requires national laws to protect 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. Most child-specific international instruments, including the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, the Beijing Rules, the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving 
</p>
<p>Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime and the Principles and Guidelines on Access to 
</p>
<p>Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, make reference to this necessity. 
</p>
<p>90. These international human rights treaties and other instruments, as well as the 
jurisprudence arising from judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, provide judges, prosecutors 
</p>
<p>and lawyers alike with legitimate instruments for adjudication that respects children&#8217;s 
rights, needs and vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Every day, throughout the world, countless children come into contact with the 
justice system. As justice systems are often not adapted to the specificities of children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>far too many children suffer adverse consequences from treatment that directly 
</b></p>
<p><b>violates or disregards their fundamental human rights. In this context, judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and lawyers have, within the limits of their professional functions, a 
</b></p>
<p><b>unique opportunity to contribute significantly to respecting, protecting and fulfilling 
</b></p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. By their actions judges, prosecutor<b>s and lawyers can influence the 
future </b>course of children&#8217;s lives. As a result, by the very nature of their functions, they 
<b>have a great responsibility towards children.   
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur has considered it important to go beyond the more 
limited notion of juvenile justice in this report so as to reflect the diverse experiences 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b>of children when they encounter the justice system as victims or witnesses, or because 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are in conflict with the law, or they are parties to justice proceedings. In all these 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of the justice system, children have special rights, needs and interests that 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be considered. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The administration of justice, whether in criminal, civil or administrative 
processes, must therefore be guided at all times and in all matters concerning children 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the overriding principles of non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to life and development and the right to be heard. Creating and strengthening 
</b></p>
<p><b>training and capacity-building programmes on international human rights law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisprudence, in particular on </b>children&#8217;s rights, for all ju<b>stice operators is an 
important requisite for a competent, independent and impartial judiciary and legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>profession to be in a position to deliver justice to children. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Proper education and training enable judges, prosecutors and lawyers to 
acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to discharge their duties in conformity 
</b></p>
<p><b>with States</b>&#8217;<b> legal obligations relating to children. Finally, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to emphasize the impor</b>tance of children&#8217;s agency. Indeed, the purpose of 
<b>rendering the administration of justice child-sensitive is not to make children even 
</b></p>
<p><b>more dependent than they already are, but to empower them to have a say and make 
</b></p>
<p><b>decisions about matters that may affect them. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The following recommendations should be read in conjunction with previous 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, in particular those contained in reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/66/289, A/HRC/8/4, A/HRC/14/26 and A/HRC/23/43. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>States should put in place a legal framework conducive to the development and 
reinforcement of a child-sensitive justice system, in line with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights instruments relating to children, especially the Convention on the Rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Child. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Children</b>&#8217;s<b> rights, in particular the four fundamental principles contained in 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, should be taken into account by judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and lawyers in the performance of their functions in all matters 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>Children&#8217;s access to justice and legal aid<b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>States should develop specific strategies, policies and measures to identify and 
tackle obstacles encountered by children in accessing justice. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>To the extent possible, legal aid should be provided free of charge to all 
children in both criminal and civil proceedings. Such legal aid should be tailored to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the specific needs of children and respect, in particular, </b>children&#8217;s right to express 
<b>their views and to be heard. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>States must seriously consider the developmental difference between children 
</b>and adults when designing legal assistance schemes for children. Children&#8217;s needs and 
<b>best interests should also be integrated into existing legal assistance programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Specific legislation should ensure minimum quality standards for the work of 
paralegals and define the types of legal services they can offer. </b></p>


<p>102. <b>Where they exist, informal justice systems should integrate and apply 
international human rights norms and standards concerning children in all their 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making procedures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Child-sensitive adjudication 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>States should design, develop and strengthen justice systems that are sensitive 
</b>to children&#8217;s needs, rights and well<b>-being, and allow for their best interests to be the 
primary consideration. Child-sensitive justice should extend to all relevant judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings affecting the child. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>In judicial proceedings, children should not only be granted all guarantees 
generally recognized in international human rights instruments, but also guarantees 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific to their status as minors. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>States should set a minimum age for the criminal responsibility of children that 
takes into account new scientific findings on the level of maturity and discernment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; this minimum age should be as high as possible, but never lower than 12 
</b></p>
<p><b>years old. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Regardless of the circumstances of the crime, children should never be tried as 
adults. Their personal circumstances, including the fact that they are minors, should 
</b></p>
<p><b>always be weighed up in all judicial proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>States should adopt special measures and protection, including protection 
</b>programmes, to facilitate children&#8217;s participation in criminal proceedings as victims 
<b>and witnesses in a way that respects and protects their needs and rights. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>When sentencing children to criminal sanctions, judges should consider the 
effect of their sentences on the child and balance this against the </b>child&#8217;s best interests. 
<b>Prosecutors should also make provision of the same considerations when requesting 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal sanctions in the cases under thei</b>r purview. Children&#8217;s deprivation of liberty 
<b>should always be a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period of time. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>When sentencing parents, in particular to the death penalty, judges should also 
consider the effect of their sentences on the well-</b>being of the child and the child&#8217;s best 
<b>interests. Prosecutors should apply the same consideration when requesting sanctions 
</b></p>
<p><b>against parents. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Alternatives to judicial proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Alternatives to judicial proceedings, including measures based on the principle 
of restorative justice, should be available for children; such alternatives should always 
</b></p>
<p><b>be considered first. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>States should establish guidelines and standards to govern the possibilities of 
diverting children away from the criminal justice system and of using restorative 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice programmes, thereby preventing arbitrariness. Each case should nevertheless 
</b></p>
<p><b>be considered individually and in the light of the specific circumstances of the case 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the child. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Education, training and capacity-building for judges, prosecutors and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>112. Institutional training on children&#8217;s rights&#8212;<b>including relevant national, 
regional and international human rights law and jurisprudence</b>&#8212;<b>should be 
established and made compulsory for judges, prosecutors and lawyers, so as to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>a child-friendly justice system. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>International human rights law, in particular regarding </b>children&#8217;s rights, 
<b>should be included in the curricula of all law faculties and law schools, and in the </b></p>


<p><b>curricula of schools for the judiciary and the academic programmes of bar 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations. 
</b></p>
<p>114. Children&#8217;s rights expertise should be promoted, valued and integrated in<b>to all 
types of legal training and capacity-building for the judiciary and members of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal profession. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
