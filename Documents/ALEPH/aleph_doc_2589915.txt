(Please note that all dollar amounts in this news release are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.)
Toronto,  Ontario,  August  4,  2016  –  Primero  Mining  Corp.  (“Primero”  or  the  “Company”)  (TSX:P)  (NYSE:PPP)
today reported operating and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Improved Q2 2016 Operating Results: Total production of 49,499 gold equivalent ounces1, comprised
of 28,978 ounces of gold and 1.60 million ounces of silver from San Dimas, and 15,172 ounces of gold
from Black Fox, a 37% improvement over the 36,158 gold equivalent ounces produced in the first quarter
of 2016. Primero produced 62,490 gold equivalent ounces in Q2 2015.
Operating Cash Flows Increased: The Company realized a net loss of $19.4 million ($0.12 per share)
and adjusted net loss2  of $2.4 million ($0.01 per share) in Q2 2016. The Company generated second
quarter operating cash flow before working capital changes of $11.2 million ($0.07 per share), notably
increased over Q1 2016 of negative $8.5 million.
Black Fox Achieved Higher Underground Production Rates: Underground production from the Black
Fox mine averaged 636 tonnes per day in Q2 2016, a 50% improvement over the production levels in Q1
2016. The mine continues to make progress towards initial production from the Deep Central Zone, with
stope production expected from this new area before the end of Q3 2016, slightly later than originally
planned.
Equity Financing Improved Balance Sheet Flexibility: Primero ended Q2 2016 with $79.5 million of
total liquidity, which includes $54.5 million in cash and $25.0 million available on its line of credit. The
$40.0 million bought deal financing, which closed on June 24, 2016, positively contributed to Primero’s
June 30, 2016 cash position.

2016 Production Guidance Updated: Primero has reduced its 2016 production guidance to between
195,000 and 215,000 gold equivalent ounces at total cash costs3 of between $775 and $825 per gold
equivalent ounce with all-in sustaining costs4 of between $1,200 and $1,250 per gold ounce. Production
at San Dimas has been impacted by lower than planned grades, unexpected labour disruptions in July
and a lower gold/silver ratio as a result of minimal expected silver spot sales. Production at Black Fox
has been affected by delays in accessing high-grade mineralization from the Deep Central Zone.
Drilling  to  Commence  on  New  Concession  in  San  Dimas District:  Initial  orientation  sampling  has
begun on the recently acquired Lechuguilla concession located close to San Dimas' southern boundary,
with drilling to commence later this year.
NAFTA Notice of Intent: In order to protect its rights as a Canadian investor in Mexico under the North
American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), on June 2, 2016, the Company issued a Notice of Intent to
submit a claim to international arbitration against the Government of Mexico, pursuant to Article 1119 of
the  NAFTA.  Primero maintains it has the right to rely on its 2012 advance pricing agreement with  the
Mexican tax authority (“SAT”) which confirmed the appropriate price for sales of silver.
“We  increased  production  levels  in  the  second  quarter  and  we  are  committed  on  continuing  to  bring  both  of  our
mines up to their optimal operating rates,” stated Ernest Mast, President and Chief Executive Officer. “San Dimas
showed solid production improvements over Q1 2016, achieving average mining rates of 2,500 tonnes per day. But
there is still much work to be done to optimize and refine the mining cycle, increase development rates and maximize
productivity and grades. We had labour disruptions during July that impacted July’s production and delayed some
development work. As a result we initiated a mine optimization plan focusing on technical and human resources
issues. We are continuing to make progress at Black Fox in developing the Deep Central Zone ahead of production
expected in the third-quarter, unfortunately we have experienced delays in early July due to poor ground conditions
on the 660 metre level. In light of these challenges the Company has reduced its 2016 production guidance.”
San Dimas Operations Improve; Black Fox Achieves Increased Underground Production Rates
Primero produced a total of 49,499 gold equivalent ounces in Q2 2016, which compares to 62,490 gold equivalent
ounces produced in Q2 2015, but represents a 37% increase compared to Q1 2016. Gold and silver production was
44,150  ounces  and  1.60  million  ounces,  respectively,  in  Q2  2016  compared  to  54,862  ounces  and  2.15  million
ounces in Q2 2015.
The Company incurred consolidated total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce of $851 for Q2 2016, compared to
$653 for Q2 2015. All-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) per ounce were $1,345 for Q2 2016, compared to $1,036 in Q2
2015.
San  Dimas  produced  34,327  gold  equivalent  ounces  (28,978  ounces  of  gold  and  1.60  million  ounces  of  silver)
during the second quarter of 2016, a 50% increase over Q1 2016 and compared to 44,128 gold equivalent ounces
produced in Q2 2015. The decreased production year-over-year was mainly due to lower throughput rates and lower
head grades due to the lack of availability of high-grade stopes mainly as a result of lower development in Q1 2016
and ventilation and mine services issues. The labour issues during July further impacted development and therefore
deferred mining some high grade areas to 2017.
2
San  Dimas  total  cash  costs  on  a  gold  equivalent  basis  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  were  $843  per  ounce,
compared to $608 per ounce in Q2 2015. AISC at San Dimas were $1,063 per ounce in the second quarter 2016,
compared with $822 per ounce in the same period of 2015. The higher cash costs per ounce were mainly due to
lower metals production and reduced silver credits realized in the second quarter of 2016. Higher unit costs were
also related to an increase in the annual bonus paid to unionized employees. The impact of the increased union
bonus was approximately $90 per ounce in the second quarter.
Black Fox produced 15,172 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2016, a 14% increase over the 13,257 ounces
produced in Q1 2016 and compared to 18,362 ounces in Q2 2015. In Q2 2016 the majority of production ounces
came from the underground mine, whereas in Q2 2015 gold production was largely sourced from the open-pit mine.
In the second quarter of 2016 the underground mine achieved increased production rates averaging 636 tonnes per
day, representing a 50% improvement over Q1 2016 production levels. During July 2016, a planned initial long-hole
stope  of  the  Deep  Central  Zone  was  delayed  due  to  poor  ground  conditions  in  a  footwall  development  drift  that
required the development of an alternative route. An alternate route was implemented that has already mined 3,220
tonnes of development ore grading 9.8 g/t (cut at 30 g/t) confirming the existence of high grade ore at the 660 level.
As a result, initial stope production from the Deep Central Zone is now expected to commence before the end of Q3
2016.
Black Fox total cash costs per gold ounce were higher in Q2 2016 at $870 per ounce compared to $762 per ounce in
Q2 2015 due to lower gold production. The Black Fox mine incurred AISC per gold ounce of $1,362 in Q2 2016,
compared  to  $1,071  in  Q2  2015  as  a  result  of  increased  capital  spending  on  underground  development  in  2016
compared to 2015.
Primero generated $59.4 million of revenue in Q2 2016, 12% lower than in Q2 2015 as a result selling 17% less gold
equivalent ounces despite a 6% higher average realized gold price. In Q2 2016, the Company sold 43,008 ounces of
gold at an average realized price of $1,241 per ounce and 1.43 million ounces of silver at an average realized price
of $4.24 per ounce. Revenue in Q2 2015 totalled $67.4 million from selling 52,975 ounces of gold at an average
realized price of $1,171 per ounce, and 1.26 million ounces of silver at an average realized price of $4.20 per ounce.
Silver produced at San Dimas is subject to a silver purchase agreement5 and as a result 1.43 million ounces of silver
were sold to Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (“Silver Wheaton”) at a fixed price of $4.24 per ounce during the quarter.
As of June 30, 2016 the Company has delivered 5.6 million ounces of silver under the San Dimas silver purchase
agreement’s 6.0 million ounce annual contract year threshold (which runs from August 6th to the following August
5th), following which the Company can begin selling 50% of the silver produced at San Dimas at spot market prices
until August 5, 2016 when the annual threshold is reset. Primero expects minimal spot silver sales in 2016. Gold
produced  at  Black  Fox  is  subject  to  a  gold  purchase  agreement6  and  as  a  result  1,131  ounces  were  sold  to
Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (“Sandstorm”) at a fixed price of $524 per ounce in Q2 2016.
The Company incurred a net loss of $19.4 million ($0.12 per share) in Q2 2016, compared with net loss of $6.7
million ($0.04 per share) for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted loss for Q2 2016 was $2.4 million ($0.01 per share)
compared with adjusted net income of $1.1 million ($0.01 per share) in Q2 2015. Adjusted loss primarily excludes
the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on deferred tax balances, costs specifically related to the NAFTA and
APA claims, and the mark-to-market gain/loss on the convertible debenture and warrants.
3
Primero generated operating cash flow before working capital changes during Q2 2016 of $11.2 million ($0.07 per
share), compared to operating cash flow of $22.6 million ($0.14 per share) in Q2 2015. Q2 2016 operating cash flow
included $4.5 million in cash payments for income taxes in Mexico for 2016 tax instalments. Q2 2016 cash flows
were also affected by lower production levels relative to Q2 2015.
Liquidity Update
The Company’s total liquidity position at June 30, 2016 totalled $79.5 million, comprised of $54.5 million in cash and
$25.0 million available under its line of credit. During Q2 2016, Primero completed a $40.0 million (C$51.8 million)
bought deal financing, which positively contributed to Primero’s June 30, 2016 cash position.
Primero has $50 million drawn on its revolving credit facility that matures on May 23, 2017. The Company expects to
renew this facility, but in the event full repayment is required cash generated by operations may not be sufficient to
repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility in full at maturity. The Company has a plan to improve
production at San Dimas and will focus on cost and capital reductions at both of its operations to increase cash flows
and is also evaluating the potential divestiture of assets and joint venture opportunities.
2016 Production Guidance Update
Primero has reduced its 2016 production guidance to between 195,000 and 215,000 gold equivalent ounces at total
cash costs of between $775 and $825 per gold equivalent ounce with AISC of between $1,200 and $1,250 per gold
ounce. The Company has also re-evaluated its capital budget and as a result, 2016 capital expenditures have been
reduced to $73.7 million including $42.4 million at San Dimas and $29.0 million at Black Fox.
Production at San Dimas has been impacted by lower than planned grades, unexpected labour disruptions in July
and a lower gold/silver ratio as a result of minimal expected silver spot sales. Labour disruptions in July were related
to the local union seeking to increase short term production bonuses and interrupted the mine’s operation during
discussions. The short term production bonuses were agreed upon in late July. The labour disruption affected July
production  and  development  and  as  a  result,  select  high  grade  areas  will  not  be  mined  in  2016  resulting  in  a
production shortfall.
In view of these recent operational challenges at San Dimas the Company initiated a mine optimization program, in
conjunction with a third party. A seven point action plan was developed to focus on technical improvements such as
improving  development  rates  and  services,  reducing  dilution,  decreasing  operating  costs,  and  improving  labour
productivity. The Company expects to provide an update at the end of the quarter.
Production at Black Fox has been affected by timing delays in accessing high-grade mineralization from the Deep
Central Zone. Stope production from the Deep Central Zone has been delayed by approximately one month, due to
poor localized ground conditions experienced on the 660 metre level. The Black Fox team has successfully worked
through  this  area,  but  the  timing  delay  has  pushed  first  stope  production  until  September.  Black  Fox  updated
guidance includes additional capital costs to develop the Deep Central zone. Additional drilling and development
will be undertaken to increase available stopes in the Deep Central zone.

Material assumptions used to forecast total cash costs for 2016 were based on the Company’s actual results to June
30, 2016 and include an estimated average gold price of $1,250 per ounce (based on actual gold prices received
through Q2 2016 and $1,300 per ounce for the remainder of the year), silver market price of $20 per ounce, and
foreign exchange rates of $1.30 Canadian dollars and $18 Mexican pesos to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of
2016. Silver sold under the silver purchase agreement is expected to average $4.26 for the 2016 year.
Froome Zone Update
Primero continues to evaluate the potential of the Froome Zone located approximately 800 metres west of the Black
Fox mine. Following the announcement of positive drilling results in Q1 2016, Primero continued to delineate and
expand the deposit and commenced an internal economic evaluation of the Froome Zone. An initial mining plan has
been developed and preliminary engineering and geotechnical studies have begun with the focus on accessing the
ore body via an underground drift from the Black Fox pit, expediting the permitting process and timeline to initial
production. Optimizing studies will continue in Q3 2016 with the focus on reducing capital cost and de-risking the
project.
The  Company’s  regional  exploration  program  will  now  focus  on  the  discovery  of  Froome-like  targets  along  the
mineralized trend.
Mineralization Potential Identified on New Lechuguilla Concession in San Dimas District
With the June 2016 acquisition of a large new concession in the San Dimas district (Lechuguilla), Primero conducted
a  geological  reconnaissance  of  identified  geological  windows.  The  large-scale  Lechuguilla  concession  is  not
covered by the San Dimas silver purchase agreement and is a key focus of Primero’s H2 2016 exploration program.
Initial geological reconnaissance conducted by Primero’s geologists has obtained preliminary grab samples from the
Causitas vein, located close to the main road between Durango and Tayoltita. Preliminary samples returned 1.0 g/t
gold and 7 g/t silver, and 0.7 g/t gold and 98 g/t silver at surface providing an indication of potential mineralization.
The Causitas vein has been identified between one and five meters and has been traced over 200 metres of strike
length.  Based  on  these  early  results,  Primero’s  geologists  will  begin  a  program  of  detailed  vein  mapping  and
channel sampling in order to identify drill targets.
5
Primero’s geologists have also noted anomalous precious metals values in preliminary grab samples taken from the
identified Sara Costanza and Cinibas veins. Grab sample locations are shown in Figure 1.
Exploration  sampling  at  Lechuguilla  was  conducted  by  Primero's  exploration  team.  Mr.  David  Laudrum,  P.Geo.,
Senior Resource Manager for Primero has reviewed the technical exploration information in this news release as the
Qualified Person ("QP") for the purposes of NI 43-101 for the Company. All samples and analyses reported herein
were performed in the ISO certified independent laboratory SGS Servicios Minerales in Durango Mexico, using fire
assay with atomic absorption finish or gravimetric finish for values over 10 g/t gold.
Mexican Tax Update and NAFTA Notice of Intent
The Company continues to vigorously defend its Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) from the legal claim initiated
by the Mexican tax authorities (“SAT”). The APA was obtained to confirm that the Company should calculate taxes
on silver sold from the San Dimas mine based on the price realized by the Company. The legal claim initiated does
not identify any different basis for paying taxes, nor have any tax reassessments been received from the SAT. The
Company continues to record its revenue from the sale of silver for purposes of Mexican tax accounting in a manner
consistent with the APA on the basis that the applicable facts and laws have not changed. The Company’s legal and
financial advisors continue to believe that the Company has filed its tax returns compliant with applicable Mexican
law.
In defending the APA, the Company has filed procedural and substantive responses to the SAT-initiated legal claim.
The  procedural  response  is  a  challenge  against  the  admission  of  the  SAT’s  claim.  The  substantive  response
contains  the  Company’s  response  to  the  SAT’s  claim.  While  the  resolution  of  the  procedural  challenge  remains
pending and the substantive matters are ongoing, the Mexican District Court recently issued a final order mandating
that no resolution may be issued in connection with the substantive matters until the procedural challenge against
the  admission  of  the  SAT’s  claim  is  finally  decided.  As  consideration  of  these  matters  continues  in  parallel,  the
Company does not expect the order to delay the resolution of the substantive case.
The Company believes that it is entitled to rely on the APA which is legally binding in respect of the Company’s 2010
through 2014 taxation years. The Company obtained the ruling transparently and in good faith. Primero believes the
APA should not be the subject of challenge by a government administration installed upon the change of government
after the APA was duly issued. On June 2, 2016, the Company notified the Government of Mexico that the measures
taken  by  its  tax  authority  (the  SAT)  with  the  judicial  proceeding  seeking  to  nullify  the  APA,  breached  several
provisions  of  Chapter  11  of  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA)  because  these  measures  are
arbitrary,  discriminatory,  unfair  and  inequitable.  As  such,  the  Company  informed  the  Government  of  Mexico  that,
absent amicable resolution within 90 days, it intends to commence international arbitration proceedings pursuant to
Article 1119 of the NAFTA.
The Company will continue to vigorously defend the validity of the APA and the correctness of its tax filing position.

800-408-3053 or 905-694-9451 and entering the call back passcode 2048848.
This  release  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  Primero’s  second  quarter  2016  financial  statements  and  MD&A
report on the Company's website, www.primeromining.com, in the “Financial Reports” section under “Investors”, or
on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com, or on the Edgar website www.sec.gov.
(1) “Gold equivalent ounces” include silver ounces produced, and converted to a gold equivalent based on a ratio of
the average commodity prices realized for each period. The ratio for the second quarter 2016 w as 293:1 based on
the average realized prices of $1,241 per ounce of gold and $4.24 per ounce of silver.
(2) Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures. Neither of these
non-GAAP performance measures has any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to other
measures presented by other issuers . The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in
accordance  with  GAAP,  the  Company  and  certain  investors  use  this  information  to  evaluate  the  Company’s
performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the second quarter 2016
MD&A for a reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) to reported net income (loss).
(3) Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce and total cash costs per gold ounce on a by -product basis are non-
GAAP measures. Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce are defined as costs of production (including refining
costs) divided by the total number of gold equivalent ounces produced. Total cash costs per gold ounce on a by-
product basis are calculated by deducting the by-product silver credits from operating costs and dividing by the total
number of gold ounces produced. The Company reports total cash costs on a production basis. In the gold mining
industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning, and are non -GAAP
measures. As such, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other is suers. In reporting
total cash costs per gold equivalent and total cash costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis, the Company follow s
the  recommendations  of  the  Gold  Institute  standard.  The  Company  believes  that,  in  addition  to  conventional
measures, prepared in acc ordance w ith GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s
performance  and  ability  to  generate  cash  flow  .  Accordingly,  it  is  intended  to  provide  a  dditional  information  and
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance w ith
GAAP. Refer to the Company’s second quarter 2016 MD&A for a reconciliation of cash costs per gold ounce on both
a  by  -product  and  gold  equivalent  basis  to  reported  operating  expenses  (the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP
measure).
(4) The Company, in conjunction w ith an initiative undertaken w ithin the gold mining industry, has adopted an all-in
sustaining  cost  non-GAAP  performance  measure  that  the  Company  believes  more  fully  defines  the  total  cost
associated with producing gold; how ever, this performance measure has no standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is
intended to provide additional information and should not be consider ed in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance w ith GAAP. The Company reports this measure on a gold ounces produced
basis. For the purposes of calculating all-in sustaining costs at individual mine sites, the Company does not include
corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses are included in the
computation of all-in sustaining costs per consolidated gold ounce. Refer to the Company’s second quarter 2016
MD&A for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce.
(5) According to the silver purchase agreement betw een the Company and Silver Wheaton Corp., until August 6,
2014  Primero  delivered  to  Silver  Wheaton  a  per  annum  amount  equal  to  the  first  3.5  million  ounces  of  silver
produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess at $4.12 per ounce (increasing by 1% per year). Thereafter Primero
w ill deliver to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 6.0 million ounces of silver produced at San
Dimas and 50% of any excess at $4.20 per ounce (increasing by 1% per year). The Company w ill receive silver spot
prices only after the annual threshold amount has been delivered.
(6) Black Fox w as subject to a gold purchase agreement w hich continues and w as assumed by the Company upon
its acquisition of t he mine. According to the gold purchase agreement, Sandstorm is entitled to 8% of production at
the Black Fox mine and 6.3% at the Pike River property.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important facto rs that
may  cause  the  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  of  Primero  to  be  materially  different  from  those
expressed  or  implied  by  such  forward-looking  statements,  including:  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  achieve
planned production levels; the Com pany may not be able to expand production at San Dimas as anticipated or
generate significant free cash flow; the Company may not be successful in returning the Black Fox mine to higher
production levels; the Company may be required to change its development and exploration plans with a negative
impact  on  production;  the  Company  may  not  discover  mineralization  in  minable  quantities;  the  exchange  rate
between the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the United States dollar may change with an adverse impact on
the Company’s financial results; the optimization and expansion initiatives may not provide the benefits anticipated;
the Company’s ability to obtain full compensation from the Mexican Government; the Company may not be able to
become an intermediate gold producer by building a portfolio of high quality, low cost precious metals assets in the
Americas. Certain of these factors are discussed in greater detail in Primero’s registration statement on Form 40 -F
on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and its most recent Annual Information Form on file with
the Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities and available at www.sedar.com.
Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements. In addition, although Primero
has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from
those described in forward -looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to
be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate,
as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly,
readers should not place undue reliance on forward -looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and accordingly are subject to change after such date.
Forward  -looking  statements  are  provided  for  the  purpose  of  providing  information  about  management’s  current
expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to get a better understanding of our operating environment.
Primero does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are included in this document, except in
accordance with applicable securities laws.
