MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
ITEM(cid:160)2
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the information provided in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on 
Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2016 (Form 10-K).
OVERVIEW
Stillwater Mining Company (the Company) is a Delaware corporation that has its shares of common stock listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SWC". The Company extracts and processes ores containing palladium and 
platinum (along with by-product metals) from two underground mines situated within the J-M Reef, a geological formation of 
platinum group metal (PGM) mineralization, which is located in Stillwater and Sweet Grass Counties in south-central Montana. 
Ore produced from the mines is crushed and concentrated in mills located at each mine site. Mine concentrates are then trucked 
to the Company’s processing complex in Columbus, Montana, where they are smelted and partially refined. In addition to the 
mine concentrates, the Company also recycles spent automotive catalyst and other materials containing PGMs it receives from 
third parties at the processing complex. A portion of this recycling activity is material the Company purchases for its own 
account; while the remainder is toll processed on behalf of others for a fee. After being processed through the Company's 
processing facilities in Columbus, the final product, a PGM-rich filter cake, is shipped to Johnson Matthey (JM) in New Jersey 
for final refining before it is then delivered as finished metal.
SECOND QUARTER 2016 SUMMARY RESULTS
For the second quarter of 2016, the Company reported a consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of 
$0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to the consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of $27.5 
million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015. The lower operating results in the second quarter of 2016 
were driven by a significant reduction in average combined realized price per mined ounce, which fell from $842 per ounce in 
the second quarter of 2015 to $665 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016, which was offset, in part, by a reduction in unit 
costs. The second quarter of 2015 included an impairment charge of $46.8 million (before-tax).
Segment earnings from the Company's mining operations totaled $10.3 million (before income taxes) for the second
quarter of 2016, compared to $21.4 million (before income taxes) for the same period in 2015. Volumes of mined palladium 
and platinum sold in the second quarter of 2016 increased to 150,900 ounces from 133,000 ounces in the second quarter of 
2015, reflecting both increased production and draw-down of mine ounce inventory. The average combined realized price per 
ounce on sales of mined palladium and platinum in the second quarter of 2016 was 21.0% lower than that realized in the second 
quarter of 2015.
Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce is the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to total 
cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's consolidated costs of metals 
sold per mined ounce of palladium and platinum was $501 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $606 per 
ounce in the second quarter of 2015, a 17.3% decrease. Consolidated total cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce for 
the Company's mining operations averaged $420 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016, which was 20.8% lower than the 
$530 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015, mostly resulting from higher production rates at the East Boulder Mine, labor 
reductions at the Stillwater Mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines. (See "Reconciliation of GAAP 
Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures").
Segment earnings from the Company's recycling activities (before income taxes) were $3.0 million in the second quarter
of 2016, an increase over the $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. Earnings in the recycling segment typically lag 
corresponding volumes processed by approximately two to three months. Total recycling ounces of palladium, platinum and 
rhodium fed to the smelter, including both purchased ounces and ounces processed on a toll basis, increased 12.1% to 169,900 
ounces in the second quarter of 2016 from 151,600 ounces in the second quarter of 2015. Recycling volumes sold increased 
25.3% during the second quarter of 2016 totaling 85,300 ounces (including palladium, platinum and rhodium) at an average 
realization of $666 per ounce, as compared to 68,100 ounces sold during the second quarter of 2015 at an average realization of 
$954 per ounce. The Company delivered 70,700 recycled tolled ounces during the second quarter of 2016, up from 37,400 
recycled tolled ounces delivered in the second quarter of 2015, an 89.0% increase.

The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $130.1 million at June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to $147.3 million at
December(cid:160)31, 2015. Total outstanding liquidity, which includes highly liquid investments as well as available cash and cash 
equivalents, was $442.2 million at June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to $463.8 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015. See "Note 12 - 
Investments", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the Company's investments. 
Net working capital (including cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investments) decreased to $519.2 million at 
June(cid:160)30, 2016, from $523.0 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015. Working capital associated with the recycling activities was $63.1 
million at June(cid:160)30, 2016 compared to $37.4 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015.
MINING OPERATIONS
Mine production of palladium and platinum totaled 137,100 ounces for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 8.0%
from the 127,000 ounces produced in the second quarter of 2015.
Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce is the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to total 
cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce, and All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) per PGM mined ounce, both non-GAAP 
financial measures. The Company's consolidated costs of metals sold per mined ounce of palladium and platinum was $501 per 
ounce in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $606 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015, a 17.3% decrease. The 
measurement of total cash costs per PGM mined ounce includes the benefit of credits for by-product sales and PGM Recycling 
segment income (before income taxes). The table below illustrates the effect of applying these credits to the average cash costs 
per PGM mined ounce for the combined Montana mining operations. Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce were reduced by 
14.4% as a result of reduced labor costs which were offset by an 8.0% increase in production in the second quarter of 2016 
when compared to second quarter of 2015.

The Company utilizes AISC (non-GAAP financial measure) to assess the overall operating efficiency of the Company's 
Montana operations. This metric is an indication of the total cash capital and operating costs per PGM mined ounce (including 
corporate general and administrative costs) required to sustain the Company's current level of mining activities. For the second 
quarter of 2016, AISC averaged $594 per PGM mined ounce, a 3.1% decrease from the first quarter of 2016, and 24.3% lower 
than the AISC of $785 per PGM mined ounce achieved in the second quarter of 2015. This was driven by lower total cash costs 
and lower capital spending incurred to sustain operations and higher production volumes during the second quarter of 2016. For 
a more complete discussion of this measure, refer to -- "Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial 
Measures."
Stillwater Mine
At the Stillwater Mine, combined palladium and platinum production increased 8.2% in the second quarter of 2016 to 
83,100 ounces, compared to 76,800 ounces produced in the second quarter of 2015. Ore grade averaged approximately 0.47 
combined ounces of palladium and platinum per ton in the quarter ended June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to 0.45 ounces per ton in 
the quarter ended June(cid:160)30, 2015. Mined ore and sub-grade volumes fed to the Stillwater Mine concentrator during the second 
quarter of 2016 totaled 188,500 tons, an increase of 1.8% from the 185,100 tons fed in the same quarter of 2015.

Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce is Stillwater Mine's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to
total cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce, a non-GAAP financial measure. Costs of metals sold per mined ounce of 
palladium and platinum was $478 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $590 per ounce in the second quarter 
of 2015. Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of credits, decreased by 26.0% in the second quarter of 2016 compared 
with the same period in 2015. The lower costs for the second quarter of 2016 are principally the result of a reduced labor force 
at the Stillwater Mine, higher production volumes, improved mining practices and the implementation of various cost reduction 
initiatives.
The following table illustrates the effect of applying the by-product and PGM Recycling segment credits to the total cash
costs per PGM mined ounce at the Stillwater Mine:

Capital expenditures at the Stillwater Mine totaled $22.1 million for the second quarter of 2016, including $12.0 million
for Blitz development. This compares to the $22.5 million of capital expenditures at the Stillwater Mine during the second 
quarter of 2015, of which $5.4 million was for Blitz development. The reduction in capital expenditures was primarily due to 
lower infrastructure activity in the mine along with higher development productivity that reduced unit rates. Primary and 
secondary development footages (excluding Blitz development) for the second quarter of 2016 decreased relative to the 
comparable footages for the second quarter of 2015, with primary and secondary development together advancing 
approximately 8,000 feet in the second quarter of 2016 and 10,900 feet in the second quarter of 2015. This was slightly above 
the development rates envisioned in the mine plan implemented in August 2015. Diamond drilling footage (excluding Blitz 
development) decreased for the second quarter of 2016, totaling approximately 50,700 feet, compared to 84,300 feet drilled in 
the second quarter of 2015. Ongoing mine development efforts, including diamond drilling, are part of a continuing effort to 
maintain the developed state of the mine.
East Boulder Mine
Mine production at the East Boulder Mine was 54,000 combined ounces of palladium and platinum for the second quarter
of 2016, an increase of 7.6% from 50,200 ounces produced in the second quarter of 2015. Ore grade averaged approximately 
0.37 combined ounces of palladium and platinum per ton in the quarter ended June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to 0.39 ounces per 
ton in the quarter ended June(cid:160)30, 2015. Mined ore and sub-grade volumes fed to the East Boulder Mine concentrator during the 
second quarter of 2016 increased 14.8% to 162,200 tons from 141,300 tons in the second quarter of 2015. This increase is due 
to additional plant run days and a higher feed rate to accommodate the increased mine production more than offsetting the 
slightly lower grade year on year.
Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce is East Boulder Mine's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to 
total cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce, a non-GAAP financial measure. Costs of metals sold per mined ounce of 
palladium and platinum was $538 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $634 per ounce in the second quarter 
of 2015. Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of credits, for the second quarter of 2016 decreased approximately 11.9% 
from the same period in 2015. The improvement in cash costs per ounce reflects the increased mine output and continuing cost 
reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.

Capital expenditures at the East Boulder Mine totaled $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $4.6 
million in the second quarter of 2015. Actual primary and secondary development advanced approximately 5,700 feet during 
the second quarter of 2016 while the comparable development advance in the second quarter of 2015 was also 5,700 feet. 
Diamond drilling footage for the second quarter of 2016 totaled approximately 37,800 feet compared to the 105,900 feet drilled 
in the second quarter of 2015 when there was a campaign on drilling at Graham Creek to prepare for the development of the 
second ore block.

PGM RECYCLING SEGMENT
The volume of recycling materials processed through the smelter during the second quarter of 2016 was 26.4 tons per day
of furnace feed compared to 26.9 tons per day in the second quarter of 2015. PGM loadings in the fed material in the second 
quarter of 2016 increased 12.1% to 169,900 ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium compared to 151,600 ounces in the 
second quarter of 2015.

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company earned $3.0 million in income (before income taxes)(cid:160)from its PGM
Recycling operations on revenues of $59.2 million. For the second quarter of 2015, the recycling operations earned $2.0 
million in income (before income taxes) on revenues of $66.3 million.
For the second quarter of 2016, PGM Recycling revenues decreased by 10.7% compared to the same period in 2015 due 
to lower realized selling prices as a result of the fall in palladium and platinum market prices, which was partially offset by an 
increase in ounces sold. The cost of metals sold from the PGM Recycling segment was $56.5 million in the second quarter of 
2016, as compared to $64.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 12.3%. A majority of the cost of metals sold 
from recycling in each period is attributable to the acquisition cost of purchasing recyclable materials for the Company's own 
account; therefore, the aggregate cost of metals sold from the PGM Recycling segment is driven mostly by the volume and the 
value of the PGMs in the materials purchased by the Company. Tolling revenues increased by approximately 80.0% in the 
second quarter of 2016 to $1.8 million, as compared to approximately $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2015, reflecting the 
increase in tolled ounces returned.
Sold ounces of recycled PGMs increased by 25.3% to 85,300 ounces in the second quarter of 2016 from 68,100 ounces in 
the second quarter of 2015. The combined average recycling sales realization (including palladium, platinum and rhodium) was 
$666 per sold ounce in the second quarter of 2016, down from $954 per sold ounce in the same quarter of 2015. In addition, the 
Company delivered 70,700 recycled tolled ounces during the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 89.0% from 37,400 
recycled tolled ounces delivered in the second quarter of 2015. A total of 156,000 combined ounces were delivered to 
customers in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to 105,500 ounces delivered in the second quarter of 2015.
For its PGM Recycling segment, the Company customarily enters into fixed forward sales contracts that set the selling
price for most of the PGMs recovered from recycled materials. Because the selling price of recycling materials held by the 
Company is fixed up front by these forward sales contracts, day-to-day changes in the market price of palladium and platinum 
have little effect on the percentage margins earned from processing these materials or on cash flow from recycling operations. 
However, as PGM prices rise or fall over time, the total volume of materials available in the market may also rise or fall and the 
selling price of recycling materials in the forward sales contracts may also change, which can affect the total profitability of the 
Company's recycling activities. On average, it takes two to three months from the date of receipt to process and deliver metal 
from purchased lots of recycling materials.
The Company has arrangements in place with many of its recycling suppliers to provide advance payments to the
suppliers prior to the release of finished metal from the final refiner. These advances may include general working capital 
advances, advances against materials in transit to the Company's processing facilities, and payments for materials in process. 
Outstanding advances for general working capital and materials in transit not backed up by inventory physically in the 
Company’s possession totaled $7.8 million at June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to $4.4 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015. In addition, 
recycling segment materials physically in inventory totaled $55.3 million at June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to $33.0 million at 
December(cid:160)31, 2015. Working capital associated with the recycling activities was $63.1 million and $37.4 million at June(cid:160)30, 
2016 and December(cid:160)31, 2015, respectively.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company is continuing to develop the Blitz area, which is expected to provide extensive new mining infrastructure
along the J-M Reef. This development includes constructing underground and surface access to an area extending 
approximately 23,000 feet to the east from the existing Stillwater Mine operations on two separate levels. The lower of these 
underground development headings, on the 50 East, is being driven with a tunnel-boring machine (TBM) and to date has 
advanced approximately 10,700 feet.
A second, parallel underground heading at Blitz, the 56 East, is being driven approximately 600 feet above the TBM
using conventional drill and blast methods. Approximately 18,900 feet of ramp and infrastructure development has been 
completed along the 56 East heading to date. Development continues ahead of schedule along this heading and has not been 
delayed by unfavorable ground conditions. In the 50 East TBM drive, water inflows have been higher than anticipated which 
has slowed advance rates. A dewatering program is being instituted to enable a higher rate of advance to be achieved. The TBM 
drive is not on the critical path for first production or ramp up and efforts are being directed to the 56 East drive and the 
Benbow decline which are on the critical path for the project.
Combined primary Blitz development footages for the second quarter of 2016 increased relative to the comparable
footages for the second quarter of 2015, advancing approximately 3,000 feet in the second quarter of 2016 and 2,000 feet in the 
second quarter of 2015. Diamond drilling footage for Blitz development increased for the second quarter of 2016, totaling 
approximately 36,000 feet, as compared to 12,400 feet drilled in the second quarter of 2015.
The permitting process for the Benbow access portal was completed in the third quarter of 2015. The Benbow access
portal to be developed at the far end of the two primary Blitz tunnels, is designed to intersect the two tunnels from the surface, 
and will provide ventilation and emergency egress for the Blitz development area. The construction of the surface facilities is 
nearing completion.
The Blitz development began in late 2010, and to date, the Company has spent approximately $91.7 million (net of
capitalized interest and capitalized depreciation) of an estimated $205 million of capital expenditures for the development. The 
Company has focused on accelerating the Blitz development timeline to enable the Company to bring forward plans for first 
production, now anticipated to occur in late 2017 or early 2018 with estimated costs to first production in the range of $155 
million to $175 million. The Company anticipates the Blitz area will provide growth in the Company’s production profile and 
the Company's lowest cost mined ounces due to expected grade and as a result of the newly constructed infrastructure. The 
Blitz development is intended to contribute to the growth of Stillwater's annual palladium and platinum production over the 
first 10 years of production, after which the Company expects to use it to off-set the depletion of the Stillwater Mine's existing 
ore reserves.
While a modest exploration program continues at the Marathon project in Canada, development plans remain suspended
until the project can demonstrate an economic return greater than the returns available on the Company's other assets.
Cash carrying costs at the Altar project in Argentina totaled approximately $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2016,
consisting of administrative costs of $0.3 million and exploration expense of approximately $0.9 million. For the second 
quarter of 2015, cash carrying costs totaled $0.6 million, consisting of $0.1 million administrative costs and approximately $0.5 
million of exploration expense.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND COMMENTARY FOR PGM MARKETS
The following discussion reflects management’s assessment of the recent state of the PGM markets, based on discussions
with industry analysts and the Company’s own observations of market dynamics. There can be no assurance that the 
Company’s conclusions reflect a complete or accurate picture of supply and demand trends or other market considerations. 
However, management’s view of market conditions and the outlook for PGM supply and demand may influence its decisions on 
mining activities, future acquisitions, expansions or divestitures, capital investment, financing, hiring and various other factors.
The primary suppliers of PGMs worldwide are limited to a few large producers in South Africa and Zimbabwe,
significant PGM by-product output from Norilsk Nickel in Russia, plus output from the Company’s operations in Montana and 
a few (mostly by-product producers) in Canada.
Johnson Matthey (JM) estimated that 79% of palladium demand and 40% of platinum demand will come from the
automotive catalyst market in 2016 (net of investment supply and demand), a percentage that has steadily grown over recent 
years for both metals. During the first half of 2016, the automotive market was strong across all major regions.
Both the U.S. and European car markets remained strong during the first half of 2016. U.S. auto sales through June 2016
were up 1.5% to 8.65 million units from the same period in 2015 according to Autodata Corp. Automobile sales in Europe 
through June 2016 were also up 9.1% to 8.09 million units from the same period in 2015 according to the European 
Automobile Manufacturers Association.
Total vehicle sales in China rose by 8.1% to 12.8 million units in the first half of 2016 compared with the same period in 
2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Vehicle sales were boosted by strong demand for sport 
utility vehicles and continued stimulus measures.
During the first half of 2016, the price for platinum reversed its previous downward trend, finishing the quarter at $999 
per ounce. In prior years, South African producers increased supply into the market by destocking their inventories. In 2016, 
JM forecasts that the impact to supply will decline as the South African producers have less ability to continue to destock 
inventories. The South African rand depreciation in 2015 protected producers from the full brunt of last year’s decline in U.S. 
dollar denominated PGM prices. Through June 2016, the rand has strengthened removing a portion of the protection created 
from the previous year.
8
The price of palladium increased 3.5% over the second quarter of 2016 to close at $589 on June 30, 2016. After hitting a
low of $470 per ounce in January 2016, the price of palladium recovered 25.3% at the end of June 2016. The overall market 
fundamentals for palladium continue to be strong. The use of palladium in the automotive, industrial and jewelry industries is 
expected to rise from 8.6 million ounces in 2010 to 10.1 million ounces in 2016 according to JM. Since 2012, this has 
significantly outpaced the level of supply from producers and recycles sources.
PALLADIUM and PLATINUM MARKET PRICE HISTORY
Annual world-wide palladium and platinum supply is driven by a combination of current mine production, recycling and
draw-down of existing palladium and platinum inventories held by governments and financial investors. The prices of these 
metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the sale or purchase of the metals by 
various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and 
foreign currencies (particularly the South African rand and Russian ruble), changes in global and regional demand and political 
and economic conditions throughout the world. The price of palladium is thought to be more closely tied to industrial demand 
and the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in automotive production.
STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion of corporate strategic efforts is intended to update matters discussed in previous filings. For a
discussion of the Company's strategic decisions regarding exploration and development and capital expenditures, see the 
previous sections of this Item 2 entitled Exploration and Development and Capital Expenditures.
The Company's safety performance is of paramount importance to every employee of the Company and is the Company's 
primary consideration in all aspects of its operations. The Company normally assesses its safety performance using two broad 
sets of measures - incidence rates and regulatory compliance. Incidence rates in the U.S. usually are measured as the number of 
medically reportable events per 200,000 man hours. Regulatory compliance is measured in terms of the number and severity of 
citations issued to the Company and its contractors on site by Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) inspectors.
The(cid:160)Company’s overall incidence rate per 200,000 man hours in its Montana operations for the first six months of 2016 
was 2.36. This represents a 32.8% improvement in the incidence rate compared to the same period in 2015.(cid:160)For further detail, 
see Exhibit 95 - Mine Safety Disclosures, which is included as an exhibit to this filing.
The Company continues to focus on environmental excellence and works closely with governmental agencies and the
local communities to ensure its compliance with environmental regulations and address its neighbors' environmental concerns. 
Based on the success of the installed underdrain system at the East Boulder Mine, the Company has commenced work on the 
installation of an underdrain system within the waste rock storage area at the Stillwater Mine. The purpose of this underdrain 
system is to capture and treat meteorological water that is currently infiltrating through the embankment and increasing the 
nitrate levels observed in the adjacent groundwater. The elevated groundwater nitrate levels are the result of explosives residue 
containing nitrogen, within the waste rock from the mines, which is being solubilized and mobilized via the meteorological 
water. As part of the effort to reduce the groundwater nitrate levels and due to lower solubility levels, the Company switched its 
blasting agent from ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (ANFO) to stick powder, at substantial additional consumable costs, when the 
conditions were initially observed. Following installation of this underdrain system, it is anticipated that the Stillwater Mine
9
will switch back to ANFO as its primary blasting agent later this year, at a substantial consumable cost savings. Based on 
previous experience from the East Boulder mining operations, the Company believes, there is potential for further 
improvements in productivity based on the use of ANFO explosives.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed, along with the regulatory agencies, a joint review of the
reclamation and closure bond for the Stillwater Mine. As a result of this review, the closure bond for the Stillwater Mine 
increased from $19.5 million to $22.0 million. The updated bond amount accounts for further operational development through 
the year 2020.
Cost containment remains a key focus throughout the Company's operations. Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce 
is the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AISC, a non-GAAP financial measure, of overall cost 
efficiency of the Company's Montana operations. (See the later section of this Item 2 entitled All-in Sustaining Costs (A Non-
GAAP Financial Measure) for a more detailed explanation of AISC). For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's 
AISC averaged $594 per PGM mined ounce, a 3.1% decrease from the first quarter of 2016, and 24.3% lower than the AISC of 
$785 per PGM mined ounce achieved in the second quarter of 2015.
The Company's total workforce at June 30, 2016, was comprised of 1,426 employees, including 1,417 employees in
Montana and Colorado; and nine employees in the Canada and South America. This compares to 1,600 employees at June 30, 
2015, of which 1,591 were located in Montana and Colorado; and nine were in Canada and South America.
The Company seeks to maintain significant balance-sheet liquidity in order to manage against cyclical price risk in the
mining industry and against downturns in the broader economy. When combining highly-liquid investments with cash and cash 
equivalents, the Company's liquidity at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 totaled $442.2 million and $463.8 million, 
respectively. See "Note 12 - Investments", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to 
the Company's investments. Total principal outstanding (before discounts and deferred debt issuance costs) under the 
Company's long-term convertible debt obligations at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 totaled $335.7 million.
The Company continues to evaluate options to maximize stockholder value and the long-term health of its business,
particularly in light of volatility in commodity prices. The Company regularly considers the deployment of cash for 
acquisitions, internal growth projects, dividends, buyback of outstanding convertible debentures and share repurchases.
The Company currently has available excess capacity in its mine concentrators and in its Columbus processing facilities.
The Company has been exploring various opportunities to increase throughput at its processing facilities, primarily through 
growing its recycling business segment and potentially through other processing arrangements with third parties. The auto 
catalyst recycling business is very competitive and, following the significant increase in volumes fed in 2015, attaining further 
significant growth while maintaining margins may prove to be challenging.

Ounces sold and average realized price per ounce from PGM Recycling relate to ounces produced from processing of spent catalyst from catalytic 
converters and other industrial sources.
By-product metals sold reflect net values of realized prices (discounted due to product form) per unit sold.
The Company’s average realized price represents revenues, which include the effect of hedging gains and losses realized on commodity instruments 
and agreement discounts, divided by ounces sold. The average market price represents the average London market for the actual months of the 
period.
The Company reports a combined average realized and market price of palladium and platinum at the same ratio as ounces that are produced from 
the base metal refinery.
Net revenues from sales of Mine Production (including proceeds from the sale of by-products) were $106.4 million and
$119.0 million during the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The higher volumes of mined ounces sold in the 
second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015 were not sufficient to offset the significant reduction in 
average combined realized price per mined ounce in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to the second quarter of 2015.
The costs of metals sold from Mine Production totaled $75.6 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $80.6 
million for the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 6.2%. The decrease in costs is the result of higher production rates at the 
East Boulder Mine, labor reductions at the Stillwater Mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines.
Total recycling ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium fed to the smelter, including both purchased ounces and
ounces processed on a toll basis, increased to 169,900 ounces in the second quarter of 2016 from 151,600 ounces in the second 
quarter of 2015, an increase of 12.1%. Total sales revenues from PGM Recycling of $59.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 
were down 10.7% from the $66.3 million reported for the second quarter of 2015. Tolling revenues in the second quarter of 
2016 rose to $1.8 million on 70,700 tolled ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium processed and returned to customers, 
compared to $1.0 million on 37,400 ounces processed and returned to customers in the second quarter of 2015. However, 
revenues from sales of purchased recycling materials declined 13.0% in the second quarter of 2016 to $56.9 million on 85,300 
ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium sold, from $65.4 million on 68,100 ounces sold in the second quarter of 2015. The 
Company’s combined average realization on recycling sales of palladium, platinum and rhodium decreased to $666 per ounce 
in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $954 per ounce realized in the second quarter of 2015.
The costs of metals sold from PGM Recycling totaled $56.5 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $64.4 
million in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 12.3%. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in the total cost of 
acquiring recycling material for processing as well as lower volumes of purchased recycled material.

For the first six months of 2016, net revenues from sales of Mine Production (including proceeds from the sale of by-
products) totaled $192.2 million, a decrease of 21.5% compared to $244.7 million in the first six months of 2015. The higher 
volumes of mined ounces sold in the first six months of 2016 was not enough to offset the significantly lower realized PGM 
prices in the first six months of 2016 as compared to the first six months of 2015.
The cost of metals sold from Mine Production totaled $143.0 million in the first six months of 2016, compared to $160.7 
million in the first six months of 2015, a decrease of 11.0%. The decrease in costs is the result of higher production rates at the 
East Boulder Mine, labor reductions at the Stillwater Mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines. 
Royalties and severance taxes were also lower as a result of the significantly lower metals prices.
Revenues from PGM Recycling reflected a decrease of 24.2% during the first six months of 2016, to $106.9 million from
$141.0 million in the first six months of 2015. Recycling ounces sold during the first six months of 2016 totaled 148,700 
ounces, an increase of 4.2% compared to the 142,700 ounces sold in the first six months of 2015. The Company’s combined 
average realization on recycling sales (which include palladium, platinum and rhodium) decreased to $681 per ounce in the first 
six months of 2016 from $968 per ounce in the first six months of 2015. The decrease in recycling earnings during the first six 
months of 2016 is attributable to several factors, including a weak market due to lower commodity prices and offset by the 
draw-down of inventories contributing to the increase in ounces sold.
Overall, recycling costs of metals sold decreased by 25.2% to $102.5 million in the first six months of 2016 from $137.1
million in the first six months of 2015, mostly as the result of lower PGM prices.
During the first six months of 2016, the Company’s mining operations produced 274,400 ounces of PGMs, compared to
260,300 ounces in 2015 as shown in the following table:

General and administrative costs decreased to $16.6 million in the first six months of 2016, from $18.7 million in the first
six months of 2015, a decrease of approximately 11.2%. The Company recognized $4.4 million in exploration expenses 
primarily related to its mineral properties in Canada and South America in the first six months of 2016, compared to $1.8 
million in the first six months of 2015.
During the first six months of 2016, the Company recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $1.2 million,
compared to a net gain of $0.1 million in the first six months of 2015. Essentially all of these net gains related to the re-
measurement into U.S. dollars of the deferred taxes recorded in association with the acquisition of Peregrine Metals Ltd. 
During 2016, the rate of Argentine peso inflation has declined significantly, reducing the Company's currency gains. The gain 
in 2015 was a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a rapidly depreciating Argentine peso. The gains reflect the 
impact of a high inflation rate in Argentina as the deferred tax obligation is remeasured from Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Net cash provided by operating activities (which includes changes in working capital) was $16.9 million and $59.6
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s net cash flow from operating activities 
is affected by several key factors, including net realized prices for its products, the level of PGM production from its mines, 
cash operating costs, the volume of activity in its PGM Recycling segment, changes in inventory balances and the timing of 
cash receipts from final customers. Mining productivity rates and ore grades affect both PGM production and cash costs of 
production. The reported net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2016 reflected primarily lower 
realized PGM prices from mining activity along with higher recycling working capital balances, which was partially offset by 
higher recycling earnings and lower cash costs.
Changes in the cash costs and revenues per ounce of Mine Production generally flow through dollar-for-dollar into cash 
flow from operations. Using metals market prices at June(cid:160)30, 2016, a 10% reduction in annual PGM mined production would 
reduce annual cash flow from operations by an estimated $20.6 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, was approximately $33.4 million, comprised
of $4.0 million of net proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments offset by $38.4 million of cash capital 
expenditures and approximately $1.0 million in proceeds from the sale of long-term investments and the disposal of property, 
plant and equipment. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $116.0 million, 
comprised of $58.2 million of cash capital expenditures and approximately $57.8 million of net purchases of short-term 
investments.
Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.7 million, comprised of principal
payments on capital leases. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the net cash associated with financing activities was $1.0 
million, comprised of principal payments on the capital leases.
At June(cid:160)30, 2016, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $130.1 million, compared to $147.3 million at
December(cid:160)31, 2015. When combining highly liquid investments with available cash and cash equivalents, the Company’s 
balance sheet liquidity was $442.2 million at June(cid:160)30, 2016 compared to $463.8 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015. See "Note 12 - 
Investments", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the Company's investments. 
Net working capital (including cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investments) was $519.2 million at June(cid:160)30, 2016 
compared to $523.0 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015.
Outstanding balance sheet debt (current and long-term) reported at June(cid:160)30, 2016, was approximately $264.3 million, up 
from the $255.8 million at December(cid:160)31, 2015. The Company’s total principal debt includes approximately $263.8 million of 
1.75% convertible debentures and $0.5 million of 1.875% convertible debentures. The $263.8 million of 1.75% convertible 
debentures represents the net discounted value of the 1.75% notes, first redeemable in 2019, valued against a borrowing rate of 
8.5%, as the gross principal amount originally borrowed was $396.75 million. The total gross principal outstanding (before 
discounts and debt issuance costs) under the Company's long-term convertible debt obligations was $335.7 million at June(cid:160)30, 
2016.
The Company expects to make cash payments of $2.9 million for interest during the remaining six months of 2016
related to its outstanding debt obligations. The Company made cash payments for interest of $2.9 million for the six months 
ended June(cid:160)30, 2016, as compared to $3.6 million for the same period of 2015.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Company's contractual obligations at December(cid:160)31, 2015, are summarized in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis - Contractual Obligations" of the Company's Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on February 22, 2016. In the first six months of 2016, there were no material changes in the Company's 
contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business.

Sub-grade tons milled includes reef waste material only. Reef waste material is PGM-bearing mined material below the cutoff grade for proven and 
probable reserves but with sufficient economic value to justify processing it through the concentrator along with the mined ore. Total tons milled 
includes ore tons and sub-grade tons only. See “Proven and Probable Ore Reserves – Discussion” in the Company’s Form 10-K for further 
information.
Total cash costs include total operating costs plus royalties, insurance and taxes other than income taxes. Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net 
of credits, is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses to monitor and evaluate the efficiency of its mining operations. This measure of 
cost is not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Please see “Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-
GAAP Financial Measures” and the accompanying discussion for additional detail.
The concentrate tonnage and grade values are inclusive of periodic re-processing of smelter slag and internal furnace brick PGM bearing materials.

Ounces sold and average realized price per ounce from PGM Recycling relate to ounces produced from processing of spent catalyst from catalytic 
converters and other industrial sources.
By-product metals sold reflect net values of realized prices (discounted due to product form) per unit sold.
The Company’s average realized price represents revenues, hedging gains and losses realized on commodity instruments and agreement discounts, 
divided by ounces sold. The average market price represents the average London market for the actual months of the period.
The Company reports a combined average realized and market price of palladium and platinum at the same ratio as ounces that are produced from 
the base metal refinery.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures as indicators in assessing the performance of its mining and 
processing operations during any period. Because of the processing time required to complete the extraction of finished PGM 
products, there are typically lags of one to three months between ore production and sale of the finished product. Revenues in 
any period include some portion of material mined and processed from prior periods as the revenue recognition process is 
completed. Consequently, while costs of revenues (a GAAP measure included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)) appropriately reflects the expense associated with the materials sold in any period, the 
Company has developed certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the costs associated with its producing and processing 
activities in a particular period and to compare those costs between periods.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may also be of value to outside readers, both as 
general indicators of the Company’s mining efficiency from period to period and as insight into how the Company internally 
measures its operating performance, these non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized across the mining industry and in 
most cases will not be directly comparable to similar measures that may be provided by other companies. These non-GAAP 
financial measures are only useful as indicators of relative operational performance in any period, and because they do not take 
into account the inventory timing differences that are included in costs of revenues, they cannot meaningfully be used to 
develop measures of earnings or profitability. A reconciliation of these measures to costs of revenues, the most directly 
comparable GAAP financial measure, for each period shown is provided as part of the following tables, and a description of 
each non-GAAP financial measure is provided below.
Total Consolidated Costs of Revenues: For the Company as a whole, this measure is equal to total costs of revenues, as
reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the Stillwater Mine, the East 
Boulder Mine, and PGM Recycling and Other, the Company segregates the expenses within total costs of revenues that are 
directly associated with each of these activities and then allocates the remaining facility costs included in total cost of revenues 
in proportion to the monthly volumes from each activity. The resulting total costs of revenues measures for the Stillwater Mine, 
the East Boulder Mine and PGM Recycling and Other are equal, in the aggregate, to total consolidated costs of revenues as 
reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Total Cash Costs (Non-GAAP): This non-GAAP financial measure is calculated as total costs of revenues adjusted to
exclude costs of metals sold from PGM Recycling, depletion and depreciation and amortization for Mine Production and PGM 
Recycling (including in inventory), asset retirement costs, and timing differences resulting from changes in product inventories 
to arrive at Total Cash Costs before by-product and recycling credits. From this calculation, the Company deducts by-product 
and recycling income credits to arrive at Total Cash Costs, net of by-product and recycling credits. Total Cash Costs is a 
measure of extraction efficiency. The Company uses this measure as a comparative indication of the cash costs related to 
production and processing in its mining operations in any period.
When divided by the total tons milled in the respective period, Total Cash Costs per Ore Ton Milled (Non-GAAP),
measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of cash costs incurred per ton milled in that period. 
Because of variability of ore grade in the Company’s mining operations, production efficiency underground is frequently 
measured against ore tons produced rather than contained PGM ounces. Because ore tons are first weighed as they are fed into 
the mill, mill feed is the first point at which production tons are measured precisely. Consequently, Total Cash Costs per Ore 
Ton Milled (Non-GAAP) is a general measure of production efficiency, and is affected both by the level of Total Cash Costs 
(Non-GAAP) and by the volume of tons produced and fed to the mill.
When divided by the total recoverable PGM ounces from production in the respective period, Total Cash Costs per PGM 
Mined Ounce (Non-GAAP), measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of cash costs incurred per 
PGM mined ounce produced in that period. Recoverable PGM ounces from production are an indication of the amount of PGM 
product mined in any period. Because ultimately extracting PGM material is the objective of mining, the cash cost per PGM 
mined ounce of extracting and processing PGM ounces in a period is a useful measure for comparing extraction efficiency 
between periods and between the Company’s mines. Consequently, Total Cash Costs per PGM Mined Ounce (Non-GAAP) in 
any period is a general measure of extraction efficiency, and is affected by the level of Total Cash Costs (Non-GAAP), by the 
grade of the ore produced and by the volume of ore produced in the period.

All-In Sustaining Costs
(Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
(Unaudited)
All-In Sustaining Costs (Non-GAAP): This non-GAAP financial measure is used as an indicator from period to period
of the level of total cash required by the Company to maintain and operate the existing mines, including corporate 
administrative costs and replacement capital. The measure is calculated beginning with total combined cash costs, net of credits 
(another non-GAAP financial measure, described above), and adding to it the recycling income credit, domestic corporate 
general and administrative costs (excluding any depreciation and general and administrative costs of foreign subsidiaries) and 
that portion of total capital expenditures associated with sustaining the current level of mining operations. Capital expenditures, 
however, for Blitz, Graham Creek (prior to 2015) and certain other one-time projects are not included in the calculation.
When divided by the total recoverable PGM mined ounces produced in the respective period, All-In Sustaining Costs 
per PGM Mined Ounce (Non-GAAP) provides an indication of the level of total cash required to maintain and operate 
the mines per PGM ounce produced in the period. Recoverable PGM ounces from production are an indication of the amount 
of PGM product extracted through mining in any period. Because the objective of PGM mining activity is to extract PGM 
material, the all-in cash costs per PGM mined ounce to produce PGM material, administer the business and sustain the 
operating capacity of the mines is a useful measure for comparing overall extraction efficiency between periods. This measure 
is affected by the total level of spending in the period and by the grade and volume of mined ore produced.

Underlying Earnings (Loss)
(Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
(Unaudited)
Underlying Earnings (Loss) (Non-GAAP): This non-GAAP financial measure is considered by the Company to be
reflective of the actual income / loss position. This non-GAAP financial measure provides to investors and analysts the ability 
to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company relating to the production, processing and sale of PGMs, 
by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on the results for the reported periods. The measure is calculated 
beginning with Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and adding back impairment charges, one-time event 
charges and charges infrequent to the Company's continuing operations and the income tax effect of such adjustment. Net loss 
attributable to noncontrolling interest has been adjusted for the noncontrolling interest's ownership percentage of any applicable 
impairment charges to which the noncontrolling interest has an ownership. The Company's determination of the components of 
Underlying earnings (loss) are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by 
mining industry analysts.
Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common
stockholders and Underlying earnings (loss) as follows:
(In thousands)
Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and non-producing
mineral properties
Income tax effect of adjustment
Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders
       Impairment loss attributable to noncontrolling interest
Underlying earnings (loss)
