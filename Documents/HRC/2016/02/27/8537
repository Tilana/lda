<p><i>Summary 
</i> The report addresses Israel&#8217;s compliance with its obligations under international 
law, in relation to the situation in the Palestinian territories that it has occupied since 1967. 
Israel&#8217;s persistent lack of cooperation with the fulfilment of the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur, as well as other United Nations human rights mechanisms, is highlighted. The 
Special Rapporteur focuses attention on concerns regarding the expansion of Israeli 
settlements, in particular in East Jerusalem, the consequences of the Israeli blockade of the 
Gaza Strip and the treatment of Palestinian children detained by Israeli authorities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Unfortunately, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 needs to again call to the attention of the 
membership of the Human Rights Council the continuing refusal of the Government of 
Israel to allow the Rapporteur to visit the occupied Palestinian territories. Repeated 
attempts have been made to engage the Government of Israel in discussion with the hope of 
reversing the policies that led to the detention and expulsion of the Special Rapporteur from 
Ben-Gurion Airport on 14 December 2008, but so far without any response. Efforts will be 
made to seek the necessary cooperation of the Government of Israel in relation to the 
obligation of the Special Rapporteur to discharge official undertakings of the United 
Nations. Such cooperation should be understood as a fundamental legal obligation incident 
to membership in the Organization.  
</p>
<p>2. As repeated efforts to call this situation to the attention of the Human Rights Council 
and the General Assembly have to date produced no positive results, the Special Rapporteur 
appeals on the occasion of this report for a more robust attempt to secure the cooperation of 
the Government of Israel. It should be recalled that Article 104 of the Charter of the United 
Nations declares that the Organization &#8220;shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members 
such legal capacity as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and the fulfilment 
of its purposes&#8221;. Article 105, paragraph 2, specifies that those who represent the United 
Nations shall enjoy in the territory of State Members: &#8220;such privileges and immunities as 
are necessary for the independent exercise of their function in connexion with the 
Organization&#8221;. These provisions were elaborated in the Convention on the Privileges and 
Immunities of the United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly on 13 February 1946, 
and then implemented via the Agreement between the Swiss Federal Council and the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, dated 19 April 1946. Article VI, Section 22, 
thereof, entitled &#8220;Experts on Missions for the United Nations&#8221;, is particularly relevant, 
setting forth the rather extensive duties of Members to cooperate with such representatives 
as special rapporteurs and to avoid interfering with their independence.  
</p>
<p>3. It should be pointed out that the Government of Israel has also not cooperated with 
other recent important initiatives of the Human Rights Council relating to the occupied 
Palestinian territories, including the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on 
the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48) and the report of the independent international fact-
finding mission to investigate violations of international law, including international 
humanitarian and human rights law, resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships 
carrying humanitarian assistance (A/HRC/15/21). This pattern of non-cooperation with 
official undertakings of the Human Rights Council should produce a concerted attempt by 
this organ and the Office of the Secretary-General to do what can be done to obtain the 
future cooperation of the Government of Israel. 
</p>
<p>4. Closely related to issues associated with non-cooperation are several outstanding 
matters bearing on non-implementation. The report of the International Fact-Finding 
Mission on the Gaza Conflict on the basis of its findings of severe and systematic violations 
of international humanitarian law recommended that several steps be taken to assess the 
accountability of the perpetrators of criminal acts committed during the Gaza conflict 
(2008/09). There is currently no sign of any attempt to mobilize effective support for the 
implementation of these recommendations. Moreover, evidence of an Israeli willingness to 
impose credible levels of accountability for criminal acts of its soldiers and leaders in 
accordance with international standards remains absent. These conclusions were reaffirmed 
by the report of the Committee of independent experts that assessed investigations by Israel 
and the Palestinian sides into the Gaza conflict (A/HRC/15/50). In addition, the same </p>


<p>conclusions seem to pertain to the report of the independent international fact-finding 
mission on the incident of the humanitarian flotilla of 31 May 2010.1 Thus, a strong 
impression is being formed within the international community that a lack of political will 
exists with which to implement recommendations based on authoritative findings that Israel 
has been guilty of flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and international 
criminal law. This impression of unwillingness to push forward with implementation 
fosters widespread perceptions of impunity with respect to the conduct of Israel, and in the 
case of flotilla incident limits and delays the opportunity of flotilla passengers to pursue 
remedies for harms unlawfully inflicted. This dynamic of evasion and delay weakens 
overall respect for international law, as well as the credibility of the Human Rights Council 
in relation to its own initiatives. More substantively, it deprives the Palestinian people 
living under occupation of their rights to receive the benefits of protection conferred in 
circumstances of occupation by international law and, specifically, the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) 
and the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. 
</p>
<p>5. Given the long duration, the severity and continuing nature of the violations of many 
fundamental legal obligations of Israel as the occupying Power, these failures of 
implementation of international humanitarian law are experienced on the ground through 
various acute forms of abuse and suffering endured on a frequent, often on a daily, basis by 
the civilian population of the occupied Palestinian territories. Many political leaders have 
confirmed this assessment in recent months, and yet the organized international community 
remains silent. For instance, the Foreign Minister of Germany, Guido Westerville, after a 
recent visit to Gaza declared that the persistence of the blockade was &#8220;not acceptable&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>6. Furthermore, the report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on 
the incident of the humanitarian flotilla found that the violence used by the Israel Defence 
Forces when the flotilla was attacked was &#8220;not only disproportionate but demonstrated 
levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence&#8221; as well involving &#8220;an unacceptable 
level of brutality&#8221;.3 The report concludes that the Israeli attack resulted in &#8220;grave 
violations&#8221; of international human right and humanitarian law, as specified in article 147 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention.4 It also solicits cooperation from the Government of Israel 
to identify the perpetrators of this violence, whose identity was hidden by masks worn 
during the attack on the flotilla. Such information was being sought &#8220;with a view to 
prosecuting the culpable&#8221;.5 As a result of these findings, the Government of Israel is 
obliged to end the blockade in all its aspects with a sense of urgency, to cooperate in the 
identification of perpetrators of the violence and of the leaders responsible for the 
underlying policies so that effective procedures of accountability can be employed and 
finally to compensate individuals and surviving family members in appropriate amounts for 
the unlawful harm suffered. Moreover, civil society actors that engage in such missions for 
genuine humanitarian purposes should be allowed to carry out their work without 
interference.  
</p>
<p>7. The Rapporteur believes that there are important issues of language that arise from 
the cumulative effects of Israeli violations of international humanitarian law, human rights 
law and criminal law. It becomes misleading to treat these violations as distinct behavioural 
</p>
<p>  
 1 At the time of the submission of this report, there is still outstanding the report and recommendations 
</p>
<p>of the Panel of Inquiry into the flotilla incident established by the Secretary-General and the Turkel 
Commission formed by the Government of Israel.

<p>instances disconnected from broader consequences that are either designed by intention or 
the natural outcome of accumulating circumstances (so-called &#8220;facts on the ground&#8221;). These 
concerns about language are accentuated because Israel is the stronger party in diplomatic 
settings and generally enjoys the unconditional support of the United States of America. 
Indeed, unlawful Israeli behaviour that starts out as &#8220;facts&#8221; have over time been 
transformed into &#8220;conditions&#8221;, or in the words of the American Secretary of State, Hilary 
Clinton, &#8220;subsequent developments&#8221; that are treated as essentially irreversible. Such 
transformation is true of several aspects of the occupation, including at a minimum the 
settlement blocs and accompanying infrastructure of roads and security zones, as well as 
the separation wall. To call appropriate attention to the effects and implications of these 
unambiguously unlawful patterns, and their somewhat perverse ex post facto attempted 
&#8220;legalization&#8221; and &#8220;normalization&#8221; requires stronger expository language to better 
understand the unbridled assault upon Palestinian rights and prospects for meaningful self-
determination. It is against this background that this report has decided to employ such 
terms as &#8220;annexation&#8221;, &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;, &#8220;apartheid&#8221;, &#8220;colonialist&#8221; and &#8220;criminality&#8221; as 
more adequately expressing the actual nature of the situation in the occupied Palestinian 
territories. Such labels can be perceived as emotive, and admittedly require a finding by a 
court of law to be legally conclusive. However, such language, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
view, more accurately describes the realities of the occupation as of the end of 2010 than 
the more neutral-seeming description of factual developments that disguises the structures 
of this occupation which has undermined the rights under international law of the 
Palestinian people for 43 years. 
</p>
<p>8. Against this background, the Rapporteur deems it appropriate at this time to renew 
the call of the former Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, John 
Dugard, for a referral of the situation to the International Court of Justice for an 
authoritative decision as to whether, &#8220;elements of the [Israeli] occupation constitute forms 
of colonialism and of apartheid&#8221;.6 It should be emphasized that the crime of apartheid is no 
longer attached to the racist policies of the South African regime that generated the 
International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. It 
is now a crime associated with an &#8220;institutionalized regime of systematic oppression &#8230; by 
one racial group over any other racial group &#8230; committed with the intention of maintaining 
that regime&#8221;.7 The crime of apartheid is also treated as &#8220;a grave breach&#8221; of article 85, 
paragraph 4 (c), of the First Geneva Protocol, an international treaty with 169 parties, and 
widely regarded as universally binding because it is declaratory of customary international 
law. As will be illustrated in the present report, the dual discriminatory structure of settler 
administration, security, mobility, and law as compared to the Palestinian subjugation 
seems to qualify the long Israeli occupation of the West Bank as an instance of apartheid. 
The referral to the International Court of Justice should also seek clarification as to whether 
the pattern of continuing unlawful settlement, manipulation of residence credentials, 
expulsions in East Jerusalem qualify as &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; and, if so, how this behaviour 
should be viewed from the perspective of the international law of belligerent occupation. 
</p>
<p>9. It is also important to underscore what should be self-evident, namely, that Israel has 
State responsibility for all violations of international humanitarian law in the territories 
under occupation, above all, for the settlements. State responsibility cannot be evaded by 
delegation or failure to deal with violations of Palestinian rights in the occupied territories 
arising from the behaviour of municipal or private sector actors, as in connection especially 
with claims of unlawful settlement building and ethnic cleansing allegations in East 
Jerusalem.

<p><b> II. Reviving the direct peace talks 
</b></p>
<p>10. At present, there has been a pause in the peace negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority and feverish diplomatic efforts are being made to continue 
discussions between the parties. These efforts are relevant to the Rapporteur, as the 
generally accepted route to the fulfilment of the right of self-determination for the 
Palestinian people living under occupation has been to achieve an Israeli withdrawal in 
accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) or on the basis of an agreement 
between the parties. Whether such negotiations can be effective and legitimate is itself a 
much contested question that will not be considered here, nor will the presumed outcome of 
establishing an independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories be assessed from the 
perspective as to whether the accumulation of facts on the ground has made such an 
outcome unattainable as a practical matter. In a recent report to the General Assembly 
(A/65/331), the Special Rapporteur put forth the argument that the developments in the 
West Bank and East Jerusalem have transformed a de jure framework of occupation into a 
de facto condition of annexation. The Rapporteur remains convinced that Israeli 
settlements, including related infrastructure roads, buffer zones and the separation wall, 
continue to be the single most important obstacle to resuming the peace talks, assuming that 
such talks can make constructive contributions to the realization of Palestinian rights, which 
is far from self-evident. The Palestinian Authority has repeatedly said that it would not 
resume negotiations without an unqualified freeze on settlement expansion, including East 
Jerusalem. President Mahmoud Abbas stated: &#8220;We want a complete cessation of settlement 
construction. We don&#8217;t want to be deceived with another moratorium or a half moratorium 
or a quarter moratorium. If they want us to talk to the direct talks, the settlements must stop 
completely&#8221;.8 The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, made the same avowal: &#8220;There 
are no compromises over settlement construction &#8230; The Israeli government must choose 
between peace and settlements, because it can&#8217;t combine the two together&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p>11. Further, the Rapporteur believes that there are grounds for concern with respect to 
maintaining the rights of the Palestinian people in relation to the inducements offered to 
Israel to extend the partial moratorium on settlement expansion. Since this question is one 
of principle, it remains relevant despite the announcement of the Government of the United 
States that it will no longer press the Government of Israel to freeze settlement expansion. 
It is important to bear in mind that the unlawfulness of the settlements has been confirmed 
over and over again by reference to the textual language of article 49(6), of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention, by decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security 
Council and by numerous statements on the part of respected world leaders. Therefore, 
providing Israel with substantive benefits for temporarily and partially halting an unlawful 
activity that infringes on Palestinian prospects for self-determination raises disturbing 
issues of principle and precedent. The former American Ambassador to Israel, Daniel 
Kurtzer, has referred to such an effort by the United States to renew the negotiations as 
designed &#8220;to reward Israel for its bad behavior&#8221; in the past and present.10 It is also widely 
reported that, if Israel accepts the offer, it will never again be asked to impose a moratorium 
on settlement expansion in either the West Bank or East Jerusalem. What is most relevant

 10 &#8220;With settlement deal, U.S. will be rewarding Israel's bad behavior&#8221;, <i>Washington Post</i>, 21<b> </b>November 
</p>
<p>2010. Robert Fisk has phrased an objection in even harsher language: &#8220;The current American bribe to 
Israel, and the latter&#8217;s reluctance to accept it, in return for even a temporary end to the theft of 
somebody else&#8217;s property would be [normally] regarded as preposterous&#8221;. &#8220;An American bribe that 
stinks of appeasement&#8221;, <i>The Independent</i>, 20 November 2010.<b> </b></p>


<p>here is the disregard of the legal rights of the Palestinians living under occupation. If a 
pattern of repeated violation of rights, as here, is to be treated as a new platform of legality, 
then a terrible precedent is being established for these parties and generally. There can be 
no positive significance to a negotiating process that incorporates an acceptance and 
legitimization of Israeli settlements and their infrastructure of roads, which constitute a 
fundamentally unlawful dimension of the prolonged Israeli occupation of the West Bank 
and East Jerusalem. In this respect, only a permanent commitment to freeze settlement 
growth would signal the minimal good faith required to support the belief that peace talks 
are a viable path at this stage to reach the essential goals of Palestinian self-determination 
and a sustainable peace with security for both peoples. 
</p>
<p>12. On the matter of Palestinian self-determination, the most basic right whose exercise 
is precluded by the continuation of the occupation, Palestinian Authority has stated that if 
the talks fail it will establish a Palestinian state on its own even in the face of the 
occupation. President Abbas expressed this view as follows: &#8220;If we fail in [the 
negotiations], we want to go to the United Nations Security Council to ask the world to 
recognize the Palestinian state&#8221;.11 This is consistent with the frequently discussed plans for 
Palestinian statehood articulated by the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister, Salam 
Fayyad. Mr. Fayyad has announced plans for constructing in the West Bank the 
institutional components of Palestinian statehood, and his efforts have been viewed as 
credible and impressive in many independent quarters.12 In Mr. Fayyad&#8217;s recent words, &#8220;I 
firmly believe [Palestinian statehood] can happen. We need to build up a sense of 
inevitability about this. I think it will happen next year&#8221;.13 A report issued by the World 
Bank in October 2010 also encouraged these expectations, suggesting that if the Palestinian 
Authority maintains &#8220;its performance in institution-building and delivery of public services 
&#8230;, it is well-positioned for the establishment of a Palestinian state at any point in the near 
future&#8221;.14 Nevertheless, it needs to be understood that such a Palestinian state could be 
viewed as falling far short of realizing the minimum content of an acceptable enactment of 
self-determination, lacking in resolution of outstanding core issues such as refugees, 
Jerusalem, borders, water and settlements. In a notable recent development, with many 
legal and political implications, Brazil and Argentina formally recognized Palestine as a 
state within its 1967 borders, which in effect, seems to be the territorial vision of 
Palestinian self-determination contained in Security Council resolution 242 (1967)(subject 
to minor border adjustments, but not sufficient to allow annexation of the settlement blocs 
in &#8220;exchange&#8221; for largely arid land abutting Gaza, or to transfer Arab villages currently 
behind the green line) and encompassing the crucial non-territorial issue of refugees.  
</p>
<p>13. Another matter of concern for the Rapporteur during the reporting period is the 
passage of an Israeli law that would subject any agreement reached in intergovernmental 
negotiations to be made subject to a national referendum unless approved by 80 or more 
members of the Knesset.15 If an agreement were to be reached that embodied the rights and 
duties of the respective governmental actors, adding internal requirements of approval by 
either a parliamentary super-majority or a national referendum would only unnecessarily 
burden that process. Saeb Erekat has gone a step further and stated that the new legislation

<p>&#8220;is making a mockery of international law&#8221;.16 States do customarily require some form of 
legislative endorsement of international treaty obligations. In this instance, the public 
validation by Israel of any agreement reached might add to its political legitimacy and the 
likelihood of future respect and, if it failed to gain sufficient Israeli support, could signal the 
unsustainability of the agreement. Thus, this new constraint on the finality of a negotiated 
settlement can at best be viewed as ambivalent, and not itself unlawful, although it might be 
imprudent, if the objective is to end the conflict through a negotiated agreement, a position 
that is increasingly confronted by doubts.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Continuing expansion of settlements in the occupied 
Palestinian territories  </b></p>
<p>14. Given the centrality that has been accorded by both sides to the settlement 
phenomenon, the Rapporteur believes that more detailed attention to the facts and legal 
implications of recent settlement expansion seems appropriate. The Israeli 10-month self-
delimited &#8220;moratorium&#8221; on settlement expansion in the West Bank expired on 26 
September 2010, leading to the breakdown of the briefly resumed peace process and giving 
rise to lengthy negotiations aimed at re-establishing the moratorium that have now been 
abandoned. However, several points must be noted. First, the 10-month moratorium did not 
stop settlement construction but only slowed the pace of expansion in some parts of the 
West Bank;17 it did not purport to freeze settlement construction in occupied East 
Jerusalem, contending, contrary to the international legal and political consensus, that the 
whole of Jerusalem, as expanded by Israeli law since 1967, is unoccupied, and that the 
whole city is the capital of Israel, leaving no part of the city to be available as the capital of 
a future Palestinian state. In the West Bank, settler construction of public facilities such as 
schools and community centres as well as thousands of housing units already under 
construction continued unabated during the moratorium. Second, according to the 
movement Peace Now, a surge of settlement building took place in the first six weeks 
following the end of the moratorium on 26 September.18 Further, the settlers managed to 
start to build 1,629 housing units, and to dig the foundations for 1,116 of them. Work 
started in 63 settlements, 46 of them east of the separation wall and 17 on the western side 
of it.<b> </b>In all of 2009, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics data, work on 1,888 
new housing units have started. Had the construction continued at the same speed without 
the moratorium, there would have been 1,574 units during the 10-month period. In the six 
weeks following the end of the freeze, the settlers managed to start a similar number of 
units attesting to the reality that the settlement freeze was no more than a 10-month delay in 
the construction.19 In fact, the rate of settlement construction quadrupled compared to what 
it had been during the two years before the moratorium.20 Third, and perhaps most 
importantly, the underlying premises of the moratorium were never drawn into question, 
namely, that it was a matter of Israeli discretion to initiate or terminate a settlement freeze. 
Official diplomacy never considered the relevance of the continuing violation arising from 
the presence of the settlements or the questionable status of the 500,000 Israeli settlers who

<p>now reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and benefit from a preferential legal and 
administrative structure, which contributes to the impression of apartheid (as a result of its 
discriminatory, coercive and ethnically specified characteristics). In this respect, the 
magnitude of the settlement phenomenon, combined with its persistence and character, also 
warrant concern that the occupation is a form of colonialist annexation that has been 
established with a clear intention of permanence. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The de facto annexation of East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Israeli insistence on excluding East Jerusalem from the partial moratorium and 
its overall attitude toward its status is of further concern to the Rapporteur. Prime Minister 
Binyamin Netanyahu, along with other Israeli leaders, has repeatedly confirmed continuing 
rejection by Israel of United Nations resolutions and other relevant aspects of international 
law recognizing that the occupied Palestinian territory includes East Jerusalem. Mr. 
Netanyahu dramatized this point when he recently stated that &#8220;Jerusalem is not a settlement 
&#8211; Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel. Israel has never restricted itself regarding 
any kind of building in the city, which is home to some 800,000 people &#8211; including during 
the 10-month construction moratorium in the West Bank. Israel sees no connection between 
the peace process and the planning and building policy in Jerusalem, something that hasn&#8217;t 
changed for the past 40 years&#8221;.21 Although such an assertion amounts to defiance of 
international law, it is a significant expression of Israeli diplomatic posture, casting further 
doubt on what could be expected to emerge from a negotiating process that attempts to 
foreclose a fundamental Palestinian right to have the part of historic Jerusalem occupied by 
Israeli in 1967 as its national capital. Again, it is disturbing to note the absence of formal 
objection by the international community and interested Governments to such an Israeli 
posture taken in advance of negotiations.  
</p>
<p>16. The Rapporteur finds that by December 2010, the pace of settlement expansion in 
East Jerusalem had in fact escalated. On 4 November 2010, the Government of Israel issued 
tenders for 238 new housing units in the East Jerusalem settlements of Pisgat Zeev and 
Ramot22 and the following day announced plans for construction of 1,352 new housing 
units elsewhere in East Jerusalem. Continued construction in addition to settlers&#8217; forcibly 
taking over Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem has resulted in the expulsion of Palestinian 
residents from their homes. Palestinian families, some of whom have lived in their homes 
for generations, have been expelled by Israeli police and settlers. In July 2010, a large 
Palestinian family that had lived in their home in the Old City for more than 70 years was 
expelled by police-backed settlers who then took over the house.23 In November 2010, 
settler organizations took control of two houses in Palestinian neighbourhoods of Jabal al-
Mukkaber and al-Tur in East Jerusalem resulting in forcible eviction of several Palestinian 
families from their homes.24 The Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood has also been the subject of 
persistent attempts by Israeli settler groups to take over land and property in order to 
establish new settlements in the area. As a result, over 60 Palestinians have lost their homes 
and another 500 remain at risk of forced eviction, dispossession and displacement in the

<p>near future.25 In Silwan neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, Israeli families have forcibly 
taken over Palestinian homes, turning them into guarded settlement compounds flying 
Israeli flags.26 Many of the settler organizations are backed by private donors from 
abroad,27 raising the issue of international complicity, as well as Israeli State responsibility, 
with these continuing violations of international law. Moreover, The Government of Israel 
and the Jerusalem Municipality support the settlers&#8217; actions in Palestinian neighbourhoods 
in East Jerusalem and the Old City by allocating private security guards, paid for by taxes, 
to protect the compounds; sending security forces to accompany takeover of Palestinian 
houses; funding and promoting building and development projects in the compounds; and 
transferring Government assets to the control of the organizations.28 This support further 
illustrates the institutional and systematic discrimination against the Palestinian residents of 
Jerusalem by Israel, as well as ongoing Israeli efforts to create what are euphemistically 
called &#8220;facts on the ground&#8221; for the annexation of East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Expulsions from East Jerusalem as a means to annexation 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur believes that the expulsions from East Jerusalem go beyond 
those linked to house seizures or demolitions &#8211; and beyond the immediate dire 
consequences to individuals and families facing the loss of their homes &#8211; and form part of 
the broader picture of annexation, not as an Israeli legal claim but enacted increasingly as 
evidence of an Israeli political project. Israel carries out new punishments against 
Palestinians in Jerusalem, including threats of the revocation of Jerusalem residency rights 
of Palestinians living legally in Jerusalem.  
</p>
<p>18. In one of the most egregious examples, in July 2010, four Palestinian citizens of 
Israel, who were elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, including one 
former Council minister, were given notice that their right to Jerusalem residency was 
being revoked, after the four politicians refused to renounce their ties to Hamas.29 Efforts to 
expel these parliamentarians were resumed in the summer of 2010 and finally, on 8 
December 2010, one of these individuals was deported from Jerusalem.30 The expulsion of 
the Council&#8217;s members from Jerusalem is a violation of the article 49(6) of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention, which explicitly prohibits the forcible transfer of protected persons. It 
also sets a particularly dangerous precedent for the removal of more than 270,000 
Palestinians living in East Jerusalem.31 As the Special Rapporteur has noted before, it is 
particularly worrying that Israel appears ready to forcibly transfer these individuals based 
on their supposed lack of allegiance to the state of Israel.32 Israel, as an occupying Power, is 
prohibited from transferring civilian persons from East Jerusalem and from forcing 
Palestinians to swear allegiance or otherwise affirm their loyalty to the State of Israel. The 
revocation of residency permits, home demolitions and evictions, settlement construction, 
the separation of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank and its annexation to Israel,

<p>and other Israeli measures to push Palestinian residents out of the city will cumulatively 
make the creation of a viable Palestinian state, with its capital as East Jerusalem, 
impossible.33  
</p>
<p>19. The evidence mounts that from a longer vantage point, the overall pattern combining 
forced expulsions of Palestinians outwards and of Government-supported voluntary 
transfers of Israeli settlers inwards reflects a systematic policy of Israel to set the stage for 
an overall dispossession of Palestinians and the establishment of permanent control over 
territories occupied since 1967. According to a United Nations report, forced population 
transfer, or ethnic cleansing, is defined as the &#8220;systematic, coercive and deliberate &#8230; 
movement of population into or out of an area &#8230; with the effect or purpose of altering the 
demographic composition of a territory &#8230; particularly when that ideology or policy asserts 
the dominance of a certain group over another&#8221;.34 There is no question that, with its policy 
of Palestinian expulsion and dispossession in Jerusalem, Israel continues to be responsible 
for a gradual, incremental, yet cumulatively devastating policy designed to achieve the 
ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. West Bank roads and international complicity in 
perpetuating the occupation 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Rapporteur strongly believes that the wider infrastructure of occupation and in 
particular the dual system of roads represents a growing violation by Israel, the occupying 
Power, of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of 
Apartheid and, more pertinently, of apartheid as an instance of a crime against humanity as 
specified in the statute governing the operations of the International Criminal Court. The 
dual system of roads, as correlated with legal regimes, creates two domains in the West 
Bank: one for privileged Israeli settlers and the other for subjugated Palestinians living 
under an occupation. This is particularly visible in the Government and international 
funding of a network of alternative roads designed to facilitate Palestinian travel, while 
institutionalizing Israeli military control over the existing main roads, which are then 
accessible only to Israeli settlers. Many of these roads are also being constructed or 
upgraded in Area C &#8211; the approximately 62 per cent of the West Bank, which according to 
the 1995 Oslo agreement remains under Israeli administrative and military control, and 
where the material conditions of the Palestinians living in Area C compares extremely 
unfavorably with conditions in areas A and B, and even with the wretched conditions under 
blockade in Gaza. In those cases, the roads remain under control of the occupying Power 
and thus largely inaccessible to Palestinians (except those very few who obtain a permit), 
while the international aid and money used to pay for the roads is money &#8211; diverted from 
funding streams ostensibly aimed at improving the lives of Palestinians living under 
occupation &#8211; instead benefits the occupying Power. 
</p>
<p>21. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has reported that Israeli 
authorities continue to implement measures to restrict Palestinian movement and access 
and, at the same time, to facilitate the movement of Israeli settlers.35 These measures 
include, namely, the expansion of the alternative (&#8220;fabric of life&#8221;) road network;

<p>checkpoints (including partial checkpoints); and the unstaffed obstacles, including 
roadblocks, earthmounds, earth walls, road gates, road barriers and trenches.36 These 
measures exact a price from Palestinians. For example, the &#8220;fabric of life&#8221; roads, which 
often require the seizure of private Palestinian lands, reconnect a few of the Palestinian 
communities that were disconnected due to the restricted access of Palestinians to a main 
road or due to the obstruction of a road by the separation wall. They, however, continue to 
reinforce the exclusion of Palestinians from the primary road network and undermine the 
territorial contiguity between different areas.37  
</p>
<p>22. Whether inadvertently or not, the role of the international donor community has led 
to a consolidation of Israeli control in the West Bank through the two-tiered system of 
roads. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has 
acknowledged that all its West Bank projects in Area C, including road construction, must 
be carried out through prior coordination with the Government of Israel.38 In other words, 
USAID and American taxpayers are financing, and thereby further entrenching, the Israeli 
de facto annexation of the West Bank.39 In one specific example, USAID announced in 
June 2010 that United States taxpayers had paid for road construction in the West Bank, 
boasting that &#8220;after completion of a road project in the southern West Bank, trade between 
Dahriyeh and the neighboring city of Beer Sheva (approximately 100,000 residents total) 
increased dramatically&#8221;.40 The West Bank area between Dahriyeh and Beer Sheva lies 
largely within Area C, thus aid funds designated for Palestinian residents is instead helping 
Israel finance the occupation. In another example in a nearby area, Nidal Hatim, a resident 
of Battir village near Bethlehem, described his inability to use Route 60, the main road 
from Bethlehem to his home village and the principal north-south traffic artery through the 
West Bank; &#8220;To go on the highway, we have to go through the checkpoint and turn around. 
I have a West Bank Palestinian ID, so I can&#8217;t go through the checkpoint&#8221;.41 Instead, he 
takes a side road that is currently being built by the Palestinian Authority with USAID 
support. The side road, still under construction, weaves around and under the four-lane 
Route 60, which is now used mostly by Israeli settlers. Upon completion, this &#8220;fabric of 
life&#8221; road is expected to be the sole access point connecting the villages in the western 
section of Bethlehem governorate with the urban area of Bethlehem.42 According to the 
Israeli human rights organization B&#8217;Tselem, &#8220;the dual road system in the West Bank will in 
the long run cement Israeli control. The tunnel that connects with Battir can be controlled 
by one army jeep&#8221;.43 The Palestinian Authority grants approval for some of the roads. 
However, that does not change the legal consequence of an outside-Government funding 
infrastructure that consolidates the process of de facto annexation already under way in the

Government supplying the funds being deemed complicit in the illegal occupation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Continuation of the Gaza blockade  
</b></p>
<p>23. It is important to underscore at the outset the conclusions drawn by the report of the 
independent international fact-finding mission on the incident of the humanitarian flotilla. 
The report reached a series of conclusions that are likely to become authoritative so far as 
the international assessment is concerned and have some wider policy implications with 
regard to the continuing blockade and occupation of Gaza. Perhaps, the most important of 
these implications, as of 31 May 2010, is &#8220;the firm conclusion that a humanitarian crisis 
existed&#8221; at the time in Gaza on the basis of a &#8220;preponderance of evidence from impeccable 
sources&#8221; that &#8220;is too overwhelming to come to a contrary opinion&#8221;.44 The report of the 
Mission further concludes that the existence of a humanitarian crisis is enough by itself to 
make the blockade &#8220;unlawful&#8221;45 and, by extension, to regard the interception of the flotilla 
in international waters as a violation of international law.46 It should be noted that the core 
unlawfulness of the blockade, quite independent of its overall humanitarian effects, is that it 
constitutes a clear, systematic and sustained instance of collective punishment imposed on 
an entire civilian population in direct violation of article 33 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. One dramatic further finding is &#8220;that a deplorable situation exists in Gaza&#8221;, 
such that action by humanitarian organizations to break an unlawful and cruel blockade of 
this sort is fully justified.47 This is especially so when, as here, &#8220;the international 
community is unwilling for whatever reason to take positive action&#8221;.48 Such an 
interpretation of the situation confronting the people of Gaza, and having persisted and 
worsened ever since Israeli sanctions were imposed in 2006 and dramatically escalated by 
the blockade established in 2007, is a powerful vindication of the humanitarian rationale for 
the flotilla offered by its organizers and denied by Israeli officials, who repeatedly refute 
that any humanitarian crisis exists in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>24. The Rapporteur has found that the situation of the civilian population in Gaza 
continues to be of critical concern. In 2010, Israeli uses of force resulted in 58 Palestinians 
killed in Gaza (including 22 civilians) plus 233 Palestinians injured (including 208 
civilians).49 Israel has declared a buffer zone that extends for 1,500 metres into Gaza from 
the border fence (comprising 17 per cent of Gaza), and Israeli military personnel fire at 
farmers and children who are pursuing normal peaceful activities close to the border.50 
Israeli naval forces also restrict Gaza fishing boats to three nautical miles from shore and 
fire warning shots should these boats go beyond this limit.51 These characteristics of the 
ongoing Israeli relationship to Gaza are strongly confirmatory of the legal and factual 
assessment that Gaza remains an occupied territory.

<p>25. Despite the announced easing of the blockade after the flotilla incident of 31 May 
2010, the dire humanitarian situation persists in Gaza.52 Unfortunately, despite some 
selective easing of the blockade, its essential features persist with continuing hardship and 
hazard for the entire civilian population of Gaza.53 The most recent statistics available, for 
instance, suggest that an average of 780 truckloads per week of humanitarian goods had 
entered Gaza in late November 2010 (as compared to 944 truckloads after the reported 
easing of the blockade on 20 June 2010) and this total was only 28 per cent of the weekly 
average before the blockade was imposed in June 2007.54 According to a recent report by 
25 non-governmental organizations, Gaza requires 670,000 truckloads of construction 
material to rebuild after the Israeli assault in January 2009. However, the Israeli authorities 
have only permitted an average of 715 truckloads per month since the &#8220;easing&#8221; of 
restrictions in June 2010.55 At this rate it will take 78 years to rebuild Gaza, with a 
completion date in 2088. It is also notable that 53 per cent of the total import was for food 
items as compared to 20 per cent prior to the blockade, suggesting the decline of the non-
food requirement for civilian normalcy. There has also been no increase in industrial fuel 
since the beginning of 2010. As a result, total available electricity is 40 per cent below the 
estimated daily demand of 280 MW.56 Daily power cuts of up to 12 hours negatively affect 
such essential services as water supply, sewage treatment and removal, and health 
facilities.57 Twenty per cent of Gazans have access to water only for one day out of five 
(and then for 6&#8211;8 hours), fifty per cent have access only one day in four; and a further thirty 
per cent every second day.58 In September 2010, the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) reported that, owing to the 
continuing blockade, it cannot meet the enrolment needs of 40,000 Gazan school children.59 
These facts demonstrate the persistence and unlawful character of the blockade, being both 
a form of unlawful collective punishment amounting to a crime against humanity and a 
denial of material necessities to a civilian population living under occupation in violation of 
international humanitarian law.

<p>standards of protection in situations of arrest or when enduring occupation. Article 37(b) of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides: &#8220;The arrest or imprisonment of a child 
shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of 
time&#8221;. Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifies that &#8220;Proper regard shall be 
paid to the special treatment due to minors&#8221;. Further, Article 77, paragraph 1, of the First 
Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions reinforces this legal obligation as follows: 
&#8220;Children shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected against any form of 
indecent assault. The Parties to the conflict shall provide them with the care and aid they 
require, whether because of age or for any other reason&#8221;. The treatment by Israeli 
authorities of Palestinian children living under occupation does not at all comply with these 
provisions.  
</p>
<p>27. The Rapporteur utterly deplores and strongly condemns the fact that, since 2000, 
1,335 Palestinian children (including 6 children in 2010) have been killed as a result of 
Israeli military and settler presence in the occupied Palestinian territories.60 The arbitrary 
opening of fire by Israeli military against Palestinian children is particularly appalling. 
Since March 2010, Israeli soldiers along the border with Gaza have shot 17 children while 
they collected building gravel in the Gaza buffer zone to support their families. The 
children were shot whilst working between 50 and 800 metres from the border. Adults and 
children continue to do this dangerous work as Israeli authorities refuse to allow the entry 
of construction material into the Gaza Strip and there are few job opportunities available.61 
</p>
<p>28. The Rapporteur is further dismayed at the continual arrests and detention of 
Palestinian children by Israeli authorities. In 2010, Israeli authorities arrested children at 
checkpoints, off the street or, most commonly, from the family home. In the case of house 
arrests, large numbers of Israeli soldiers typically surrounded the family home in the middle 
of the night. Children were beaten or kicked at the time of arrest and put at the back of a 
military vehicle where they were subject to further physical and psychological abuse on the 
way to the interrogation and detention centre. Upon arrest, children and their families were 
seldom informed of the charges against them.62 Children were often subject to abuse during 
interrogation.63 At the end of October 2010, 256 children remained in Israeli detention, 
including 34 between the ages of 12&#8211;15 years.64 As of August 2010, 42.5 per cent of 
Palestinian children in Israeli prisons were not held in facilities separate from adults.65 
</p>
<p>29. The continued reports of inhumane and degrading treatment, including sexual 
assault, of children in detention is further deplorable. In Silwan neighbourhood of East 
Jerusalem, at least 81 minors from Silwan have been arrested or detained for questioning 
(mostly in the middle of the night), the vast majority on suspicion of stone-throwing 
following confrontations between Palestinians and settlers in the neighbourhood, where

<p>there is tension resulting from settlers&#8217; taking control of houses and archeological sites.66 
Some of those arrested were under the age of 12. An increasing number of testimonies by 
children and their families pointed to gross violations of the rights of children during 
interrogation.67 In the Ariel settlement in the occupied West Bank, children reported that 
they had been given electric shocks by Israeli interrogators in the settlement.68 The children, 
one as young as 14 years of age, were each accused of throwing stones at a settler bypass 
road in the occupied West Bank. Following the electric shocks, the boys provided their 
interrogators with confessions, although they maintained their innocence.69 In May 2010, a 
14-year-old boy reported that his interrogator in the Israeli settlement block of Gush Etzion, 
in the occupied West Bank, attached car battery jump leads to the boy&#8217;s genitals and 
threatened to electrify the cable. After further abuse, the boy confessed to throwing stones, 
although he maintains his innocence.70  
</p>
<p>30. Each year, approximately 700 Palestinian children (under 18) from the West Bank 
are prosecuted in Israeli military courts after being arrested, interrogated and detained by 
the Israeli army.71 Observers have been shocked by the disparities between the special 
regard for children imposed by international legal norms and the actual practices of Israeli 
military and security forces. A recent visit by a British Parliamentary group is illustrative: 
Sandra Osborne, after visiting a military court used to prosecute children at Camp Ofer, 
near Ramallah, remarked during a Parliamentary debate on the subject, &#8220;it was a visit to a 
military court that shocked us to the core&#8221;.72 Among the shocking features were the 
following: the child defendants &#8211; 13 and 14 years of age &#8211; were brought into the courtroom 
with their legs shackled in changes and handcuffed, usually behind their backs; their jail 
sentences were lengthened by as much as three times unless they pleaded guilty; the judge 
had no interaction with the child defendants and was reported never even to look at them; 
proceedings and signed confessions were in Hebrew, a language most of these children did 
not know.73 The scene being described resembles the administration of justice in the South 
Africa of apartheid that the Special Rapporteur visited on a formal mission on behalf of the 
International Commission of Jurists in 1968. 
</p>
<p>31. The apartheid dimension of this abusive atmosphere is also accentuated by the dual 
legal system that is operative in the occupied territories, with settler children &#8211; who are 
rarely apprehended in any event for their violent act &#8211; being prosecuted in Israeli civilian 
courts, while Palestinian children are brought before the military court system. Among the 
discriminatory features of the two systems is the imposition of higher degrees of 
accountability at lower ages, Palestinians being held responsible as adults at the age of 16, 
while the Israeli age is 18. The failure to uphold minimum standards in relation to the 
treatment of Palestinian children detained and imprisoned is an extreme violation of Israeli

<p>obligation to do all that is possible, subject to reasonable security measures, to respect the 
status of protected persons as mandated by the Fourth Geneva Convention. Such an 
assessment is rendered more disturbing when account is taken that almost all of these 
arrests of children are generated by their resistance to unlawful patterns of Israeli settlement 
building and expansion, along with related ethnic-cleansing measures being applied at an 
accelerating rate in East Jerusalem.

<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Intensified efforts be made to induce Israel to cooperate with the proper 
discharge of this mandate, including allowing access to the occupied Palestinian 
territories by the Special Rapporteur; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Efforts be undertaken to have the International Court of Justice assess 
allegations that the prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem 
possess elements of &#8220;colonialism&#8221;, &#8220;apartheid&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; inconsistent 
with international humanitarian law in circumstances of belligerent occupation and 
unlawful abridgements of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Intensified efforts be made to attach legal consequences to the failure by 
Israel to end the blockade of the Gaza Strip in all of its dimensions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Human Rights Council organize an inquiry, possibly jointly with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross or the Government of Switzerland, into the 
legal, moral and political consequences of prolonged occupation, including prolonged 
refugee status, with an eye toward convening Governments to negotiating further 
protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Steps be taken by the Human Rights Council to implement the 
recommendations of the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the 
Gaza Conflict in the light of the failure of Israel to address allegations in a manner 
that accords with international standards as well as the conclusions of the 
Independent International Fact-Finding Mission into the incident of the humanitarian 
flotilla; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f)</b> <b>Measures are taken to ensure that no Palestinian child is detained inside 
Israel or in the occupied Palestinian territories in contravention of article 76 of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention; children are not brought before military courts; cases of 
mistreatment and abuse of children are thoroughly and impartially investigated; and 
all evidence against children obtained through ill-treatment or torture be rejected by 
the courts.
