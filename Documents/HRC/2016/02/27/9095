<p><b>Responses from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: French] 
[3 February 2009] 
</p>
<p> (a) The Government of Algeria has always worked for the promotion of international 
cooperation in the field of human rights, and advocates for dialogue and the respect of the 
sovereignty and cultural specificity of each country. On the basis of such beliefs, Algeria acts to 
strengthen international cooperation in human rights in the following areas: the ratification of 
international treaties, which is the legal accomplishment of international cooperation; traditional 
cooperation with regional and international institutions dealing with human rights; and active 
presence within human rights forums.  
</p>
<p><b>Ratification of international treaties 
</b></p>
<p> (b) The Government of Algeria listed treaties it has ratified, including the four Geneva 
Conventions, which were ratified during the national war of liberation and thus reflected the 
State&#8217;s commitment to international cooperation in human rights. This commitment was further 
reinforced after independence with support for adhesion to the principal international human 
rights instruments. Article 132 of the Constitution acknowledges the primacy of the conventions 
ratified by Algeria in its domestic law.  
</p>

</p>
<p> (j) In addition to the above-mentioned ratified treaties, Algeria has also signed the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. 
</p>
<p><b>Traditional cooperation with regional and international institutions dealing with  
human rights 
</b></p>
<p> (k) In addition to its statutory and voluntary contribution allowing international 
organizations to fulfil their mandate, the Government of Algeria has participated in the activities 
of the following institutions:  
</p>
<p><b>A.  International instances 
</b></p>
<p> (l) With regard to the Human Rights Council, Algeria was a founding member and has 
always maintained that the transition of the Commission on Human Rights to the Human Rights 
Council represents an opportunity to overcome the past practice of politicization, selectivity and 
politics of double standards in human rights matters. It is only through dialogue and cooperation 
that human rights in the world can progress and Algeria has expended efforts supporting the 
negotiating phase to clear the way to reach the largest consensus for the establishment of the 
Council. In the Council, Algeria has advocated for equal treatment for all States, prioritizing 
dialogue and cooperation for the realization of universal human rights objectives; 
 (m) In the past few years, the Government of Algeria has received visits from several 
special procedures mandate-holders: in September 2002 by the Special Rapporteur on freedom </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/26/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>of religion or belief, Adbelfattach Amor, and in January 2007, by the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, Yakin Ert&#252;rk. In addition, Algeria has 
agreed in principle to a visit by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression; 
</p>
<p> (n) From 31 March to 6 April 2008, Algeria received a visit from the United Nations 
Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, Craig Johnson, who had discussions with Algerian 
officials; 
</p>
<p> (o) In 2008, Algeria hosted a visit from the President of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, Jakob Kellenberger, who from 13 to 15 March 2008 had a high-level dialogue 
with Algerian officials; 
</p>
<p> (p) In order to have constructive exchanges with non-governmental organizations in the 
area of the protection and promotion of human rights, the Government of Algeria has invited 
representatives from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders 
and the International Federation of Human Rights League for discussions; 
</p>
<p> (q) Algeria is part of the first group reviewed under the universal periodic review 
mechanism of the Human Rights Council, initiated by General Assembly resolution 60/251 and 
Council resolution 5/1. In the report submitted, Algeria faithfully depicted its achievements in 
the area of civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. The report 
reconstructed the historical, sociological and environmental context of difficulties and 
constraints for rights and freedoms and referred to future actions the State proposes to promote 
rights to its full extent. The Government has pledged to cooperate with universal periodic review 
in good faith and regarded this mechanism as an instrument that adds a spirit of dialogue and 
communication to the field of human rights. Algeria has agreed to a great majority of 
recommendations formulated individually by 17 States and will take the necessary steps to 
implement them. On 19 and 20 November 2008, Algeria took part in a meeting in Bahrain, 
organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
on the evaluation of and follow-up to the universal periodic review mechanism and lessons 
learned and best practices of the different recommendations formulated by States in the review 
framework; 
</p>
<p> (r) The country&#8217;s relations with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) date back to the Algerian war of liberation. Since 1959 and on the basis of a 
General Assembly resolution, UNHCR has intervened to help Algerian refugees, who found 
asylum in Morocco and Tunisia. The country&#8217;s cooperation with UNHCR had been strengthened 
in the framework of assistance to Saharoui refugees. On 27 September 1984, an agreement was 
signed for the opening of a United Nations presence in the country and a delegation has been 
present in Algeria since; 
</p>
<p> (s) Algeria and the World Food Programme (WFP) have had relations since 1963, when 
WFP delivered aid to hundreds of displaced persons in and outside of the country after the war of 
liberation. Since 1986, the presence of WFP in Algeria has been even more significant with 
regard to the matter of Saharoui refugees, following the signing of an assistance agreement 
in 1986.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Regional instances 
</b></p>
<p> (t) In respect of its cooperation with the African Union, in addition to the ratification of 
African Union legal instruments on human rights, Algeria was one of the first African countries 
to volunteer to undergo review by the African Mechanism of Peer Evaluation, which inspired the 
creation of the universal periodic review mechanism. Also, Algeria submitted its third and fourth 
consolidated periodic reports to the African Commission of Human and People&#8217;s Rights at its 
forty-second session in November 2007 in Brazzaville. Algeria brought clarifications pertaining 
to certain questions from Commission members during the meeting held in May 2008 in 
Ezulwini (Swaziland); 
</p>
<p> (u) Participation and cooperation in the League of Arab States: Algeria is one of seven 
Arab States to have ratified the Arab Charter on Human Rights. It regularly participates in work 
of the Permanent Arab Committee for Human Rights. In March 2008, Algeria hosted a meeting 
of the Arab national institution for human rights on the theme &#8220;human rights and development, 
the role of national human rights institutions&#8221;. Algeria has also contributed to the strategic plan 
of the Arab League for the promotion and protection of human rights for the period 2008-2013, 
which envisages the development of financial resources dedicated to human rights, to ensure 
better application of resolutions and the reviving of human rights mechanisms of the League of 
Arab States. 
</p>
<p><b>Active presence in human rights forums 
</b></p>
<p> (v) The Government of Algeria also provided information on its active presence at the 
various human rights forums. It took part in the first Arab Conference on Human Rights, in 
December 2008, in Doha; the third World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children and 
Adolescents, in November 2008, in Rio de Janeiro; the Regional Seminar on Human Rights and 
Terrorism organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
for Middle-East and North African countries, in October 2008, in Amman; the Manila Forum on 
Migration, in October 2008; the Regional Conference for the Durban Review, in August 2008, in 
Abuja; the Beijing Forum on Development, Security and Human Rights; the ministerial 
conference on human rights and cultural diversity, organized by Non-Aligned Movement 
countries, in September 2007, in Teheran; the seminar as a bilateral plan between Algeria and 
Norway; the Dialogue of Civilizations, in November 2008, in New York; and an international 
seminar on reform of criminal sanctions in Algeria and the fulfilment of the United Nations 
resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty organized by the National Consultative 
Commission in January in Algiers.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: Spanish] 
[19 January 2009] 
</p>
<p> (a) The Government of Mexico is convinced that active participation in the international 
human rights system and international cooperation in this field will lead to the strengthening of 
the domestic juridical and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human 
rights. The foreign policy of Mexico on human rights is therefore based on three areas: openness </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/26/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>to and cooperation with human rights agencies and bodies and international human rights 
mechanisms; participation and leadership in international human rights forums; and 
implementation of international human rights standards at the national level;  
</p>
<p> (b) The Government of Mexico provided information on its commitment to international 
cooperation in the following areas:  
</p>
<p>(i) Cooperation with bodies and international human rights mechanisms. As a 
State party to all international human rights instruments, Mexico recognizes the 
competence of all the existing monitoring bodies, including the function to 
receive individual communications. Mexico submits periodic reports to those 
treaty bodies and actively participates and follows recommendations issued by 
them. Since 2001, Mexico has issued an open and standing invitation to 
relevant international human rights mechanisms to visit the country; to date it 
has received 21 visits from these mechanisms, including 14 from the 
United Nations system and 7 from the inter-American system; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR). Since 2002, Mexico has hosted a representative 
office of OHCHR as established with the invitation of the Government. 
Collaboration with OHCHR has resulted in significant contributions to the 
improvement of the human rights situation in Mexico, including the evaluation 
of the human rights situation in 2003 as well as assessment for the elaboration 
of a national programme of human rights for the period 2008-2012. The Office 
maintains agreements and close relationship with the executive, legislative and 
judicial branches, academic institutions and civil society. In February 2008, the 
Government of Mexico and OHCHR signed an agreement on ongoing OHCHR 
activities in the country, allowing OHCHR to monitor the human rights 
situation in the country, provide technical advice to the Government on human 
rights matters and advise other actors at their request; 
</p>
<p>(iii) International cooperation in initiatives in multilateral human rights forums. In 
this regard, Mexico has implemented several initiatives relating to the human 
rights of women, indigenous peoples, migrants, people with disabilities and 
human rights in the fight against terrorism, for which it holds extensive 
negotiations and has an open dialogue with all countries. Some of these 
initiatives are presented jointly with other countries in the region, such as the 
resolution on human rights and indigenous peoples with Guatemala. Other 
initiatives are presented together with countries of other regions, such as the 
joint resolution by Mexico and New Zealand on the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, adopted by the 
General Assembly at its sixty-third session and the resolution on human rights 
of persons with disabilities, adopted by the Human Rights Council at its 
seventh session. Mexico also joined the sponsors for the resolution on the 
rights of the child traditionally presented in the General Assembly by the 
Group of Latin American and Caribbean States and the European Union; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/26/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>(iv) International cooperation in the universal periodic review mechanism of the 
Human Rights Council. Mexico participates actively and constructively in the 
Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review to identify cooperation needs 
in the promotion and protection of human rights in each country. Mexico also 
elaborated its national report for this mechanism through dialogue which 
involved various stakeholders, including its executive, legislative and judicial 
branches, academic institutions, civil society and national and State human 
rights institutions; 
</p>
<p>(v) Participation in bilateral and trilateral dialogues and mechanisms on human 
rights matters. Mexico maintains institutionalized and periodic mechanisms of 
consultation and dialogue on human rights matters with Canada and the 
United States of America. In recent months, Mexico has held dialogues on 
human rights matters with Belgium, China, Cuba, France, the Russian 
Federation, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland; 
</p>
<p>(vi) Mexico-European Union cooperation programme in the field of human rights. 
In May 2008, a financing agreement was signed for the second phase of the 
human rights programme between the European Union and Mexico for the 
period 2008-2010, the aim of which is to concretize, through horizontal 
cooperation, actions that promote the implementation of measures, public 
policy and legislative harmonization in issues related principally to gender 
equality, the pursuit of justice for indigenous peoples, reforms to the justice 
system and human rights training for public officials. The signing of the second 
phase of the cooperation programme reiterates the importance that the 
Government of Mexico accords to the expansion and strengthening of 
cooperation in human rights that it has with the European Union since 2001. 
</p>
<p> (c) The Government of Mexico also proposed ways and means to enhance international 
cooperation and dialogue in United Nations human rights mechanisms, including in the Human 
Rights Council, including:  
</p>
<p>(i) Universal periodic review mechanism: Mexico considers that it would be very 
positive if more countries from all regions participated actively in the Working 
Group of Universal Periodic Review. Recalling the objectives of the review 
mechanisms, especially the reinforcement of State capacity and technical 
assistance in consultation with the State concerned and with their consent, and 
that the content of the final report of the review contains, inter alia, provision 
of technical assistance and capacity-building in consultation with the country 
concerned and with their consent. Mexico believes that it would be a 
significant advance that OHCHR systematize technical assistance requests, as 
well as the requests to hold bilateral consultations on human rights, made 
within the framework of the universal periodic review; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Multilateral human rights initiatives: Mexico supports greater promotion of 
joint and transregional human rights initiatives to strengthen dialogue between 
countries and regions, reconcile positions and strengthen international </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/26/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>cooperation. This includes promotion of interaction between countries and 
regions, and it is a better way to share experiences, good practices and common 
objectives in the field of human rights. It would also be desirable to promote 
cooperation of the concerned State in the drafting and adoption of multilateral 
initiatives related to national human rights situations, in order to make them a 
balanced and objective way of addressing the prevalent situation in this field 
and lead to specific cooperation actions to improve the situation in the country; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Mechanisms of cooperation in human rights: it would be very useful if 
OHCHR conducted a general survey on the current situation of human rights 
cooperation mechanisms throughout the world. It would also be positive to 
continue to strengthen the practice of dialogue between different bodies and 
regional mechanisms, as well as between these and global mechanisms, 
including treaty bodies, special procedures, quasi judicial mechanisms and 
judicial bodies.
