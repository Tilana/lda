<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 16/28 on the protection of human rights 
in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS), emphasized the significance of the 2011 comprehensive review of 
progress achieved in realizing the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the 
2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS. The 2011 comprehensive review was requested 
by the General Assembly in its resolution 65/180 of 20 December 2010. In the fourth 
preambular paragraph of the resolution, the General Assembly noted that a comprehensive 
review was apposite to mark three decades of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, 10 years since the 
adoption of the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and its time-bound 
measurable goals and targets, and five years since the adoption of the 2006 Political 
Declaration on HIV/AIDS with the goal of achieving universal access to comprehensive 
HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. In its resolution 16/28, the Human 
Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to engage actively with the 2011 General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AIDS, 
providing a human rights-based perspective, and to inform the Human Rights Council 
thereon. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report includes background information on the context and objectives of 
the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS adopted at the General Assembly High-
Level Meeting on AIDS in its resolution 65/277; a summary of the human rights challenges 
prior to the adoption of the Political Declaration; information on the role that the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights played in advocating for a 
human rights-based perspective; and an analysis of the 2011 Political Declaration from a 
human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Thirty years of AIDS: context and objectives of the 2011 
Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rationale for a new declaration on HIV and AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted unanimously by the 
General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session in its resolution S-26/2, emphasized 
that the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is essential to reduce 
vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The Declaration highlighted the central importance of 
addressing stigma and related discrimination against people living with and at risk of HIV. 
Noting the disproportionate risk of HIV faced by women, the Declaration committed 
Member States to developing and implementing national strategies that promote the 
advancement of women and women&#8217;s full enjoyment of human rights. The 2006 Political 
Declaration on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 60/262, 
committed States to intensify efforts to enact, strengthen or enforce legislation, regulations 
and other measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination against and to ensure the full 
enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by people living with HIV and 
members of vulnerable groups. It also included a commitment to the full and active 
participation of people living with HIV and vulnerable groups in HIV responses, as well as 
to achieving the goal of universal access to HIV prevention programmes, treatment, care 
and support by 2010.   
</p>
<p>4. Together these landmark declarations have galvanized global support for reversing 
the spread of the epidemic and accelerating momentum in providing universal access to </p>


<p>HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. In line with this growing momentum, in 
March 2011, the General Assembly decided to convene a high-level meeting from 8 to 10 
June 2011 to undertake a comprehensive review of progress achieved in previous 
declarations, including successes, best practices, lessons learned, obstacles and gaps, 
challenges and opportunities, and to make recommendations to guide and monitor the 
HIV/AIDS response beyond 2010. The General Assembly decided in its resolution 65/180 
that this review should also include concrete strategies for action, as well as promote the 
continued commitment and engagement of leaders in a comprehensive global response to 
HIV/AIDS. During its sixty-fifth session in its resolution 65/277, the General Assembly 
adopted a new declaration entitled Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying our 
Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS. This 2011 Political Declaration was adopted when 
important progress had been achieved at national, regional and international levels &#8211; 
namely, more than 25 per cent reduction in the rate of new infections in over 30 countries, 
significant reduction in vertical transmission, and expansion of access to treatment to over 6 
million people resulting in the reduction of AIDS-related deaths by more than 20 per cent 
over a five year period. However, in recognition of the fact that the goals and targets in 
previous declarations adopted in 2001 and 2006 would expire at the end of 2010, and in the 
light of the urgent need to renew commitments to the fight against AIDS, an intensified 
response was considered necessary (see General Assembly resolution 65/180). It was also 
recognized that HIV continues to constitute a global emergency that poses formidable 
challenges to development, progress and stability and requires an exceptional and 
comprehensive global response. The meeting was held at a time when HIV was entering 
into its fourth decade, AIDS had claimed more than 30 million lives, 33 million people 
were living with HIV, almost 17 million children were orphaned due to AIDS, 7,000 new 
infections were occurring daily, and AIDS was the sixth leading cause of death globally.1  
</p>
<p>5. The new 2011 Political Declaration reaffirms the 2001 Declaration of Commitment 
and the 2006 Political Declaration and the urgent need to scale up the goal of universal 
access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support. It also 
commits to new targets and goals, some of which are time-bound, in order to end the 
epidemic with renewed political will. Like previous declarations, the 2011 Political 
Declaration reaffirms that the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
for all is an essential element in the global response to HIV. It recognizes that addressing 
stigma and discrimination is a critical element in the global response to HIV and also 
recognizes the need to strengthen national policies and legislation in that regard. It also 
contains a chapter on human rights that seeks to address important human rights-related 
concerns pertinent to the HIV response. That chapter, together with other references to 
human rights in the declaration, calls on Member States to tackle stigma and discrimination 
in its multiple forms and address the drivers of vulnerability and risk behaviours associated 
with HIV, as well as the human rights violations against people living with, presumed to be 
living with, and/or affected by HIV. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights challenges 
</b></p>
<p>6. Prior to the 2011 High-Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, the Secretary-General was 
requested to submit an analytical report on progress achieved and challenges remaining in 
realizing the commitments set out in the Declaration of Commitment and the 2006 Political 
Declaration, which was entitled &#8220;Uniting for universal access: towards zero new HIV 
</p>
<p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Epidemic</i> (2010) and World Health Organization (WHO) &#8220;The top 10 causes of death&#8221;, fact sheet No. 
310 (2011). </p>


<p>infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths&#8221; (A/65/797). In its resolution 
12/27, the Human Rights Council also requested the Secretary-General to prepare an 
analytical study on steps taken to promote and implement programmes to address 
HIV/AIDS-related human rights in the context of efforts towards the goal of universal 
access to HIV prevention, treatment, case and support, which was entitled &#8220;The protection 
of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)&#8221; (A/HRC/16/69). Both reports point to successes in 
strengthening human rights in the context of national HIV responses, but also highlight a 
number of ongoing challenges and contain a number of recommendations and observations 
including the following: 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a) <b>Inadequate protection against discrimination:</b> Although the number of 
countries reporting anti-discrimination laws in place has increased, nearly 3 in 10 countries 
still lack such laws or regulations. When anti-discrimination provisions are in place, they 
are often not effectively enforced. Fewer than 60 per cent of countries report having a 
mechanism to record, document and address cases of HIV-related discrimination. In 2010, 
the vast majority of countries reported that they addressed stigma and discrimination in 
their national HIV strategies; however, most countries did not have a budget for activities 
aimed at responding to HIV-related stigma and discrimination;2 
</p>
<p> (b) <b>Strategic reorientation of global and national HIV responses</b>: Human 
rights-related programmes often do not exist in national HIV responses. Where such 
programmes exist, they are generally not brought to scale or are scattered and fragmented. 
A strategic shift is required to: (i) invest in better assessments of those most vulnerable to 
HIV and ensure adequate coverage of their needs; (ii) ensure meaningful engagement of 
ministries dealing with justice, law enforcement, prisons, human rights, gender, migration 
and labour, among others; and (iii) focus on the legal and social environments that are 
necessary for universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support; 
</p>
<p> (c) <b>Decriminalization and legal protections</b>: The reform of punitive laws that 
impede HIV responses and the strengthening of human rights protections for people living 
with and vulnerable populations are essential to sustaining the AIDS response. Political 
leaders should be supported in confronting issues involving decriminalization. Greater 
efforts must be made by States to reconsider the application of criminal law against HIV 
transmission and exposure, sex work, drug use and homosexuality and their impact on 
access to HIV services. They should also reform laws that restrict sexuality education, 
impose travel restrictions on people living with HIV or require mandatory HIV testing. 
Specific attention must be paid in law reform efforts to address gender-based violence, the 
HIV-related rights of women, children and other key populations; 
</p>
<p> (d) <b>Increasing participation of those vulnerable to and living with HIV</b>: The 
Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV is a long-standing principle of the HIV 
response and one of its human rights successes. However, as evidence shows heightened 
vulnerability to HIV among members of key populations it appears critical to renew, 
expand and improve the participation of all those vulnerable to and living with HIV in all 
aspects of the response. 
</p>
<p> (e) <b>Eliminating gender-based discrimination and violence</b>: Many gender 
analyses show how subordination of women and girls and violence against them drive HIV 
transmission and raise gender-based barriers to care, treatment and support. The

</i></p>
<p><i>Rights Programmes in Global Fund-supported HIV Programmes</i> (New York, 2011) </p>


<p>mobilization of Government, civil society and donors is needed to scale up programmes 
that address this issue and violence is a priority;  
</p>
<p> (f) <b>Financing national programmes</b>: The mobilization of both Governments 
and donors to invest financial and technical resources in human rights-centred programmes 
is urgently needed, as are resources for transparent and independent evaluation of measures 
taken. More resources are needed for appropriate and comprehensive HIV education for 
children. Health-service professionals should be equipped to protect confidentiality, ensure 
informed consent and have functioning mechanisms for redress when people face abuse and 
discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (g) <b>Universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support: </b>With nearly 
two in three people eligible for antiretroviral therapy still lacking access,3 Member States 
will have to adopt reinvigorated approaches to the treatment, care and support needs of 
people living with HIV. This includes a recommitment to overcoming legal and regulatory, 
trade and other barriers that block access to prevention, treatment, care and support. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. The High-Level Meeting comprised General Assembly plenary meetings and five 
thematic panel discussions. In addition, numerous side events took place and the President 
of the General Assembly presided over an informal civil society hearing held to bring civil 
society perspectives to the attention of the High-Level Meeting and to include civil society 
contribution in the negotiation of the new declaration. In accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 16/28 and General Assembly resolution 65/180, the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights participated in the High-Level Meeting on 
AIDS and supported the preparatory processes leading to the meeting, in collaboration with 
United Nations programmes, funds and specialized agencies. Activities included the 
issuance of an information note and communication materials to draw attention to the 
importance of maintaining human rights goals and targets in the new declaration and an 
assessment of the key human rights priority areas based on the Secretary-General&#8217;s report 
to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/16/69). The Office also followed the negotiations of 
the 2011 Political Declaration and, upon request, provided advice on technical issues.  
</p>
<p>8. The Office supported preparations in relation to the high-level panel discussion on 
prevention entitled &#8220;What can be done to get to zero new infections?&#8221; The objective of the 
panel was to focus on the priorities for achieving HIV-prevention goals, including 
eliminating stigma and discrimination, overcoming barriers to prevention for populations 
with greater vulnerability and populations at higher risk, ensuring a comprehensive 
approach to prevention and treatment, and educating young people to lead future HIV-
prevention efforts. Among the many issues highlighted, the panel emphasized the need for 
political commitment and leadership at every level to support HIV prevention and confront 
and end stigmatization, discrimination and marginalization. Discussions also centred on the 
need to scale up programmes to address gender inequality, violence against women and 
girls and consider the role of men in the HIV response. Participants highlighted that respect, 
including mentioning populations by name with dignity and not derision, would bring HIV 
prevention out of the shadows. The review or adoption of laws, policies and practices was 
needed to uphold the human rights of vulnerable and key populations, support the 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The latest data from the <i>UNAIDS</i> <i>World AIDS Day Report 2011</i> indicates that nearly 50 per cent of

<p>implementation of effective interventions such as harm-reduction programmes and stop 
criminalization of people based on sexual orientation, drug use or HIV transmission. 
</p>
<p>9. In his address to the high-level panel on prevention, the Assistant Secretary-General 
for Human Rights highlighted the critical links between human rights and protective versus 
punitive legal and social environments. He proposed five human rights priority actions that 
are needed to sustain the global AIDS response: (a) reaching those most vulnerable to 
discrimination and ensuring that they have access to HIV services; (b) involving people 
living with HIV in all aspects of the response, no matter what group they belong to; (c) 
reviewing punitive laws on HIV transmission and exposure, sex work, homosexuality, 
travel restrictions and mandatory testing and strengthening laws and policies on sexuality 
education and women&#8217;s rights; (d) eliminating gender-based discrimination and violence 
and scaling up programmes to address this issue; and (e) removing regulatory, trade and 
other barriers that block the human rights imperative of universal access to HIV prevention, 
treatment, care and support. His remarks echoed those of the Secretary-General, who stated 
at the opening plenary meeting of the High-Level Meeting that &#8220;from its birth, the 
campaign against AIDS was much more than a battle against disease. It was a cry for 
human rights. It was a call for greater equality. It was a fight to end discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. And it was a demand for equal treatment of all people&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> III. A human rights analysis of the 2011 Political Declaration on 
HIV and AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>10. The adoption of the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS symbolizes a 
renewed global commitment to stop, reverse and eliminate AIDS. By reaffirming previous 
declarations and setting new targets, Member States agreed to address the issue of 
leadership to end the HIV epidemic; expand HIV-prevention coverage, diversify 
approaches and intensify efforts to end new infections; increase access to treatment, care 
and support; advance human rights to reduce stigma, discrimination and violence; address 
resource constraints and the efficient utilization of resources for AIDS; strengthen health 
systems and integrate HIV into broader health and development; accelerate research and 
development to prevent, treat and cure HIV; and establish coordination, monitoring and 
accountability mechanisms to maximize the response. Some of the important highlights of 
the declaration include a commitment to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Reduce sexual transmission of HIV by half by 2015; 
</p>
<p> (b) Eliminate transmission of HIV from mother-to-child by 2015; 
</p>
<p> (c) Reduce transmission of HIV among people who inject drugs by half by 2015; 
</p>
<p> (d) Increase the number of people on lifesaving treatment to 15 million by 2015; 
</p>
<p> (e) Reduce tuberculosis-related deaths by half by 2015; 
</p>
<p> (f) Eliminate gender inequalities and gender-based abuse and violence, increase 
the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from the risk of HIV 
infection; 
</p>
<p> (g) Engage people living with and affected by HIV in decision-making and 
planning, implementing and evaluating the response; 
</p>
<p> (h) Redouble HIV-prevention efforts by, among other measures, facilitating 
access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services and expanding risk and harm 
reduction programmes; </p>


<p> (i) Ensure that national prevention strategies target populations at higher risk &#8211; 
the declaration mentions specifically men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs 
and sex workers as populations at higher risk; 
</p>
<p> (j) Remove before 2015 obstacles that limit the capacity of low- and middle-
income countries to provide affordable and effective HIV prevention and treatment and 
optimize the full use of existing flexibilities under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects 
of Intellectual Property Rights; 
</p>
<p> (k) Review laws and policies that adversely affect the successful, effective and 
equitable delivery of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes; and 
</p>
<p> (l) Increase HIV-related spending to reach a significant level of annual global 
expenditure on HIV and AIDS, while recognizing that the overall target estimated by the 
Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is between US$22 billion and 
US$24 billion in low- and middle-income countries by 2015. 
</p>
<p>11. The 2011 Political Declaration reaffirms the obligations of States to promote 
universal respect and the observance and protection of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and other instruments relating to human rights and international law. It 
also reaffirms that the full realization of human rights is an essential element of the global 
response to HIV. The Political Declaration takes notes of the strategy of the UNAIDS for 
2011&#8211;2015, which has included human rights and gender equality within UNAIDS three 
strategic directions, on a par with prevention and treatment.  
</p>
<p>12. The inclusion of a specific chapter on human rights in the Political Declaration is 
particularly noteworthy as it is an affirmation of the recognition by the General Assembly 
of the centrality of human rights in the AIDS response. While the prevention and treatment 
targets also reflect human rights imperatives, the human rights chapter focuses on: (a) 
creating an enabling legal, social and policy framework to eliminate stigma, discrimination 
and violence and promoting universal access; (b) reviewing laws and policies that adversely 
affect the HIV response; (c) reviewing with a view to eliminating restrictions on entry, stay 
and residence; (d) promoting and protecting human rights in national HIV and AIDS 
strategies; (e) meeting the specific needs of women and girls by promoting and protecting 
their rights, reducing their vulnerability to HIV, eliminating discrimination and all forms of 
sexual exploitation and violence; (f) strengthening national social and child protection 
systems and care in particular for the girl child; (g) promoting laws and policies to ensure 
the full realization of human rights for young people; (h) addressing the vulnerabilities of 
migrant and mobile populations; and (i) mitigating the impact of the epidemic on workers, 
their families, their dependants, workplaces and economies, taking into account the 
International Labour Organization Recommendation on HIV and AIDS and the World of 
Work, 2010 (No. 200) (the first international labour standard on HIV and the world of 
work).  
</p>
<p>13. For the first time, a specific reference to an international human rights treaty has 
been included. The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
was welcomed and the need to take into account the rights of persons with disabilities in the 
context of health, education, accessibility and information recognized. In a similar manner, 
the Political Declaration recognizes that access to safe, effective, affordable, good-quality 
medicines and commodities in the context of HIV is fundamental to achieving the full 
realization of the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health.  
</p>
<p>14. In negotiating the Political Declaration, Member States were challenged to set and 
agree to a new set of goals and targets. The inclusion of time-bound targets and benchmarks 
in the human rights chapter of the Political Declaration similar to those in other sections of </p>


<p>the declaration would have strengthened the monitoring of progress in achieving the human 
rights goals in the Political Declaration and strengthened the human rights accountability 
framework that States are obligated to fulfil and rights-holders are entitled to claim. The 
Political Declaration&#8217;s commitment to prepare evidence-based operational monitoring and 
evaluation and mutual accountability mechanisms between all stakeholders to support 
multisectoral national strategic plans for HIV and AIDS provides a unique opportunity to 
further integrate and assess human rights principles in all the programmatic phases of 
national responses. The meaningful participation of affected populations and integration of 
human rights in the revision of the core indicators framework as stipulated in the Political 
Declaration to include structural, process and outcome indicators on human rights4 will 
enable States to better prioritize their actions and recognize when national policy 
adjustments and programmatic actions are required.  
</p>
<p>15. The importance of culture, ethical, religious values and local circumstances is also 
highlighted as an important consideration in responses to HIV. These values are critical to 
the AIDS response and should be consistent with international human rights norms and 
standards. As stated in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action &#8220;while the 
significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and 
religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their 
political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms&#8221;. Furthermore, in accordance with the Universal Declaration on 
Cultural Diversity (art. 4) and Human Rights Council resolution 10/23 (para. 4), no one 
may invoke cultural diversity to infringe upon human rights guaranteed by international 
law, nor to limit their scope. In addition, in its general comment No. 21 (2009) on the right 
of everyone to take part in cultural life, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has underscored that &#8220;the concept of culture must be seen not as a series of isolated 
manifestations or hermetic compartments, but as an interactive process whereby individuals 
and communities, while preserving their specificities and purposes, give expression to the 
culture of humanity. This concept takes account of the individuality and otherness of 
culture as the creation and product of society&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. The Political Declaration also reaffirms the sovereign rights of Member States and 
the need for all countries to implement the commitments and pledges in the Declaration 
consistent with national law, national development priorities and international human 
rights. It is trite to observe that sovereignty entails responsibility. The positive human rights 
obligations of sovereign States implies the responsibility of States to ensure the realization 
of human rights in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and ratified international human rights instruments, human 
rights norms and standards, and customary international law. These include but are not 
limited to the immediate obligation of non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>17. Member States are also challenged to ensure that their national responses to HIV are 
inclusive of all people, especially people that are most marginalized and populations most 
affected by the epidemic, including those unnamed in the Political Declaration such as 
transgender persons, persons in detention, refugees, internally displaced persons and people 
living in poverty. This will require developing monitoring mechanisms to assess who has 
been left out of the response and taking measures to address systemic/structural 
discrimination and ensuring access to HIV-related health services without prejudice. 
Member States must also tackle the disproportionate impact of the epidemic on women and 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See interim report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the right of 
</p>
<p>everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (A/58/427). </p>


<p>girls and include comprehensive targets on HIV prevention, treatment, and care that address 
women&#8217;s subordination, violence and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>18. In terms of funding the AIDS response, donors and States have an obligation to 
ensure that the resources for HIV are commensurate with the realization of the right to the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to the extent of maximum 
available resources. At a time of dwindling resources for HIV, the efficient use of resources 
directed towards most affected populations will be critical. Among other things, the human 
rights obligations relating to the right health includes ensuring the sustainability of access to 
affordable and good quality lifesaving antiretroviral treatment for people already on 
treatment; that those in need of treatment are able to receive it; and the availability of new 
antiretroviral drugs that are less toxic, contain high barriers to drug resistance and require 
minimal clinical monitoring while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.5  
</p>
<p>19. The Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
widely ratified international human rights treaties highlight the duty and importance of 
international cooperation in realizing the right to the highest attainable standard of physical 
and mental health. Countries that cannot realize this right within existing resources are 
obliged to seek international assistance. Depending on the availability of resources, States 
should facilitate access to essential health facilities, goods and services wherever possible 
and provide the necessary aid when required.6 However, States also have a responsibility to 
ensure that international funding sources for health do not replace domestic investments in 
health systems and the fundamental need for an effective health infrastructure. In any 
society, an effective health system is a core institution, no less than a fair justice system of a 
democratic political system.7 Initiatives such as the one taken by African countries through 
the adoption of the Abuja Declaration and Framework for Action for the Fight against 
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Diseases on the allocation of at least 15 per cent of 
their annual budget to the improvement of the health sector should be encouraged.

<p><b>transform the fourth decade of AIDS into an era of zero new infections, zero AIDS-
</b></p>
<p><b>related deaths and zero discrimination. The renewed commitment of Member States 
</b></p>
<p><b>as detailed in the 2011 Political Declaration reflects lessons learned, incorporates new 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges and demonstrates global solidarity for people living with and affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>HIV. The following elements will be critical in sustaining the fragile gains that were

<p><b>made during the first 30 years of AIDS: political leadership; revolutionizing HIV 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention; ensuring that treatment is affordable, acceptable, accessible and of good 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality; sustainability and shared responsibility for investments in AIDS; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>advancing human rights for all including addressing discrimination associated with 
</b></p>
<p><b>HIV-related stigma, vulnerability and risk behaviours.
