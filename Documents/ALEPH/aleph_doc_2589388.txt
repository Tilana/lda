Quarterly Activities Report:
June 2016
The  Board  of  KalNorth  Gold  Mines  Limited  (“KalNorth  or 
the  “Company”,  ASX:  KGM)  is  pleased  to  provide  the 
report  on  activities  and  progress  made  during  the  June 
2016  Quarter.  The  second  pass  drilling  program  at 
Schiedam prospect in the Kurnalpi project well defined the 
gold target in NNW and further drilling has been planned 
for  the  current  quarter.    The  mineral  resource  at  the 
Brilliant  deposit  has  been  updated  and  is  now  reported 
under  JORC  2012.  The  development  of  Lindsay’s  project 
open pit operation now awaits formal approval from the 
DMP.  
 
Quarterly Highlights:
•  A  29  holes  drill  program  in  Schiedam  prospect  of 
Kurnalpi  project  indicated  the  NNW  trend  gold 
mineralisation and defined the target well for further 
drilling.
•  Gold mineralisation at Schiedam appears related to 
demagnetization and low gravity zone within altered 
ultramafic rock.
•  An updated gold resource of 3.53M tonnes at 1.2 g/t 
for  137,600  ounces  has  been  estimated  by  an 
independent  consultant  for  the  Brilliant  deposit  in 
Kurnalpi project.
•  The new resource had been updated by adding new 
identified gold mineralisation but reducing the depth 
cut-off for mineralisation from previous drilling.
•  Documentation
for  recommencement  of  mining 
activity  at  Lindsays  Project  under  the  agreement 
with Keras has been lodged with DMP for approval 
and mining anticipated to commence in August.

EXPLORATION REPORT
Kurnalpi Project (100% KGM) 
Schiedam Second Pass Drill Program  
The  Schiedam  Prospect  was  recognized  as  a  top  priority  target  subsequent  to  a  geophysical 
interpretation of the Kurnalpi Project undertaken in early 2015.  The target was based primarily on 
proximity to the Avoca Fault, the complex structural framework and zone of magnetic destruction- 
coincident gravity low with the latter two features suggesting a zone of significant alteration of the 
basement lithologies.
In the June quarter,  the Company completed a small phase (29 holes, 2,039m) of angled air core 
drilling  at  the  Schiedam  Prospect  (refer  ASX  announcement  on  10  June  2016)  to  follow  up  the 
positive  gold  results  returned  from  an  initial  drill  test  in  December  2015  (refer  December  2015 
Quarterly report).
The aim of this program was to confirm and increase the drill density over the core gold anomaly 
recognized from the 2015 drill program.  The drill spacing is down to 160m between drill lines and 
either  40-80m  between  drill  holes  over  a  strike  length  of  approximately  750m.    The  drilling 
intersected  a  sequence  of  predominantly  variably  altered  and  weakly  deformed  ultramafic  rocks 
(komatiite).  The most intensely altered zones are now manifested as a quartz carbonate fuchsite 
rock.
The  gold  results  were  very  encouraging  (refer  ASX  announcement  on  10  June  2016)  which  are 
considered anomalous given the wide spaced pattern of the drilling to scope out the geochemical 
footprint  of  the  system.  This  and  the  results  of  the  2015  drill  program  have  defined  a  northerly  
trending basement gold system over a 500m strike length and with a width of 50-100m wide based 
on interpretation of the maximum gold value in the drill holes.
The Company is very encouraged by these results that have confirmed and extended an emerging 
gold  discovery  in  the  Kurnalpi  Project.    Additional  infill  air  core  drilling  of  the  main  Schiedam 
anomaly  and  additional  gold  anomalies  along  the  1,500m  strike  as  well  as  early  stage  diamond 
drilling to gain a better appreciation of the geology and structural attributes of the basement rocks 
has been planned.
Brilliant Resources Update 
The  Brilliant  deposit  is  part  of  KalNorth’s  Kurnalpi  project,  located  90  km  east-northeast  of 
Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
The Brilliant Deposit is concentrated in two mineralised corridors: the east and the west mineralised 
structures. The east mineralised structure is more consistent with a strike length of approximately 
800  meters,  the  west  mineralised  structure  has  a  strike  length  of  approximately  200  meters  as 
previously defined (refer KGM ASX annual report 2012).
Gold mineralisation at Brilliant exists within a brittle dolerite host rock which has intruded upward 
into  a  sequence  of  Komatiite  ultramafic  rock  units.  The  gold  mineralisation  is  predominantly 
associated with quartz sulphide alteration in the host rock.
The Brilliant deposit Mineral Resource was previously reported at the Kurnalpi project (refer KGM 
ASX  annual  report  2012)  under  JORC  2004.  In  late  2012,  a  further  round  of  RC  drilling  was 
completed at the Brilliant North prospect (refer KGM ASX annual report 2013). In December 2015, a
Page | 2
small  targeted  program  of  diamond  and  Reverse  Circulating  (RC)  drilling  was  completed  to  test 
extensions  at  the  Brilliant  North  prospect,  which  extended  the  western  structures  a  further  120 
meters to the north (Refer KGM ASX announcement on 15 February 2016).
In the June quarter, KalNorth engaged David Reid, Principal Geologist of Ravensgate International 
Pty  Ltd  (Ravensgate)  to  undertake  the  mineral  resource  estimation  of  the  Brilliant  deposit  in 
accordance with JORC 2012.
New lode interpretation 
Mineralisation  at  the  Brilliant  deposit  is  based  on  a north-northwest  vertical shear  zone (Brilliant 
Shear zone) with flat lying supergene enrichment in the oxide zone and laterite at the surface (refer 
to Fig. 1).
The majority of the sub vertical lodes and the flat supergene lodes remained unchanged from the 
2012 Mineral Resource estimate, due to no new drilling information.
Three of new northwestern gold mineralised lodes identified at Brilliant North have been estimated 
(refer to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) based on 0.3g/t Au mineralised envelopes. A minimum downhole width of 
2m and a maximum internal dilution of 2m were used to define the individual lodes.
The  same  modelling  and  estimating  process  was  used  for  the  JORC  2012  update  to  maintain 
consistency with the 2012 model (JORC 2004), which are detailed in the attached JORC Tables and 
summarised  as  below.  David  Reid conducted  a  site visit  and  inspection of  drill  core  inspection  as 
part of the new Mineral Resource estimate.
Resource Estimation Summary 
The existing 2012 resource model was updated by adding the new estimated lodes; all drilling data 
used in the estimate was either RC, or diamond drilling. The drill spacing is a nominal 20m by 20m, 
with diamond drilling conducted at select locations (Figure 1). The resource estimate incorporates a 
total of 511 RC (56,044m), and 27 diamond (6,463m) holes (Appendix A), with the majority (80%) 
completed by KalNorth (former name Carrick).
Ravensgate evaluated the local deposit statistics of the Brilliant deposit and decided that Ordinary 
Kriging would be best used for model interpolation, the block size used was 10m north by 10m east 
by 10m elevation, with sub- blocks of 1.25m by 1.25m by 1.25m.
A cut-off grade of 0.5g/t Au, consistent with the 2012 Mineral Resource was used to select blocks 
for the estimate and block model bulk density values were assigned based on the weathering codes 
for each block.
The  end  of  the  lode  was  extrapolated  half  the  section  width,  if  the  adjacent  section  was  not 
mineralised. The envelopes were tapered using the dip/plunge of the envelope and extrapolated no 
more than 20m past the last drill hole intersection, unless indicated by other sections.
Resource classification and comparing 
The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  has  been  classified  as  Indicated  and  Inferred  and  reported  in 
accordance with JORC 2012. The comparisons to the previous estimate have been detailed in Table 
1  below.  The  deeper  mineralisation  was  not  included  in  JORC  2012  reported  resource  due  to 
insufficient grade to support underground mine development and it was also unlikely to support a 
high stripping ratio for extraction via open pit mining.
Project Review and Targeting Exercise 
The  Company  engaged  CSA  Global  Pty  Ltd  (CSA)  to  commence  a  staged  project  review  with  the
Page | 3
intention  to  physically  assess  the  project  area  in  respect  to  geology,  structure,  alteration  and 
mineralisation  in  order  to  deliver  an  integrated  interpretation  that  will  allow  the  delivery  of 
constrained targets. It will allow the Company to prioritize targets and progress exploration. 
The 1st stage scope includes review of the existing data including surface geochemistry, drilling data, 
geophysical data, satellite imagery as well as other data that may be available, the 2nd stage as field  
reconnaissance,  mapping  and  sample  collection  for  lithogeochemical  analysis  and  3rd  stage  as 
regional interpretation and target analysis and exploration model development.
The  work  program  has  progressed  very  well  with  stage  1  and  2  being  completed,  with  stage  3 
analysis pending assays returned after the end of the June Quarter. The final result is expected to be 
available in the September quarter.
Lindsays Project (100% KGM)
Lindsays is one of three projects which held JORC compliance mineral resources, 100% owned by 
KalNorth and located 70 kilometres northeast of Kalgoorlie. The Company developed this project, 
mainly the Parrot Feathers deposit, in early 2013 but suspended mining after 6 months as a result of 
the  falling  gold  price.  In  the  March  2016  quarter,  the  Company  executed  a  Heads  of  Agreement 
(“HOA”)  to  recommence  the  development  of  Lindsays  Mine  with  Keras  Resources  plc  (“Keras”)  
(refer  to  ASX  announcement  on  14  March  2016).  KalNorth  has  granted  Keras  an  exclusive  and 
irrevocable  option  to  mine  presently  published  JORC  compliant  resources  at  Lindsays  project.  
Mining at the Lindsays project may comprise an open pit mining prospect (Open Pit Mining Proposal) 
and an underground deposit known as the Parrot Feathers Deposit (Parrot Feathers Proposal).
On 10 May 2016, the Company announced that Keras had exercised the option and both parties will 
seek  regulatory  mining  approvals  and  finalise  the  formal  agreement  prior  the  commencement  of 
mining operation. Keras has lodged the requested documents for open pit mining to Department of 
Mines  and Petroleum  (“DMP”)  in Western  Australia  within  the  timeline of  HOA..  Both  parties are 
finalising the formal agreement to make sure mining activities can be carried out immediately after 
DMP approval is received.  Approval and commencement of mining activity is anticipated in August 
2016.
Tenement Divestment
In  June  quarter,  the  Company  continued  rationalising  its  tenement  portfolio  by  divestment 
Spargoville and Roe project tenements to third parties to enable the Company focus on its three key 
projects.

Notes: the 2012 resource model of Brilliant was reported in the Company’s 2013, 2014 and 2015 
Annual  Reports  under  JORC  2004  compliance.  The  2016  model  applied  a  0.5g/t  Au  cut  off  to 
estimate the resource.
CORPORATE REPORT
Further Financial Facility Draw Down
The Company refers to the $2 million convertible note facility (“CNF”) made available to it by the 
then largest shareholder, Cross-Strait Common development fund Co., Limited (“Cross Strait”). The 
Cross  Strait  CNF  was  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  November  2015  AGM  and  subsequently 
received other regulatory approvals in late February 2016.  The CNF was previously drawn down for 
an amount of $300,000 and the Company has drawn down a further $700,000 subsequent to June 
quarter-end.
Cash Reserves
Total  expenditure  for  the  June  2016  quarter  amounted  to  $385,965  of  which  $250,345  was 
attributable  to  exploration  and  evaluation,  compared  to  a  total  expenditure  of  $1,585,808  in  the 
March 2016 quarter.
The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $34,105. On 8 July 2016 (subsequent to the end of 
the quarter), the Company received $137,000 as the final settlement for sale of an ore stockpile, and 
on 22 July 2016 the Company completed a $700,000 drawdown under its existing convertible note 
facility.

Comment
Sampling Techniques
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut 
channels, random chips, or specialised 
industry standard measurement tools 
appropriate to the minerals under 
investigation, such as down-hole gamma 
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments etc). 
These examples should not be taken as 
limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to 
ensure sample representivity and the 
appropriate calibration of any measurement 
tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of 
mineralisation that are Material to the Public 
Report.
The deposit was sampled from Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond (DDH) drill holes on nominal 
20m  x  20m  spacing  and  RC  collared  diamond  tails  (RD)  in  selected  locations.  A  total  of  511RC 
(56044m), and 27 RD (6463m DDH) holes were completed, of which the majority (80%) were by 
KalNorth. 
All  drill  holes  were  drilled  to  optimally  intercept  the  mineralised  zones.  No  other  sampling 
techniques were employed.  
Sampling quality is discussed in subsequent sections of Table 1. 
Cone  or  Riffle  split  samples  from  reverse  circulation  drilling  are  the  primary  method  of  sample 
collection to support the resource estimation. 
Half core (sawn) sampling of NQ sized diamond drill holes has also been conducted. 
Drilling and sampling were undertaken in many different campaigns using a variety of drill rigs and 
equipment over several decades.
For many of the historic drilling campaigns no or limited QAQC measures were taken. For drilling 
campaigns by KalNorth, certified reference material samples were inserted into assay batches to 
check  accuracy  of  assaying.  Field  duplicates  from  an  alternative  aperture  in  the  cone  splitter  or 
riffle  splits  were  taken  to  assess  sample  collection  precision.  Sampling  during  2011-2015  was 
carried out under KalNorth Gold Mine Limited (KalNorth) protocols and QAQC procedures as per 
industry best practice.
Samples collected at 1m interval – For the majority of drill holes the entire length was sampled and 
assayed.

diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other 
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by 
what method, etc).

Drill Sample Recovery
Method of recording and assessing core and 
chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
RC drill holes account for 90% (by drilled metres) of the data used in the resource estimate. The RC 
precollared diamond drilling accounts for 10% of the total drill metres. 
Historic Drilling- RC drilling completed by Kurnalpi Gold, North Ltd, Anglo gold and Newcrest during 
1996-2004 account for 7132m or 13% of RC drill metres. 
KalNorth Drilling-Main period of RC drilling 2006-2009 completed by Redmond Drilling using riffle 
splitter and then 2011-2015 completed by Raglan Drilling using cone splitter.  Majority of diamond 
drilling completed by KalNorth in 2011. 
Reverse Circulation drilling was used for majority of the resource estimation. Holes/metres.  
Drilling undertaken by Raglan Drilling using a custom built Reverse Circulation drill rig mounted on 
a 6 x 6 truck. Specifications of the rig are hole diameter 4¾” (120mm),  Sullair 1150cfm x 350psi 
compressor, cyclone mounted on swinging arm and a Hurricane 636-41B 1400 cfm x 700psi booster 
which was not generally required 
Limited diamond drilling (NQ) has been used.  Core holes drilled in the period 2011-2015 period 
were orientated. 
Air Core (AC) and rotary air blast (RAB) were used for geological reconnaissance and to help define 
the interpretation but were not used for grade estimation
Pre KalNorth RC and diamond drilling –recoveries are unknown. 
KalNorth RC Drilling- Sample weights of the bags were checked in the field by the logging geologist 
and  light  samples  which  might  indicate  core  loss  were  noted  in  the  log.  Most  of  the  samples 
recovered from the RC drilling were dry. Consistent sample bag weights were obtained for the vast 
majority of RC samples.  Diamond tails were completed on RC holes which were terminated due to 
high water flows. 
KalNorth  Diamond  Drilling-  Core  recoveries  were  ≥98%  with  no  core  loss  issues.  Core  block 
measurements  checked,  validated  and  recoveries  recorded.  Majority  of  holes  drilled  to  test 
primary (fresh) zone. Three PQ sized triple tube Metallurgical holes drilled in 2012 targeted oxide, 
laterite and transition zone with good recoveries.
Measures taken to maximise sample 
recovery and ensure representative nature of 
the samples.
KalNorth ensured geologist and field assistant on site at all times during the RC drill program to 
ensure sample recovery is maintained at a high level and that sample collection is high quality to 
minimise contamination.  These efforts can include slowing down the drilling and cleaning cyclone

Logging
Whether a relationship exists between 
sample recovery and grade and whether 
sample bias may have occurred due to 
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse 
material.
Whether core and chip samples have been 
geologically and geotechnically logged to a 
level of detail to support appropriate Mineral 
Resource estimation, mining studies and 
metallurgical studies.
Whether logging is qualitative or 
quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, 
channel, etc) photography.
The total length and percentage of the 
relevant intersections logged.
The  resource  is  defined  mainly  by  RC  and  DDH  drilling  completed  in  2011-2015,  which  had 
recorded  good  sample  recoveries.  The  style  of  mineralisation  and  the  consistency  of  the 
mineralised intervals are considered to preclude any issue of sample bias due to material loss or 
gain.
A geologist was logging and monitoring sample recoveries at the rig for all RC drilling during the 
2011-2015 period. For these drill programs quality digital geological logs were captured and loaded 
in a database (Datashed) along with survey, assay and QAQC data.   For RC drilling pre 2011 the rig 
geologist recorded geological information to paper logs with data subsequently entered to a digital 
format ( excel).Chip tray samples were collected for all RC drilling and virtually all holes post 2004 
have been retained and securely stored by the company. DDH logs included lithological, structural, 
recovery, geotechnical (RDQ, number of fractures and weathering)..Diamond core drilled in 2011-
2015  was  logged  in  detail  on  paper  logs  both  long  hand  and  code,  and  then  transcribed  to  the 
database.
Logging  of  the  RC  or  diamond  samples  recorded  lithology,  structure,  mineralisation,  colour  and 
other features of the sample. Core was photographed in wet and dry form.
All the core and percussion drilling intervals had been logged in full.

Sub-Sampling Techniques and 
Sample Preparation
If core, whether cut or sawn and whether 
quarter, half or all core taken.
Core samples were cut in half with diamond saw.
If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, 
rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or 
dry.
For many of the historic drilling campaigns no or limited QAQC measures were taken. For drilling 
campaigns by KalNorth, Cone splitting on the sample collection cyclone for recent RC drilling.  
Earlier drilling programs used riffle splitting of the cuttings.

Quality of Assay Data and 
Laboratory Tests
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling 
is representative of the in situ material 
collected, including for instance results for 
field duplicate/second-half sampling.
For many of the historic drilling campaigns no or limited QAQC measures were taken. For drilling 
campaigns by KalNorth (2011-2015), Field duplicates collected for RC sample intervals.  Little bias in 
sampling  was  observed.    A  large  proportion  of  duplicates  were  greater  than  +-10%  difference 
between original and duplicate samples indicating poor sample precision.
Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the 
grain size of the material being sampled.
The nature, quality and appropriateness of 
the assaying and laboratory procedures used 
and whether the technique is considered 
partial or total.
For geophysical tools, spectrometers, 
handheld XRF instruments, etc, the 
parameters used in determining the analysis 
including instrument make and model, 
reading times, calibrations factors applied 
and their derivation, etc.
Nature of quality control procedures adopted 
(eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external 
laboratory checks) and whether acceptable 
levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and
No evidence of coarse gold in core or RC drill chips—lack of high grade values.
KalNorth (2004-2015) used NATA accredited commercial laboratories (KalAssay and Bureau Veritas) 
which follow industry best practice. Au was analysed by Fire Assays (50g charge). Detailed 
documentation lacking for pre KalNorth RC and Diamond drill holes.
No geophysical or spectral tools were used.
For many of the historic drilling campaigns (pre 2004) no or limited QAQC measures were taken.

Verification of Sampling and 
Assaying
The verification of significant intersections by 
independent or alternative company 
personnel.
Significant  gold intersections were visually validated-checked by  the Exploration Manager during 
the 2011-2015 drill campaigns to determine the consistency of assays recorded versus geology , to 
ensure  that  the  assays  had  supporting  geological  evidence.  Mineralised  intervals  correlate  with 
zones of alteration and quartz veining.
The use of twinned holes.
No twinned drill hole have been used.
Documentation of primary data, data entry 
procedures, data verification, data storage 
(physical and electronic) protocols.
2011-2015  Drilling-  Geological  and  sampling  information  captured  was  recorded  in  the  field  on 
Panasonic  tough  books  using  Logchief  software  and  the  company’s  geological  legend.    This  data 
was then sent to the data base administrator and imported to Datashed.  All validation, auditing of 
the geologists recorded data was undertaken by the database administrator.
Discuss any adjustment to assay data.
No assay adjustment was applied
1-7
Location of Data Points
Accuracy and quality of surveys used to 
locate drill holes (collar and down-hole 
surveys), trenches, mine workings and other 
locations used in Mineral Resource 
estimation.
The  collars  of  the  KalNorth  drill  holes  where  surveyed  by  Timble  R6,  base  receiver  and 
rover  equipment  using  the  Real  Time  Kinematic  method  (RTK).  The  equipment  was 
calibrated using several existing state survey control points.  The excepted accuracy for the 
RTK method are ±0.03m in the horizontal and ±0.05m in the vertical relative to the survey 
control used.  The surveying was undertaken by contractor Kingston Surveys.  
The Pre 2011 RC drill holes only have a planned downhole survey. KalNorth located and 
re-entered all the drill hole that the company could find and resurveyed the drill hole with a 
gyro  downhole  camera.  The  remaining  drill  hole  (KalNorth didn’t  find) still has  a planned 
downhole survey.  
Ravensgate  checked  the  collar  position  RLs  against  the  original  topographic  surface.  No 
adjustments were required.
Specification of the grid system used.
The grid system used at the project area is MGA_GDA94, Zone 51. All data is recorded using Easting 
and Northing and AHD.
Quality and adequacy of topographic control.
Topography is derived from 1m contours derived from surveyed RC holes.  Topography in the area 
is of very low relief.

Data Spacing and Distribution
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration 
Results.
Drill holes are arranged on a regular grid with 20x20m or 40x20m spacing in the main part of the 
mineral resource.

Part
Criteria
Explanation
Comment
Whether the data spacing and distribution is 
sufficient to establish the degree of 
geological and grade continuity appropriate 
for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
estimation procedure(s) and classifications 
applied.
Continuity of the mineralised dolerite units is well defined by the current drill spacing. 
Variogram ranges exceed the drill spacing but short range variogram structures show local Au 
grade variability at the drill spacing is high.
Whether sample compositing has been 
applied.
Compositing  of  samples  was  conducted  at  one  metre  down  hole  interval.    This  length  is  the 
dominant drill sample interval.
1-9
Orientation of Data in 
Relation to Geological 
Structure
Whether the orientation of sampling 
achieves unbiased sampling of possible 
structures and the extent to which this is 
known, considering the deposit type.
Overall geological units are steep to vertical.  The majority of holes are inclined to the west and 
cross the units.  Hole intercepts are not true widths of the units. 
Veining associated with the mineralisation observed in oriented core has a shallow dip to the west.   
Some holes inclined to the east confirm the interpretation from the west inclined holes.
If the relationship between the drilling 
orientation and the orientation of key 
mineralised structures is considered to have 
introduced a sampling bias, this should be 
assessed and reported if material.
Drilling cross cuts mineralised veins at a reasonably high angle to give representative samples.  Drill 
intervals are not true thickness.

The KURNALPI PROJECT is located approximately 90 km east of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and 
is  part  of  a  large  package  of  contiguous  wholly  owned  tenements.    The  work  described  in  this 
report was undertaken on Mining Lease 28/374 and M28/92 held 100% by KalNorth Gold Mines 
Limited.   The company signed a mining agreement in December 2012 with the Central East Native 
Title group. 
The  tenement  is  current  and  in  good  standing.    Heritage  and  Flora-Fauna  surveys  have  been 
completed over the tenements. 
Tenement M28/374 has total 2% royalty on gold produced divided amongst 4 separate parties 
KalNorth  holds  granted  tenements  that  surround  and  are  contiguous  with  the  two  resource 
tenements.
These  tenements  are  in  good  standing  and  KalNorth  is  unaware  of  any  impediments  for 
exploration on these leases.
Surface cover obscured the deposit from historical prospecting in the area.  Modern exploration 
has been completed at Brilliant by KalNorth Gold Mines Limited since 2009 and has estimated a 
JORC 2004 Compliant resource of 3.9Mt grading 1.2gpt Au.  
Kurnalpi Gold NL undertook exploration at Brilliant during the late 1990’s who made the initial 
discovery.  The prospect was then explored in short periods by North Limited, Anglo gold, 
Newcrest and Western Resources Pty Ltd.  KalNorth acquired the Brilliant project in the 
acquisition of Shannon Resources Ltd in 2007. 
KalNorth was formally known as Carrick Gold Limited and changed its name in November 2012.
The local geology mainly consists of basaltic flows with several komatiitic, peridotite flows 
interbedded with Archaean sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, siltstone and chert which is 
intruded by granitoid rock and dolerite sills. 
The Brilliant deposit is localised on the north-northwest Brilliant shear zone which is a control for 
the gold mineralisation throughout the local area. The central eastern portion of the Kurnalpi

Balanced Reporting
These relationships are particularly important 
in the reporting of Exploration Results.
Drill intercepts are not reported.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with 
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole 
lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, 
true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) 
and tabulations of intercepts should be 
included for any significant discovery being 
reported These should include, but not be 
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar 
locations and appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all 
Exploration Results is not practicable, 
representative reporting of both low and high
Downhole intervals are at low angle to the mineralised domain and do not represent the true 
thickness. However, this has been taken into account in the resource estimation process.

Ravensgate visited site on 1/4/2016.  There is no surface expression of the mineralisation with 
transported cover obscuring much of the area.  Drill sites in the vicinity of the eastern lodes had been 
rehabilitated recently but collar plugs were visible.  Drill sites of more recent drilling on the western 
lode were intact.  Sample reject piles were retained in rows near collars and the geological units, 
weathering profile and zones of mineralisation were easily identified.

Geological Interpretation
Confidence in (or conversely, the 
uncertainty of) the geological 
interpretation of the mineral deposit.
Interpretation of the weathering profile and the transported material surface is of high confidence.  
These zones are clearly visible in drilling and are logged consistently. 
The confidence in the mineralised domain modelling would be improved by an interpretation of the 
dolerite intrusions which host the mineralisation.  Inconsistent lithology logging codes have made this 
task difficult.
Nature of the data used and of any 
assumptions made.
No QAQC for older (pre 2011) data is available and it is assumed that it is representative.  This data 
represents a low proportion of data used in the resource estimate.
The effect, if any, of alternative estimation 
interpretations on Mineral Resource 
estimation
Alternative connection of mineralised lodes between holes and section could be effected.  A local 
variation in the location of mineralisation may result, but there would be little impact on global 
volume.
The use of geology in guiding and 
controlling Mineral Resource estimation.
Mineralised lodes are interpreted to follow the observed orientation of the dolerite intrusions.

minimum downhole length of 2 m and with a maximum internal waste interval of 2 m. Individual 
lodes were extended half way between sections and extrapolated no more than 20 m past the last 
drill hole intersection unless indicated up by other sections.
The factors affecting continuity both of 
grade and geology.
Orogenic shear hosted gold deposits of this type are well documented, and known to have limited 
range of continuity in both grade and geology, requiring very close spaced drilling to confirm 
continuity.

Estimation and Modelling 
Techniques
The extent and variability of the Mineral 
Resource expressed as length (along strike 
or otherwise), plan width, and depth below 
surface to the upper and lower limits of the 
Mineral Resource.
The nature and appropriateness of the 
estimation technique(s) applied and key 
assumptions, including treatment of 
extreme grade values, domaining, 
interpolation parameters and maximum 
distance of extrapolation from data points. 
If a computer assisted estimation method 
was chosen include a description of 
computer software and parameters used.
The availability of check estimates, 
previous estimates and/or mine production 
records and whether the Mineral Resource 
estimate takes appropriate account of such 
data.
The assumptions made regarding recovery 
of by-products.
The area of mineralisation occurs within a series of mineralised lodes which extend over a 1 km strike 
length and 150 m width. The mineralisation is extended to depth of around 220 m from surface. The 
thickness of the individual lodes ranges from less than 1.5 m up to 20 m.
Grade estimation using ordinary kriging was completed for Au within individual lode domains.  Lode 
boundaries were treated as hard. Search size and orientation was guided by variogram modelling 
results. 
Indicated blocks used a minimum of 8 composites to complete an estimation.  Inferred blocks used a 
minimum of 2 composites. 
Top cuts were applied to composite outliers.  A cut of 15g/t Au was applied to the flat or supergene 
lodes and 20g/t Au applied to the steep lodes. 
Surpac mining software was used to complete the interpretation and grade estimation.
The resource estimate corresponds well with previous resource estimates.
No recoverable by-products are expected.

non-grade variables of economic

multielement data reported from the metallurgical work completed and also extensive petrological 
examination of drill chips.  The main sulphide species is Pyrite.  Rocks outside the mineralisation appear 
to have low sulfide content.
In the case of block model interpolation, 
the block size in relation to the average 
sample spacing and the search employed.
Estimation block size is 10x10x10m which is approximately half the drill spacing in the well drilled areas 
of the deposit.   
Multiple interpolation runs and search passes were used to obtain the best local estimation where 
there was high drilling density. 
Maximum search ellipse dimensions were:
• 
•
Indicated 70x45x8m 
Inferred 140x90x16
Any assumptions behind modelling of 
selective mining units.
Minimum downhole width of 2m was used to ensure that narrow zones were not interpreted.  No 
selective unit size was assumed.
Any assumptions about correlation 
between variables.
Description of how the geological 
interpretation was used to control the 
resource estimates.
Only Au was estimated.
Estimations were constrained to within interpreted mineralised lodes.  Boundaries of the lodes was 
assumed to be hard with no samples located outside the lode used in the estimation.
Discussion of basis for using or not using 
grade cutting or capping.
Some of the lodes contained high grade outliers identified from histograms and probability plots.  Top 
cuts of 15g/t Au for flat lodes and 20g/t Au for vertical lodes were applied during estimation.
The process of validation, the checking 
process used, the comparison of model 
data to drill hole data, and use of 
reconciliation data if available.
Modelled grades were compared to drill hole grades in section and plan to confirm that the estimated 
grades represent the input data. 
Global comparison between the estimated grade of each load and raw and declustered composite 
grades were conducted.  Individual lodes with low composite numbers showed greatest variation but 
overall there was a good global correspondence. 
Swath plots were used to compare estimated block and composite grade trends.  Estimated grades 
were smoother than composite grades but showed overall trends in the input data were honoured.

Mining Factors or 
Assumptions
Assumptions made regarding possible 
mining methods, minimum mining 
dimensions and internal (or, if applicable, 
external) mining dilution.
Mineralisation greater than 130m below surface has been excluded from the resource.  This is based on 
maximum depth of open pits for similar low grade deposits in the region.  The Brilliant deposit grade is 
highly unlikely to support underground mining. 
Preliminary mining optimisation studies have previously been conducted on earlier block models.
Metallurgical Factors or 
Assumptions
The basis for assumptions or predictions 
regarding metallurgical amenability.
Metallurgical test work indicates that Au recovery is high (92-98%) via grinding and cyanide leaching. 
Bottle roll leach tests indicate that expected heap leach recovery for fresh rock is reasonable (60%), but 
poor for oxide and laterite material.

The bulk density for bulk material must 
have been measured by methods that 
adequately account for void spaces (vugs, 
porosity, etc), moisture and differences 
between rock and alteration zones within
Weathering has had the greatest influence on the bulk density of the resource.  On this basis the 
interpreted weathering zones has been used to assigned the following bulk density to the resource 
blocks 
• 
•  Oxide 1.92 t/m3 
• 
•
Transitional 2.36 t/m3 
Fresh 2.79 t/m3
Laterite 2.44 t/m3
The resource is located in sound competent rock with low porosity and low voids.   
Variation in bulk density with weathering has been used as per above.  No moisture has been 
measured and the bulk density was measured on a dry basis.

Comment
Discuss assumptions for bulk density 
estimates used in the evaluation process of 
the different materials.
There are low numbers of bulk density measurements in the laterite and oxide zones.  This reduces the 
confidence in the values used for these zones.

Classification
The basis for the classification of the 
Mineral Resources into varying confidence 
categories.
The Au estimates have been classified as Indicated and Inferred resources based on geological

Whether appropriate account has been

confidence in tonnage/grade estimations, 
reliability of input data, confidence in 
continuity of geology and metal values, 
quality, quantity and distribution of the 
data).
Whether the result appropriately reflects

The results of any audits or reviews of 
Mineral Resource estimates.
Where appropriate a statement of the 
relative accuracy and confidence level in 
the Mineral Resource estimate using an 
approach or procedure deemed 
appropriate by the Competent Person.
The statement should specify whether it 
relates to global or local estimates, and, if 
local, state the relevant tonnages, which 
should be relevant to technical and
The definition of the mineralised zones was relatively consistent from section to section and based on a 
good level of geological understanding producing a robust model of mineralised domains.  The 
validation of the block model shows relatively good correlation of the input data to the estimated 
grades.
The Mineral Resource estimate appropriately reflects the view of the Competent Person.
No external reviews or audits of the resource estimation have been undertaken.
The relative accuracy of the Mineral Resource estimate is reflected in the resource category, with much 
of the deposit classified as Indicated Resource.   Inferred resources have been extrapolated to a 
maximum of 20m from drill holes.  The extrapolation has not been quantified but represents a small 
proportion of the resource.
This statement relates to both global and local estimates of tonnes and grades.  Indicated resources 
should be considered as having reasonable local accuracy whilst the Inferred resources are global in 
nature.
