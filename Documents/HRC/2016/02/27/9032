</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The election of a new President of Somalia, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, the expansion of the 
Parliament, the appointment of a government of unity, and the complete withdrawal of Ethiopian 
troops from Somalia in early January 2009 have created a new momentum and a window of 
opportunity for the implementation of the Djibouti peace agreement. 
 Furthermore, the feared breakdown in the security situation has not occurred so far, with 
Sheikh Sharif Ahmed stressing that security was a main priority, during a visit to Mogadishu 
immediately after his election. His assurances of an inclusive process and discussions with a 
wide range of groups have also been positively perceived. Elsewhere in Somalia, peaceful 
elections in &#8220;Puntland&#8221; in January led to the election of a new President and a Government 
which has made a commitment to democratization and change. 
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, many challenges lie ahead, contributing to the unpredictability of the 
situation. Strengthening security, including through the development of Somali transitional 
forces and a new civilian police force in South/Central is urgent. At the same time, the African 
Union Peace and Security Committee has urged the reinforcement of the African Union Mission 
in Somalia (AMISOM) and asked the United Nations to provide urgently needed financial and 
political support, which is currently under consideration.  
</p>
<p> Despite these recent political developments, all the parties to the conflict have continued to 
commit serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Indiscriminate 
violence and frequent attacks against civilians continue, including the use of heavy artillery, 
mortars and roadside bombs; targeted attacks, abduction and killings of aid workers and human 
rights defenders, in particular journalists; smuggling and human trafficking; looting and 
extensive property destruction; as well as sexual and gender-based violence. Intensified and 
widespread violence, in 2008 especially, has also led to a significant increase in the number of 
displaced persons, which stood at a staggering 1.1 million people as of September 2008. 
Moreover, the right to food is severely affected by the drought and water shortages and the rights 
to education, health, shelter, water and sanitation are seriously challenged. All these violations 
and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law are committed with total 
impunity. 
</p>
<p> The lack of accountability for past and current violations and abuses of human rights and 
international humanitarian law has further exacerbated the situation. A culture of impunity, 
although not new, prevails, especially in those cases where the traditional clan structure does not 
provide adequate protection, and most acutely in cases where the victims belong to a minority. 
</p>
<p> Although institutions are still very weak, the ongoing Djibouti peace process is the 
opportunity to start building the necessary structures to prevent human rights violations and 
abuses in the future. The establishment of the Joint Security Committee<b>1</b> and the High Level 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Joint Security Committee (JSC) and the High Level Committee (HLC), as established 
</p>
<p>respectively by the articles 8 and 9 of the Djibouti Agreement, are two key bodies of the peace 
accord chaired by the United Nations to follow up on the implementation of agreed security  
 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Committee pursuant to the Djibouti Agreement, which strongly focus on the protection of the 
population with respect to human rights, constitutes a positive step in ensuring that political 
dialogue be continued, while also addressing issues of justice and reconciliation. The unity 
Government established in February 2009 must continue this focus. 
</p>
<p> On 22-23 November, the independent expert appointed by the Human Rights Council on 
the situation of human rights in Somalia, while on mission to the Horn of Africa, attended a 
preparatory meeting on justice and reconciliation organized by the United Nations Political 
Office for Somalia (UNPOS) Human Rights Unit (HRU) with OHCHR support, with the 
participation of the members of the High Level Committee, civil society delegates, and 
representatives from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat, 
among others. The positive outcome of the meeting was an agreement (though implementation 
has been delayed) to set up a working group made up of three representatives of each party, 
chaired by UNPOS, to review in more depth possible mechanisms such as the establishment of a 
commission of inquiry and/or judicial mechanisms. 
 Meanwhile, attacks on humanitarian aid workers and civil society continued unabated. 
In 2008, the conflict in Somalia took on a new dimension with targeted killings of dozens of 
humanitarian workers and civil society activists. On 17 October a World Food Programme 
(WFP) national officer was killed in Merca, as were two more in January 2009. On 19 October a 
UNICEF national officer was killed in Hudur. International non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) and United Nations agencies have subsequently limited their actions in lower Shabelle. 
</p>
<p> In &#8220;Somaliland&#8221;, Al Shabab attacked the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) compound in Hargeisa on 29 October, killing 4, including 2 national staff members, and 
severely wounding 10. The attack was one in a concerted series of attacks in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and 
&#8220;Puntland&#8221;, also targeting the presidential palace in Hargeisa, the Ethiopian diplomatic mission 
in Hargeisa and the headquarters of the &#8220;Puntland&#8221; security services in Bossasso. Owing to the 
security situation, all planned United Nations human rights activities inside Somalia had to be 
postponed, but with renewed access to some parts of the country in February, it is hoped that it 
will be possible to resume these.  
</p>
<p> The situation in Baidoa has also been of concern, with Al Shabaab taking control of the 
town in January, though high levels of violence were prevented through mediation by elders. A 
wave of violence at the end of 2008 led to at least two targeted killings. The deputy minister for 
reconciliation, Ismail Hassan Timir, was shot dead on 27 December by unidentified gunmen as 
he got out of his car in Baidoa. Another member of the national reconciliation commission, 
Abdullahi Abdi Egaal, was shot dead on 1 January 2009 in similar circumstances in the centre of 
Baidoa. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>arrangements, including monitoring of the cease fire agreement (JSC) and to address challenges 
related to political, justice and reconciliation issues, including protection of civilians and respect 
of human rights (HLC). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> Violations of freedom of expression continued to be a major concern in all parts of 
Somalia. Authorities in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and &#8220;Puntland&#8221; strictly reduced freedom of expression in 
the preparation for elections, although the situation appears to have improved in Puntland since 
the elections. In South/Central Somalia, both sides to the conflict continue to target journalists 
and human rights defenders. On 1 January 2009 the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) 
condemned the murder of Hassan Mayow Hassan, a Somali journalist, who was shot dead in the 
Afgoye District of lower Shabelle region in Southern Somalia. A second journalist, the Director 
of Radio HornAfrik, was shot dead in Mogadishu on 3 February.  
</p>
<p> As mentioned earlier, the complete withdrawal of the Ethiopian troops from Somalia, 
together with the enlargement of Parliament, the election of President Sheikh Sharif, the 
formation of a Government of national unity under a new prime minister, create a new 
momentum and a window of opportunity for lasting peace and security in Somalia which must 
not be lost. Meanwhile, huge challenges lie ahead in terms of security, political and logistical 
needs. 
</p>
<p> Ethiopia&#8217;s withdrawal deprives the militant liberationists of their national appeal. In this 
regard, much will depend on how the security needs in Mogadishu and Baidoa, in particular, are 
met. Whether the international community would be able to strengthen the capacity of 
AMISOM, and support the establishment of functioning security forces which protect the 
population rather than abuse it, are all factors, including possible increasing conflict between the 
Islamist hardliners and the insurgent groups, will have an impact on the situation of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p> Before entering into the substance of my report - which covers the period from 
September 2008 to February 2009 - I should like to acknowledge all the help I received 
during the entire trip and the hospitality shown by many to me and to my Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) colleague. First and foremost, I am grateful to 
Idrissa Kane of OHCHR who assists me in the exercise of my mandate. I am also grateful to the 
United Nations offices at the various places I visited for logistical and other support they 
provided to us. But the support I received from UNHCR was much more than logistical.  
</p>
<p> I am grateful to UNPOS and in particular to the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, for filling me in the progress of the 
Djibouti Peace Accord. And finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the 
Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Yemen, Ali Muthana Hassan, and the Deputy Minister for 
Human Rights for Yemen, Ali Saleh Taiseer, for the courtesies and hospitality they and their 
colleagues extended to me and my colleague during our trip to Yemen. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate established by the former Commission on Human Rights 
in its resolution 1993/86 and with resolution 7/35 adopted at the seventh session of the 
Human Rights Council that renewed the mandate for a period of one year, the independent 
expert submits the present report to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Appointed by the Council in March 2008, I undertook my first field visit to the Horn of 
Africa subregion from 28 June to 12 July 2008 and visited Kenya, Somalia, including &#8220;Puntland&#8221; 
and &#8220;Somaliland&#8221;, as well as Djibouti and Ethiopia. I presented my preliminary oral report to the 
ninth session of the Council on 19 September 2008.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. From 22 November to 2 December 2008, I undertook my second field visit to the region to 
update the tenth session of the Council on the situation of human rights in Somalia. However, 
due to the security constraints (Mogadishu is under security Phase V while all other areas fall 
under Phase IV), I was not able to visit Somalia but focused on the neighbouring countries such 
as Kenya, including a visit to the Dadaab refugee camp. I visited Djibouti and Yemen, where I 
also had the opportunity to talk to newly arrived Somali refugees. The present report covers the 
period from September 2008 to January 2009. 
</p>
<p>4. In Kenya and Yemen I visited refugee camps and spoke with United Nations officials 
dealing with refugees. In Yemen, I also met with key ministers and officials of the Government 
involved with refugee affairs. In Djibouti, I participated in the preparatory conference on Justice 
and Reconciliation organized by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia 
and with OHCHR as part of the Djibouti Peace Accord formalized in August 2008 between TFG 
and ARS. While there, I also spoke at length with the African Union Ambassador to Somalia. 
I had the opportunity to talk with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the Somali Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein, the 
members of the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) and Government (TFG) as well as with 
many NGO representatives in Yemen and Djibouti. 
</p><p>5. This report will focus primarily upon (a) my participation in and the outcome of the 
Djibouti preparatory conference; (b) my findings on the situation in Somalia based on my talks 
with refugees in camps and conglomerations, as well as refugee officials, in Kenya and Yemen; 
and (c) information gathered on developments in the field of human rights and humanitarian law 
in Somalia from United Nations and NGO sources. Based on the above, I would share some 
personal reflections and draw a few conclusions on the challenges of my mandate. And finally, 
the independent expert would like to offer some recommendations for consideration by the key 
players concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>II. OUTCOME OF THE DJIBOUTI PREPARATORY CONFERENCE  
ON JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION 
</b></p>
<p>6. This report will begin with my trip to Djibouti, for two main reasons. Not only because this 
was the first stop (from 22 to 26 November 2008) on my trip schedule but also because it 
provides a good opportunity to start with developments in the political sphere, which is 
inextricably linked to the human rights situation in Somalia. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. A preparatory conference on Justice and Reconciliation was organized by the 
Human Rights Unit of UNPOS, together with experts from OHCHR Headquarters in Geneva. 
The conference was an important part in the implementation of the Djibouti Peace Agreement 
formalized in August 2008 between the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the 
opposition grouping known as the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS). In its 
article 9, the agreement had, inter alia, led to the establishment of a High Level Committee 
(HLC) of the parties to follow up on issues of justice and reconciliation, as well as other political 
matters. Those attending the meeting were members of the HLC and UNPOS, of Somali civil 
society representatives from African Union (AU), the Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD), the European Union (EU), UNICEF, UNIFEM, UNHCR, and the 
Department of Political Affairs, among others. 
</p>
<p>8. The main objective of the conference was to provide the two main parties to the 
Djibouti Agreement with information and tools on the different types of mechanisms to be set up 
in the context of a transitional justice process, to highlight the need for respect for existing 
international framework and the development of a locally relevant process respecting that 
framework. The idea was to set the ball rolling in this regard.  
</p>
<p>9. The preparatory conference ended with an agreement to set up a working group made up of 
representatives of each party and chaired by UNPOS. The working group would make an 
in-depth review of possible mechanisms such as the establishment of a commission of inquiry 
and/or judicial mechanisms to deal with human rights and humanitarian law violations. It would 
present its work and proposals at a second preparatory meeting to be held in early 2009, prior to 
the main conference on justice and reconciliation which would take place later in the year.  
</p><p>10. I consider this to be a very positive development. As a participant in the conference, I was 
pleased by the level of commitment of the parties towards peace and reconciliation in Somalia. It 
will be important for UNPOS and OHCHR to take the outcome of this preparatory conference 
forward by ensuring proper follow-up in cooperation with the working group. The conference 
was very useful in providing information and initiating discussions on transitional justice issues 
but, as has been rightly recognized by UNPOS, it will be an uphill task to balance the time 
required to develop a proper, well-informed process and the security requirements on the ground 
for it to be put in place, and at the same time show some concrete signs of progress.  
</p>
<p>11. As the conference overlapped with a meeting of the HLC of the parties under the 
Djibouti Agreement, I had the opportunity to attend the signing of the decisions of the HLC on a 
power-sharing agreement between the TFG and the ARS. In particular, the parties agreed to 
establish a Unity Government and an enlarged Parliament to accommodate the opposition forces 
and other elements. The decisions also included, as mentioned earlier, the establishment of a 
working group to explore as appropriate a possible mechanism to set up a Commission of 
Inquiry (COI) and/or an International Tribunal to address gross violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law and to move forward to end impunity and establish a system and 
mechanism to ensure accountability.  
</p>
<p>12. In between the meetings in Djibouti, I had the occasion to meet with senior ministers of 
the TFG, including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. 
I also met with a large number of members of the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). Equally 
important was the opportunity to meet with a significant number of opposition leaders belonging </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to the ARS. They reassured me of their desire for peace in Somalia. It was encouraging to learn 
from them that among those who are still opposed to the accord, many are gradually coming 
around on the side of peace. The fact remains, however, that the ARS Asmara, the remaining 
main opposition grouping, as well as so-called Al Shabab or other armed groups, are still a 
considerable force to reckon with and it will be a long way for peace to be established in 
Somalia, as long as they stay out of the peace process. To my mind this will be the main 
challenge for the TFG, ARS and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to deal 
with. 
</p>
<p>13. In my talks with the then Prime Minister, Nur Hassan Hussein, I reminded him of the letter 
I had written to him after our first meeting in July 2008. He told me that he had read it carefully. 
I then shared with him my concerns about the continuing and intensified human rights and 
humanitarian law violations in his country in more recent months. I shall summarize his 
responses in the paragraphs below. 
</p>
<p>14. The Prime Minister acknowledged that the deteriorating human rights situation in Somalia 
was indeed a matter of concern for him and his Government. They considered that to correct the 
situation, the role of religion, clans and clan elders is critical. Somalia had inherited a culture 
where clan elders and traditional leaders used to play a protection and reconciliation role 
between parties in a conflict. These values have been largely destroyed in the South and Central 
region by war and the gunmen. Fortunately they have survived in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and &#8220;Puntland&#8221;. 
One of the Prime Minister&#8217;s goals was to help revive these traditional values in the rest of 
Somalia as a means to resolve the conflict and contribute to reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>15. The then Prime Minister added that, while it is indeed the task of the Government to 
protect human rights, his Government did not have the necessary capacity to do so, particularly 
when the opposition is exerting so much violence against it and the people. In order to make an 
impact, the TFG must have its capacity enhanced. It needs the support of the international 
community in this regard. The Prime Minister asked me to convey this message to the 
international community. 
</p>
<p>16. As examples of his Government&#8217;s achievements, the Prime Minister mentioned the recent 
decentralization of the Banadir Administration and the agreement between TFG and ARS on the 
enlargement of TFP and the establishment of a Government of National Unity. He also added 
that those who were displaced between Afgooye and Mogadishu in June-July welcomed the new 
administration of Banadir and were encouraged to return home. 
</p>
<p>17. Responding to my concern about incidents such as the stoning to death of a young girl, 
Aisha Ibrahim Dhuhulow, in Kismayo, on 27 October, and the recent targeting and assassination 
of women human rights defenders, United Nations staff and journalists, the Prime Minister told 
me that he was himself very saddened by what happened in Kismayo. However, because the 
place is outside his Government&#8217;s control, there was not much he could do about it. He feared, 
however, that without increased international support to the Government, such cases could occur 
repeatedly. He hoped that the enlargement of the Parliament and the establishment of a 
Government of National Unity would improve the human rights situation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. My talks with the then Vice Prime Minister, Ahmad Abdi Salan Haji, were equally 
wide-ranging. Among other things, we discussed ways and means to involve the people of 
Somalia directly in the peace process. We discussed at length my proposal for the use of a 
participatory action research (PAR) approach in Somalia, which I had recommended in my oral 
report to the Council at its ninth session. I was pleased to learn that he too is aware of the 
approach and that he had already tried it effectively at several places in Somalia. I agreed to 
share with him an elaboration of my idea which we could try out on a pilot basis at an 
appropriate time and place. 
</p>
<p>19. In Djibouti, I had also the opportunity to talk to the ambassador of the African Union (AU) 
to Somalia, Nicholas Bwakira, at some length. He reiterated the commitment of the AU to 
helping the peace process in Somalia. It may be mentioned that the same message was 
conveyed to me by the Chairman of the African Union, Jean Ping, whom I met last July at 
AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa. My discussions with Mr. Bwakira included the need to 
approach the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) for 
financial and other support for an international stabilization force to fill in after the withdrawal of 
Ethiopian troops from Somalia. I pledged my full cooperation in this regard. I have already 
talked to the Ambassadors of the Arab League and OIC in this regard in Geneva last September 
and intend to follow up with talks with senior officials at the Headquarters of these two 
organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE SITUATION IN SOMALIA AS GLEANED FROM TALKS WITH 
REFUGEES AND REFUGEE OFFICIALS IN KENYA AND YEMEN 
</b></p>
<p>20. As stated earlier, because of my inability to visit Somalia, I had put special emphasis on 
meeting with newly arrived Somali refugees in Kenya and Yemen and find out from them about 
the circumstances that led to their flight from Somalia. The following paragraphs contain some 
information/impressions based on my talks with them and others involved with refugee affairs. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Visit to Dadaab refugee camps, Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>21. I visited the refugee camps in Dadaab, Kenya, on 27 November 2008. I visited the same 
camps during my first trip in July 2008. I have included my findings from that trip in my last 
report to the Council. This time, the number of refugees had increased significantly. The arrivals 
in 2008 and, more particularly in recent months, have swelled the camp population, making 
Dadaab, which hosts more than 230,000 refugees, the largest refugee conglomeration in the 
world. The average monthly number of arrivals of Somali refugees in Kenya recently has been 
around 5,000, among the highest since the opening of the camps in 1991. 
</p>
<p>22. The reasons given by the newly arriving refugees for their decision to flee Somalia in such 
large numbers are similar to those stated in my earlier report. As in the past, the majority of the 
refugees I met came from Mogadishu. (According to one estimate some 870,000 persons, or 
almost two-thirds of the population of Mogadishu, have now fled the city, either to become 
refugees in Kenya or Yemen or displaced within Somalia.) They fled because of continued 
insecurity in civilian areas. The more articulate among them blamed all the warring parties in the 
conflict in Somalia - the TFG forces, the Ethiopian troops and the Islamist insurgents - for 
continued violence, death and destruction. All of them are said to have pursued military tactics 
without much concern about civilian population living in urban areas. The insurgents have </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>continued to employ hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, namely ambush and mortar attacks, using the 
civilian population as cover. The response of the TFG and Ethiopian forces, according to them, 
has continued to be unrestrained with indiscriminate retaliatory mortar and rocket attacks as well 
as artillery fires on populated neighbourhoods. They also employ indiscriminate violence during 
house-to-house searches for weapons and insurgents. 
</p>
<p>23. The refugees confirmed the general knowledge that the humanitarian situation in Somalia 
has deteriorated dramatically in recent months. This was also corroborated by refugee officials 
who have interviewed other refugees. Most of the people I talked to spoke about increasing 
success of the insurgents in bringing more and more Somali territory under their control, putting 
the TFG and Ethiopian forces virtually on the run. Many of them told me that they feared further 
chaos if the Ethiopian troops withdraw and the insurgents take over. Even in Mogadishu and 
Baidoa, where the TFG still had some control with the help of Ethiopian troops, there is an 
appearance of a state of siege. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Visits to Sana&#8217;a and Aden, Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>24. This was my first trip to Yemen as the independent expert on the situation of human rights 
in Somalia. In both Sana&#8217;a and Aden, UNHCR had organized a series of meetings with refugees 
from Somalia, most of whom were new arrivals. All those I talked to had arrived in Yemen on 
smugglers&#8217; boats. In Aden I met with a number of refugees who had arrived only a few weeks 
ago. Apart from what they told me about conditions of life in Somalia which impelled them to 
leave the country, the descriptions they gave me on their crossing the Gulf of Aden were 
horrifying and would be etched in my mind for a long time. 
</p>
<p>25. In my long career as a UNHCR official before my retirement some 10 years ago, I have 
dealt with many painful humanitarian situations. My memories of the suffering of the 
Vietnamese boat people are still fresh. But what I heard about the traumatic experiences of men, 
women and children who crossed the Gulf of Aden in overcrowded fishing boats for safety to 
Yemen has overshadowed those memories. 
</p>
<p>26. I am told that a documentary movie has been made by a French journalist/film-maker on 
the inhuman conditions of the journey that refugees normally undertake to arrive, dead or alive, 
on the shores of Yemen. The film-maker was on the journey he filmed. I have not watched the 
movie but I spoke with some survivors of similar journeys. Listening to them was a painful 
experience. They demonstrated for me how they were made to sit in rows on a small boat, 
pressing their knees onto their chests, with no space to move around during the entire trip. The 
total ban on movement on board is also imposed to ensure safety since any abrupt movement 
may unbalance the boat and cause it to capsize. In the absence of any other alternative, the 
passengers had to meet the calls of nature while seated at the same place. The trip lasts an 
average of 36 hours. It was difficult for me to imagine how more than 100 persons in an 
overcrowded boat, not fit to accommodate even half that number, are able to survive such a 
choppy ride, mostly in total darkness of the night. I was told that most of the people arriving 
after such unhygienic, sardine-like rides develop severe skin diseases and have to remain prone 
on the beach to slowly regain their ability to stretch their legs out.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. Apart from conditions on the boats, the journey itself is very treacherous because of rough 
sea conditions. Many perish at sea when their boats capsize. Many others are thrown overboard 
by ruthless crew if there are differences of opinions or other altercations between them and the 
passengers, if the passengers disobey their orders, if the boat is deemed to be excessively 
crowded under given circumstances, or if their children cry or make noises that may draw 
attention of patrol boats nearby. Many are pushed overboard near the Yemeni shores because of 
fear by the smugglers of being caught by patrol boats.  
</p>
<p>28. As a result of all these hazards, out of the 43,000 persons - mostly Somalis but some 
Ethiopians as well - who arrived in 850 boats in Yemen through early December 2008, more 
than 380 persons have perished at sea and another 360 are missing. In 2007, out of 
29,500 persons who arrived in Yemen by boat, again mostly Somalis, some 1,400 persons had 
either perished at sea or were missing. 
</p>
<p>29. In fact, on the last day of our stay in Yemen, i.e. on 2 December, UNHCR reported the 
drowning of at least 20 Somalis, with 2 missing, when the passengers on a boat carrying 
115 persons were forced by the boat crew to jump overboard in deep water near the shore of 
Yemen. The problem of people thus perishing at sea and being washed ashore has assumed such 
a proportion that UNHCR had to intervene with the Yemeni authorities to grant burial grounds in 
three different sites.  
</p>
<p>30. When I spoke with the refugees about the hazards of the boat trips and asked them whether 
they would advise their friends and relatives back home to risk such a trip to come to Yemen, I 
was not surprised that many said they would, except for one who said that she would not ask her 
daughter, who was left behind, to take this path to escape. It was the most traumatic experience 
in her life. Most of the refugees gave me the same reasons for their flight as those who fled to 
Kenya, namely insecurity of life in Somalia (most were also from Mogadishu), loss of close 
family members, loss of or lack of livelihood, lack of or high cost of food etc. In describing her 
situation when she was in labour pain in Somalia, a woman who arrived recently told me that she 
had waited for an opportunity to go out of her home for medical help for more than 70 hours, but 
failed to do so because of raging armed conflict in her neighbourhood all that time. As a result 
she had to give birth at home without any help. Fortunately the child survived but for another 
70 hours she was unable to go out to get food for herself. She finally decided to flee the country, 
leaving the child with its grandmother. 
</p>
<p>31. The above provides an eloquent picture of the desperate conditions of life in Somalia 
today. It is the insecurity of life, lack of food, medical service and schooling, and more 
importantly the lack of livelihood opportunities that cause the Somalis to flee their country. And 
when one recalls that this has been going on for the ordinary people for close to two decades, one 
can understand the extent of their desperation. 
</p>
<p>32. However, there was also a brighter side of my trip to Yemen. This relates to the generosity 
of the Government of Yemen not only to accept the Somalis as refugees on a prima facie basis, 
thereby assuring their legal stay in the country until circumstances change, but also their 
cooperation with the United Nations in making the lives of the refugees as bearable as possible. 
Given the fact that Yemen is not a resource-rich country and is a developing nation itself, this </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>generosity is all the more commendable. It is seldom in my long career with UNHCR that I had 
come across such warm acceptance of refugees by the authorities. This of course does not mean 
that there are no protection problems for Somali refugees in Yemen. I shall refer to them in my 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. In the meetings I had with the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ali Muthana Hassan, and 
the Deputy Minister for Human Rights, Ali Saleh Taiseer, as well as their colleagues, I was 
impressed by the concern and sympathy they expressed for refugees from Somalia. While 
reiterating the policy of the Government of Yemen to accept and host Somali refugees to the best 
of its ability, they also asked me to convey their plea to the international community for more 
burden-sharing in this regard. 
</p>
<p>34. I was also pleased to learn that the Somali refugees in Yemen have unrestricted access to 
all educational institutions and that the Government has made some 150 scholarships available to 
Somali students to study in Yemeni universities and high schools for the year 2008/09. The Vice 
Foreign Minister however, added that his Government would appreciate international support to 
address the health needs and unemployment situation of Somali refugees in Yemen. 
</p>
<p>35. In sharing his views on the situation in Somalia, Dr. Muthana stated that, unless the root 
causes of the conflict were addressed, it would not be possible to improve the human rights 
situation, noting that the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops without an alternative will make the 
situation worse.  
</p>
<p>36. Dr. Muthana also referred to the issue of the piracy situation which, he felt, was helping to 
bring back the focus on Somalia. He thought that the big powers owning merchant fleets 
crossing the Gulf of Aden could help to stabilize not only Somali waters but also the country. He 
considered that piracy was an easy way to make money. By helping villagers in Somalia with 
that money, pirates were perhaps gaining support of the population.  
</p>
<p>37. Among other things, he mentioned that illegal fishing and dumping of toxic waste in 
Somali waters by western nations was causing anger to Somalis. He thought that patrolling by 
NATO ships in the Gulf of Aden was also adversely affecting the activities of Yemeni fishermen 
and the arrival of refugee boats. The fishermen were losing their revenues and many 
refugee-carrying boats were being held by the International Force. He suggested that I lobby the 
League of Arab States and the OIC for contribution of the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia, 
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait to assist the refugees with 
scholarships, health and employment opportunities.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. INFORMATION ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN  
LAW SITUATION IN SOMALIA GATHERED FROM THE  
UNITED NATIONS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL  
ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>38. To obtain further information on the situation in Somalia, I also consulted United Nations 
officials and NGOs involved with Somalia and read their periodic reports. On the basis of these, 
I have put together below some additional information relating to human rights in Somalia. Most 
of these have been corroborated by the refugees I talked to in Yemen and Kenya. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights and humanitarian law violations in general 
</b></p>
<p>39. The human rights situation in Somalia continues to be characterized by indiscriminate 
violence and frequent attacks against civilians, including arbitrary detention of human rights 
defenders, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings of journalists as well as sexual- and 
gender-based violence. While a large section of the opposition forces grouped under the ARS has 
agreed to renounce violence, the remaining opposition groups, those known as ARS-Asmara and 
the so-called Al Shabab (or youth) have intensified their insurgency. As a result, attacks and 
counter-attacks between the warring factions, namely the TFG forces and the Ethiopian troops 
on the one hand, and the Al Shabab insurgents on the other, have been causing increased 
violence and violations of basic human rights and humanitarian law, in particular since 
April 2008. 
</p>
<p>40. A joint statement issued in October 2008 by 52 NGOs involved with Somalia, expressed 
concern at the impact of increasing violence on the humanitarian crisis. In addition to the 
large-scale displacement of the civilian population, both internally and externally, particularly 
from Mogadishu, the statement reported that the number of people requiring emergency aid had 
increased by 77 per cent since the beginning of 2008, due to the combination of extreme 
insecurity, drought and steep rise in food prices and was then numbering almost half of 
Somalia&#8217;s population (3.25 million people). The statement further alleged that all parties to the 
conflict are responsible for indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, and noted that 
increased attacks on aid workers had further hindered humanitarian efforts, especially in South 
and Central. 
</p>
<p>41. In its report &#8220;Fatal insecurity, attacks on aid workers and right defenders in Somalia&#8221; of 
October 2008, Amnesty International has reported that at least 3.25 million Somalis, 43 per cent 
of the population, would require food until the end of 2008 and they were at a greater risk of 
malnutrition and disease due to the escalation of attacks on humanitarian and aid workers in 
Southern and Central Somalia, and the subsequent suspension of humanitarian programmes 
there. According to Amnesty International, in the first nine months of 2008 alone, at least 
40 humanitarian aid workers and human rights defenders were killed, mainly in targeted killings. 
The majority of the killings were attributed to members of armed opposition groups and criminal 
gangs, with a small number attributed to militias associated with the TFG or Ethiopian troops. As 
an indication of the gravity of the situation, it may also be mentioned that a large number of 
airstrips in South Central Somalia were closed, creating difficulties for the movement of all, 
including aid workers.  
</p>
<p>42. According to an UNPOS report of October 2008, while armed clashes have continued 
regularly in Mogadishu between insurgents and the Ethiopian backed-TFG forces, there have 
also been recent reports of an increase in targeted attacks against AMISOM troops, which 
allegedly led the Ugandan troops to retaliate by indiscriminately firing with artillery against 
residential neighbourhoods. It should be recalled that the insurgents often use civilians as human 
shields and abusively make use of civilian neighbourhoods and installations as a base when 
attacking. 
</p>
<p>43. Another report mentioned the discovery of mass graves in Belet Weyne, an important city 
in South Central Somalia. The identity and number of victims buried in the graves as well as the 
identity of alleged perpetrators is unknown. At the time of writing, as the Belet Weyne airstrip </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>was closed for flights of the United Nations, its personnel could not access the area to verify the 
allegation. It was also reported that with the withdrawal of the Ethiopian troops from 
Belet Weyne in November 2008, nearly all IDPs displaced to nearby areas in July, have 
reportedly returned home.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights violations in relation to specific categories 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>Right to life and physical integrity</b>: As is evident, the violations of these two basic rights 
are primarily linked to the ongoing armed conflict. Both the warring sides accuse each other of 
violations, the verification of which is difficult, as there is no international human rights 
presence on the ground. The killing of 20 women by a roadside bomb in Mogadishu and the 
death of more than 40 civilians on board of two buses on the road between Afgooye and 
Mogadishu on 15 August are just two gruesome reminders of a desperate human rights situation 
in Somalia, which could not be independently verified. Both sides have denied any 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>45. It must be added, however, that armed conflict is not the only reason for these violations. 
Human rights violations are also committed by soldiers, police, warlords, clan leaders, etc. 
Accountability in this regard must, however, lie with the Government, since it has the primary 
responsibility for law enforcement and justice.  
</p><p>46. In the absence of effective government protection, murder, assassination, abduction and 
wounding by insurgent forces, criminal elements or those with personal/private axes to grind are 
also quite rampant. Some examples of this are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Insurgents continue to target civilians with links or supposed links to the TFI as well as 
human rights activists. Women appear to be especially targeted. As weapons with little 
accuracy are being used for the attacks, passers-by are often victims.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The town of Baidoa, which is second to Mogadishu in terms of importance since the 
Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) was located there, though still under nominal 
control of the TFG, has become precarious in recent months as the insurgents were 
reportedly regrouping at its periphery. In the last week of October, at least 2 civilians 
were killed and 4 injured in two separate attacks at the TFG Regional Security Offices 
and at a military convoy passing in the Telecom area, while at least 13 civilians were 
severely injured when insurgents fired several mortar rounds into populated areas of the 
town on 4 October 2008.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 25 October, Duniya Sheikh Doon, Chairwoman of the local IIDA branch a women&#8217;s 
development organization and a local defender of women&#8217;s rights and fighter against 
FGM, was killed in the town of Guriel by unknown gunmen.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 3 November, Mariam &#8220;Dabayarey&#8221; Aden Mohamed, Chairwoman of the Bay region 
women&#8217;s organization, was killed in Baidoa by unknown gunmen. The previous 
weekend, when the Chairwoman of IIDA organization was killed in Guri-ceel Mudug 
Region in Central Somalia, she was worried that she too would meet the same fate.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Merca, three unidentified gunmen allegedly attacked an NGO vehicle on 15 October, 
killing the driver and injuring three staff.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In ICU-controlled Belet Weyne, the Chairman of the Hiran Regional Council of 
elders, Dacar Hersi Hoshow, was killed on 7 October by two unknown gunmen. The 
incident led to violent street demonstrations and closure of businesses in town.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In December, after the announcement of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops, at least 
four women were killed by unknown gunmen for allegedly having had relationships 
with Ethiopian soldiers. 
</p>
<p>47. <b>Freedom of expression</b>: Journalists in all parts of Somalia, including &#8220;Puntland&#8221; and 
&#8220;Somaliland&#8221;, continued to face severe threats and intimidation by the authorities and by armed 
opposition groups. In South Central region, the parties to the conflict apparently try to stop the 
press from reporting anything that might be perceived harmful to their interest or favourable to 
their opponents. Authorities in Hargeisa apparently resort to administrative measures as well as 
arbitrary arrests and detentions to obstruct the work of the journalists and there were some 
instances affecting journalists in Garowe prior to the elections. 
48. The 2008 annual report of the National Union of Journalists of Somalia (NUSOJ) stressed 
that, despite the decrease in killings of journalists in Somalia in 2008 compared to the previous 
year, Southern Somalia still remains the most dangerous area for journalists to work 
independently. Two journalists were murdered with complete impunity in Kismayo. The murder 
of the vice-president of NUSOJ, Naster Dahir Farah, shocked all the media workers in Somalia. 
In &#8220;Somaliland&#8221;, 30 journalists and media staff reportedly were arrested and released without 
trial. More than 30 journalists received death threats, in many cases, by individuals allegedly 
acting with the consent of politicians.  
</p>
<p>49. <b>Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)</b>: Traditionally, these violations are seldom 
reported. However, Somali NGOs working with SGBV-victims indicated to the United Nations 
that this type of violence occurs on a daily basis by different controlling authorities, as part of the 
conflict, e.g. during cordon and search operations, or in other circumstances, often in IDP camps. 
Women and young girls are doubly affected, since they have no effective justice and support 
system to turn to and the traditional conflict resolution mechanisms at the clan level do not 
provide them with the necessary protection. This is because SGBV is treated more as a civil 
dispute than a criminal matter in Somalia. 
</p>
<p>50. A gruesome example of SGBV is the stoning to death of a young, allegedly teenaged, 
woman, on 27 October, at the Veko stadium in Kismayo, which was covered internationally in 
media. She was given a death sentence by the local court for adultery in application of sharia 
law. The victim, who had been raped by three men allegedly linked to the ICU, was reported to 
be mentally ill. During the public execution, two onlookers, including one child, were reportedly 
killed and three injured, when a police officer opened fire. The two other victims had tried 
reportedly to stop the stoning. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. <b>Right to education</b>: As a result of armed conflicts which have lasted for close to two 
decades, the education sector in Somalia has been drastically affected, with most educational 
institutions, other than religious schools, closed, particularly in the conflict-ridden areas. 
However, Somalis have managed to organize an independent schooling system in many places, 
giving children a chance to enjoy basic education. In the last two years, however, these 
institutions have also been targeted by both sides to the conflict. In October and November 2008, 
TFG forces have reportedly closed down 34 schools, including 7 universities, for security 
reasons, preventing some 30,000 students from attending classes. The fact that the Deputy 
Prime Minister of Somalia had to publicly condemn these closures also indicated the lack of 
coordination between different branches of the Government that should work in a concerted team 
spirit.  
</p>
<p>52. <b>Right to health care</b>: With an increased part of the population in need, the chronic food 
insecurity and endemic high malnutrition rates, the burden on and demand for basic health 
services have increased in an already dilapidated health system with very low levels of service 
coverage and poor health indicators. The outbreaks of communicable diseases, including cholera, 
meningitis and measles, are recurrent due to unhygienic conditions, limited access to safe 
drinking water, weakened immune systems due to poor nutrition, and general livelihood distress. 
The situation analysis in the United Nations 2008 Somalia Consolidated Appeal (CAP) 
document, particularly for the South and Central regions and for IDPs in the North, highlighted 
the critical health care conditions. While public hospitals are destroyed by the war and do not or 
rarely function, a large part of the population cannot afford medical care in the limited private 
clinics. International assistance is also hampered by the deteriorating security situation and 
access. Humanitarian organizations operating in Somalia, such as CARE and M&#233;decins sans 
fronti&#232;res (MSF), are often targeted. Three MSF staff members were deliberately killed in 
Kismayo in early 2008. As I recommended in my previous report, hospitals and medical services 
run by the Government must be revived and revamped to bring much needed medical services to 
the people. 
</p>
<p>53. <b>Rights of the minorities</b>: Discrimination and abuses against minorities and vulnerable 
groups continue unabated.<b> </b>Somali minorities such as the Benadir/Rer Hamar, Midgan (Gadoye) 
and Tomal, in particular the African Bantu/Jarir population, who have been traditionally 
discriminated against in Somali society, continue to face abuses and human rights violations 
because of their ethnic origin. During the Siad Barre regime, the vice-president was from the 
minority Tomal ethnicity, and the minorities were perceived to have enjoyed some protection. 
However when the regime collapsed and clan protection replaced State protection, the stronger 
clans managed to establish their own protection mechanisms leaving the weaker minority clans 
virtually unprotected. The fighting in South and Central region has adversely affected their 
ability to earn a livelihood as labourers, metalworkers, herbalists and hunters, their traditional 
occupation. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Human rights situation in &#8220;Puntland&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>54. In &#8220;Puntland&#8221;, the situation has become more volatile in recent months leading up to the 
elections. For example: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; One civilian was killed and another injured in the evening of 24 October, when 
&#8220;Puntland&#8221; police opened fire on a public mini-bus in Bossaso. On 29 October, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>two suicide bombers blew up cars at &#8220;Puntland&#8221; security services headquarters in 
Bossasso, killing one police officer, and injuring five others. Although the attack was 
simultaneous with the attack in Hargeisa (see below), United Nations offices were not 
targeted. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the ongoing inter-clan violence affecting Galkayo, a North Galkayo businessman was 
killed by two unknown gunmen on 7 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Puntland&#8221; security forces attacked a pirate ship off the Somali coast on 12 October, 
killing two alleged pirates and wounding four. The ship was finally taken over by the 
security forces after a second liberation attempt on 14 October. The crew is reportedly 
unharmed. &#8220;Puntland&#8221; authorities announced that judicial procedures against the pirates 
would be initiated.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Human rights situation in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>55. In one of the worst incidents in recent times, Al Shabaab attacked the UNDP compound in 
Hargeisa on 29 October, killing 4, including 2 United Nations national staff members and 
severely wounding 10 others. This was one in a concerted series of attacks in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and 
&#8220;Puntland&#8221;, also targeting the presidential palace and the Ethiopian diplomatic mission in 
Hargeisa and the headquarters of the &#8220;Puntland&#8221; security services in Bossasso. As a result, the 
United Nations had to relocate all international staff out of &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; until the situation could 
be reassessed. In &#8220;Puntland&#8221;, staff ceilings were reduced as well. Since the attack, all 
United Nations human rights operations inside Somalia have been impeded and had not resumed 
at the time of drafting this report. 
</p>
<p>56. On a more positive note, the &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; President, Dahir R. Kahin, 
pardoned 815 prisoners incarcerated in different regions of the country, including in 
Mandhera Central prison, and released 104 minors from detention returning them to the care of 
their families and communities. 
</p>
<p><b>V. SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE MANDATE  
IN RELATION TO SOMALIA 
</b></p>
<p>57. It is evident that the international regime for the protection of human rights and 
humanitarian law in Somalia is one of the most challenged in the world. Almost two decades of 
armed conflicts and the consequent absence of law and order have given rise to a culture of 
impunity. As a result, citizens have suffered one of the longest and most brutal humanitarian 
crises in the world. The only protection they are able to seek is from the traditional clan 
structure, which does not provide adequate protection against most serious violations and abuses, 
particularly for victims belonging to a minority. 
</p>
<p>58. In this context, I have often wondered whether there is much scope for me to play a 
meaningful role as the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia. My 
difficulties are compounded by the imposition of travel restrictions for security reasons. How 
does one assess the situation on the ground effectively without visiting the country and talking to 
people? There are times, therefore, that I have felt frustrated and questioned myself whether I 
was adding any value. Even if I am able to visit some parts of the country, as I did during my </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>previous mission, whom do I address my concerns to and share my recommendations with in the 
absence of an effective and stable central Government? To whom do I channel &#8220;the flow of 
technical assistance to Somalia&#8221; as the Council mandates me to, when the transitional 
Government exercises only limited authority? And with whom would I discuss the requirements 
of &#8220;technical assistance&#8221; when I am unable to talk to the relevant authorities in the country 
because of my lack of access to many of them, except in a fleeting manner? I believe that an 
independent expert&#8217;s role in Somalia will only be effective when there is an effective 
Government on the ground. My hope is that such a day is not far off, in view of the hopeful signs 
on the horizon. 
</p>
<p>59. I see a catalytic role for the independent expert to play by bringing the stark realities of 
Somalia into sharper focus for the international community to take notice of and consider 
necessary measures. If I can contribute even a little to change the status of &#8220;most forgotten 
humanitarian crisis&#8221; which Somalia has acquired, I would feel that I have been of some use.  
</p>
<p>60. In this regard, I would like to recognize the sterling role played by the NGO community, 
both national and international, in bringing the inhuman suffering and unconscionable 
deprivations that the Somali people are going through to the attention of the international 
community. The international NGOs have been bringing out detailed and timely reports on the 
situation in Somalia for quite some time. Most of these are highly objective and extremely 
constructive. The recent reports of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International contain 
some useful recommendations for the improvement of the situation in Somalia. In its latest report 
&#8220;So much to fear - war crimes and devastation of Somalia&#8221;, Human Rights Watch reiterated 
among other recommendations, the need for the Security Council to &#8220;establish an independent 
and impartial commission of inquiry to investigate and map serious crimes and recommend 
further measures to recommend accountability&#8221;. This NGO is convinced that the relevant data is 
available and in the public domain, to support the analysis of the human rights situation in 
Somalia, despite the challenges on the ground in terms of security and access to credible 
information. I would like to draw the attention of all concerned to this data.  
</p>
<p>61. On the political front, I am convinced that the peace process initiated by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia offers the best opportunity for the return of 
peace and respect for human rights in Somalia. The process has come a long way in the last 
six months and must not be allowed to lose steam. There is an urgent need, therefore, to ensure 
implementation and follow-up of the various aspects of the Djibouti Agreement. 
</p><p>62. I was happy to participate in the follow-up process of the Djibouti Agreement. In my talks 
with members of the High Level Committee in Djibouti including to both the sides I sensed their 
fervent hope that the long dark night of suffering would come to an end sooner than later. 
However, as I told them, it is they who must play the key role to ensure that the process of 
justice and reconciliation leads to adoption of effective mechanisms to bring those responsible 
for the most serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law to justice, and to guarantee 
the rule of law. In this regard, they will, of course, need the full support of the international 
community.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>63. Support will also be needed to rebuild institutions that have been destroyed by the war. It 
will be important to instil in the minds of all concerned that adequate capacity in the field of 
human rights is as much an integral part of an effective Government as is security, finance or 
foreign affairs. Other nascent institutions, such as law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and 
the military will also need to build the adequate human rights capacity. 
</p>
<p>64. Additionally, the capacity of independent structures, such as civil society organizations 
will have to be built or enhanced so that they are able to monitor independently the human rights 
situation. This is intrinsically linked to the constitutional process, which should provide the basis 
for a national structure, as well as for the engagement of civil society. 
</p>
<p>65. I agree with the assessment of the Human Rights Unit of UNPOS that until the 
establishment of effective national and local human rights monitoring, protection and promotion 
mechanisms, and until an adequate international presence is secured on the ground, all local 
organizations and agencies involved directly or indirectly in the protection of human rights will 
need to build partnerships to objectively monitor the human rights situation, and provide the 
Government and the opposition with the necessary support for the protection and promotion of 
human rights. They have rightly stated during the above-mentioned preparatory conference held 
in Djibouti on 21-22 November 2008 that no peace process, however ambitious it might be, will 
succeed, if it does not provide for the protection and promotion of human rights, justice and 
reconciliation. The latter can only be achieved effectively, if past violations are investigated and 
justice is found for the victims.  
</p><p>66. In this context, the international community will have to ensure that any future 
international involvement in Somalia, be it through peacekeeping or through reconstruction and 
development, includes a human rights component. Any international assistance to the Unity 
Government must include as a precondition that they must not only ensure the development of 
institutional mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights but also make efforts 
to hold accountable all those responsible for war crimes or serious human rights abuses, both 
past and future.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> In my oral report presented to the ninth session of the Council in September 2008, I 
had made a number of recommendations for different stakeholders in the Somali crisis. 
Most of them remain valid. I shall however add some new ones in light of my latest visit to 
the region and also, most especially, in the light of the election of the new president, the 
new extended Parliament and the Government of Unity.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the new Government of Unity 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The new Government selected through the Djibouti process will have enormous 
challenges, one of its main initial ones being to establish itself in Somalia and tackle 
the issue of security, to build on the steps already taken by the new president. 
Recommendations could include: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Making human rights as the foundation of the transition; focus on protecting lives </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Security to allow humanitarian access; measures to reopen schools and develop 
health care 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that the new security apparatus which should be put in place has 
appropriate training and structures to hold perpetrators to account and respect 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>I had suggested in my last report that the Government should seriously endeavour to 
reopen educational institutions which were shut down for various reasons; that it should 
refurbish Government hospitals, clinics and other health-care facilities; that it should be 
seen to be making serious efforts to improve the law and situation in areas under its 
control. The new Government, to that end, should, for example, ensure timely 
disbursement of police salaries, which has been a long-standing problem. The appointment 
of a new administration for the Banadir region is a good beginning. In addition, the efforts 
of the new President and Government to draw more and more recalcitrant elements into 
the peace process would be a good signal for the people. A genuinely inclusive approach 
should become the hallmark of the Government, and I am encouraged by the initial steps 
taken by the President.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>In regard to the implementation of the Djibouti peace accord, the Government must 
ensure that the various processes already set into motion are diligently pursued. The 
discussions on transitional justice mechanisms initiated at the Djibouti conference must 
continue not only to enhance the awareness of the people but also to promote their 
participation in the process. The implications of the decisions on the possible establishment 
of an international commission of inquiry on past human rights and humanitarian law 
violations in Somalia and the need for the establishment of an international tribunal for the 
trial of key offenders must be openly discussed. The Government should officially welcome 
the views of the people on these ideas. A key recommendation in my last report was to 
ensure people&#8217;s participation in peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts. The 
implementation of the provisions on justice and reconciliation in the Djibouti Agreement 
provides a good opportunity for considering innovative ways in that regard. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Another follow-up measure required in connection with the peace accord is 
capacity-building of members of the new extended Parliament and the new Government on 
human rights and humanitarian law issues. I am certain that concerned United Nations 
agencies are ready to help the Government&#8217;s efforts in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>For the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS), my key recommendation is 
that the commitment they have shown for peace and reconciliation in Somalia by their 
acceptance of the Djibouti peace accord should be followed up by their continued active 
promotion of the accord. By doing so they will not only reassure the people of Somalia but 
also help others, such as Asmara-based ARS, to choose the path of peace and renounce 
violence.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>ARS should also take the necessary measures to build or enhance the capacity of their 
members to participate constructively in the processes aimed at developing appropriate 
laws and institutions for a more law-based and human rights-oriented society. It should 
commit itself to improve the capacity of the Government of Unity and the inclusive 
Parliament to improve the protection of all civilians. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the United Nations  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>A number of United Nations bodies are deeply involved in addressing the Somalia 
crisis. The longest involvement has been that of the Security Council. In recent years it has 
discussed the situation in Somalia on many occasions, and adopted important resolutions. 
In my oral report to its ninth session, I made some recommendations for the Council and I 
continue to see the protection and promotion of human rights and humanitarian law in 
Somalia as inextricably linked to the political process led by the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General. In furtherance of that process, I cannot overemphasize the 
importance of the provision of peacekeeping/stabilization forces in Somalia as foreseen in 
the Djibouti Agreement. While I appreciate the caution of the members of the 
Security Council in authorizing troops before improvement of security conditions on the 
ground, I think it would be prudent to take the risk in acceding to the request of the parties 
in this regard because a sizeable number of both Government and opposition forces, as well 
as the respective clans behind them, have come together under a peace agreement. If this 
opportunity is not seized, it is likely that the situation will get worse. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>I encourage the Security Council to consider the proposal I made in my last report, 
echoing that of my predecessor as well as that of some NGOs regarding the establishment 
of an International Commission of Inquiry or a similar mechanism to investigate violations 
of human rights and humanitarian law in Somalia (at least those committed in recent 
years).  
</b>76. <b>As for UNPOS, I commend the commitment of the Special Representative to 
contribute to end impunity and hold those responsible for serious violations of human 
rights and international humanitarian law accountable. On the basis of my recent talks 
with people belonging both to the TFG, the Djibouti-based ARS, parliamentarians, as well 
as newly arrived refugees in Kenya and Yemen, I am convinced that the people of Somalia 
are fed up with war and destruction and genuinely desire the return of peace. If my 
reading is correct, there may be some hope for the remaining opposition groups to listen to 
arguments for peace. Even if they do not respond positively, the gesture may be useful and 
nothing would be lost.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>I was requested by refugees both in Kenya and Yemen to inform the Special 
Representative about their wish to be included in the Djibouti peace process. I therefore 
recommend that appropriate travel authorizations arrangements are made with relevant 
authorities to consider the participation of refugees in meetings of the peace process outside 
the country of refuge.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>I would like to make a recommendation for consideration of the Human Rights 
Council, which can play an important role in drawing</b> <b>the terrible human rights and 
humanitarian law situation in Somalia to the attention of the international community. The 
Council could call for a special session on the situation of human rights in Somalia or at 
least for a panel discussion. I have recently written to a number of thematic 
mandate-holders on getting together under some mechanism for this purpose. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The recommendations I made to UNHCR in my previous report remain valid.2 In 
addition, I would recommend that UNHCR, together with OHCHR, and the UNCT, 
together with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and civil society, make 
further representation to the Governments of Kenya and Yemen regarding the urgent need 
for more land for a potential spike in arrivals of Somali refugees in Kenya and for the 
burial of the dead bodies from the sea drowning in Yemen. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>UNHCR should also consider, together with other relevant agencies, to undertake 
awareness campaigns on the dangers of crossing the Gulf of Aden in unsafe boats. To 
address the root causes of smuggling and trafficking of boat-people from the port city 
Bossasso in Somalia, UNHCR and IOM could also consider opening sub-offices in the 
relatively peaceful parts of Somalia. Such offices could also consider, with international 
support, small reinsertion projects for prospective asylum-seekers by providing them 
with humanitarian assistance in safe places. This may help mitigate the flow of new 
asylum-seekers to neighbouring countries and even attract returnees. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the Government of Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>I am impressed by the commitment of the Government of Yemen to welcome and 
assist Somali refugees in Yemen. Its generosity is indeed commendable. However, there are 
a few areas where the Government could further improve the situation of the refugees, 
such as through the issuance/renewal of refugee identification (ID) cards. I was promised 
that this would be done soon. If it is not done yet, I would welcome its expedition.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>I am encouraged that the Ministry of Human Rights proposed the establishment of an 
inter-ministerial Drafting Committee for National Refugee Law, including UNHCR as a 
member of the Committee. I was told that refugees and asylum matters are governed by 
various national laws and institutions, and their implementation is sometimes ad hoc, 
inconsistent and not in accordance with international protection principles.  
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  In my report to the ninth session of the Council, I recommended that UNHCR seeks ways to 
</p>
<p>improve its capacity to deal with large numbers of new arrivals in the Dadaab Camps in Kenya 
and gives serious consideration to develop a project aimed at providing young refugee girls and 
boys with scholarships so that they can continue their studies at the university level after 
completion of secondary level studies at refugee camps. I also further welcomed the attention of 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to education on the matter. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The Government could ensure that the travel-weary newly arrived refugees are 
spared the occasional arrests by army/patrol boats. As the Government of Yemen does not 
seem to provide clear guidelines, instructions or training to/for the concerned agencies on 
how to comply with international refugee protection principles in the course of maintaining 
the integrity of Yemen&#8217;s borders, the appropriate United Nations agencies and the 
international community generally should provide the Yemen law enforcement institutions 
with relevant technical cooperation in terms of capacity-building to help them comply with 
refugee law and human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Apart from the long-standing humanitarian crisis, Somalia has also been in news for 
acts of piracy. This has at least led to international attention. In dealing with piracy, the 
international community should also consider the circumstances contributing to this 
phenomenon. I was told by many Somalis whom I spoke to that their windfall income from 
ransom money from the pirates is providing some important services to the poverty-ridden, 
war-ravaged population of Somalia. There is thus a link between the situation in Somalia 
and piracy in Somali waters.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>I would also urge the international community to help the Government of Somalia 
with financial, technical and other assistance in discharging its responsibilities. There is 
now a greater need for such assistance in view of the fact that the Government would have 
to be engaged in activities and efforts to win over the support of the population towards 
efforts for peace and reconciliation. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The international community should consider the request of the Government of 
Yemen, conveyed to me in the course of my trip, regarding the health-care needs of the 
Somali and other refugees in that country. Providing scholarships to eligible Somali 
refugees in Yemen and Kenya would also be a good investment for human-resource 
development for Somalia of the future.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>During my trip to Yemen, UNHCR raised concerns about the human rights violations 
in the refugee camps in Yemen, in particular on the need to monitor and document cases of 
sexual and gender-based violence. Refugees are also allegedly beaten up and women are 
stoned by elders in the name of sharia. It would, therefore, be useful if OHCHR could 
develop collaboration with the Yemen Ministry of Human Rights, UNHCR, IOM and the 
Danish Refugee Council (DRC) offices in Yemen to monitor and document the human 
rights abuses in the camps and identify solutions. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>I welcome the process of strengthening the human rights presence in Somalia within 
UNPOS with the proposed four international and one national staff. However, in light of 
the difficult security situation, as exemplified by the recent attack of 29 October on the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>United Nations compound in Hargeisa, the UNPOS HRU needs to be strengthened further, 
including by appointing additional human rights officers to the unit, to adequately address 
needs related to monitoring, public reporting, advisory services and capacity-building 
activities. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>I support the Human Rights Watch recommendations to OHCHR, published in its 
latest report &#8220;So much to fear - war crimes and devastation of Somalia&#8221;, on the need for 
UNPOS Human Rights Office to have further expertise [on children, and] on monitoring of 
sexual and gender-based violence. If monitoring inside Somalia is not possible due to 
security concerns, OHCHR may consider focusing on documenting the experiences of 
refugees in Kenya, Djibouti, and Yemen and of displaced people in Somalia.
