<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recalling the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2001/33 of 23 April 2001, 2002/31 
and 2002/32 of 22 April 2002, 2003/28 of 22 April 2003, 2004/27 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/24 
of 15 April 2005, and that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health is a human right that derives from the inherent dignity of 
the human person, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing </i>the development goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in 
particular the four health-related development goals, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>*</b> The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of the Council 
on its twelfth session (A/HRC/12/50), chap. I. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with</i> <i>concern</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full enjoyment 
of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health remains a distant goal 
and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal is becoming increasingly 
remote, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the Declaration on the Right to Development, which establishes that States 
should take, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to 
development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic 
resources, such as health services, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>its resolution 6/29 of 14 December 2007, in which the Council extended the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> Council resolution S-10/1 of 23 February 2009, and reiterating its 
concern that financial and economic crises are having a negative impact on the ability of States 
to provide social services, such as health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Regretting</i> the high number of people still without access to medicines, and underscoring 
that improving access to medicine could save millions of lives every year, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Recognizes</i> that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Stresses </i>the responsibility of States to ensure access to all, without discrimination, of 
medicines, in particular essential medicines, that are affordable, safe, effective and of good 
quality; 
</p>
<p> 3. C<i>alls</i> <i>upon</i> States, at the international level, to take steps, individually and/or through 
international cooperation, in accordance with applicable international law, including 
international agreements, to ensure that their actions as members of international organizations 
take into due account the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, and that the application of international agreements is supportive of 
public health policies that promote broad access to safe, effective and affordable medicines; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes </i>that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the 
Agreement does not and should not prevent States Members of the World Trade Organization 
from taking measures to protect public health and that the Declaration, while reiterating the 
commitment to the Agreement, affirms that it can and should be interpreted and implemented in 
a manner supportive of the rights of States Members of the World Trade Organization to protect 
public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all; and further recognizes, in 
this connection, the right of States Members of the World Trade Organization to use, to the full, 
the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement, which provide flexibility for this purpose; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also recognizes</i> that intellectual property protection is important for the development 
of new medicines, as well as the concerns about its effects on prices; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> all States to apply measures and procedures for enforcing intellectual 
property rights in such a manner as to avoid creating barriers to the legitimate trade of medicines, 
and to provide for safeguards against the abuse of such measures and procedures; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Invites </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
convene an expert consultation, within existing resources, open to the participation of 
Governments, regional and international organizations, relevant United Nations bodies and civil 
society organizations, for an exchange of views on human rights considerations relating to the 
realization of access to medicines as one of the fundamental elements in achieving progressively 
the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, and invites the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to present a summary 
of the discussions held during the expert consultation to the Council; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to integrate, within his existing mandate, the 
human rights dimensions of access to medicines; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also</i> <i>encourages </i>all States to consider including in their national reports, to be 
submitted to the universal periodic review mechanism, information on the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, particularly on 
measures taken to promote access to medicines; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this matter. 
</p>
<p><i>32nd meeting 
2 October 2009 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote.] </p>
