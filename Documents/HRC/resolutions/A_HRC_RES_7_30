<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/30.   Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>at the suffering of Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan due to the systematic and continued violation of their fundamental and human 
</p>
<p>rights by Israel since the Israeli military occupation of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent 
</p>
<p>being resolution 62/110 of 17 December 2007, in which the Assembly declared that 
</p>
<p>Israel had failed so far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and 
</p>
<p>demanded that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 
</p>
<p>1981 to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p>which has resulted in the effective annexation of that territory,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
</p>
<p>force in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of 
</p>
<p>international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to 
</p>
<p>Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
</p>
<p>Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories (A/62/360) of 24 September 2007, in which 
</p>
<p>the Committee referred to the grave deterioration in the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan and, in this connection, 
</p>
<p>deploring the Israeli settlement in the occupied Arab territories and expressing regret 
</p>
<p>at the constant refusal of Israel to cooperate with and to receive the Special 
</p>
<p>Committee, </p>

<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming the 
</p>
<p>applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
</p>
<p>in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and the relevant provisions of the Hague 
</p>
<p>Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the importance of the peace process which started in Madrid on 
</p>
<p>the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 
</p>
<p>(1973) of 22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its 
</p>
<p>concern at the halting of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace 
</p>
<p>talks will be resumed on the basis of the full implementation of Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for the establishment of a just and 
</p>
<p>comprehensive peace in the region, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, in particular resolution 2/3 of 27 
</p>
<p>November 2006, 
</p>
<p> 1.  <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, particularly Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council 
</p>
<p>decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
</p>
<p>administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without 
</p>
<p>international legal effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its 
</p>
<p>decision; 
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 
</p>
<p>demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 
</p>
<p>Syrian Golan, and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan must be allowed to return to their homes and to recover their 
</p>
<p>property; 
</p>
<p> 3.  <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship 
</p>
<p>and Israeli identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan and to 
</p>
<p>desist from its repressive measures against them, and from all other practices that 
</p>
<p>obstruct the enjoyment of their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, </p>

<p>social and cultural rights, some of which are mentioned in the report of the Special 
</p>
<p>Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan to visit their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the 
</p>
<p>Quneitra checkpoint and under the supervision of the International Committee of the 
</p>
<p>Red Cross, and to rescind its decision to prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant 
</p>
<p>violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in 
</p>
<p>Israeli prisons, some of whom have been detained for over 22 years and calls on Israel 
</p>
<p>to treat them in conformity with international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel, in this connection, Israel to allow delegates 
</p>
<p>of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of 
</p>
<p>conscience and detainees in Israeli prisons accompanied by specialized physicians in 
</p>
<p>order to assess the state of their physical and mental health and to protect their lives; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions 
</p>
<p>taken or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character 
</p>
<p>and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant 
</p>
<p>violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Again calls upon</i> States members of the United Nations not to 
</p>
<p>recognize any of the above-mentioned legislative or administrative measures; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the 
</p>
<p>attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized 
</p>
<p>agencies, international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on 
</p>
<p>the matter to the Council at its tenth session; </p>

<p> 10. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of human rights violations in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan at its tenth session.
