MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

Cr. Misc. Case No: HAM0080 of 2004S

JOSUA RAITAMATA

RULING

The Applicant was sentenced to 6½ years imprisonment in either June or August of this year. He has submitted correspondence to me which show that he made earnest attempts to communicate with the court from the 9th of September 2004 and to file an appeal.

In the light of the fact that he was making these attempts from prison and is unrepresented, I consider he has shown good cause.

Leave to appeal is granted.
