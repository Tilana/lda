Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains “forward-looking statements” – meaning, statements related to future events
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of
historical facts, included or incorporated by reference in this document that addresses activities,
events or developments we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, are forward-
looking statements. The words “believes,” “intends,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,”
“estimates,” “predicts,” and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements.
This report modifies and supersedes documents filed by us before this report. In addition, certain
information we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede
information in this report.
 
These forward-looking statements include, among others, things as:
•
•
•
the amount and nature of our future capital expenditures and how we expect to fund our capital
expenditures;
•prices for oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and natural gas;
•demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas;
•our exploration and drilling prospects;
•the estimates of our proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves;
•oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserve potential;
•development and infill drilling potential;
•expansion and other development trends of the oil and natural gas industry;
•our business strategy;
•our plans to maintain or increase production of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;
•the number of gathering systems and processing plants we plan to construct or acquire;
•volumes and prices for natural gas gathered and processed;
•expansion and growth of our business and operations;
•demand for our drilling rigs and drilling rig rates;
our belief that the final outcome of our legal proceedings will not materially affect our financial
results;
•our ability to timely secure third-party services used in completing our wells;
our ability to transport or convey our oil or natural gas production to established pipeline
systems;
impact of federal and state legislative and regulatory actions affecting our costs and increasing
operating restrictions or delays and other adverse impacts on our business;
•our projected production guidelines for the year;
•our anticipated capital budgets;
•our financial condition and liquidity;
•the number of wells our oil and natural gas segment plans to drill or rework during the year; and
our estimates of the amounts of any ceiling test write-downs or other potential asset impairments
we may be required to record in future periods.
These statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience
and our perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments,
and other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether actual results and
•
•
•
developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to several risks and
uncertainties, any one or combination of which could cause our actual results to differ materially
from our expectations and predictions, including:
the risk factors discussed in this document and in the documents (if any) we incorporate by
reference;
•general economic, market, or business conditions;
•the availability of and nature of (or lack of) business opportunities we pursue;
•demand for our land drilling services;
•changes in laws or regulations;
•changes in the current geopolitical situation;
risks relating to financing, including restrictions in our debt agreements and availability and cost
of credit;
•risks associated with future weather conditions;
•decreases or increases in commodity prices;
our ability to successfully implement our pending technology conversion process relating to our
financial and operational information systems; and
•other factors, most of which are beyond our control.
You should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. Except as
required by law, we disclaim any current intention to update forward-looking information and to
release publicly the results of any future revisions we may
•

make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this
document to reflect unanticipated events.

UNIT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report include
the accounts of Unit Corporation and all its subsidiaries and affiliates and have been prepared
under the rules and regulations of the SEC. The terms “company,” “Unit,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or like
terms refer to Unit Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and one or more of its subsidiaries and
affiliates, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and do not
include all the notes in our annual financial statements. This report should be read with the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes in our Form 10-K, filed February 25, 2016,
for the year ended December 31, 2015.
In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments (including the elimination of all
intercompany transactions) necessary to fairly state the following:
•Balance Sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015;
•Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015; and
•Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (GAAP). GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and
assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be realized for the full year of 2016, or that we realized for the full year of 2015.
Certain amounts in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. There was no
impact to consolidated net income (loss) or shareholders' equity.
NOTE 2 – OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES
    
Full cost accounting rules require us to review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas
properties at the end of each quarter. Under those rules, the maximum amount allowed as the
carrying value is referred to as the ceiling. The ceiling is the sum of the present value (using a
10% discount rate) of the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves (using the
unescalated 12-month average price of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas), plus the cost of
properties not being amortized, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved
properties included in the costs being amortized, less related income taxes. If the net book value
of the oil, NGLs, and natural gas properties being amortized exceeds the full cost ceiling, the
excess amount is charged to expense in the period during which the excess occurs, even if
prices are depressed for only a short while. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas
properties is not reversible.
During the first quarter of 2015, the 12-month average commodity prices decreased significantly,
resulting in a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $400.6 million pre-tax ($249.4 million, net of
tax). During the second quarter of 2015, the 12-month average commodity prices decreased
further, resulting in a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $410.5 million pre-tax ($255.6 million,
net of tax).
During the first quarter of 2016, the 12-month average commodity prices continued to decrease,
resulting in a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $37.8 million pre-tax ($23.5 million, net of tax).
For the second quarter of 2016, the 12-month average commodity prices decreased further,
resulting in a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $74.3 million pre-tax ($46.3 million, net of tax).

NOTE 3 – DIVESTITURES
Oil and Natural Gas
We sold non-core oil and natural gas assets, net of related expenses, for $43.6 million during the
first six months of 2016, compared to less than $0.1 million during the first six months of 2015.
Proceeds from those sales reduced the net book value of our full cost pool with no gain or loss
recognized.
Contract Drilling
During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a write-down of approximately $8.3 million pre-
tax on drilling equipment that was being held for sale.

Due to the net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016, approximately 417,000 weighted
average shares related to stock options, restricted stock, and SARs were antidilutive and
excluded from the above earnings per share calculation. For the three months ended June 30,
2015, approximately 307,000 weighted average shares were excluded.
The following table shows the number of stock options and SARs (and their average exercise
price) excluded because their option exercise prices were greater than the average market price
of our common stock:

and excluded from the above earnings per share calculation. For the six months ended June 30,
2015, approximately 206,000 weighted average shares were excluded.
The following table shows the number of stock options and SARs (and their average exercise
price) excluded because their option exercise prices were greater than the average market price

Credit Agreement. On April 8, 2016, we amended our Senior Credit Agreement (credit
agreement) scheduled to mature on April 10, 2020. The amount we can borrow is the lesser of
the amount we elect as the commitment amount or the value of the borrowing base as
determined by the lenders, but in either event not to exceed the maximum credit agreement
amount of $875.0 million. Our elected commitment amount is $475.0 million. Our borrowing base
is $475.0 million. We are charged a commitment fee of 0.50% on the amount available but not
borrowed. The fee varies based on the amount borrowed as a percentage of the amount of the
total borrowing base. We paid $1.0 million in origination, agency, syndication, and other related
fees. We are amortizing these fees over the life of the credit agreement. With the new
amendment, we pledged the following collateral: (a) 85% of the proved developed producing
(discounted as present worth at 8%) total value of our oil and gas properties and (b) 100% of our
ownership interest in our midstream affiliate, Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C.
The borrowing base amount–which is subject to redetermination by the lenders on April 1st and
October 1st of each year–is based primarily on a percentage of the discounted future value of our
oil and natural gas reserves. We or the lenders may request a onetime special redetermination of
the borrowing base between each scheduled redetermination. In addition, we may request a
redetermination following the completion of an acquisition that meets the requirements in the
credit agreement.
At our election, any part of the outstanding debt under the credit agreement may be fixed at a
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). LIBOR interest is computed as the sum of the LIBOR
base for the applicable term plus 2.00% to 3.00% depending on the level of debt as a percentage
of the borrowing base and is payable at the end of each term, or every 90 days, whichever is
less. Borrowings not under LIBOR bear interest at the prime rate specified in the credit
agreement that cannot be less than LIBOR plus 1.00%. Interest is payable at the end of each
month and the principal may be repaid in whole or in part at any time, without a premium or
penalty. At June 30, 2016, we had $236.0 million outstanding borrowings under our credit
agreement.
We can use borrowings for financing general working capital requirements for (a) exploration,
development, production, and acquisition of oil and gas properties, (b) acquisitions and operation
of mid-stream assets, (c) issuance of standby letters of credit, (d) contract drilling services and
acquisition of contract drilling equipment, and (e) general corporate purposes.
The credit agreement prohibits, among other things:
•
the payment of dividends (other than stock dividends) during any fiscal year over 30% of our
consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year;
•the incurrence of additional debt with certain limited exceptions; and
the creation or existence of mortgages or liens, other than those in the ordinary course of
business and with certain limited exceptions, on any of our properties, except in favor of our
lenders.
•
11
Table of Contents
The credit agreement also requires that we have at the end of each quarter:
•a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 1 to 1.
Through the quarter ending March 31, 2019, the credit agreement also requires that we have at
the end of each quarter:
•
a senior indebtedness ratio of senior indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
credit agreement) for the most recently ended rolling four quarters of no greater than 2.75 to 1.
Beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2019, and for each quarter ending thereafter, the
credit agreement requires:
•
a leverage ratio of funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) for
the most recently ended rolling four fiscal quarters of no greater than 4 to 1.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement.
6.625% Senior Subordinated Notes. We have an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million,
6.625% senior subordinated notes (the Notes) outstanding. Interest on the Notes is payable
semi-annually (in arrears) on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Notes will mature on
May 15, 2021. In issuing the Notes, we incurred fees of $14.7 million that are being amortized as
debt issuance cost over the life of the Notes.
The Notes are subject to an Indenture dated as of May 18, 2011, between us and Wilmington
Trust, National Association (successor to Wilmington Trust FSB), as Trustee (the Trustee), as
supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 18, 2011, between us, the
Guarantors, and the Trustee, and as further supplemented by the Second Supplemental
Indenture dated as of January 7, 2013, between us, the Guarantors, and the Trustee (as
supplemented, the 2011 Indenture), establishing the terms of and providing for the issuance of
the Notes. The Guarantors are most of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The discussion of the
Notes in this report is qualified by and subject to the actual terms of the 2011 Indenture.
Unit, as the parent company, has no independent assets or operations. The guarantees by the
Guarantors of the Notes
(registered under registration statements) are full and unconditional, joint and several, subject to
certain automatic customary releases, are subject to certain restrictions on the sale, disposition,
or transfer of the capital stock or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary guarantor, and
other conditions and terms set out in the 2011 Indenture. Any of our subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors are minor. There are no significant restrictions on our ability to receive funds from any
of our subsidiaries through dividends, loans, advances, or otherwise.
On and after May 15, 2016, we may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes at certain
redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a “change of control” occurs, subject to
certain conditions, we must offer to repurchase from each holder all or any part of that holder’s
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The 2011 Indenture contains
customary events of default. The 2011 Indenture also contains covenants that, among other
things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem capital stock or subordinated
indebtedness; transfer or sell assets; make investments; incur liens; enter into transactions with
our affiliates; and merge or consolidate with other companies. We were in compliance with all
covenants of the Notes as of June 30, 2016.

NOTE 7 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
We are required to record the estimated fair value of the liabilities relating to the future retirement
of our long-lived assets. Our oil and natural gas wells are plugged and abandoned when the oil
and natural gas reserves in those wells are depleted or the wells are no longer able to produce.
The plugging and abandonment liability for a well is recorded in the period in which the
obligation is incurred (at the time the well is drilled or acquired). None of our assets are restricted
for purposes of settling these AROs. All of our AROs relate to the plugging costs associated with
our oil and gas wells.

services used to plug wells over the preceding year. We had various upward and downward
adjustments.
NOTE 8 – NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Compensation—Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting. The FASB has issued ASU 2016-09. The amendments are intended to improve the
accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-
based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax
consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. The amendments primarily impact classification
within the statement of cash flows between financial and operating activities. We do not believe
the amendments will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Leases. The FASB has issued ASU 2016-02. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required
to recognize at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make
lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset,
which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use a specified asset for the lease term.
Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. For public companies, the amendments are effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the
impact it will have on our financial statements.
Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The FASB has issued ASU
2015-17. This changes how deferred taxes are classified on organizations' balance sheets.
Organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The
amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. For public
companies, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early
adoption of the amendments is permitted. The amendments will require current deferred tax
assets to be combined with noncurrent deferred tax assets. We do not believe the amendments
will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Interest—Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The FASB
has issued ASU 2015-03. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability be presented in the
14
Table of Contents
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with
debt discounts. The FASB has also issued ASU 2015-15. The amendments in this ASU allow an
entity to defer and present debt issuance cost as an asset and subsequently amortize the
deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of
whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We have
maintained debt issuance costs associated with our credit agreement as an asset and amortize
these fees over the life of the credit agreement. For public business entities, the amendments are
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied on a retrospective
basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to
reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We have adopted these
amendments during the first quarter of 2016. Previously, debt issuance costs associated with the
Notes was classified as a long-term asset on the balance sheet, but with ASU 2015-03, it is
presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the recognized debt liability.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The FASB has issued ASU 2014-09. This affects any
entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or
services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are
within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core
principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-12, "Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," which provides
clarifying guidance in certain areas and adds some practical expedients. Also in May 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-11, "Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards
Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF
Meeting." This ASU rescinds SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 605,
Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities— Oil and Gas, effective upon the
adoption of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In April 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-10, "Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing," which amends the revenue
guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual
property. The FASB has issued 2015-14, which defers the effective date to annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. We are in the process of evaluating the impact it will have on our financial
statements.

The Second Amended and Restated Unit Corporation Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan
effective May 6, 2015 (the amended plan) allows us to grant stock-based and cash-based
compensation to our employees (including employees of subsidiaries) as well as to non-
employee directors. A total of 4,500,000 shares of the company's common stock is authorized for
issuance to eligible participants under the amended plan with 2,000,000 shares being the
maximum number of shares that can be issued as "incentive stock options."

The time vested restricted stock awards granted during the first six months of 2016 and 2015 are
being recognized over a three year vesting period. During the first quarter of 2016, there were two
different performance vested restricted stock awards granted to certain executive officers. The
first will cliff vest three years from the grant date based on the company's achievement of certain
stock performance measures at the end of the term and will range from 0% to 200% of the
restricted shares granted as performance shares. The second will vest, one-third each year, over
a three year vesting period based on the company's achievement of cash flow to total assets
performance measurement each year and will range from 0% to 200%. The total aggregate stock
compensation expense and capitalized cost related to oil and natural gas properties for 2016
awards for the first six months of 2016 was $0.7 million.

NOTE 10 – DERIVATIVES
Commodity Derivatives
We have entered into various types of derivative transactions covering some of our projected
natural gas and oil production. These transactions are intended to reduce our exposure to market
price volatility by setting the price(s) we will receive for that production. Our decisions on the
price(s), type, and quantity of our production subject to a derivative contract are based, in part, on
our view of current and future market conditions. As of June 30, 2016, our derivative transactions
comprised the following hedges:
•
Swaps. We receive or pay a fixed price for the commodity and pay or receive a floating market
price to the counterparty. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are netted,
resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
•
Basis Swaps. We receive or pay the NYMEX settlement value plus or minus a fixed delivery
point price for the commodity and pay or receive the published index price at the specified
delivery point. We use basis swaps to hedge the price risk between NYMEX and its physical
delivery points.
•
Collars. A collar contains a fixed floor price (put) and a ceiling price (call). If the market price
exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, we receive the fixed price and pay
the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are
due from either party.
•
Three-way collars. A three-way collar contains a fixed floor price (long put), fixed subfloor price
(short put), and a fixed ceiling price (short call). If the market price exceeds the ceiling strike
price, we receive the ceiling strike price and pay the market price. If the market price is between
the ceiling and the floor strike price, no payments are due from either party. If the market price is
below the floor price but above the subfloor price, we receive the floor strike price and pay the
market price. If the market price is below the subfloor price, we receive the market price plus the
difference between the floor and subfloor strike prices and pay the market price.
We have documented policies and procedures to monitor and control the use of derivative
transactions. We do not engage in derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For our
economic hedges any changes in fair value occurring before maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations
in value) are reported in gain (loss) on derivatives in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
At June 30, 2016, we had the following derivatives outstanding:

NOTE 11 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid for
the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (in either case, an
exit price). To estimate an exit price, a three-level hierarchy is used prioritizing the valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three levels with the highest priority given to Level 1
and the lowest priority given to Level 3. The levels are summarized as follows:
•Level 1—unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•
Level 2—significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1
either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Essentially, inputs (variables
used in the pricing models) that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data.
•
Level 3—generally unobservable inputs which are developed based on the best information
available and may include our own internal data.
The inputs available to us determine the valuation technique we use to measure the fair values of
our financial instruments.
The following tables set forth our recurring fair value measurements:

All of our counterparties are subject to master netting arrangements. If a legal right of set-off
exists, we net the value of the derivative transactions we have with the same counterparty. We
are not required to post any cash collateral with our counterparties and no collateral has been
posted as of June 30, 2016.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the assets and
liabilities in the table above.
Level 2 Fair Value Measurements
Commodity Derivatives. We measure the fair values of our crude oil and natural gas swaps using
estimated internal discounted cash flow calculations based on the NYMEX futures index.
Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Commodity Derivatives. The fair values of our natural gas and crude oil collars and three-way
collars are estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based on forward price
curves, quotes obtained from brokers for contracts with similar terms, or quotes obtained from
counterparties to the agreements.
The following tables are reconciliations of our level 3 fair value measurements:

The commodity contracts detailed in this category include non-exchange-traded crude oil and
natural gas collars and three-way collars that are valued based on NYMEX. The forward
pricing range represents the low and high price expected to be paid or received within the
settlement period.
Based on our valuation at June 30, 2016, we determined that risk of non-performance by our
counterparties was immaterial.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments
The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in
accordance with accounting guidance for financial instruments. We have determined the
estimated fair values by using available market information and valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair
value. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
At June 30, 2016, the carrying values on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets for cash and cash equivalents (classified as Level 1), accounts receivable, accounts
payable, other current assets, and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of their
short term nature.
Based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for credit agreement debt with similar
terms and maturities and also considering the risk of our non-performance, long-term debt under
our credit agreement approximates its fair value and at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
was $236.0 million and $281.0 million, respectively. This debt would be classified as Level 2.
The carrying amounts of long-term debt, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs,
associated with the Notes reported in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $639.1 million and $638.0 million,
respectively. We estimate the fair value of these Notes using quoted marked prices at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 were $505.4 million and $455.5 million, respectively. These Notes
would be classified as Level 2.
Fair Value of Non-Financial Instruments
The initial measurement of AROs at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow
techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement costs associated with property,
plant, and equipment. Significant Level 3 inputs used in the calculation of AROs include plugging
costs and remaining reserve lives. A reconciliation of the Company’s AROs is presented in Note
7 – Asset Retirement Obligations.
NOTE 12 – INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have three main business segments offering different products and services within the
energy industry:
•Oil and natural gas,
•Contract drilling, and
•Mid-stream
Our oil and natural gas segment is engaged in the development, acquisition, and production of
oil, NGLs, and natural gas properties. The contract drilling segment is engaged in the land
contract drilling of oil and natural gas wells and the mid-stream segment is engaged in the
buying, selling, gathering, processing, and treating of natural gas and NGLs.
We evaluate each segment’s performance based on its operating income, which is defined as
operating revenues less operating expenses and depreciation, depletion, amortization, and
impairment. We have no oil and natural gas production outside the United States.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) provides you with an understanding of our
operating results and financial condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from
year to year or period to period. We have organized MD&A into the following sections:
•General;
•Business Outlook;
•Executive Summary;
•Financial Condition and Liquidity;
•New Accounting Pronouncements; and
•Results of Operations.
Please read the information in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with
your review of the information below as well as our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes.
Unless otherwise indicated or required by the content, when used in this report the terms
“company,” “Unit,” “us,” “our,” “we,” and “its” refer to Unit Corporation or, as appropriate, one or
more of its subsidiaries.
General
We operate, manage, and analyze the results of our operations through that of our three principal
business segments:
•
•
•
Oil and Natural Gas – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company. This segment
explores, develops, acquires, and produces oil and natural gas properties for our own account.
Contract Drilling – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Drilling Company. This segment contracts
to drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for others and for our own account.
Mid-Stream – carried out by our subsidiary Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its
subsidiaries. This segment buys, sells, gathers, processes, and treats natural gas for third
parties and for our own account.
Business Outlook
As discussed in other parts of this report, our success depends, to a large degree, on the prices
we receive for our oil and natural gas production, the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as,
the demand for our drilling rigs which, in turn, influences the amounts we can charge for those
drilling rigs. While our operations are located within the United States, events outside the United
States affect us and our industry.
Deteriorating commodity prices worldwide during the past 20 or so months brought about
significant adverse changes affecting our industry and us. These lower commodity prices caused
us (and other oil and gas companies) to reduce (or even stop) our level of drilling activity and
spending. When drilling activity and spending decline for extended periods of time the rates for
and the number of our drilling rigs working also tend to decline. In addition, sustained lower
commodity prices can impact the liquidity condition of some of our industry partners and
customers, which, in turn, could limit their ability to meet their financial obligations to us.
It is uncertain how long the current depressed commodity prices will continue. As noted
elsewhere in this report, those prices are subject to a number of factors most of which we cannot
control.
The impact on our business and financial results from the reduction in oil, NGLs, and natural gas
prices has had a number of consequences for us, including:
•
We incurred non-cash ceiling test write-downs in the first six months of 2016 of $112.1 million
($69.8 million net of tax). It is hard to predict with any reasonable certainty the need for or
amount of any future impairments given the many factors that go into the ceiling test calculation
including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, drilling and completion costs, upward
or downward oil and gas reserve revisions, oil and gas reserve additions, and tax
26
Table of Contents
attributes. Subject to these factors and inherent limitations, if we hold these factors constant as
they existed on July 1, 2016 and only adjusted the 12-month average price to an estimated
second quarter ending average (holding July 2016 prices constant for the remaining two months
of the third quarter of 2016), we would not expect to recognize an impairment in the third quarter
of 2016. Commodity prices remain volatile and have recently trended downward and should that
trend continue it could negatively impact the 12-month average price and the potential for an

impairment in the third quarter.
We have reduced the number of gross wells we plan to drill in 2016 by approximately 57-66%
from the number drilled in 2015 due to reduced cash flow resulting from lower commodity prices.
Several of our drilling rig customers significantly reduced their drilling budgets, which have
reduced the average utilization of our drilling rig fleet. At December 31, 2015, we had 26 drilling
rigs operating and at July 22, 2016, that number was 16. We are starting to see a small increase
in rig activity in the third quarter.
Due to the low NGLs prices, we are operating our mid-stream processing facilities in full ethane
rejection mode which reduces the amount of liquids sold. As long as NGLs prices continue to be
depressed, we expect to continue operating in full ethane rejection mode. As low commodity
prices continue, we expect the reductions in drilling activity around our systems will reduce the
number of new wells available to connect to our systems thus resulting in lower processed
volumes as production from connected wells naturally decline.
Under the third amendment to our credit agreement entered into on April 8, 2016, the lenders
decreased our borrowing base from $550.0 million to $475.0 million. Our commitment under the
credit agreement also decreased from $500.0 million to $475.0 million. At July 22, 2016,
borrowings were $238.6 million. We believe our liquidity is adequate to carry out our 2016
capital plans.
•
We have reduced our total 2016 capital budget by a range of approximately 59-65% as
compared to 2015, excluding acquisitions and ARO liability. The budget is designed to keep our
capital expenditures below our anticipated cash flow and proceeds from any non-core asset
sales and is based on realized prices for the year of $34.57 per barrel of oil, $8.01 per barrel of
NGLs, and $2.24 per Mcf of natural gas. We may periodically adjust our budget for various
reasons including changes in commodity prices and industry conditions. Funding for the budget
will come primarily from our cash flow, possible non-core asset sales, and, if necessary,
borrowings under our credit agreement.
In response to lower commodity prices we did the following during the first six months of 2016:
•
•
•
•
Consolidated from five to two the number of divisions within our drilling segment further reducing
the costs associated with operating the divisions.
Designed the higher end of our 2016 exploration and production segment budget so the majority
of those proposed expenditures would be in the latter part of the year allowing us to take into
account future commodity price movement before we actually incur those expenditures.
Implemented certain reductions in our office and field workforces to account for the reduction in
our operating activities as well as reducing the compensation paid to drilling personnel.
Through June 30, 2016, we have sold non-core oil and gas properties for approximately $43.6
million with most of the proceeds being used to pay down borrowings under our bank credit
agreement.
Executive Summary
Oil and Natural Gas
Second quarter 2016 production from our oil and natural gas segment was 4,359,000 barrels of
oil equivalent (Boe), a decrease of 3% and 14% from the first quarter of 2016 and the second
quarter of 2015, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to natural declines in production
with minimal replacement in production from new wells due to our reduced drilling activity
resulting from lower commodity prices.
Second quarter 2016 oil and natural gas revenues increased 19% over the first quarter of 2016
and decreased 36% from the second quarter of 2015. The increase over first quarter of 2016 was
due primarily to higher oil and NGLs prices offset partially from lower production volumes and
lower natural gas prices. The decrease from the second quarter of 2015 was due primarily to
lower commodity prices and to a lesser extent from lower production volumes.

Table of Contents
Our oil prices for the second quarter of 2016 increased 28% over the first quarter of 2016 and
decreased 25% from the second quarter of 2015. Our NGLs prices increased 73% over the first
quarter of 2016 and decreased 6% from the second quarter of 2015. Our natural gas prices
decreased 4% from the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 33% from the second quarter of 2015.
Operating cost per Boe produced for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4% over the first
quarter of 2016 and decreased 16% from the second quarter of 2015. The increase over the first
quarter of 2016 was primarily due to higher gross production taxes due to fewer gross production
tax credits. The decrease from the second quarter of 2015 was primarily due to lower lease
operating expenses, saltwater disposal expense, and general and administrative expenses.
At June 30, 2016, we had the following derivatives outstanding:

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we completed drilling 13 gross wells (7.65 net wells).
For all of 2016, we plan to participate in the drilling of approximately 20-25 gross wells.
Excluding acquisitions and ARO liability, our estimated 2016 capital expenditures for this
segment range from $109.0 to $131.0 million. Our current 2016 production guidance is
approximately 16.9 to 17.4 MMBoe, a decrease of 13% to 16% from 2015, although actual results
continue to be subject to many factors.

Contract Drilling
The average number of drilling rigs we operated in the second quarter of 2016 was 13.5
compared to 20.6 and 30.7 in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015,
respectively. Late in the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of our drilling rigs operating started to
decline and has continued to decline through the first six months of 2016 because of lower
commodity prices and operators reducing their drilling budgets. As of June 30, 2016, 16 of our
drilling rigs were operating.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 decreased 37% and 56% from the first quarter of 2016
and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The decreases were due primarily to fewer drilling
rigs operating.
Dayrates for the second quarter of 2016 averaged $18,585, a 1% increase over the first quarter of
2016 and a 7% decrease from the second quarter of 2015. The decrease from the second quarter
of 2015 was primarily due to downward pressure on dayrates from lower demand.
Operating costs for the second quarter of 2016 decreased 31% and 47% from the first quarter of
2016 and the second quarter of 2015, respectively. The decreases were due primarily to fewer
drilling rigs operating.
Almost all of our working drilling rigs were drilling horizontal or directional wells for oil and NGLs.
The continued low commodity prices for oil and natural gas has changed demand for drilling rigs.
These factors affect the demand and mix of the type of drilling rigs used by our customers and
that demand will impact our future dayrates.
As of June 30, 2016, we had five term drilling contracts with original terms ranging from six
months to three years. One of these contracts is up for renewal in the fourth quarter of 2016 and
four are up for renewal in 2017. Term contracts may contain a fixed rate for the duration of the
contract or provide for rate adjustments within a specific range from the existing rate. Some
operators who had signed term contracts have opted to release the drilling rig and pay an early
termination penalty for the remaining term of the contract. During the second quarter of 2016, we
recorded $0.4 million in early termination fees compared to $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2016
and $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2015.
As of June 30, 2016, seven of our eight BOSS drilling rigs were under contract. Currently, we do
not have any contracts to build additional BOSS drilling rigs. Our anticipated 2016 capital
expenditures for this segment range from $9.0 million to $11.0 million, an 87-89% decrease from
2015.
Mid-Stream
Second quarter 2016 liquids sold per day increased 2% over the first quarter of 2016 and
decreased 11% from the second quarter of 2015. The increase over the first quarter of 2016 was
due to recovering more liquids at certain processing facilities. The decrease from the second
quarter of 2015 was due to less volume to process at our plants. For the second quarter of 2016,
gas processed per day decreased 3% from the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 13% from the
second quarter of 2015. The decreases were primarily due to declines in existing volumes and
fewer new wells connected. For the second quarter of 2016, gas gathered per day increased
15% over the first quarter of 2016 and increased 21% over the second quarter of 2015. The
increases were primarily from additional wells added to our Pittsburgh Mills gathering system.
NGLs prices in the second quarter of 2016 increased 38% over the prices received in the first
quarter of 2016 and were essentially unchanged from the prices received in the second quarter of
2015. Because certain of the contracts used by our mid-stream segment for NGLs transactions
are commodity-based contracts–under which we receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of
the NGLs–our revenues from those commodity-based contracts fluctuate based on the price of
NGLs.
Total operating cost for our mid-stream segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4%
over the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 20% from the second quarter of 2015. Second
quarter of 2016 costs were higher than the first quarter of 2016 due to higher gas purchase prices
while second quarter of 2016 versus second quarter of 2015 was lower due to lower gas
purchase prices and lower purchase volumes along with lower general and administrative and
field direct expenses.
At our Hemphill Texas system, for the second quarter of 2016, our total throughput volume
averaged 69.3 MMcf per day and our total production of natural gas liquids was approximately
172,200 gallons per day. At this processing facility we have the capacity to process 135 MMcf per
day through three processing skids. During the second quarter, we connected one new- long
lateral well to this system.
At our Bellmon processing facility located in the Mississippian play in north central Oklahoma,
our total throughput volume averaged approximately 34 MMcf per day for the second quarter of
2016. Additionally, during the second quarter, we
29
Table of Contents
increased our natural gas liquids volume to approximately 130,800 gallons per day. After minor
modifications to our gathering system, we have been receiving additional volumes from third
party producers since the first of this year. During the first six months of 2016, we connected 15
additional wells to this gathering system. At this processing facility we have two processing skids
available that provide total processing capacity of 90 MMcf per day.
At our Segno gathering facility located Southeast Texas, our average transported volume
increased to over 90 MMcf per day for the second quarter of 2016. Since the first of this year, we
connected three new wells to this gathering system. With the completion of the GAP pipeline
extension project, our total gathering capacity has increased to 120 MMcf per day for this system.
In the Appalachian region, at our Pittsburgh Mills gathering system, our average throughput
volume continues to increase. During the second quarter of 2016 the total throughput volume
increased to approximately 142.5 MMcf per day. Since the beginning of this year we have
connected three new well pads with a total of 12 new wells to this gathering system. In June, we
connected the Thompson well pad which included two new wells. The Thompson well pad is
located on the northern end of our system and delivers gas into NiSource’s Big Pine system. We
have completed construction of a pipeline to connect our next well pad which is the Belo pad.
There are six wells located on this pad and it was connected and began flowing gas in July.
Also in the Appalachian area at our Snow Shoe gathering system, since the first of this year, we
have connected three well pads that have a total of six wells. Our average throughput volume for
the second quarter of 2016 has increased to approximately 14 MMcf per day. During the second
quarter, we connected one new well pad that had three wells which began flowing in April. We
have completed preliminary construction of the Snow Shoe compressor station but we will not
complete the compressor station until compression services are required.
Our estimated 2016 capital expenditures for this segment range from $22.0 million to $24.0
million.
Financial Condition and Liquidity
Summary
Our financial condition and liquidity depends on the cash flow from our operations and
borrowings under our credit agreement. The amount of our cash flow is based primarily on:
 
•the amount of natural gas, oil, and NGLs we produce;
•the prices we receive for our natural gas, oil, and NGLs production;
•the demand for and the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs; and
•the fees and margins we obtain from our natural gas gathering and processing contracts.
We currently believe we will have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our obligations and
remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the next twelve months. Our ability to meet our
debt covenants (under our credit agreement as well as our 2011 Indenture) and our capacity to
incur additional indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which in turn will be
affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. For example, lower oil,
natural gas, and NGLs prices since the last borrowing base determination under our credit
agreement could result in a reduction of the borrowing base and therefore reduce or limit our
ability to incur indebtedness. As a result, we monitor our liquidity and capital resources, endeavor
to anticipate potential covenant compliance issues, and work with our lenders to address those
issues, if any, ahead of time.
As part of our efforts to manage liquidity risks, we have lowered our capital expenditures budget,
focused our drilling program on our highest return plays, and continue to explore opportunities to
divest non-core assets and properties. During the first six months, we sold non-core oil and gas
properties for approximately $43.6 million using most of the proceeds to pay down borrowings
under our bank credit agreement. If necessary, we could sell other non-core assets and use the
proceeds to further reduce our outstanding borrowings.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Our operating cash flow is primarily influenced by the prices we receive for our oil, NGLs, and
natural gas production, the quantity of oil, NGLs, and natural gas we produce, settlements of
derivative contracts, and third-party demand for our drilling rigs and mid-stream services and the
rates we obtain for those services. Our cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by
changes in working capital.
Net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2016 decreased by $124.9
million from the first six months of 2015. The decrease was the result of lower revenues resulting
from lower commodity prices, lower drilling rig utilization, and by changes in operating assets
and liabilities related to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We dedicate and expect to continue to dedicate a substantial portion of our capital budget to the
exploration for and production of oil, NGLs, and natural gas. These expenditures are necessary
to off-set the inherent production declines typically experienced in oil and gas wells.
Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $289.1 million for the first six months of
2016 compared to the first six months of 2015. The change was due primarily to a decrease in
capital expenditures and an increase in the proceeds received from the disposition of assets.
See additional information on capital expenditures below under Capital Requirements.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities decreased by $163.8 million for the first six
months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the
payback of borrowings under our credit agreement.
At June 30, 2016, we had unrestricted cash totaling $1.0 million and had borrowed $236.0 million
of the $475.0 million we had elected to then have available under our credit agreement. Our
credit agreement is used primarily for working capital and capital expenditures.

Working Capital
Typically, our working capital balance fluctuates, in part, because of the timing of our trade
accounts receivable and accounts payable and the fluctuation in current assets and liabilities
associated with the mark to market value of our derivative activity. We had negative working
capital of $57.5 million and $11.4 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This is
primarily from the change in value of remaining derivatives outstanding and lower accounts
receivable due to lower revenues partially offset by the timing of accounts payable associated
with our capital expenditures. Our credit agreement is used primarily for working capital and
capital expenditures. At June 30, 2016, we had borrowed $236.0 million of the $475.0 million
available under our credit agreement. The effect of our derivative contracts decreased working
capital by $9.6 million as of June 30, 2016 and increased working capital by $14.6 million as of
June 30, 2015.
Oil and Natural Gas Operations
Any significant change in oil, NGLs, or natural gas prices has a material effect on our revenues,
cash flow, and the value of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves. Generally, prices and
demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions, supply imbalances, and
by worldwide oil price levels. Domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by global oil market
developments. All of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict nor measure
their future influence on the prices we will receive.
Based on our first six months of 2016 production, a $0.10 per Mcf change in what we are paid for
our natural gas production, without the effect of derivatives, would cause a corresponding
$464,000 per month ($5.6 million annualized) change in our pre-tax operating cash flow. The
average price we received for our natural gas production, including the effect of derivatives,
during the first six months of 2016 was $1.83 compared to $2.80 for the first six months of 2015.
Based on our first six months of 2016 production, a $1.00 per barrel change in our oil price,
without the effect of derivatives, would have a $252,000 per month ($3.0 million annualized)
change in our pre-tax operating cash flow and a $1.00 per barrel change in our NGLs prices,
without the effect of derivatives, would have a $399,000 per month ($4.8 million annualized)
change in our pre-tax operating cash flow. In the first six months of 2016, our average oil price
per barrel received, including the effect of derivatives, was $36.88 compared with an average oil
price, including the effect of derivatives, of $51.73 in the first six months
32
Table of Contents
of 2015 and our first six months of 2016 average NGLs price per barrel received was $8.90
compared with an average NGLs price per barrel of $10.37 in the first six months of 2015.
Because commodity prices affect the value of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves, declines in
those prices can cause a decline in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Price
declines can also adversely affect the semi-annual determination of the amount available for us
to borrow under our credit agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our
oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves. A reduction could limit our ability to carry out our planned
capital projects. In the first quarter of 2016, the unamortized cost of our oil and gas properties
exceeded the ceiling of our proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves. As a result, we recorded
a non-cash ceiling test write down of $37.8 million pre-tax ($23.5 million, net of tax). During the
second quarter of 2016, the 12-month average commodity prices decreased further, resulting in a
non-cash ceiling test write-down of $74.3 million pre-tax ($46.3 million, net of tax). At June 30,
2016, the 12-month average unescalated prices were $43.12 per barrel of oil, $17.79 per barrel
of NGLs, and $2.24 per Mcf of natural gas, then adjusted for price differentials.
It is hard to predict with any reasonable certainty the need for or amount of any future
impairments given the many factors that go into the ceiling test calculation including, but not
limited to, future pricing, operating costs, drilling and completion costs, upward or downward oil
and gas reserve revisions, oil and gas reserve additions, and tax attributes. Subject to these
factors and inherent limitations, if we hold these factors constant as they existed on July 1, 2016
and only adjusted the 12-month average price to an estimated second quarter ending average
(holding July 2016 prices constant for the remaining two months of the third quarter of 2016), we
would not expect to recognize an impairment in the third quarter of 2016. Commodity prices
remain volatile and have recently trended downward and should that trend continue it could
negatively impact the 12-month average price and the potential for an impairment in the third
quarter.
Given the uncertainty associated with the factors used in calculating our estimate of both our
future period ceiling test write-down and the decrease in our undeveloped reserves, these
estimates should not necessarily be construed as indicative of our future development plans or
financial results.
Price declines can also adversely affect future semi-annual determinations of the amount we can
borrow under our credit agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our
oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves. Such a reduction could limit our ability to carry out our
planned capital projects. Under the third amendment to our credit agreement entered into on April
8, 2016, the lenders decreased our borrowing base from $550.0 million to $475.0 million. Our
commitment under the credit agreement decreased from $500.0 million to $475.0 million.
Our natural gas production is sold to intrastate and interstate pipelines and to independent
marketing firms and gatherers under contracts with terms ranging from one month to five years.
Our oil production is sold to independent marketing firms generally in six month increments.
Contract Drilling Operations
Many factors influence the number of drilling rigs we are working at any given time as well as the
costs and revenues associated with that work. These factors include the demand for drilling rigs
in our areas of operation, competition from other drilling contractors, the prevailing prices for oil,
NGLs, and natural gas, availability and cost of labor to run our drilling rigs, and our ability to
supply the equipment needed.
Our drilling rig personnel are a key component to the overall success of our drilling services;
however, due to the present conditions existing in the drilling industry, we reduced the
compensation paid to all drilling personnel in April 2016.
Almost all of our working drilling rigs  are drilling horizontal or directional wells for oil and NGLs.
The continued low commodity price environment for oil and natural gas has changed demand for
drilling rigs.  These factors affect the demand and mix of the type of drilling rigs used by our
customers and that demand will have an impact on our future dayrates. For the first six months of
2016, our average dayrate was $18,468 per day compared to $20,032 per day for the first six
months of 2015. The average number of our drilling rigs used in the first six months of 2016 was
17.1 drilling rigs compared with 40.4 drilling rigs in the first six months of 2015. Based on the
average utilization of our drilling rigs during the first six months of 2016, a $100 per day change
in dayrates has a $1,710 per day ($0.6 million annualized) change in our pre-tax operating cash
flow.
Our contract drilling segment also provides drilling services for our oil and natural gas segment.
Some of the drilling services we perform on our properties are, depending on the timing of those
services, deemed to be associated with acquiring an ownership interest in the property. In those
cases, revenues and expenses for those drilling services are eliminated in our

Table of Contents
statement of operations, with any profit recognized as a reduction in our investment in our oil and
natural gas properties. The contracts for these services are issued under the same conditions
and rates as the contracts entered into with unrelated third parties. We did not eliminate any
revenue in our contract drilling segment for the first six months of 2016 and the oil and gas
segment did not use any of our rigs in the second quarter. Our oil and natural gas segment to
incur the majority of its drilling capital expenditures in the latter part of the year thus allowing us to
take into account future commodity price movement before those expenditures are incurred. For
the first six months of 2015, we eliminated revenue of $15.7 million from our contract drilling
segment and eliminated the associated operating expense of $12.2 million, yielding $3.5 million
as a reduction to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.
Mid-Stream Operations
Our mid-stream segment is engaged primarily in the buying, selling, gathering, processing, and
treating of natural gas. It operates three natural gas treatment plants, 14 processing plants, 26
gathering systems, and approximately 1,450 miles of pipeline. It operates in Oklahoma, Texas,
Kansas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Besides serving third parties, this segment also
enhances our ability to gather and market our own natural gas and NGLs and serving as a
mechanism through which we can construct or acquire existing natural gas gathering and
processing facilities. During the first six months of 2016 and 2015, our mid-stream operations
purchased $16.4 million and $33.0 million, respectively, of our natural gas production and NGLs,
and provided gathering and transportation services of $5.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively.
Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between this business
segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.
This segment gathered an average of 411,671 Mcf per day in the first six months of 2016
compared to 348,666 Mcf per day in the first six months of 2015. It processed an average of
164,333 Mcf per day in the first six months of 2016 compared to 187,592 Mcf per day in the first
six months of 2015. The amount of NGLs sold was 525,824 gallons per day in the first six months
of 2016 compared to 584,389 gallons per day in the first six months of 2015. Gas gathering
volumes per day in the first six months of 2016 increased 18% compared to the first six months of
2015 primarily from additional wells added to our Pittsburgh Mills gathering system. Processed
volumes for the first six months of 2016 decreased 12% from the first six months of 2015 due to
declines in existing wells in our systems where we process gas combined with few replacement
wells due to decreased drilling activity by operators in those areas. NGLs sold decreased 10%
from the comparative period due to less volume to process at our plants.
Our Credit Agreement and Senior Subordinated Notes
Credit Agreement. On April 8, 2016, we amended our Senior Credit Agreement (credit
agreement) scheduled to mature on April 10, 2020. The amount we can borrow is the lesser of
the amount we elect as the commitment amount or the value of the borrowing base as
determined by the lenders, but in either event not to exceed the maximum credit agreement
amount of $875.0 million. Our elected commitment amount is $475.0 million. Our borrowing base
is $475.0 million. We are charged a commitment fee of 0.50% on the amount available but not
borrowed. The fee varies based on the amount borrowed as a percentage of the amount of the
total borrowing base. We paid $1.0 million in origination, agency, syndication, and other related
fees. We are amortizing these fees over the life of the credit agreement. With the new
amendment, we pledged the following collateral: (a) 85% of the proved developed producing
(discounted as present worth at 8%) total value of our oil and gas properties and (b) 100% of our
ownership interest in our midstream affiliate, Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C.

The borrowing base amount–which is subject to redetermination by the lenders on April 1st and
October 1st of each year–is based primarily on a percentage of the discounted future value of our
oil and natural gas reserves. We or the lenders may request a onetime special redetermination of
the borrowing base between each scheduled redetermination. In addition, we may request a
redetermination following the completion of an acquisition that meets the requirements in the
credit agreement.
At our election, any part of the outstanding debt under the credit agreement may be fixed at a
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). LIBOR interest is computed as the sum of the LIBOR
base for the applicable term plus 2.00% to 3.00% depending on the level of debt as a percentage
of the borrowing base and is payable at the end of each term, or every 90 days, whichever is
less. Borrowings not under LIBOR bear interest at the prime rate specified in the credit
agreement that cannot be less than LIBOR plus 1.00%. Interest is payable at the end of each
month and the principal may be repaid in whole or in part at any time, without a premium or
penalty. At June 30, 2016 and July 22, 2016, borrowings were $236.0 million and $238.6 million,
respectively.
We can use borrowings for financing general working capital requirements for (a) exploration,
development, production, and acquisition of oil and gas properties, (b) acquisitions and operation
of mid-stream assets, (c) issuance of standby letters of credit, (d) contract drilling services and
acquisition of contract drilling equipment, and (e) general corporate purposes.
The credit agreement prohibits, among other things:
•
the payment of dividends (other than stock dividends) during any fiscal year over 30% of our
consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year;
•the incurrence of additional debt with certain limited exceptions; and
the creation or existence of mortgages or liens, other than those in the ordinary course of
business and with certain limited exceptions, on any of our properties, except in favor of our
lenders.
•
The credit agreement also requires that we have at the end of each quarter:
•a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 1 to 1.
Through the quarter ending March 31, 2019, the credit agreement also requires that we have at
the end of each quarter:
•
a senior indebtedness ratio of senior indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
credit agreement) for the most recently ended rolling four quarters of no greater than 2.75 to 1.
Beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2019, and for each quarter ending thereafter, the
credit agreement requires:
•
a leverage ratio of funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) for
the most recently ended rolling four fiscal quarters of no greater than 4 to 1.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement.

6.625% Senior Subordinated Notes. We have an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million,
6.625% senior subordinated notes (the Notes) outstanding. Interest on the Notes is payable
semi-annually (in arrears) on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Notes will mature on
May 15, 2021. In issuing the Notes, we incurred fees of $14.7 million that are being amortized as
debt issuance cost over the life of the Notes.
The Notes are subject to an Indenture dated as of May 18, 2011, between us and Wilmington
Trust, National Association (successor to Wilmington Trust FSB), as Trustee (the Trustee), as
supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 18, 2011, between us, the
Guarantors, and the Trustee, and as further supplemented by the Second Supplemental
Indenture dated as of January 7, 2013, between us, the Guarantors, and the Trustee (as
supplemented, the 2011 Indenture), establishing the terms of and providing for the issuance of
the Notes. The Guarantors are most of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The discussion of the
Notes in this report is qualified by and subject to the actual terms of the 2011 Indenture.
Unit, as the parent company, has no independent assets or operations. The guarantees by the
Guarantors of the Notes
(registered under registration statements) are full and unconditional, joint and several, subject to
certain automatic customary releases, are subject to certain restrictions on the sale, disposition,
or transfer of the capital stock or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary guarantor, and
other conditions and terms set out in the 2011 Indenture. Any of our subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors are minor. There are no significant restrictions on our ability to receive funds from any
of our subsidiaries through dividends, loans, advances, or otherwise.
On and after May 15, 2016, we may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes at certain
redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a “change of control” occurs, subject to
certain conditions, we must offer to repurchase from each holder all or any part of that holder’s
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The 2011 Indenture contains
customary events of default. The 2011 Indenture also contains covenants that, among other
things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem capital stock or subordinated
indebtedness; transfer or sell assets; make investments; incur liens; enter into transactions with
our affiliates; and merge or consolidate with other companies. We were in compliance with all
covenants of the Notes as of June 30, 2016.
Capital Requirements
Oil and Natural Gas Segment Dispositions, Acquisitions, and Capital Expenditures. Most of our
capital expenditures for this segment are discretionary and directed toward future growth. Our
decisions to increase our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves through acquisitions or through
drilling depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions, potential return on investment,
future drilling potential, and opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved,
all of which provide us with flexibility in deciding when and if to incur these costs. We completed
drilling 13 gross wells (7.65 net wells) in the first six months of 2016 compared to 33 gross wells
(21.85 net wells) in the first six months of 2015. Capital expenditures for oil and gas properties on
the full cost method for the first six months of 2016 by this segment, excluding a $28.9 million
reduction in the ARO liability, totaled $76.2 million. Capital expenditures for the first six months of
2015, excluding a $6.0 million reduction in the ARO liability, totaled $167.6 million.
Currently we plan to participate in drilling approximately 20 to 25 gross wells in 2016 and our
total estimated capital expenditures (excluding any possible acquisitions) for this segment range
from approximately $109.0 million to $131.0 million. Whether we can drill the full number of wells
planned depends on several factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the
availability of drilling rigs, availability of pressure pumping services, prices for oil, NGLs, and
natural gas, demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas, the cost to drill wells, the weather, and the
efforts of outside industry partners.
Contract Drilling Segment Dispositions, Acquisitions, and Capital Expenditures. During the
second quarter of 2015, we recorded a write-down of approximately $8.3 million pre-tax on
drilling equipment that was being held for sale.
During the first quarter of 2015, we had two BOSS drilling rigs placed into service for third-party
operators. The long lead time components for three additional BOSS drilling rigs were ordered in
2014 in anticipation for future demand of the BOSS drilling rigs. However, with the decline in the
drilling market, many of these long lead time components were either postponed for later delivery
or canceled altogether. Currently, we do not have any contracts to build new BOSS drilling rigs.
Our estimated 2016 capital expenditures for this segment range from $9.0 million to $11.0 million.
At June 30, 2016, we had commitments to purchase approximately $4.8 million for drilling
equipment over the next two years. We have spent $5.2 million for capital expenditures during
the first six months of 2016, compared to $70.1 million for capital expenditures, including $53.8
million for the BOSS drilling rigs, during the first six months of 2015.

Mid-Stream Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures. At our Hemphill Texas system, for the
second quarter of 2016, our total throughput volume averaged 69.3 MMcf per day and our total
production of natural gas liquids was approximately 172,200 gallons per day. At this processing
facility we have the capacity to process 135 MMcf per day through three processing skids. During
the second quarter, we connected one new long lateral well to this system.
At our Bellmon processing facility located in the Mississippian play in north central Oklahoma,
our total throughput volume averaged approximately 34 MMcf per day for the second quarter of
2016. Additionally, during the second quarter, we increased our natural gas liquids volume to
approximately 130,800 gallons per day. After minor modifications to our gathering system, we
have been receiving additional volumes from third party producers since the first of this year.
During the first six months of 2016, we connected 15 additional wells to this gathering system. At
this processing facility we have two processing skids available that provide total processing
capacity of 90 MMcf per day.
At our Segno gathering facility located Southeast Texas, our average transported volume
increased to over 90 MMcf per day for the second quarter of 2016. Since the first of this year, we
connected three new wells to this gathering system. With the completion of the GAP pipeline
extension project, our total gathering capacity has increased to 120 MMcf per day for this system.
In the Appalachian region, at our Pittsburgh Mills gathering system, our average throughput
volume continues to increase. During the second quarter of 2016 the total throughput volume
increased to approximately 142.5 MMcf per day. Since the beginning of this year we have
connected three new well pads with a total of 12 new wells to this gathering system. In June, we
connected the Thompson well pad which included two new wells. The Thompson well pad is
located on the northern end of our system and delivers gas into NiSource’s Big Pine system. We
have completed construction of a pipeline to connect our next well pad which is the Belo pad.
There are six wells located on this pad and it was connected and began flowing gas in July.
Also in the Appalachian area at our Snow Shoe gathering system, since the first of this year, we
have connected three well pads that have a total of six wells. Our average throughput volume for
the second quarter of 2016 has increased to approximately 14 MMcf per day. During the second
quarter, we connected one new well pad that had three wells which began flowing in April. We
have completed preliminary construction of the Snow Shoe compressor station but we will not
complete the compressor station until compression services are required.
During the first six months of 2016, our mid-stream segment incurred $8.5 million in capital
expenditures as compared to $24.3 million in the first six months of 2015. For 2016, our
estimated capital expenditures range from $22.0 million to $24.0 million.

We provide a salary deferral plan which allows participants to defer the recognition of salary
for income tax purposes until actual distribution of benefits, which occurs at either termination
of employment, death, or certain defined unforeseeable emergency hardships. We recognize
payroll expense and record a liability, included in other long-term liabilities in our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, at the time of deferral.
(2)
Effective January 1, 1997, we adopted a separation benefit plan (“Separation Plan”). The
Separation Plan allows eligible employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated or,
in the case of an employee who has completed 20 years of service, voluntarily or involuntarily
terminated, to receive benefits equivalent to four weeks salary for every whole year of service
completed with the company up to a maximum of 104 weeks. To receive payments the
recipient must waive certain claims against us in exchange for receiving the separation
benefits. On October 28, 1997, we adopted a Separation Benefit Plan for Senior Management
(“Senior Plan”). The Senior Plan provides certain officers and key executives of the company
with benefits generally equivalent to the Separation Plan. The Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals covered in this
plan. Currently there are no participants in the Senior Plan. On May 5, 2004 we also adopted
the Special Separation Benefit Plan (“Special Plan”). This plan is identical to the Separation
Benefit Plan with the exception that the benefits under the plan vest on the earliest of a
participant’s reaching the age of 65 or serving 20 years with the company. On December 31,
2008, all these plans were amended to bring the plans into compliance with Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
(3)
When a well is drilled or acquired, under “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” we
record the discounted fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
(mainly plugging and abandonment costs for our depleted wells).
(4)
We have recorded a liability for those properties we believe do not have sufficient oil, NGLs,
and natural gas reserves to allow the under-produced owners to recover their under-
production from future production volumes.
We formed The Unit 1984 Oil and Gas Limited Partnership and the 1986 Energy Income
Limited Partnership along with private limited partnerships (the “Partnerships”) with certain
qualified employees, officers and directors from 1984 through 2011. One of our subsidiaries
serves as the general partner of each of these programs. Effective December 31, 2014, The
Unit 1984 Oil and Gas Limited Partnership dissolved. The Partnerships were formed for the
purpose of conducting oil and natural gas acquisition, drilling and development operations
(5)
and serving as co-general partner with us in any additional limited partnerships formed during
that year. The Partnerships participated on a proportionate basis with us in most drilling
operations and most producing property acquisitions commenced by us for our own account
during the period from the formation of the Partnership through December 31 of that year.
These partnership agreements require, on the election of a limited partner, that we repurchase
the limited partner’s interest at amounts to be determined by appraisal in the future.
Repurchases in any one year are limited to 20% of the units outstanding. We made
repurchases of $8,000 during the first six months of 2015 but did not have any for the first six
months of 2016.
(6)
We have recorded a liability for future estimated payments related to workers’ compensation
claims primarily associated with our contract drilling segment.
(7)
The amount includes commitments under capital lease arrangements for compressors in our
mid-stream segment.
Derivative Activities
Periodically we enter into derivative transactions locking in the prices to be received for a portion
of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas production.
39
Table of Contents
Commodity Derivatives. Our commodity derivatives are intended to reduce our exposure to price
volatility and manage price risks. Our decision on the type and quantity of our production and the
price(s) of our derivative(s) is based, in part, on our view of current and future market conditions.
At June 30, 2016, based on our second quarter 2016 average daily production, the approximated
percentages of our production under derivative contracts are as follows:
 Q3  Q4   
 
 2016 2016 2017 2018
 
Daily oil production
 58 % 34 % 9 % — %
Daily natural gas production 63 % 63 % 52 % 6 %
With respect to the commodities subject to derivative contracts, those contracts serve to limit the
risk of adverse downward price movements. However, they also limit increases in future
revenues that would otherwise result from price movements above the contracted prices.
The use of derivative transactions carries with it the risk that the counterparties may not be able
to meet their financial obligations under the transactions. Based on our June 30, 2016 evaluation,
we believe the risk of non-performance by our counterparties is not material. At June 30, 2016,
the fair values of the net liabilities we had with each of the counterparties to our commodity
derivative transactions are as follows:

)
If a legal right of set-off exists, we net the value of the derivative transactions we have with the
same counterparty in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30,
2016, we recorded the fair value of our commodity derivatives on our balance sheet as current
and non-current derivative liabilities of $9.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively. At June 30,
2015, we recorded the fair value of our commodity derivatives on our balance sheet as current
and non-current derivative assets of $14.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
For our economic hedges any changes in their fair value occurring before their maturity (i.e.,
temporary fluctuations in value) are reported in gain (loss) on derivatives in our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These gains (losses) at June 30 are as
follows:

Stock and Incentive Compensation
During the first six months of 2016, we granted awards covering 728,951 shares of restricted
stock. These awards had an estimated fair value as of their grant date of $4.2 million.
Compensation expense will be recognized over the three year vesting periods, and during the six
months of 2016, we recognized $0.6 million in compensation expense and capitalized $0.1
million for these awards. During the first six months of 2016, we recognized compensation
expense of $5.3 million for all of our restricted stock, stock options, and SAR grants and
capitalized $1.2 million of compensation cost for oil and natural gas properties.
During the first six months of 2015 we granted awards covering 750,290 shares of restricted
stock. These awards had an estimated fair value as of their grant date of $24.5 million.
Compensation expense will be recognized over the three year vesting periods, and during the six
months of 2015, we recognized $3.6 million in compensation expense and capitalized $0.8
million for these awards. During the first six months of 2015, we recognized compensation
expense of $9.1 million for all of our restricted stock, stock options, and SAR grants and
capitalized $1.9 million of compensation cost for oil and natural gas properties.
Insurance
We are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation, general liability, control
of well, and employee medical benefits. Insured policies for other coverage contain deductibles
or retentions per occurrence that range from zero to $1.0 million. We have purchased stop-loss
coverage in order to limit, to the extent feasible, per occurrence and aggregate exposure to
certain types of claims. There is no assurance that the insurance coverage we have will protect
us against liability from all potential consequences. If insurance coverage becomes more
expensive, we may choose to self-insure, decrease our limits, raise our deductibles, or any
combination of these rather than pay higher premiums.
Oil and Natural Gas Limited Partnerships and Other Entity Relationships
We are the general partner of 15 oil and natural gas partnerships which were formed privately or
publicly. Each partnership’s revenues and costs are shared under formulas set out in that
partnership’s agreement. The partnerships repay us for contract drilling, well supervision, and
general and administrative expense. Related party transactions for contract drilling and well
supervision fees are the related party’s share of such costs. These costs are billed on the same
basis as billings to unrelated third parties for similar services. General and administrative
reimbursements consist of direct general and administrative expense incurred on the related
party’s behalf as well as indirect expenses assigned to the related parties. Allocations are based
on the related party’s level of activity and are considered by us to be reasonable. For each of the
first six months of 2016 and 2015, the total we received for all of these fees was $0.2 million. Our
proportionate share of assets, liabilities, and net income (loss) relating to the oil and natural gas
partnerships is included in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Compensation—Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting. The FASB has issued ASU 2016-09. The amendments are intended to improve the
accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-
based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax
consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. The amendments primarily impact classification
within the statement of cash flows between financial and operating activities. We do not believe
the amendments will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Leases. The FASB has issued ASU 2016-02. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required
to recognize at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make
lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset,
which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use a specified asset for the lease term.
Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. For public companies, the amendments are effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Early adoption of the amendments in permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the
impact it will have on our financial statements.
Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The FASB has issued ASU
2015-17. This changes how deferred taxes are classified on organizations' balance sheets.
Organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets

Table of Contents
and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified
balance sheet. For public companies, the amendments are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. The amendments will require
current deferred tax assets to be combined with noncurrent deferred tax assets. We do not
believe the amendments will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Interest—Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The FASB
has issued ASU 2015-03. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The FASB has also issued
ASU 2015-15. The amendments in this ASU allow an entity to defer and present debt issuance
cost as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the
term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding
borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We have maintained debt issuance costs
associated with our credit agreement as an asset and amortize these fees over the life of the
credit agreement. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the
balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-
specific effects of applying the new guidance. We have adopted these amendments during the
first quarter of 2016. Previously, debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was classified as
a long-term asset on the balance sheet, but with ASU 2015-03, it is presented as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of the recognized debt liability.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The FASB has issued ASU 2014-09. This affects any
entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or
services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are
within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core
principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-12, "Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," which provides
clarifying guidance in certain areas and adds some practical expedients. Also in May 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-11, "Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards
Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF
Meeting." This ASU rescinds SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 605,
Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities— Oil and Gas, effective upon the
adoption of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In April 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-10, "Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing," which amends the revenue
guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual
property. The FASB has issued 2015-14, which defers the effective date to annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. We are in the process of evaluating the impact it will have on our financial
statements.

Oil and Natural Gas
Oil and natural gas revenues decreased $38.1 million or 35% in the second quarter of 2016 as
compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices
and to a lesser extent from reduced production volumes. In the second quarter of 2016, as
compared to the second quarter of 2015, oil production decreased 20%, natural gas production
decreased 13%, and NGLs production decreased 10%. Average oil prices decreased 25% to
$41.52 per barrel, average natural gas prices decreased 33% to $1.80 per Mcf, and NGLs prices
decreased 6% to $11.38 per barrel.
Oil and natural gas operating costs decreased $12.6 million or 27% between the comparative
second quarters of 2016 and 2015 due to lower LOE, saltwater disposal expense, and general
and administrative expenses.
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization (“DD&A”) decreased $37.7 million or 55% due
primarily to a 50% decrease in our DD&A rate and a 14% decrease in equivalent production. The
decrease in our DD&A rate in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of
2015 resulted primarily from the effect of the ceiling test write-downs throughout 2015. Our DD&A
expense on our oil and natural gas properties is calculated each quarter utilizing period end
reserve quantities adjusted for current period production.
During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $410.5
million pre-tax ($255.6 million, net of tax). During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-
cash ceiling test write-down of $74.3 million pre-tax ($46.3 million, net of tax).
Contract Drilling
Drilling revenues decreased $30.8 million or 56% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the
second quarter of 2015. The decrease was due primarily to a 56% decrease in the average
number of drilling rigs in use as well as a 7% decrease in the average dayrate. Average drilling
rig utilization decreased from 30.7 drilling rigs in the second quarter of 2015 to 13.5 drilling rigs in
the second quarter of 2016. Revenue on contracts that terminated early were $0.4 million in the
second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Drilling operating costs decreased $17.2 million or 47% between the comparative second
quarters of 2016 and 2015. The decrease was due primarily to fewer drilling rigs operating.
Contract drilling depreciation decreased $2.3 million or 18% also due primarily to fewer drilling
rigs operating. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a write-down of approximately
$8.3 million pre-tax on drilling equipment that was being held for sale.
Mid-Stream
Our mid-stream revenues decreased $7.3 million or 14% in the second quarter of 2016 as
compared to the second quarter of 2015 due primarily from the average price for natural gas and
condensate sold decreasing 28% and 24%, respectively and from gas sales and liquids volumes
decreasing 15% and 11%, respectively, offset partially by an increase in transportation volumes
and prices of 60% and 13%, respectively. Gas processing volumes per day decreased 13%
between the comparative quarters primarily due to declines in existing volumes. Gas gathering
volumes per day increased 21% between the comparative quarters primarily due to additional
wells added to our Pittsburgh Mills gathering system.
Operating costs decreased $8.2 million or 20% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the
second quarter of 2015 primarily due to a 18% decrease in prices paid for natural gas purchased
and an 14% decrease in purchase volumes along with an 6% decrease in field direct expenses
and a 22% decrease in general and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization
increased $0.7 million, or 6%, primarily due to capital expenditures for upgrades and well
connects.
General and Administrative
Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million or 13% in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower employee costs
and a reduction to our workforce during the first quarter of 2016.
Gain on Disposition of Assets
There was a $0.5 million gain on disposition of assets in the second quarter of 2016 primarily
due to the sale of two top drives and power units, several large trucks, trailers, forklifts, and
smaller vehicles, compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the disposition of assets in the second
quarter of 2015 primarily due to the sale of one gathering system in our mid-stream segment.
44
Table of Contents
Other Income (Expense)
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased $2.7 million between the comparative
second quarters of 2016 and 2015 due primarily to decreased capitalized interest in the second
quarter of 2016 and to a lesser extent to the higher average bank debt outstanding and a higher
average interest rate. We capitalized interest based on the net book value associated with
undeveloped leasehold not being amortized, the construction of additional drilling rigs, and the
construction of gas gathering systems. Capitalized interest for the second quarter of 2016 was
$3.6 million compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2015, and was netted against our
gross interest of $14.2 million and $13.4 million for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our average interest rate increased from 5.4% in the second quarter of 2015 to 5.6%
in the second quarter of 2016 and our average debt outstanding was $1.9 million higher in the
second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to the increase
in outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement over the comparative periods.
Loss on derivatives increased $20.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in forward prices used to
estimate the fair value in mark-to-market accounting.
Income Tax Benefit
Income tax benefit decreased $121.5 million between the comparative second quarters of 2016
and 2015 primarily due to decreased pre-tax loss primarily from a lower non-cash ceiling test
write-down in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015. Our effective tax
rate was 37.3% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 37.5% for the first quarter of 2015.
There was no current income tax expense in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.8 million
for the second quarter of 2015. We did not pay any income taxes in the second quarter of 2016.

Oil and Natural Gas
Oil and natural gas revenues decreased $85.9 million or 40% in the first six months 2016 as
compared to the first six months of 2015 primarily due to lower oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices
and to a lesser extent from reduced production volumes. In the first six months of 2016, as
compared to the first six months of 2015, oil production decreased 24%, natural gas production
decreased 12%, and NGLs production decreased 5%. Average oil prices decreased 29% to
$36.88 per barrel, average natural gas prices decreased 35% to $1.83 per Mcf, and NGLs prices
decreased 14% to $8.90 per barrel.
Oil and natural gas operating costs decreased $24.5 million or 27% between the comparative
first six months of 2016 and 2015 due to lower LOE, saltwater disposal expense, and general
and administrative expenses offset partially by higher gross production taxes due to fewer
credits.
DD&A decreased $83.0 million or 57% due primarily to a 52% decrease in our DD&A rate and a
13% decrease in equivalent production. The decrease in our DD&A rate in the first six months of
2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 resulted primarily from the effect of the ceiling test
write-downs throughout 2015. Our DD&A expense on our oil and natural gas properties is
calculated each quarter utilizing period end reserve quantities adjusted for current period
production.
During the first six months of 2015, we recorded a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $811.1
million pre-tax ($505.0 million, net of tax). During the first six months of 2016, we recorded a non-
cash ceiling test write-down of $112.1 million pre-tax ($69.8 million, net of tax).
Contract Drilling
Drilling revenues decreased $87.1 million or 58% in the first six months of 2016 versus the first
six months of 2015. The decrease was due primarily to a 58% decrease in the average number of
drilling rigs in use as well as an 8% decrease in the average dayrate. Average drilling rig
utilization decreased from 40.4 drilling rigs in the first six months of 2015 to 17.1 drilling rigs in
the first six months of 2016. Revenue on contracts that terminated early were $3.1 million in the
first six months of 2016 compared to $14.3 million in the first six months of 2015.
Drilling operating costs decreased $40.9 million or 46% between the comparative first six months
of 2016 and 2015. The decrease was due primarily to fewer drilling rigs operating. Contract
drilling depreciation decreased $5.2 million or 18% also due primarily to fewer drilling rigs
operating. During the first six months of 2015, we recorded a write-down of approximately $8.3
million pre-tax on drilling equipment that was being held for sale.
Mid-Stream
Our mid-stream revenues decreased $22.1 million or 21% in the first six months of 2016 as
compared to the first six months of 2015 due primarily from the average price for natural gas,
liquids, and condensate sold decreasing 30%, 15%, and 31%, respectively and from gas sales,
liquids, and condensate volumes decreasing 13%, 10%, and 2%, respectively, offset partially by
an increase in transportation volumes and prices of 58% and 5%, respectively. Gas processing
volumes per day decreased 12% between the comparative periods primarily due to declines in
existing volumes. Gas gathering volumes per day increased 18% between the comparative
periods primarily due to additional wells added to our Pittsburgh Mills gathering system.
Operating costs decreased $21.3 million or 25% in the first six months of 2016 compared to the
first six months of 2015 primarily due to a 28% decrease in prices paid for natural gas purchased
and an 13% decrease in purchase volumes along with an 7% decrease in field direct expenses
and an 11% decrease in general and administrative expense. Depreciation and amortization
increased $1.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to capital expenditures for upgrades and well
connects.
General and Administrative
Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased $1.9 million or 10% in the first six
months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 primarily due to lower employee costs
and a reduction to our workforce during the first quarter of 2016.
Gain on Disposition of Assets
There was a $0.7 million gain on disposition of assets in the first six months of 2016 primarily due
to the sale of various rig components (including three top drives and power units), vehicles, and a
drilling yard, compared to a gain of $1.0 million
47
Table of Contents
for the disposition of assets in the first six months of 2015 primarily due to the sale of one
gathering system, various rig components, vehicles, and to a lesser extent the sale of one drilling
rig.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased $5.0 million between the comparative first
six months of 2016 and 2015 due primarily to decreased capitalized interest in the first six
months of 2016 and to a lesser extent to the higher average bank debt outstanding and a higher
average interest rate. We capitalized interest based on the net book value associated with
undeveloped leasehold not being amortized, the construction of additional drilling rigs, and the
construction of gas gathering systems. Capitalized interest for the first six months of 2016 was
$7.6 million compared to $11.4 million in the first six months of 2015, and was netted against our
gross interest of $27.8 million and $26.6 million for the first six months of 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our average interest rate increased from 5.5% to 5.6% and our average debt
outstanding was $13.9 million higher in the first six months of 2016 as compared to the first six
months of 2015 primarily due to the increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit
agreement over the comparative periods.
Gain (loss) on derivatives decreased $16.4 million primarily due to fluctuations in forward prices
used to estimate the fair value in mark-to-market accounting.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax benefit decreased $256.4 million between the comparative first six months of 2016
and 2015 primarily due to decreased pre-tax loss primarily from lower non-cash ceiling test write-
downs in the first six months of 2016 versus the first six months of 2015. Our effective tax rate
was 34.1% for the first six months of 2016 compared to 37.6% for the first six months of 2015.
This decrease is primarily due to increased deferred tax expense in the first six months of 2016
related to our restricted stock vestings in the first six months of 2016 after the exhaustion of our
remaining accumulated excess tax benefits. There was no current income tax expense in the first
six months of 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the first six months of 2015. We did not pay any
income taxes in the first six months of 2016.

risks relating to financing, including restrictions in our debt agreements and availability and cost
of credit;
•risks associated with future weather conditions;
•decreases or increases in commodity prices;
our ability to successfully implement our pending technology conversion process relating to our
financial and operational information systems; and
•other factors, most of which are beyond our control.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
Our operations are exposed to market risks primarily because of changes in commodity prices
and interest rates.
Commodity Price Risk. Our major market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our oil,
NGLs, and natural gas production. These prices are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide
price for crude oil and market prices applicable to
49
Table of Contents
our NGLs and natural gas production. Historically, these prices have fluctuated and we expect
this to continue. The prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas also affect the demand for our drilling
rigs and the amount we can charge for the use of our drilling rigs. Based on our first six months
2016 production, a $0.10 per Mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production,
without the effect of hedging, would result in a corresponding $464,000 per month ($5.6 million
annualized) change in our pre-tax operating cash flow. A $1.00 per barrel change in our oil price,
without the effect of hedging, would have a $252,000 per month ($3.0 million annualized) change
in our pre-tax operating cash flow and a $1.00 per barrel change in our NGLs prices, without the
effect of hedging, would have a $399,000 per month ($4.8 million annualized) change in our pre-
tax operating cash flow.
We use derivative transactions to manage the risk associated with price volatility. Our decisions
regarding the amount and prices at which we choose to enter into a contract for certain of our
products is based, in part, on our view of current and future market conditions. The transactions
we use include financial price swaps under which we will receive a fixed price for our production
and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty. We do not hold or issue derivative
instruments for speculative trading purposes.
At June 30, 2016, we had the following derivatives outstanding:

Interest Rate Risk. Our interest rate exposure relates to our long-term debt under our credit
agreement and the Notes. The credit agreement, at our election bears interest at variable rates
based on the Prime Rate or the LIBOR Rate. At our election, borrowings under our credit
agreement may be fixed at the LIBOR Rate for periods of up to 180 days. Based on our average
outstanding long-term debt subject to a variable rate in the first six months of 2016, a 1% increase
in the floating rate would reduce our annual pre-tax cash flow by approximately $2.4 million.
Under our Notes, we pay a fixed rate of interest of 6.625% per year (payable semi-annually in
arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year).

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this
report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of
June 30, 2016 in ensuring the appropriate information is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported in our periodic SEC filings relating to the company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) and is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, and management to allow timely decisions.
Changes in Internal Controls. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a –
15(f) under the Exchange Act.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Panola Independent School District No. 4, et al. v. Unit Petroleum Company, No. CJ-07-215,
District Court of Latimer County, Oklahoma.
Panola Independent School District No. 4, Michael Kilpatrick, Gwen Grego, Carla Lessel,
Thelma Christine Pate, Juanita Golightly, Melody Culberson, and Charlotte Abernathy are the
Plaintiffs in this case and are royalty owners in oil and gas drilling and spacing units for which the
company’s exploration segment distributes royalty. The Plaintiffs’ central allegation is that the
company’s exploration segment has underpaid royalty obligations by deducting post-production
costs or marketing related fees. Plaintiffs sought to pursue the case as a class action on behalf of
persons who receive royalty from us for our Oklahoma production. We have asserted several
defenses including that the deductions are permitted under Oklahoma law. We have also
asserted that the case should not be tried as a class action due to the materially different
circumstances that determine what, if any, deductions are taken for each lease. On December 16,
2009, the trial court entered its order certifying the class. On May 11, 2012 the court of civil
appeals reversed the trial court’s order certifying the class. The Plaintiffs petitioned the supreme
court for certiorari and on October 8, 2012, the Plaintiff’s petition was denied. On January 22,
2013, the Plaintiffs filed a second request to certify a class of royalty owners that was slightly
smaller than their first attempt. Since then, the Plaintiffs have further amended their proposed
class to just include royalty owners entitled to royalties under certain leases located in Latimer,
Le Flore, and Pittsburg Counties, Oklahoma. In July 2014, a second class certification hearing
was held where, in addition to the defenses described above, we argued that the amended class
definition is still deficient under the court of civil appeals opinion reversing the initial class
certification. Closing arguments were held on December 2, 2014. There is no timetable for when
the court will issue its ruling. The merits of Plaintiffs’ claims will remain stayed while class
certification issues are pending.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report, you should carefully consider
the factors discussed below, if any, and in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business,
financial condition, or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are
not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to
us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and/or operating results.
There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A in our Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
