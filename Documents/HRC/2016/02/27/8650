<p><b>  The situation of indigenous peoples in Botswana</b>*  
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, James Anaya, presents his observations and 
recommendations on the situation of indigenous peoples in Botswana, focusing on those 
groups that have been historically marginalized and that remain non-dominant parts of 
society. The report arises out of an exchange of information with the Government, 
indigenous peoples and other interested parties and follows the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit 
to Botswana (19&#8211;27 March 2009). 
 The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the initiatives undertaken by the Government 
of Botswana to address the conditions of disadvantaged indigenous peoples. He highlights, 
in particular, efforts aimed at addressing long-standing problems such as marginalization in 
political spheres and a history of underdevelopment. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur 
notes that, while important, these initiatives still suffer from a variety of shortcomings and 
need to be designed and implemented in a manner that recognizes and respects cultural 
diversity and distinct indigenous or tribal identities. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government of Botswana has developed a 
number of programmes aimed at preserving and celebrating the unique cultural attributes of 
the country&#8217;s many indigenous tribes. However, Government programmes should not be

<p>limited to the recognition of ceremonial and artistic expression, but rather should be 
expanded to include a real respect for and promotion of cultural diversity as it is manifested 
in its many forms, including in political and social structures, land-use patterns and 
approaches to development. Too often, the practices of the dominant Tswana tribes have 
been incorporated in the design and implementation of Government initiatives to the 
exclusion of the practices of culturally distinct minority tribes. 
</p>
<p> Marginalized indigenous peoples of Botswana continue to confront serious issues 
arising out of the historical loss of vast amounts of land and natural resources. A significant 
amount of tribal land, particularly of non-dominant peoples, such as the Basarwa, was lost 
during colonization, and this pattern of land loss and denial of access to natural resources 
continued post-independence. The Special Rapporteur finds that the failure to provide 
adequate redress for these historical grievances has profoundly affected Botswana&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples in the present, and land loss remains a significant contributing factor to 
many of the issues of these peoples. The depth of these issues is exemplified by the 
removal of indigenous peoples from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur offers a number of observations and recommendations with 
the hope that they will help guide the Government of Botswana, indigenous peoples within 
the country and other interested parties to develop and implement laws, policies and 
programmes that conform to the international human rights standards related to indigenous 
peoples.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, James Anaya, addresses issues and makes a 
series of recommendations concerning culturally distinct peoples who are indigenous to 
Botswana and who have characteristics of non-dominance and marginalization similar to 
those of indigenous peoples in other parts of the world. It is based on information gathered 
by the Special Rapporteur during a visit to Botswana from 19 to 27 March 2009, carried out 
with the cooperation of the Government, and on subsequent exchanges of information and 
independent research. 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with Government 
representatives, indigenous communities and their leaders and a variety of civil society 
organizations. He held meetings in Gaborone with representatives of the Ministry of 
Presidential Affairs and Public Administration and the Inter-Ministerial Committee, 
consisting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of 
Local Government, the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources, the Ministry of 
Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, the Ministry of Defence, Justice and Security, the 
Ministry of Lands and Housing and the Ministry of Education and Skills Development. The 
Special Rapporteur also met with members of the United Nations country team. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur conducted field visits to the settlements of Kaudwane in 
Kweneng District; Gugamma and Metsiamanong in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve and 
New !Xade, West Hanahai and D&#8217;kar in Ghanzi District; and Tsodilo Hills, Shaikarawe and 
Mababe in North West District. He consulted local authorities, indigenous leaders and 
community members at these locations. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of 
a variety of non-governmental organizations, including the Botswana Centre for Human 
Rights (Ditshwanelo), the Botswana Council of Churches, the Botswana Council of Non-
Governmental Organisations, the First People of the Kalahari, and the Kuru Family of 
Organizations (Letloa, D&#8217;Kar Trust, Gantsi Craft, Komku Trust, Bokamoso, TOKADI and 
Sand Arts &amp; Crafts), the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa, the 
Central Kalahari Game Reserve Coalition and Temasi. Lastly, he met with representatives 
of the University of Botswana&#8217;s San/Basarwa Research Project and Gem Diamonds/Gope 
Exploration Company (Pty) Ltd.1  
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government of Botswana 
and to local indigenous communities and a number of non-governmental organizations of 
Botswana for the support they provided for the visit. He would like to thank the Office of 
the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Gaborone for its support and instrumental role 
in the preparation and execution of the visit.  
</p>
<p>5. Through a letter dated 17 April 2009, the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 
Government preliminary observations relating to issues discussed during the visit and 
presented a number of questions, to which the Government responded in a note received by 
the Special Rapporteur on 12 June 2009. Subsequently, on 24 August the Special 
Rapporteur transmitted to the Government a preliminary version of the present report and 
then met with representatives of the Government to discuss the report on 28 September 
2009 in Geneva, during the twelfth session of the Human Rights Council. At the meeting it 
was agreed that the Government would provide written comments on the preliminary 
version of the report, which were received by the Special Rapporteur on 4 January 2010.

<p>The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government for its detailed responses, which have 
been taken into account in the preparation of this final version of the report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The indigenous and tribal peoples of Botswana 
</b></p>
<p>6. Numerous ethnically distinct groups that are indigenous to the African continent live 
in Botswana, speaking approximately 28 different languages or dialects. They fall primarily 
into five linguistic-tribal groups: the Tswana, the Basarwa, the Bakgalagadi, the Wayeyi 
and the Hambukushu. The Tswana, comprised of eight subgroups, are politically and 
numerically dominant throughout Botswana. Tswana-speaking groups began to migrate 
into the area no later than A.D. 1200. During the past few centuries, the presence of Tswana 
groups increased, and over time the Tswana established effective control over the territory, 
in some cases displacing other groups, primarily Basarwa, from their land. During 
colonization, the British colonial powers negotiated primarily with the dominant Tswana 
tribes. The legacy of this prioritization of Tswana interests and culture over non-dominant 
tribes in Botswana persists in the social and political dynamics of present-day Botswana.  
</p>
<p>7. Botswana is considered by historians and anthropologists to have been first 
inhabited by the ancestors of the hunter-gatherer Basarwa, or San, people. This historical 
presence is particularly evident in the Tsodilo Hills region of northern Botswana, where 
archaeological findings include stone tools and rock art paintings dating back thousands of 
years. The Basarwa population is now about 50,000&#8211;60,000, and encompasses a number of 
subgroups, including Ju/&#8217;hoansi, Bugakhwe, //Anikhwe, Tsexakhwe, !Xoo, Naro, G/wi, 
G//ana, Kua, Tshwa, Deti, &#8225;Khomani, &#8225;Hoa, =Kao//&#8217;aesi, Shua, Danisi and /Xaisa. Basarwa 
communities reside in seven districts: the Southern, Kweneng, Kgatleng, Ghanzi, 
Kgalagadi, Central, and North West districts. Traditionally, the Basarwa were a semi-
nomadic people who practised a hunter-gatherer and agro-pastoralist lifestyle, moving 
within designated areas based on the seasons and availability of resources, such as water, 
game and edible plants.  
</p>
<p>8. Other non-dominant tribes in Botswana include the Bakgalagadi people, comprised 
of several subgroups including the Bangologa and Bakgwathen, who number approximately 
272,000. Traditionally, the Bakgalagadi were agro-pastoralists who occasionally moved 
depending on the water supply. Still other groups include the Kalanga, who live in the 
Central and North East districts; the Wayeyi, numbering approximately 60,000 and living 
primarily in the North West District; and the Hambukushu, who number around 49,000, 
and live, among other areas, near the Tsodilo Hills in the North West District. Much 
smaller tribal groups within Botswana include the Nama, a Khoesan-speaking people, 
numbering approximately 1,500 and the Balala, numbering approximately 2,200.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Botswana gained its independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland in 1966. Alongside the formal institutions of governance that succeeded 
the colonial regime, tribal structures of authority and customary law have remained part of 
the country&#8217;s legal and political framework. Historically and in many ways still, however, 
the legal and political accommodation to tribal interests has privileged the dominant 
Tswana tribes.  
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution of Botswana provides for a House of Chiefs, a body that advises 
the National Assembly and executive authorities on issues related to Botswana&#8217;s tribes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13968 
</p>
<p>Under sections 77&#8211;79 of the Constitution of 1966, eight chiefs from each of the eight major 
Tswana tribes &#8212; the Bamangwato, Batawana, Bakgatla, Bakwena, Bangwaketse, 
Bamalete, Barolong and Batlokwa &#8212; were guaranteed a seat on the House of Chiefs, while 
representatives of the numerous other, non-dominant tribes competed for the remaining 
seven seats in elections for the then 15-member body. Further, the Chieftainship Act of 
1933 defined &#8220;chief&#8221; and &#8220;tribe&#8221; by reference to the eight dominant Tswana tribes only.  
</p>
<p>11. The Constitution was amended in 2007 to revise the composition of the House of 
Chiefs, now known as the Ntlo ya Dikgosi. Additionally, after the Botswana High Court 
declared the Chieftainship Act unconstitutional for its discriminatory characteristics,2 that 
act was repealed and replaced by the Bogosi Act of 2008, which established a more tribally 
neutral framework for recognition of tribes, tribal areas and their respective chiefs. While 
the Government has expressed to the Special Rapporteur its position that the constitutional 
amendments, together with the Bogosi Act, now afford equal treatment to all tribes and 
ensure equitable representation, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned with some 
aspects of these reforms, a matter which is addressed in section IV (B) below.  
</p><p>12. Other laws still recognize Tswana tribes and tribal structures, without similar 
recognition of the smaller tribes and their respective political and social structures. For 
example, the Tribal Territories Act of 1968, which still provides part of the legal 
framework for indigenous land rights in Botswana (see paragraphs 40&#8211;44 below), names 
tribal territories after the major Tswana tribes. This legislation also named the Tswana 
chiefs as the custodians of these territories, though it did not confer ownership rights.  
</p>
<p>13. Tribal customary law, primarily based on oral tradition, has been incorporated into 
the legal framework of Botswana since independence. Under the Customary Law Act, tribal 
customary law is valid to the extent that it &#8220;is not incompatible with provisions of any 
written law or contrary to morality, humanity or natural justice&#8221;. Customary law is 
administered by all courts of Botswana, when applicable, in cases involving tribal 
members, including by customary courts operating under the authority of chiefs or 
headmen. These customary courts derive their authority from oral tradition as well as from 
the Customary Courts Act. Customary courts have been developed in connection with the 
<i>kgotla</i> system, which is a system for handling matters of concern to the tribe through 
community meetings, and which is based on Tswana custom.  
</p>
<p>14. Botswana is party to a number of United Nations treaties and to the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Furthermore, it voted in favour of adopting the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Botswana is not a party to the 
International Labour Organization Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries, 1989 (No. 169), although the Government expressed to the Special 
Rapporteur that it supports the general principles and objectives of the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The application of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>15. In voting in favour of the Declaration, the Government of Botswana has manifested 
its support for the Declaration&#8217;s call for affirmative and concerted measures to address the 
disadvantaged conditions of indigenous peoples in accordance with the human rights 
principles elaborated upon in that instrument. At the same time, the Government takes the 
position, as reiterated to the Special Rapporteur, that all people of Botswana &#8212; with the 
exception of some naturalized citizens &#8212; are indigenous to the country. However, the

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13968 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>specific relevance of the Declaration, as evident by its terms, and of the various United 
Nations programmes and mechanisms concerning indigenous peoples, including the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur, applies to those indigenous groups that are in non-
dominant positions and that have suffered and continue to suffer threats to their distinct 
identities and basic human rights in ways not felt by dominant sectors of society. Hence, in 
the present report the Special Rapporteur focuses, in the light of the standards articulated in 
the Declaration, on the concerns of non-dominant indigenous groups of Botswana that share 
in these characteristics. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur considers that the incorporation of tribal institutions and 
custom into the national legal system of Botswana provides a foundation for strengthening 
distinct indigenous identities and cultural patterns, in line with the Declaration. In 
particular, recognition of tribal authorities and customary law, within a framework of 
respect for fundamental human rights and gender equality, constitutes a good practice if 
that recognition is extended equally to all indigenous or tribal groups. Additionally, the 
House of Chiefs, or Ntlo ya Dikgosi, serves the important role of ensuring that tribal 
interests are considered at the highest levels of Government. While legal obstacles have 
impeded non-dominant tribes from achieving the same level of participation and 
representation in political life as dominant Tswana tribes, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
recent efforts of the State to address this complex issue through constitutional and 
legislative reform (see part II (B) above), although it appears that certain problems remain 
in this regard (see part IV (B) below).  
</p><p>17. The Special Rapporteur also notes and commends the Government of Botswana for 
its broader policies and initiatives oriented towards eliminating discrimination based on 
ethnic or tribal identity and towards building a society that is genuinely inclusive of all. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Remote Area Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts and commitment of the 
Government to provide all citizens with access to development programmes and to address 
the economic disadvantages faced by particular groups, such as the Basarwa. He also 
recognizes the challenges that exist in providing such services to indigenous communities, 
many of them nomadic or semi-nomadic, located in remote areas throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>19. The primary policy initiative currently in place to alleviate poverty and promote 
development is the Remote Area Development Programme. In 1975, the Government 
initiated the Basarwa Development Project, aimed at helping the Basarwa in particular 
&#8220;adapt to the fast evolving economy of Botswana&#8221;.3 In 1978, the project was decentralized 
and its focus expanded beyond the Basarwa to address the socio-economic conditions of 
other marginalized communities in the seven geographic districts: Central, Ghanzi, 
Kgalagadi, Kweneng, Kgatleng, North West, and Southern. At that time, the project 
became known as the Remote Area Development Programme. 
</p>

 Botswana, &#8220;Report of the Review of the Remote Area Development Programme&#8221; (Ministry of Local 
</p>
<p>Government, 19 December 2003), p. 7. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13968 
</p>
<p>20. Initially, the programme worked to combat poverty and promote development 
through the creation of &#8220;remote area settlements&#8221; and the relocation of remote area dwellers 
into these settlements in order to provide basic social services. The Special Rapporteur 
visited several of these settlements during his time in Botswana and addresses some of the 
issues associated with this initial development strategy in part IV (A) of the present report.  
</p><p>21. Over the past several years, the Government has evaluated and revised the Remote 
Area Development Programme, most recently in February 2009. According to the 
Government, the emphasis of the programme has shifted from the original resettlement and 
infrastructure development strategy to land distribution, employment opportunities, 
institution-building and leadership training. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to find, among the goals of the revised 
programme, that the Government &#8220;shall adopt a community-led development approach 
which aims to promote participatory processes and community participation in issues 
affecting their own development&#8221;.4 Also noteworthy is that the new policy acknowledges 
the need for affirmative measures for the benefit of communities that have faced 
&#8220;intractable disadvantages, either for logistical reasons, or because of long standing 
historical prejudice and subjugation by the dominant groups&#8221;.5 Such measures will be 
adopted across a variety of sectors to improve access to education, health, employment and 
economic development opportunities, and to socio-political institutions. 
</p>
<p>23. To some extent, the Government appears to be addressing concerns regarding access 
to land. Specifically, the 2003 review of the Remote Area Development Programme 
acknowledged the lack of sufficient access to land in the remote area settlements, 
attributing this problem to the allocation of surrounding land for cattle posts, ranches and 
wildlife management areas. The review also pointed to a lack of understanding of the 
procedures for obtaining land through the land boards, which were created in 1968 to 
administer and hold in trust all tribal land in Botswana. 
</p>
<p>24. In its 2009 revision of the programme, the Government proposed important 
measures to address this problem, stating that remote area communities would be given 
priority by land boards for land near their settlements and that consideration should be 
given to buying back tracts of land near the settlements. The revised Remote Area 
Development Programme policy further suggests that the Tribal Land Act be amended to 
include affirmative action measures that allow preferential allocation of nearby land to 
poorer people living in remote settlements, and that the Act should reserve a quota of 
positions on land boards for people from remote settlements.  
</p>
<p>25. The revised policy also states that programme officers should be trained to assist 
people from remote areas in submitting land applications. The Government has highlighted 
a number of important steps already in place to promote understanding of the land 
distribution system and related application processes. These initiatives include the 
introduction of help desks at the various land boards; clearly posted policies, procedures, 
and standards for land grant applications; and a number of outreach measures to explain 
operations and address questions and concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Areas of concern 
</b></p>
<p>26. Despite the noted positive developments, the Special Rapporteur heard persistent 
and consistent accounts of discontent from the Basarwa and Bakgalagadi communities he

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2

<p>GE.10-13968 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>visited. Several community members with whom he spoke, both in open meetings with 
government presence and in more private settings, acknowledged some positive aspects of 
government development initiatives. But, overwhelmingly, community members expressed 
sentiments of exclusion from government decision-making processes on matters directly 
affecting their lives, including in relation to development initiatives, and many alleged they 
were discriminated against because of their ethnic identities.  
</p>
<p>27. Community members complained that development programmes were not in fact 
bringing markedly improved living conditions for the great majority of the people in their 
communities and that in many cases they saw their living conditions deteriorating. Many 
expressed frustration over a lack of respect for their cultures and languages in the design 
and implementation of development programmes, including in areas of health, education 
and income generation. Concern was also expressed about lack of access to traditional 
lands and impediments to, or outright prohibition of, traditional hunter-gatherer activities 
for basic subsistence.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur understands that members of local communities may be 
prone to highlighting the continuing challenges they face and criticizing the Government 
for its shortcomings rather than reflecting on its successes, and that he was able to visit but 
a small fraction of the many communities of Basarwa and other non-dominant tribes in 
Botswana. Nonetheless, he was struck by the apparent sincerity and consistency of the 
accounts he heard, and by the fact that these accounts are reinforced by information and 
analysis provided by respected non-governmental actors in Botswana and other credible 
sources, including those associated with international institutions such as the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur perceives the expressions of discontent by the local 
community members with whom he visited to be associated with three underlying, 
interrelated issues: respect for cultural diversity/identity, political participation and 
consultation, and redress for historical wrongs. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Respect for cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p>30. Botswana is a culturally diverse country with several distinct tribes or ethnic groups 
that are indigenous to the African continent, and the National Policy on Culture (2001) 
articulates objectives for the preservation and development of the diverse cultures of 
Botswana. There is significant Government support, through a number of programmes, for 
preserving aesthetic and folkloric aspects, such as song, dance and crafts, of the distinctive 
cultures of non-dominant indigenous groups. However, the cultural practices of these non-
dominant groups that are related to leadership and decision-making structures, development 
and land-use patterns remain in significant respects unrecognized or undervalued. Indeed, 
Government officials repeatedly stated to the Special Rapporteur that the Government 
places a high priority on &#8220;nation-building&#8221;, which includes consolidating a single national 
identity over the identities of diverse groups, and they appeared sceptical of any suggestion 
of robust recognition of distinct indigenous identities.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Development programmes 
</b></p>
<p>31. Government development programmes, including those specifically for the benefit 
of non-dominant indigenous communities, require greater accommodation to diverse 
cultural identities. As already noted, a primary poverty reduction strategy of the Remote 
Area Development Programme was the resettlement of remote dwellers into &#8220;remote area 
settlements&#8221; in order to facilitate the provision of social services. This practice failed to 
recognize the distinct cultural and land-use patterns of many of the indigenous communities 
it was intended to aid. This strategy of relocation remains a source of concern, and residents </p>

to move from their traditional lands. As one informed source has observed, the relocation 
was not a &#8220;simple geographical movement of people&#8221;, but rather &#8220;a whole social 
transformation of a community that has depended on a certain environment from time 
immemorial&#8221;.6  
</p>
<p>32. The Basarwa have been particularly affected by a uniform approach to development 
that lacks sensitivity to diverse cultural patterns. They have traditionally maintained a 
hunter-gatherer subsistence way of life, which is in tension with Remote Area Development 
Programme initiatives to relocate them into settled communities in favour of a sedentary, 
agro-pastoralist lifestyle. As a result, many residents of remote area settlements remain 
dependent on Government handouts, which creates a feeling of despair and difficulty in 
maintaining a culturally appropriate and sustainable livelihood. Furthermore, it is evident 
that the lack of cultural adaptation of development programmes is impeding their ultimate 
success. 
</p>
<p>33. Many residents of remote area settlements have insufficient land to carry out basic 
subsistence activities, like gathering or grazing the cattle given to them under the Remote 
Area Development Programme. In Kaudwane, for example, residents stated that they have 
access only to small plots, and that there is insufficient land for hunting and gathering 
purposes or for raising livestock. Likewise, Mababe residents complained of insufficient 
land for cultivation and gathering of wild fruits, and stated that the restrictions that 
Government has imposed on their use of land prevent them from hunting or raising 
livestock.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Social services 
</b></p>
<p>34. Beyond the poverty reduction development initiatives, the design and delivery of 
social services, including in the areas of health and education, likewise require greater 
accommodation to diverse cultural practices and values.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Government 
over the difficulties posed in offering a health-care system that incorporates and respects 
both Western and traditional medicinal practices. Nonetheless, he highlights the need to 
enhance the understanding of and respect for traditional medicine, which continues to be 
practised among indigenous communities but remains largely excluded from the 
Government health system. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes the Government 
initiative to draft a traditional health practice bill in consultation with traditional health 
practitioners associations and international bodies such as the World Health Organization. 
As that initiative progresses, the Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of additionally 
consulting with community members themselves to address their respective needs and 
concerns.  
</p>
<p>36. Regarding education, the Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its 
commitment to ensuring universal access to education and notes the aspects of the national 
school curriculum and educational planning that call for an awareness of diverse cultures. 
However, interviews with parents and educators at the community level, as well as with 
officials of the Ministry of Education in the capital, indicate insufficient funding for 
education programmes targeted at marginalized indigenous groups and a lack of genuine 
cultural sensitivity in the development, design and implementation of education

<p>programmes. Government officials were unable to articulate to the Special Rapporteur 
precisely how culturally adapted educational programming is being implemented.  
</p>
<p>37. Apparent, instead, is an unavailability of mother-tongue education; insufficient and 
inadequate incorporation of the history, culture and current conditions of minority 
indigenous groups in schooling for the children of those groups; and a lack of trained 
teachers and school officials from non-dominant indigenous groups. In fact, in its 1994 
Revised National Policy on Education, the National Commission on Education 
recommended mother-tongue instruction for children in pre-primary schools, but the 
Ministry of Education did not accept this recommendation, noting that the proposed policy 
was contrary to the national language policy.7  
</p>
<p>38. The Government of Botswana has communicated to the Special Rapporteur that it 
acknowledges the need to train teachers to deliver mother-tongue education, and that it has 
now begun working towards the implementation of mother-tongue education programmes. 
While this represents an important initiative, the Special Rapporteur takes note that the 
Government still remains in the earliest stages of designing this programme. 
</p>
<p>39. Another concern is the hostelling system used to provide education in remote areas 
where teacher retention has been poor, which has resulted in the alienation of children from 
their culture and families. The Government has indicated that it is exploring various options 
aimed at attracting and retaining teachers in remote areas, which would minimize the need 
for the hostelling system. For example, in its revised Remote Area Development 
Programme, the Government expressed plans to encourage the construction and operation 
of two-teacher, multigrade schools in remote areas, a process already under way with 
regard to primary school education. Nevertheless, delivery of a culturally appropriate 
education system remains a challenge in Botswana.  
</p>
<p><b> 3 Land distribution 
</b></p>
<p>40. Land laws that were passed in the early years of the independence of Botswana 
continued to reflect the colonial land tenure system instituted by the British that specifically 
recognized Tswana interests in land over those of non-dominant groups. These laws, 
including the Tribal Territories Act of 1933 and the Tribal Land Act of 1968, are still in 
force today, as are the land boards that, as noted above, were created in 1968 to administer 
and hold in trust all tribal area lands in Botswana.  
</p>
<p>41. The Tribal Territories Act divides the tribal land in Botswana that is available for 
communal use into eight tribal territories named after the dominant Tswana tribes. While 
the Act does not confer ownership rights on the named tribes, members of minority tribes 
and civil society organizations highlighted the perception of the non-Tswana indigenous 
groups that they were being discriminated against because they were not receiving the same 
recognition as the dominant tribes.  
</p>
<p>42. Botswana does not have in place a clear or effective mechanism through which 
indigenous peoples can collectively seek the demarcation and titling of their lands on the 
basis of traditional patterns of land use and occupancy, nor is there a procedure for 
addressing historical grievances for lands lost in the past (see paragraphs 57&#8211;63 below). 
Instead, the land boards hold all tribal land in trust and issue leases on an individual or 
collective basis, presumably in a tribally neutral fashion. However, Tswana customary law 
has continued to dominate the land board processes, and as a result, the administration of

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2

<p><b>12</b> GE.10-13968 
</p>
<p>tribal land rights by the land boards raises concerns over the recognition of traditional land 
uses by non-dominant groups. 
</p>
<p>43. Specifically, it is reported that only land-use patterns consistent with agro-
pastoralism, and not with hunter-gatherer systems, are recognized in the system of granting 
leases. While many traditionally hunter-gatherer communities currently live more sedentary 
ways of life, members of these communities stated that they wished to continue hunting 
certain animals and gathering traditional fruits and other plants, subsistence activities that 
they would combine with raising goats and other small livestock. The Government asserts 
that such activities are permitted. But in fact they are severely restricted by licensing and 
wildlife management schemes, a concern that was expressed to the Special Rapporteur 
during his visit to the Mababe Wildlife Management Area.  
</p>
<p>44. Further, recent Government policy on State lands has focused on conservation and 
tourism efforts, and most State land is now categorized as national parks, wildlife 
management areas or game reserves. However, many indigenous groups, such as the 
Basarwa, Bakgalagadi and Hambukushu, were in fact living within the conservation areas, 
and were forced to leave their traditional lands once those were declared protected areas. 
This scenario is exemplified by the removal of Basarwa and Bakgalagadi communities 
from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, as discussed in part V below. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Need for affirmative measures to promote cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p>45. It is clear that the Government has taken strides to ensure that equality is extended to 
all citizens of Botswana. Yet Government practice has mostly adhered to a now highly 
questioned model of equality that stresses the formal equality of the individual at the 
expense of effective equality, which in a multicultural society requires close consideration 
of diverse group identities and, in the case of indigenous peoples, affirmation of their 
collective rights, including rights over lands in accordance with traditional patterns.   
</p>
<p>46. As recognized by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, to 
achieve equality in fact and compliance with the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which Botswana is a party, there 
must be due regard for cultural difference and special consideration for culturally 
distinctive minority and indigenous groups. Hence, in 2006 in its latest observations on 
Botswana, the Committee expressed concern that Botswana&#8217;s &#8220;objective to build a nation 
based on the principle of equality for all has been implemented in a way detrimental to the 
protection of ethnic and cultural diversity&#8221; (CERD/C/BWA/CO/16, para. 9). Thus the 
Committee, &#8220;recalling that the principle of non-discrimination requires that the cultural 
characteristics of ethnic groups be taken into consideration&#8221;, urged Botswana &#8220;to respect 
and protect the existence and cultural identity of all ethnic groups within its territory&#8221; and 
&#8220;to review its policy regarding indigenous peoples&#8221; (idem). 
</p><p>47. Respect for ethnic and cultural diversity is a core principle of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Upon the basis of this core principle, the 
Declaration addresses the concerns of indigenous peoples that are in some way 
marginalized or vulnerable in relation to other population sectors within a country. The 
Declaration calls upon States to take special measures, within the framework of respect for 
the political unity and territorial integrity of each State, to secure the collective and 
individual rights of these peoples in multiple areas touching upon all aspects of their 
cultural identities, including in development programmes, health and education, and access 
to lands and natural resources.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13968 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Participation and consultation 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Government has expressed a commitment to a system of political participation 
that is equally accessible to all and to ensure consultation with local communities in 
relation to decisions affecting them. However, there are a number of indications that 
existing mechanisms are in fact inadequate with regard to minority or non-dominant 
indigenous groups.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Participation in governance 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Constitution of Botswana recognizes the right of all citizens, regardless of tribal 
affiliation, to vote and participate in national political processes. However, it is apparent 
that, despite the formal status of equality enjoyed by all citizens in relation to the means of 
political participation, those citizens who are members of minority indigenous groups are 
themselves disproportionately absent from national and district-level representative bodies 
and government agencies. The Special Rapporteur heard reports, confirmed by Government 
officials, that due to various socio-economic factors and histories of marginalization, non-
dominant indigenous groups face particular challenges in participating in district-level 
governance processes, even in districts where their communities are numerically sizeable. 
</p>
<p>50. Governance at the level of local tribal and indigenous communities is through the 
system of <i>kgosi</i> (traditional chiefs) and <i>kgotla </i>meetings, a system with origins in Tswana 
custom that is recognized and regulated by the Bogosi Act. The <i>kgotla </i>is the meeting place 
for dispute resolution, as well as for discussions regarding matters of concern to the 
community, including development initiatives. While such institutions of local governance 
are appropriate to many communities, and to that extent are to be encouraged, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that they may fail to adequately accommodate to the cultural patterns and 
traditional leadership structures of non-Tswana peoples, such as the Basarwa, which are 
traditionally organized around a system of clans and elders.  
</p>
<p>51. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned over the process of 
selecting members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi (House of Chiefs). Notably, the Special 
Rapporteur heard concerns that despite the amendments to the Constitution, discussed in 
section II (B) above, the process for determining membership in the Ntlo ya Dikgosi still 
disadvantages non-dominant tribes and favours Tswana leadership. The constitutional 
amendments of 2007 increase the number of members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi but do not 
provide for each tribe to be represented by its own chief. Members are selected by 
geographic region and presidential appointment, through a complex system in which 
demographic factors and the distribution of chiefs at the tribal level ensure representation 
by a number of Tswana chiefs. Non-dominant indigenous groups are not likewise ensured 
that their chiefs are included in the Ntlo ya Dikgosi<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Consultation 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur also remains concerned about the participation of 
community members in decision-making related to development initiatives that have 
specific local effects on their lives and communities. The Government stresses that 
&#8220;<i>therisanyo</i>&#8221;, or consultation, is one of its key planning principles, with consultations 
taking place at the settlement or village level mainly through <i>kgotla</i>, or community, 
meetings. A complementary institution to the <i>kgotla </i>is the village development committee, 
which the Government describes as a vehicle for coordinating development activities at the 
village level. Additionally, the Government notes that consultations occur with and through 
a myriad of other relevant bodies, including land boards and district councils whose 
constituencies cover more than just particular communities or tribes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13968 
</p>
<p>53. However, at all the villages and settlements visited, the Special Rapporteur heard 
accounts of inadequate participation in development planning. The sentiment repeatedly 
expressed was that decisions are made by the Government at the national or district levels 
and that <i>kgotla </i>or other local community processes are usually at best opportunities to 
comment on development planning with little real influence in outcomes of that planning. 
In Basarwa communities, concerns were also raised that the consultation processes, like the 
<i>kgotla </i>system, do not always reflect their own traditional decision-making institutions.  
</p>
<p>54. Exemplifying the shortcomings of the current system, residents of Mababe stated 
that they were simply informed of the decision to place their traditional lands within the 
restrictive regime of a wildlife management area, and were not allowed to take part in that 
decision. Residents of West Hanahai complained that the village development committee 
did not, in fact, function as an effective vehicle for consultation, stating that in practice they 
were excluded from the dialogue between the committee and the Government, and that the 
committee failed to consult with community members on such issues as partitioning land 
and funding priorities.  
</p>
<p>55. The Government, in its 2003 review of the Remote Area Development Programme 
and its 2009 Revised Remote Area Development Programme, states that community 
organizations and leadership structures in remote communities are generally weak and 
lacking in capacity, with participation in development planning remaining low.8 The 
Special Rapporteur observed that, at least to some extent, such perception of a lack of skills 
at the local level contributes to a tendency for the Government to take control of project 
development with the intention that communities be persuaded to accept the initiatives. Yet, 
the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the Government&#8217;s apparent willingness to address 
these issues, as discussed in part III (B) above, and stresses the need to strengthen local 
capacity and institutions and ensure that mechanisms of consultation are appropriate to the 
relevant cultural patterns. 
</p>
<p>56. It is evident that particular indigenous groups remain underrepresented in the 
decision-making bodies in Botswana, and that development and other decisions affect these 
groups in ways that are unique to them or not felt by the general population. Hence, the 
normal avenues of political participation and consultation that are devised to apply to the 
general population are inadequate for these groups. In accordance with the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (arts. 19 and 32, inter alia), it is important 
that such underrepresented indigenous communities be consulted directly, through special 
procedures that accommodate to their own cultural patterns and institutions, in the making 
of decisions affecting them, with the objective of obtaining their free, prior and informed 
consent. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Historical grievances, in particular with regard to land 
</b></p>
<p>57. In the courses of history that accompany the development of many countries, 
especially those that have experienced European colonization and waves of migration, it is 
common for indigenous groups that are in the minority to have suffered injustices that leave 
them disadvantaged in the present. Botswana is such a country. In its 2009 Revised Remote 
Area Development Programme, the Government acknowledges that certain communities 
&#8220;find particular and intractable disadvantages, either for logistical reasons, or because of 
long standing historical prejudice and subjugation by the dominant groups&#8221;. Thus, the 
Government commits to &#8220;adopt affirmative action across a variety of sectors to improve 
their access to education, health, employment and economic development opportunities,

<p>GE.10-13968 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>and socio-political institutions, among others&#8221;.9 As already noted, the Remote Area 
Development Programme, an important initiative in this regard, has the potential to achieve 
positive results if it is adapted to embrace and conform to the cultural patterns of the groups 
it is intended to benefit. That programme, and other initiatives to address the disadvantages 
faced by particular groups, should extend to addressing a major cause of that disadvantage, 
which is associated with the historical prejudice and subjugation acknowledged by the 
Government: the historical dispossession of land.  
</p>
<p>58. By many accounts, the Basarwa have been especially affected over time by the 
expansion of majority tribes and non-indigenous farmers into the areas traditionally used 
and occupied by them, particularly in western Botswana. Dispossession in favour of white 
settlers and dominant tribes engaging in agro-pastoralism from colonial times continued, 
according to numerous sources, with the implementation of the Tribal Grazing Land Policy 
of 1975, as large tracts of land were allocated to cattle ranchers at the expense of the 
Basarwa. Under that policy, the Government re-zoned approximately 12 per cent of the 
tribal land identified in the Tribal Territories Act and allocated it to individual cattle 
ranchers, who received the exclusive lease rights to the grazing land.  
</p>
<p>59. Under the final version of the policy, no alternative lands were set aside for the 
people who had been living on the land. The World Bank has estimated that 28,000 people 
living in poor, rural areas of Botswana were displaced from the ranching areas created by 
the Tribal Grazing Land Policy. A settlement scheme was eventually established to move 
the Basarwa of the Ghanzi farms, who numbered over 4,000, to four settlements, including 
East and West Hanahai. Others continued to live and work as field hands or squatters at the 
cattle posts. Without recognized land rights, those dispossessed, such as the Basarwa 
people, were not compensated for the land taken. 
</p>
<p>60. While the Tribal Grazing Land Policy was aimed at better managing the country&#8217;s 
land resources and preventing land degradation resulting from the overgrazing of tribal 
lands, it failed to consider the hunter-gatherer subsistence way of life practised by those 
displaced. Thus, a residual effect of the policy was the loss of adequate access to the area&#8217;s 
natural resources needed for survival. The cattle farming resulted in the reduction of plant 
food in the area; the interference with game migration routes, reducing the number of large 
game available for hunting; and the depletion of water resources. 
</p>
<p>61. These historical injustices have put minority indigenous peoples, such as the 
Basarwa, at a significant disadvantage vis-&#224;-vis other tribes. While the Remote Area 
Development Programme seems to be aimed at addressing these disadvantages, the 
initiative in itself has had some profound negative impacts on the rights of indigenous 
peoples to their traditional lands in Botswana, given the Government&#8217;s strategy of 
relocating communities from remote areas, as discussed earlier (paras. 31&#8211;33 above). In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s initiative to now require the land 
boards to prioritize the lease applications of remote area settlers, an initiative that could 
potentially provide a measure of redress for the historical dispossession of land. 
</p>
<p>62. Highlighting international concern about the effects of historical dispossession of 
traditional lands, territories and resources of indigenous peoples, the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People calls on States to recognize and protect the 
land rights of indigenous peoples on the basis of their customary or traditional tenure (art. 
26). The Declaration further affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by 
means that can include restitution or, when that is not possible, just, fair and equitable 
compensation, for the lands, territories and resources unjustly taken from them (art. 28).

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-13968 
</p>
<p>63. These provisions flow from the Declaration&#8217;s fundamental purpose of addressing 
historical injustices and ongoing disadvantages suffered by indigenous peoples, and of 
promoting positive measures to ensure that the rights of vulnerable indigenous peoples are 
protected. In line with the Government&#8217;s acknowledgment of the need to address historical 
injustices and prejudice, the Government should take effective steps to provide redress for 
marginalized indigenous peoples, including with regard to the dispossession of lands and 
natural resources. 
</p>
<p><b> V. An emblematic case: the Central Kalahari Game Reserve 
</b>64. Representative of the difficulties faced by non-dominant indigenous peoples 
confronted by historical and ongoing patterns of marginalization, including with regard to 
Government development strategies, is the situation of those groups whose lives were 
drastically changed by the establishment of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The game 
reserve was established in 1961 to protect wildlife resources and to provide Basarwa living 
in the area with land on which to continue their hunter-gatherer way of life. At that time, 
there were approximately 3,000&#8211;4,000 people living in the game reserve, the majority who 
were Basarwa, and the rest Bakgalagadi. While hunting and gathering was generally not 
permitted in the game reserve, an exemption was made for people whose primary 
subsistence was derived from wild plants and animals. The lifestyle of the residents was 
viewed as consistent with the preservation of wildlife inside the game reserve.  
</p>
<p>65. Over time, the lifestyles of the Basarwa and Bakgalagadi residents of the game 
reserve changed with the drilling of boreholes to provide access to water and the 
Government&#8217;s establishment of a school and health post at !Xade under the Remote Area 
Development Programme, which encouraged an agro-pastoralist lifestyle and led to the 
keeping of some livestock within the reserve. 
</p>
<p>66. In 1985 the Government investigated the situation in the reserve and found that the 
communities were depleting the wildlife and natural resources, that the communities&#8217; 
lifestyles were no longer consistent with the objectives of the reserve, and that it was cost-
prohibitive to provide services within the reserve. On those grounds, the Government 
decided to relocate all people residing within the reserve to outside settlements. The 
Government maintains that the relocations were voluntary and only occurred after a series 
of consultations and public meetings that took place between 1986 and 1996. While it is 
clear that some residents consented to the relocation, it is equally clear that the consultation 
process was inadequate and that many of the residents were simply unwilling to relocate.  
</p>
<p>67. There are serious concerns about whether consent to relocation, when it was given, 
was in fact freely given. The Special Rapporteur received information that measures such 
as the termination of services inside the reserve, the dismantling of existing infrastructure, 
the confiscation of livestock, harassment and ill-treatment of some residents by police and 
wildlife officers, and hunting prohibitions were used as inducements to relocate. Some 
former inhabitants of the game reserve interviewed by the Special Rapporteur spoke of the 
Government&#8217;s termination of services to their communities in 2001 as one of the main 
factors in their decision to relocate. According to several sources, the Government 
prohibited hunting during the relocations and confiscated goats and other livestock, and 
then cut off the residents&#8217; water supply, terminated food rations, and told residents that they 
would be able to benefit from these services at the new settlements. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13968 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>68. With the exception of small groups of people, almost all inhabitants of the game 
reserve relocated between 1997 and 2001.10 On 31 January 2002, the Government ceased 
provision of basic and essential services to the Basarwa and Bakgalagadi people who 
remained in the game reserve. Additionally, the Government removed the pipe and capped 
the borehole that brought water to inhabitants of the reserve.  
</p>
<p>69. In February 2002, 243 Basarwa individuals who had lived in the reserve filed an 
urgent application with the High Court of Botswana, seeking an order declaring the 
termination of basic and essential services by the Government unlawful and 
unconstitutional, and declaring the Government&#8217;s obligation to restore these services and 
their access to the lands and resources within the reserve. They further sought an order 
declaring unlawful and unconstitutional the Government&#8217;s refusal to issue special game 
licences and its refusal to allow them to enter the game reserve unless they possess such a 
permit.  
</p>
<p>70. In December 2006, the High Court of Botswana in the case of <i>Roy Sesana and 
Others v. The Attorney General</i>11 held that the &#8220;Applicants were deprived of [possession of 
the land, which they lawfully occupied] by the Government forcibly or wrongly and 
without their consent&#8221;.12 Two of the three justices on the panel that decided the case 
highlighted conflicting and confusing statements and actions by the Government, in 
particular regarding the provision of services, which would indicate that the residents did 
not freely consent to the relocation.  
</p>
<p>71. Justice Dow highlighted the Government&#8217;s failure to take into consideration the 
social and political structures of the Basarwa, and to some extent the Bakgalagadi, which 
are in fact different from the social and political structures of Tswana groups, in the design 
of programmes and projects at the new settlements. Additionally, both Justice Dow and 
Justice Phumaphi referred to the reserve inhabitants&#8217; relative position of powerlessness, 
resulting from historical processes and general discrimination that has resulted in a number 
of Basarwa having low literacy levels and little to no political or economic clout. Finally, 
the justices concluded that even if residents had decided to relocate voluntarily, their 
consent could not be considered informed, based on evidence that the Government failed to 
adequately inform them about compensation or their right to return to the reserve after 
relocation. 
</p>
<p>72. The Government has stated that the decision of the High Court is being faithfully 
implemented and that all applicants in the <i>Sesana </i>case and some of their family members 
have been allowed to return without having to fulfil the requirement of obtaining entry 
permits. In the view of the Government, all others, including those who lived in the reserve 
at the time of the relocation but who were not applicants to the Court case, must obtain 
temporary entry permits. While allowing inhabitants of the reserve to make their own 
provisions for water, the Government has stated that it is not obligated to provide access to 
water in the reserve and that it will not permit the inhabitants to gain access to water 
through the use of the Government&#8217;s borehole. The Government also has affirmed that the 
prohibition of livestock in the reserve continues, and that the ordinary restrictions on 
hunting in the reserve still apply.13 Further, Government representatives explained to the 
Special Rapporteur that allowing even relatively small communities to live within the game

</p>
<p>reserve is incompatible with the conservation and wildlife management objectives of the 
reserve.  
</p>
<p>73. While the Government may or may not be following the order of the Court in the 
<i>Sesana</i> case in a technical sense, its position on who should be permitted to re-enter the 
reserve without obtaining entry permits, its restrictions on hunting and livestock possession 
and its denial of services to those currently living in the reserve do not appear to be in 
keeping with the spirit and underlying logic of the decision, nor with the relevant 
international human rights standards. The <i>Sesana </i>decision would seem to suggest that all 
former residents of the game reserve who were relocated should be permitted to return 
without having to obtain entry permits and should be able to subsist and maintain a 
dignified life within the reserve. In addition, the Government&#8217;s position that habitation of 
the reserve by the Basarwa and Bakgalagadi communities is incompatible with the 
conservation objectives and status of the reserve appears to be inconsistent with its decision 
to permit Gem Diamonds/Gope Exploration Company (Pty) Ltd. to conduct mining 
activities within the reserve, an operation that is planned to last several decades and could 
involve an influx of 500&#8211;1,200 people to the site, according to the mining company.  
</p>
<p>74. Some former inhabitants chose not to return to the reserve because of the lack of 
services. Those people currently in the reserve are struggling due to lack of water and social 
services and have asked to receive services at their communities within the reserve; even 
just the provision of water would significantly improve their current living conditions, and 
hence a number of them have commenced a new legal action to reactivate a water borehole 
in the reserve. Moreover, those living in the reserve stated that they want to be able to hunt 
and gather, and explained that these activities are important aspects of their culture. They 
also explained their deep sense of connection to the land in the reserve, based in significant 
part on their belief that their ancestors are present in those lands, and that they view the 
land as their own. This connection to the reserve lands was also evident among Basarwa 
and Bakgalagadi people that have been resettled at Kaudwane and New !Xade, who 
expressed a desire to return to the reserve despite the significant challenges that they had 
previously faced while living there.  
</p>
<p>75. The Government reports that it commenced in 2008 an initiative for a consultation 
process with residents of the affected communities, with a view towards resolving the 
issues that persist within and around the reserve, and that initial consultations have taken 
place in the settlements in and around the game reserve, paving the way towards more in-
depth discussion scheduled for early 2010. Close observers outside the Government, 
however, complain about the slow pace of the process and that meaningful talks have not 
yet taken place, due in large part to a lack of funding by the Government for the process.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Respect for cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Affirmative measures 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Botswana is a country rich with diverse indigenous cultural and tribal 
identities, including those of the non-Tswana indigenous groups that are a numerical 
minority and that have suffered marginalization in various aspects of life. The 
Government has already made significant efforts to celebrate and promote this 
cultural diversity through a number of important programmes, many articulated in 
its National Policy on Culture. Every effort should be made &#8212; by the Government, 
civil society, the media and the private sector &#8212; to continue and strengthen these 
efforts.</b>   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13968 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Government should strengthen and adopt new affirmative measures, 
consistent with universal human rights standards, to protect the rights of non-
dominant indigenous groups to retain and develop the various attributes of their 
distinctive cultural identities, particularly those related to land rights, approaches to 
development, and political and decision-making structures. All laws and Government 
programmes should be reviewed and reformed as needed to ensure that they do not 
discriminate against particular groups, but rather accommodate to and strengthen 
cultural diversity and adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Development programmes 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The 2009 Revised Remote Area Development Programme represents an 
important and positive policy shift in the approach to addressing economic and social 
disadvantage suffered by many non-dominant tribes in Botswana. In particular, 
stated Government intentions to enhance community participation in the development 
and implementation of the programme, to address land rights issues, and to engage in 
capacity-building at the local level are all significant and encouraging steps that 
represent a clear departure from the past policies of a uniform approach to 
development that in fact disadvantaged the intended beneficiaries of the programme.</b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>In addition to promoting development focused around an agro-pastoralist way 
of life, development programmes such as the Remote Area Development Programme 
should promote, in consultation with the affected communities, economic and other 
development activities that align with the culture of the targeted communities, 
including hunting and gathering activities.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>In the design and execution of development programmes, the special needs of 
indigenous women and children should be identified and given priority, and practices 
that discriminate against indigenous women should be targeted and eliminated.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Social services 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Government should incorporate, in consultation with the indigenous 
peoples, traditional medicinal practices in the provision of health-care services, 
through, inter alia, the education of health-care workers in traditional practices and 
beliefs as well as the recruitment and training of members of non-dominant tribes to 
serve in remote communities.</b>  
</p>
<p>82. <b>In the elaboration of the traditional health practice bill, the Government should 
expand its consultation process to include community members in order to 
incorporate into the legislation their respective needs and concerns.</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>The Government has begun taking important steps to comply with the 
recommendation of the National Commission on Education to incorporate instruction 
in mother-tongue language into the education system. This effort should be further 
promoted and strengthened, including through the allocation of resources to recruit 
and train native language speakers to serve in remote communities.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The Government should modify, in consultation with the affected indigenous 
peoples, its educational curriculum to better reflect the cultural diversity of Botswana, 
including the history, culture, identity and current situation of non-dominant tribes 
throughout the country.</b>  
</p>
<p>85. <b>While the hostel system has provided educational opportunities to residents of 
many underserved communities, the Government should pursue methods that do not 
require students to leave their homes and risk losing their cultural ties to their </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-13968 
</p>
<p><b>communities, such as establishing two-teacher schools in remote areas and providing 
transportation to and from schools.</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Land distribution 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Even though it does not specifically confer ownership rights, the Tribal 
Territories Act of 1933 should be reformed to eliminate references to dominant 
Tswana tribes. </b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The Government has adopted important measures to enhance community 
understanding of land board processes and standards. The respective land boards of 
each tribal area should seek to further clarify and make publicly available, including 
through the utilization of community education programmes, the process for 
submitting an application for a lease, including the basis upon which a land board will 
or will not issue such a lease.</b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>Certain indigenous groups continue to suffer from a lack of secure land tenure, 
including access to and use of their ancestral lands and resources, in part due to the 
non-recognition of these groups&#8217; customary land-use practices. In consultation with 
the affected indigenous peoples, the Government should seek to identify the lands 
traditionally used and occupied by these indigenous groups and incorporate into the 
land-board system a respect for and recognition of those groups&#8217; particular interests 
in such lands. In particular, a provision should be made for securing collective 
landholdings by communities in accordance with traditional land-use patterns.</b>  
</p>
<p>89. <b>Legislation and policy related to natural resource use and management, 
particularly that related to hunting and gathering rights and access to conservation 
areas, should be reviewed and reformed, in accordance with international human 
rights norms, to accommodate the traditional cultural patterns of non-dominant 
indigenous peoples, many of whom were displaced during the creation of conservation 
areas and continue to face exclusion from those areas.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation and consultation 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Indigenous peoples or tribes that are ethnically distinct from the majority 
Tswana tribes are underrepresented in legislative and administrative institutions at 
both the national and district levels. Affirmative measures should be further 
developed and implemented, in consultation with the affected peoples, to enhance 
representation by minority indigenous groups at all levels and in all institutions of 
government, including in administrative and legislative bodies at both the national 
and district levels.</b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>While recent constitutional and legislative reforms provide for greater 
participation by historically underrepresented groups in the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, the 
Government should continue working to ensure that these groups are in fact 
effectively represented in both that institution and in the National Assembly, with due 
regard to the traditional leadership structures and practices of all tribes in Botswana. </b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Local indigenous communities that are underrepresented in the political 
processes and government institutions have not been adequately consulted, in 
accordance with relevant international standards, in significant decisions that affect 
their lives and communities. The Government should work, in consultation with the 
indigenous peoples of Botswana, to develop and implement a comprehensive policy 
and corresponding procedure directed specifically at facilitating consultations with 
local communities on all issues that affect their particular rights and interests. This 
policy and procedure should be incorporated into law, and should, inter alia:</b>  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13968 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Recognize and respect the traditional decision-making structures and 
patterns of the distinct indigenous groups in Botswana, including those that differ 
from the <i>kgotla</i> system currently in place; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that local indigenous communities are genuine participants in all 
decisions affecting them, especially those decisions affecting the integrity of their 
cultures and the lands on which they survive; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that indigenous communities have adequate and full information 
about proposed decisions affecting them;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that important decisions about development priorities and 
projects that affect the lives, cultures or territories of indigenous communities that are 
underrepresented in the dominant political system are not taken without genuine, 
good faith efforts to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of those communities. </b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Historical grievances 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Particular indigenous groups have uniquely suffered historical injustices, 
including the dispossession of traditional lands, which has contributed to conditions of 
marginalization and a range of social ills.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>The Government has acknowledged many of these historical injustices and, 
notably, in its 2009 Revised Remote Area Development Programme, identified a 
number of measures to address these issues. The Government should further pursue 
the development of specific policies and programmes to provide redress for these 
historical injustices, including those recommended in the 2003 review of the Remote 
Area Development Programme, which aims to reorient that programme to address 
the underlying poverty issues and, in particular, land rights issues.</b>  
</p>
<p>95. <b>In addition to measures already in place, the Government should develop and 
implement a mechanism, in consultation with the affected indigenous groups, to 
thoroughly examine and provide redress for instances of land dispossession, in 
accordance with international standards for reparations and restitution of land.</b>  
</p>
<p>96. <b>The Government should reorient its policies and laws regarding land use, 
conservation and wildlife management to accommodate the subsistence needs and 
cultural practices of communities that have been dispossessed of access to lands or 
resources by policies and measures such as the Tribal Grazing Land Policy and the 
creation of conservation and wildlife management areas. </b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Central Kalahari Game Reserve 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The decision by the High Court of Botswana in the case of <i>Roy Sesana and 
Others v. The Attorney General</i>, concerning the removal of Basarwa and Bakgalagadi 
communities from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, highlights the failure of the 
Government to adequately consult with indigenous peoples in significant decisions 
affecting them and to respect their rights to traditional lands and resources. The 
Government should fully and faithfully implement the <i>Sesana</i> judgement and take 
additional remedial action in accordance with international standards relating to the 
removal of indigenous peoples from their traditional lands. Such remedial action 
should include, at a minimum, facilitating the return of all those removed from the 
reserve who wish to do so, allowing them to engage in subsistence hunting and 
gathering in accordance with traditional practices, and providing them the same </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>government services available to people of Botswana elsewhere, including, most 
immediately, access to water.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>Indigenous people who have remained or returned to the reserve face harsh 
and dangerous conditions due to a lack of access to water, a situation that could be 
easily remedied by reactivating the boreholes in the reserve. The Government should 
reactivate the boreholes or otherwise secure access to water for inhabitants of the 
reserve as a matter of urgent priority.</b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>The Government has taken steps to negotiate with relevant stakeholders to 
resolve the situation of the people removed from or still living in the Central Kalahari 
Game Reserve. However, further efforts in this regard are required. The Government 
should work to ensure the effective, direct participation in the negotiations of all 
affected indigenous communities and allow them to be assisted in the negotiations by 
legal counsel or to receive other technical support available to them if they so choose. 
Additionally, the Government should provide adequate financial and logistical 
support to ensure the effective participation of the stakeholder indigenous 
communities.</b>  
</p>
<p><b> E. United Nations system in Botswana 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>All United Nations programmes and agencies with projects in Botswana should 
incorporate into their project planning and execution full consideration, as applicable, 
of the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and the recommendations in the present report.</b>
