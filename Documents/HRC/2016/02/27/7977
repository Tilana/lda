<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment undertook a visit to Morocco from 15 to 22 September 2012. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government for extending 
an invitation to visit the country, which illustrated the willingness to open Morocco to 
independent and objective scrutiny of its human rights situation. 
 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the effort made by the authorities to address the 
legacy of past abuses during the &#8220;years of lead&#8221; through the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission, and in general the development of an emerging culture of human rights in 
Morocco. However, he notes that torture and ill-treatment still occur. He finds that the 
practice of cruel treatment persists in ordinary criminal cases, and when there are highly

any political view concerning the present or future status of the Non-Self-Governing 
Territory of Western Sahara. The territory is subject to the right to self-determination in 
conformity with the principles contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 
1541 (XV).

<p>charged events, such as a perceived threat to national security, terrorism or large 
demonstrations, there is a corresponding increase in acts of torture and ill-treatment during 
the detention and arrest process. Although the mistreatment of detainees appears to be 
essentially inflicted in the initial period of detention, situations of mistreatment in later 
stages of detention were also detected. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also notes the apparent absence of prompt and thorough 
investigations into all cases of torture and ill-treatment, prosecution of the perpetrators, and 
the provision of effective remedies and reparations, including rehabilitation services, for all 
victims of torture and ill-treatment. In this context he stresses the fact that the Moroccan 
forensic medical system should be urgently reviewed and changed, as the present system 
does not guarantee the detection, documentation and correct forensic assessment of any 
alleged situations of torture and mistreatment; according to the Special Rapporteur, this 
may be one of the reasons for the non-application of the exclusionary rule with regard to 
evidence obtained under torture. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes that conditions in most prisons are still alarming, due 
to overcrowding, cases of ill-treatment and abusive disciplinary measures, unsanitary 
conditions, inadequate food and limited access to medical care. He welcomes the efforts 
made by the Government to increase the visits to places of detention, notably by the 
National Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur calls upon the international community to assist Morocco in 
its fight against torture and ill-treatment by providing financial and technical support.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, conducted a visit to Morocco from 15 to 22 September 
2012, at the invitation of the Government. He also visited La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, on 17 
and 18 September 2012.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, the 
Interior and Health; the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration 
and the Office of the Crown Prosecutor-General before the Court of Cassation. He also met 
with representatives of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Department of Criminal 
Affairs and Pardons, the General Prosecution at the Court of Cassation, and the Supreme 
Institute of Magistracy; representatives of the General Directorate of National Security; the 
Ministry in Charge of Relations between Parliament and Civil Society; the Delegate and 
personnel of the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights and the President and 
members of the National Human Rights Council (CNDH), regional offices of CNDH and 
former members of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. He also met with 
representatives of United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and victims of 
torture and their relatives.  
</p>
<p>3. In La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, the Special Rapporteur met with the region&#8217;s &#8220;Wali&#8221; 
and representatives of the Ministries of Health, Justice and Liberties, Youth and Sports, the 
General Directorate of National Security, the Royal Gendarmerie, the General Delegation 
for Prison Administration and Reintegration and the regional commission of CNDH. In 
addition he met with representatives of the Sahrawi population, representatives of civil 
society organizations and victims of torture and their relatives. He also met with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General, Head of the United Nations Mission for the 
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).  
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights for 
facilitating his visit and expresses his appreciation to the Government for providing him 
with unimpeded access to all detention facilities in accordance with the terms of reference 
for fact-finding missions by special rapporteurs (E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V).  
5. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government on 22 
September 2012, at the conclusion of his visit, and on 23 November the Government 
provided comments on the end of mission statement. The Special Rapporteur shared an 
advance version of the report and on 19 February 2013 the Government provided 
comments, which were taken into consideration before the report was finalized.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. At the international level 
</b></p>
<p>6. Morocco is a party to the majority of United Nations human rights treaties 
prohibiting torture and ill-treatment, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional 
Protocol thereto, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Women and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto. 
Morocco has approved a law of accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture, but has not yet deposited its instrument of ratification.  
</p>
<p>7. The State has signed but not ratified the Rome Statute for the International Criminal 
Court and is party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide.  
</p>
<p><b> B. At the national level 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Constitutional and legislative provisions  
</b></p>
<p>8. Article 22 of the new Constitution of July 2011 stipulates that everyone shall have 
the right to physical and moral integrity which shall not be undermined under any 
circumstances by any person, private or public; that no one shall inflict upon another, under 
any pretext whatsoever, any cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which undermines their 
dignity; and that the practice of any form of torture, by anyone, is a crime punishable by 
law. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the introduction of these principles into the 
Constitution and the demonstrated will of the authorities to accord them primacy. 
</p>
<p>9. The Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure criminalized torture before 
</p><p>2011. Act No. 43-04 amending and supplementing the Criminal Code of 1962 was adopted 
on 14 February 2006. The definition of torture in article 231-1 of the Criminal Code defines 
torture as follows: &#8220;any act, committed intentionally by a public official or someone acting 
at his behest or with his express or tacit consent, by which acute physical or mental pain is 
inflicted on a person in order to intimidate him or her, or to pressure that person, or 
someone else, to obtain information or indications, or confessions; to punish that person for 
an act that he or she, or a third person has committed or is suspected to have committed, or 
when such pain or suffering is inflicted for any other reason based on any type of 
discrimination. This term does not cover the pain or suffering relating only to legal 
sanctions or caused by such sanctions or that is inherent to such sanctions&#8221;. Articles 231-2 
to 231-8 of the Criminal Code foresee sanctions for the act of torture, including prison 
sentences of 5 to 30 years, depending on the gravity of the offence. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that further amendments to the definition of 
torture are needed to bring the offence into line with international human rights law. He 
acknowledges that the definition contained in article 231-1 of the Criminal Code 
encompasses the main elements of article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, but notes that it does not cover 
complicity or explicit or tacit consent on the part of law enforcement or security personnel 
or any other person acting in an official capacity. By its terms, this article does not 
contemplate penalties for officials who consent to or cover up instances of torture. 
Although such forms of participation may be adequately contemplated elsewhere in 
Moroccan law, given the gravity of torture it would be preferable for this norm to explicitly 
contemplate and criminalize the commission of torture by means of other persons.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Assessment of the situation 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur perceives the emergence of a culture of human rights and 
the political will among the various authorities, in particular the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights, to build up an institutional culture 
that prohibits and prevents torture and ill-treatment.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made between 2003 and 2005 by the 
transitional justice mechanism, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, to investigate 
the gross, large-scale and systematic human rights violations that took place in Morocco 
between 1956 and 1999 (a period that Moroccans call &#8220;the years of lead&#8221;), including many 
cases of torture and ill-treatment. However, he notes that not all the victims or families of 
victims have received compensation and that in some cases the compensation awarded has 
been neither equitably distributed nor adequate or effective. In addition, as also noted by 
the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the work of the 
Commission has not broken the cycle of de facto impunity of the perpetrators of violations 
of the Convention committed during that period, since to date none of them has been 
prosecuted.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Practice of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>13. The situation on the ground regarding the practice of torture has improved since the 
&#8220;years of lead&#8221;. However, the Special Rapporteur received credible testimonies of undue 
physical and mental pressure exerted on detainees in the course of interrogations in 
ordinary criminal cases and, in particular, cases involving State security. This was largely 
corroborated by forensic expertise which indicated that the mistreatment inflicted during 
that phase of detention was normally of short duration, consisting mainly of physical 
trauma caused by punches, kicks, slapping and, occasionally, blows with objects, and 
verbal insults and threats. In some cases detainees complained of more severe physical and 
torture and mistreatment, including <i>falaqa</i> (beating the soles of the feet with a stick), 
shocks in the testicles, anal insertion of foreign bodies, waterboarding, etc.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Cases involving allegations of terrorism or threats against national security  
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about several testimonies of torture and 
ill-treatment in cases involving allegations of terrorism or threats against national security. 
In these cases a systematic pattern of acts of torture and ill-treatment during the detention 
and arrest process can be detected. 
</p>
<p>15. In such cases, it appears that suspects are often not officially registered, that they are 
held for weeks without being brought before a judge and without judicial oversight, and 
that families are not notified until such time as the suspects are transferred to police custody 
in order to sign confessions. It was reported that in many cases victims are then transferred 
to a police station where a preliminary investigation is opened, dated from the transfer to 
avoid exceeding the limits placed on the custody period. 
</p>
<p>16. In addition, the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03) of 2003 extends the time limits on 
custody to up to 96 hours, renewable twice. This means that detainees may be held for up to 
12 days upon written consent from the prosecution before being brought before the 
investigative judge. In addition, communication with a lawyer is possible only 48 hours 
after the renewal of custody is granted. Hence suspects may be deprived of all contact with 
the outside world for six days before being allowed to communicate for half an hour with a 
lawyer and, even then, under the control of a police officer (art. 66, para. 10, of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure). The Special Rapporteur notes that these provisions restricting crucial 
safeguards, such as early contact with counsel, significantly increase the risk of torture.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur examined numerous cases that occurred in the aftermath of 
the attacks in Casablanca of 16 May 2003, where thousands of suspects were arrested, often 
by officials of the National Surveillance General Directorate (DST), and held 
incommunicado or at unknown places of detention. He also heard testimonies of terrorism 
suspects recently arrested. It appears that currently torture is widely used to extract </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>confessions in cases involving national security. These practices include beating with sticks 
and hoses, hanging for long periods, beating on the soles of the feet (falaqa), slapping the 
face and particularly the ears, kicking, exposure to extreme temperatures, sexual assault and 
the threat of sexual assault. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes that, although in May 2011 delegations from 
Parliament and CNDH reported finding no evidence of a detention facility located at the 
DST headquarters in T&#233;mara, testimonies indicate that persons are detained 
incommunicado at this and other locations. While article 23 of the Constitution explicitly 
states that secret or arbitrary detention and forced disappearances are crimes of the utmost 
seriousness, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about past and present practices of 
incommunicado detention. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur found that detainees convicted for terrorism-related offences 
continue to be subjected to torture and ill-treatment while serving their sentences. Most of 
these prisoners are held in the Sal&#233; 1 and Sal&#233; 2 prisons and the Tulal Prison in Mekn&#232;s. 
Numerous reports were received of sexual assault and the threat of further reprisals if 
complaints were filed, in particular after the uprising in the Sal&#233; 2 prison on 16 May 2011. 
In this context it is also reported that solitary confinement is excessively used as a 
disciplinary measure, for periods ranging from several days to several weeks.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Excessive use of force during demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur received credible information regarding excessive use of 
force by law enforcement officials during the protests in Rabat and several other cities in 
February and March 2011 (referred to as the 20 February Movement) calling for 
constitutional reform and democracy. Security forces were reported to have attacked 
protestors on many occasions, leading to at least one death and many injuries. 
</p><p>21. The Special Rapporteur received similar testimonies of excessive use of force during 
demonstrations that referred to the events on 15 May 2012 in Rabat, Fez, Tangiers and 
T&#233;mara, where demonstrators demanded the closure of the alleged secret detention centre in 
T&#233;mara. Furthermore, he received information that on 29 May 2012, a demonstration 
organized in the town of Safi was violently dispersed by the security forces. One protester 
was severely beaten by police officers and died from his injuries on 2 June 2011.  
22. The Government explained that most of the above-mentioned demonstrations had 
not been authorized and so had been legitimately dispersed, but the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that excessive use of force is prohibited under international law and that law 
enforcement officials, in carrying out their duties, are to apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms. Depending on the seriousness of the pain and 
suffering inflicted, excessive use of force may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or even torture.   
</p>
<p>23. In addition, the Special Rapporteur examined cases of violence against protestors 
after arrest, including beatings carried out during transfer to police stations and during 
interrogation and the coercion into confessions which later had been used before the courts 
to secure a conviction and prison sentence.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur received information about severe beating and acts of sexual 
violence against sub-Saharan migrants who attempt to transit through northern Morocco by 
sea or through Ceuta and Melilla en route to Europe every year. The Special Rapporteur 
received evidence that suggested a pattern of systematic abuse of sub-Saharan migrants, 
involving beatings with sticks, stones or other implements, sexual assault or the threat of 
sexual assault and other forms of ill-treatment, such as being tied with ropes, burned with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>cigarette lighters and urinated upon. In addition he heard that afterwards victims are 
dumped in forest areas or ravines or they escape to those places, far from assistance.   
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about information received regarding 
illegal and collective expulsions of hundreds of migrants to Algeria and Mauritania, where 
they are allegedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including by being abandoned in 
no-man&#8217;s land without further assistance, most frequently near Oujda. Other testimonies 
suggested that the principle of non-refoulement of persons at risk of torture has not been 
respected by the Moroccan authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Safeguards and prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to lawyers  
</b></p>
<p>26. Article 23 of the new Constitution provides that a person in custody must benefit, as 
soon as possible, from legal assistance and the possibility to communicate with relatives, in 
conformity with the law. The Code of Criminal Procedure allows access to a lawyer after 
the arrest, upon the authorization of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, during the first 24 hours for 30 
minutes and in the presence of an investigator. Upon request of the investigator the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office can delay contact with a lawyer for another 12 hours after the first 24 
hours in custody. Testimonies from lawyers indicate that, in practice, they are often denied 
access beyond the legal time frame. It appears that in the majority of cases, lawyers meet 
their clients only at the first hearing before the judge. In the procedure provided for under 
the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03), police custody can last for three consecutive periods of 
96 hours and during that time there is no meaningful right to a lawyer except for the 
monitored half-hour interview that can occur, at the earliest, at the halfway point of those 
12 days. In addition, there is an evident risk that even those terms can easily be violated 
simply by delaying the registration of the arrest.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Evidence obtained under torture, and lack of ex officio investigations  
</b></p>
<p>27. Article 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that a confession, like any 
other evidence, is subject to the discretion of the judge and that any confession obtained by 
torture is inadmissible. However, the Special Rapporteur learned that courts and 
prosecutors do not comply with their obligation to initiate an ex officio investigation 
whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that a confession has been obtained 
through the use of torture and ill-treatment, or to order an immediate and independent 
medical examination (see arts. 74 (8) and 135 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure) if 
they suspect that the detainee has been subjected to ill-treatment. It appears that judges are 
willing to admit confessions without attempting to corroborate the confession with other 
evidence, even if the person recants before the judge and claims to have been tortured. In 
addition, testimonies received indicate that many cases that are submitted to the courts are 
based solely on confessions by the accused, in the absence of any material evidence. This 
creates conditions that encourage torture and ill-treatment of suspects. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Lack of effective investigation of torture allegations  
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, often, when defendants try to prove their 
injuries in court, the judge reacts to these allegations by questioning the credibility of 
defendants who did not raise the matter at the earliest opportunity&#8212;emerging from police 
custody and appearing for the first time before the prosecutor or the investigating judge. 
Upon request, the Government provided statistics on the number of investigations against 
law enforcement officials, including members of the Royal Gendarmerie, judicial police 
and customs during the period 2009 to 2012. The numbers provided by the Government </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>indicate that in those four years 220 law enforcement officials were investigated for acts of 
violence, including other forms of abuse of power. Although the statistics do not allow for 
further assessment due to lack of information, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern 
that it appears that no persons have been prosecuted or convicted under article 231-1 of the 
Criminal Code. Officials who were prosecuted were charged with battery or assault, but not 
torture. Most of the 220 officials are still under investigation or have been found not guilty. 
Those convicted received minor sentences, such as a fine or suspension, and only a few 
received a sentence.   
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes that there is an apparent absence of convictions under 
article 231-1 of the Criminal Code. He concludes that given the failure to impose genuine 
disciplinary measures or to bring any significant number of cases against State officials 
accused of torture, an atmosphere of impunity seems to exist with regard to recent years as 
well as with regard to the gross, large-scale human rights violations that took place between 
1956 and 1999.  
</p>
<p>30. In addition, it is imperative for Morocco to prosecute public officials who order, 
condone or cover up torture in flagrant abuse of their superior authority, including 
situations where they knew or ought to have known that the crime of torture was about to 
be, was being or had been committed. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Burden of proof and independent medical examinations 
</b></p>
<p>31. When the offence on trial involves a crime that carries a penalty of five or more 
years in prison, the Code of Criminal Procedure provides no special instructions on how the 
court is to treat police statements: it is presumed that such statements are evidence like any 
other, to be considered on their merits. However, in the case of infractions that occasion a 
sentence of less than five years, the rules of evidence are different. Under article 290 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, the court is to deem a statement prepared by the judicial 
police as trustworthy unless the defendant can demonstrate that it is not. This presumption 
places an unfair burden of proof on the defendant to disprove the truthfulness of a statement 
that the police have written up and attributed to him with no other witnesses present, and 
gives the court a basis for not going beyond a perfunctory inquiry into the defendant&#8217;s 
claim of torture or ill-treatment, unless he has clear signs of torture on his body. 
</p>
<p>32. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the public statement 
made by the Minister of Justice and Liberties on 27 September 2012, after the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, declaring his will to launch a new project to video record all statements 
made to the police during the investigation and interrogation period. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that this measure is not sufficient to prevent torture or mistreatment. He 
reiterates the fact that one of the fundamental safeguards against torture remains the right of 
access by lawyers at all stages of the investigation process and particularly from the 
moment of actual apprehension. 
</p>
<p>33. Government statistics indicate that in 2011 only 33 medical examinations have been 
ordered (20 by the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and 13 by investigative judges), and in 2010 
the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the investigative judges ordered 21 and 16 medical 
examinations, respectively. It is not clear, however, if this small number of medical 
examinations were all related to torture allegations.  
</p>
<p>34. Furthermore there is no systematic approach or randomly undertaken forensic 
assessment at the time of detention and release. There is an urgent need to establish 
mechanisms that can guarantee qualified, impartial and independent forensic examination 
of detainees that does not depend only on the request of the police or legal authority. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur reviewed a sample of medical certificates, and notes with 
concern that the majority of medical assessments that are made for forensic purposes are </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>performed not by forensic medical experts but by medical clinicians included in the court 
lists of &#8220;experts&#8221;. These individuals do not have any specific training or competence in 
forensic medicine. The medical reports produced after allegations of torture and ill-
treatment are of very poor quality, not in accordance with the minimum international 
standards for clinical forensic assessment of victims and not acceptable as forensic 
evidence. Neither prison health-care staff nor the clinicians who act as court &#8220;experts&#8221; have 
specific training in assessing, interpreting and documenting torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes that this may be one of the reasons for the non-
application of the exclusionary rule with regard to evidence obtained under torture. Even in 
cases where a prosecutor or a judge orders a medical examination, the poor quality of 
medical and forensic reports currently provide little assistance to the prosecutors and judges 
in their decision-making process. The confession or declaration thus remains on the record 
and no serious effort is made to investigate, prosecute and punish perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Monitoring and inspection of places of detention  
</b></p>
<p>37. Police stations are placed by law under the effective control of the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The officers in charge of the police stations visited by the Special 
Rapporteur confirmed regular visits from the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. However, no 
statistics on the frequency of such visits were received. 
</p>
<p>38. Article 249 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that the President of the 
Criminal Chamber or his representative must visit penal institutions at least once every 
three months to take stock of the situation of prisoners in preventive detention and the 
justification for their detention, giving him the possibility to make direct recommendations 
to the examining judge in this regard. However, as noted in the CNDH report of October 
2012, most facilities were not visited by the President of the Criminal Chamber in 2011. 
Also, the visits by the commissions set forth in articles 620 and 621 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure take place only on an irregular basis. 
</p>
<p>39. Nevertheless, there is an increase in visits to places of detention. The founding law 
of CNDH specifically mandates it to visit places of detention and other places of 
deprivation of liberty to help improve conditions of detention. The access of CNDH to 
places of detention and the post-visit report, as well as the work to ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, are important steps towards establishing an effective monitoring 
mechanism in Morocco. However, under article 10 of the implementing decree for Act No. 
23/98, non-governmental organizations have only a very limited scope of activities 
conditioned by the approval of the General Delegation of Prison Administration and 
Reintegration. This minimizes the ability of these associations to play a role in promoting a 
culture of human rights within the penal institutions and have their observations and 
recommendations considered regarding improvements to the prisoners&#8217; regime, physical 
environment and reintegration.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</b></p>
<p>40. When Morocco publicly announced its intention to ratify the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture as a priority in March 2007, this was supported by CNDH 
and the national human rights organizations. On 1 and 12 November 2012 the Government 
Council and the Council of Ministers, respectively, approved the bill on accession to the 
Optional Protocol. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s assurances of 
speedy ratification of the Optional Protocol, but notes that the instrument of accession has 
not been deposited.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>41. During the visit, CNDH indicated that it would be ready to act as the national 
preventive mechanism foreseen in article 17 of the Optional Protocol, but would support a 
comprehensive process of consultation with other actors prior to any decision.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>42. Since 2008, the overall responsibility for correctional facilities in Morocco, the 
implementation of judicial decisions and the execution of sentences lies with the General 
Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration, a governmental body reporting 
directly to the Head of Government. The main national legal instrument regulating prison 
conditions and treatment of prisoners is the Prisons Act (No. 23/98) of 1999. Morocco has 
73 detention facilities, including 3 central prisons for long-term imprisonment and life 
sentences, and 58 local prisons for pretrial and short-term detainees.   
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur visited a number of facilities of deprivation of liberty and 
detention centres in Rabat, Kenitra, Skhirat-T&#233;mara and Casablanca, including police and 
Royal Gendarmerie stations; pretrial detention facilities; prisons, including a death-row 
section, and sections for juveniles and for women; one temporary detention facility for 
irregular migrants and asylum seekers; one juvenile correctional facility; and one 
psychiatric institution. He notes that there was obvious readiness and preparation for his 
visit, including the relocation of certain prisoners. While this may have detracted from his 
ability to see these places more spontaneously, he appreciates the impressive effort 
undertaken to invest in the upgrading and renovation of these facilities, which will 
hopefully have longer term positive benefits.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur observed that there were a high number of doctors and 
nurses present during his inspections of detention facilities, but independent medical care is 
not provided. The facilities visited suffer from a shortage of infirmary equipment, 
particularly in relation to dental care, which was insufficient or non-existent. Psychiatric 
medical care was also insufficient or even non-existent. However, the Special Rapporteur 
did not detect situations of detainees with infectious contagious diseases, namely 
tuberculosis, living side by side with all the others.  
</p>
<p>45. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the budget for nutrition 
service in detention facilities was 331 million dirhams (DH) in 2012. He notes that this 
represents a three-fold increase of the budget from 2008 (DH 108 million). In this context, 
the Government explained that the control lies with the local office of hygiene. However, 
no independent control exists over the quantity and quality of the food. It appears that 
inmates rely heavily on their families in order to avoid malnutrition. The kitchen facilities 
visited were clean but poorly equipped and not sufficiently maintained to provide inmates 
with balanced and healthy meals. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Overcrowding 
</b></p>
<p>46. The authorities openly acknowledged that overcrowding was an issue that needed to 
be addressed. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, as of August 2012, 
there was a prison population of 69,054 detainees (comprising both convicted and pretrial 
detainees, who are not always kept separate, and including 1,613 female prisoners). There 
have been conflicting figures as to the total capacity in the prison system. The General 
Delegation informed the Special Rapporteur that it was 48,000-50,000, indicating an 
overcrowding rate of about 38 per cent, while CNDH estimates it to be 37,000, which 
would put the overcrowding rate at closer to 86 per cent. These figures may even 
underestimate the real rate of overcrowding because the rates are based on the number of 
beds available in relation to the actual population. In some of the prisons, the beds </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>themselves were so close together that, even at full capacity or somewhat below capacity, 
living conditions would still be overcrowded. The Special Rapporteur finds that a better 
indication of overcrowding would be to divide total inhabitable capacity by the size of the 
population (69,054). He understands that figure would be between 1.5 and 3 cubic metres 
per inmate, not counting common areas and toilets and showers. 
</p>
<p>47. The high rate of overcrowding was confirmed by the Special Rapporteur. In the 
facilities he visited, the universally accepted standards were not met. Inmates live in highly 
overcrowded cells and in some cases without beds due to the high number of inmates per 
cell and with mostly poor ventilation. Overcrowding inevitably leads to serious violations, 
such as denial of or insufficient access to medical care, nutrition, sanitation, security and 
rehabilitation services. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Torture and ill-treatment in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>48. The majority of the victims examined in the prisons visited denied ever being 
subjected to any kind of torture or degrading treatment inside prison establishments. Also, 
the allegations received usually pointed to a small number of staff committing these 
violations&#8212;the majority of the penitentiary staff is not involved in such violations.  
</p><p>49. In several of the forensic medical examinations conducted, physical sequelae of 
traumatic injuries were visible and compatible with the allegations made, but not, in the 
majority of the situations, diagnostic of torture or ill-treatment. However, the consistency 
and coherence of the histories and descriptions given by numerous victims, and the 
coherence of the physical consequences suffered post-trauma give credibility to the 
allegations of torture or ill-treatment. The most frequent and consistent testimonies 
concerned prisoners serving sentences relating to terrorism and members of Islamist 
groups, all of whom are particularly targeted for such abuse. These cases are also 
characterized by failure to investigate the prisoner&#8217;s complaints.  
</p>
<p>50. Upon request, some of the prison authorities provided information about the 
application of and procedures for disciplinary measures. However, the oversight of such 
measures, in particular the use of solitary confinement as punishment, and the applicable 
complaint mechanisms remain unclear. Testimonies indicate that solitary confinement is 
widely used as a disciplinary measure, and lasts from three days up to several weeks 
(detainees usually referred to the &#8220;black hole&#8221;). Inquires revealed that isolation is the 
primary, and often only, disciplinary measure applied, without resort to less harmful and 
more progressive disciplinary steps of an incremental nature, such as temporary denial of 
some benefits. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Inmates serving life imprisonment/death row inmates 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur takes note that since 1993 there has been a de facto 
moratorium on the enforcement of the death penalty. He welcomes the Government&#8217;s 
decision to impose a moratorium on executions and its announced intention to abolish the 
death penalty. The Government reported that as of August 2012 there were 110 prisoners 
sentenced to death (including two women) and 662 inmates serving life imprisonment. 
Most of these inmates are detained in Kenitra Central Prison, which the Special Rapporteur 
visited.  
</p>
<p>52. The prison regime and physical conditions are especially harsh for those on death 
row or serving life sentences compared to those of the general prison population. The 
Special Rapporteur observed that inmates generally depended heavily on their families to 
provide food and medication, which is an economic hardship that particularly affects 
families of individuals serving indefinite or lengthy sentences. Also, family visits are, in 
practice, limited due to the distance many families live from those serving lengthy </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>sentences. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about harsh conditions imposed on 
death row inmates due to an event several years ago that led to the death of a prison guard 
in Kenitra Central Prison. In particular, he observed the denial of access to books, 
newspapers, exercise, education, employment or any other type of prison activities. The 
Special Rapporteur considers such long-term collective punishment of all inmates serving 
life sentences excessive and amounting to collective ill-treatment. Furthermore, during the 
interviews of those on death row, the indefinite detention and the uncertainty about possible 
execution made it clear to the Special Rapporteur that the &#8220;death row phenomenon&#8221; is 
indeed a serious threat to the mental health of these detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Juveniles in conflict with the law and child protection 
</b>53. The Moroccan criminal legislation regarding juveniles provides for a juvenile 
system which operates with specially trained prosecutors and judges. However, in practice 
the Special Rapporteur heard that any public prosecutor may be responsible for a juvenile 
case.  
</p>
<p>54. Article 460 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judicial police 
officer in charge of juveniles may detain the juvenile in a dedicated place. In a police 
station visited, there were neither special places dedicated to juveniles nor specialized 
police officers assigned to such cases. However, during these inspections the Special 
Rapporteur did not receive any complaints regarding the treatment of juveniles.  
</p><p>55. Reports indicate that the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office rarely requests alternative 
measures of detention, as provided for in articles 501 to 504 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. Reports also indicate that juveniles often remain in custody for a long period 
before being admitted to a child protection centre. 
</p>
<p>56. During his visit to a child protection centre, the Special Rapporteur observed decent 
living conditions and, in general, good treatment of the juveniles, aged between 12 and 17. 
However, he heard credible reports about corporal punishment (beating with sticks and 
electric cords) committed by one specific member of the staff. He has no further 
information as to whether the reported use of corporal punishment is an isolated case or if 
such treatment is generally used in juvenile protection centres. The medical examination of 
one juvenile detainee resulted in findings consistent with such abuse. However, the 
Ministry of Youth and Sports indicated that no such treatment would be tolerated and that 
complaints would be investigated without undue delay.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Women serving prison sentences 
</b></p>
<p>57. Reports indicate that women suffer a high incidence of humiliating and degrading 
treatment during their detention at the police station and during their time spent in the 
correctional system. However, the reported rate of torture or ill-treatment is significantly 
lower than for male detainees. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur visited the women&#8217;s section of two prisons, which revealed 
the same or even a higher rate of overcrowding as in other parts of the prison, and in 
particular an apparent lack of space for women with children and well-equipped recreation 
areas for children. However, during the visits no complaints about the treatment and 
behaviour of the prison staff were received. It appears that women are provided with their 
basic needs regarding their own hygiene and general health as well as that of the children 
living with them, which is permitted up to the age of 3 years, but may be extended to the 
age of 5 years.    </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the Government to prevent 
ill-treatment of patients in psychiatric hospitals. He welcomes the strategic plan of the 
Ministry of Health and the draft law (2012) amending Royal Decree No. 1-58-295 with 
respect to the protection of persons in mental health institutions, explicitly prohibiting all 
forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in health-care institutions. 
</p>
<p>60. Article 134 of the Criminal Code stipulates that whoever commits a misdemeanour 
or felony as a result of mental disability must be placed in a psychiatric institution. 
However, perpetrators of minor infractions are handed over to the administrative authority 
if proven to be exempt from criminal liability, which excludes them from medical 
monitoring and the necessary treatment. Reports indicate that, in cases where placement of 
an individual in a psychiatric institution has been decided, often the implementation of such 
decision takes a long time, which leads to situations where persons with mental illnesses 
remain incarcerated for excessive periods. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. La&#226;youne, Western Sahara 
</b>61. The Special Rapporteur received numerous submissions and testimonies relating to 
the legal and political status of the territory as well as complaints concerning a vast array of 
human rights violations other than torture and ill-treatment. He also received multiple 
requests for interviews and written submissions on matters within his mandate. Consistent 
with the terms of reference of the mandate, the present report will not deal with allegations 
of human rights violations other than torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, nor 
will it address issues relating to the status of Western Sahara as a Non-Self-Governing 
Territory. 
</p>
<p>62. Regarding cases within his mandate, the Special Rapporteur found that torture and 
ill-treatment were used to extract confessions and that protestors were subjected to 
excessive use of force by Moroccan law-enforcement officials. The testimonies received 
indicate that members of the Sahrawi population are specifically, but not exclusively, 
victims of such violations. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur received numerous complaints indicating a pattern of 
excessive use of force in repressing demonstrations and in arresting protestors or persons 
suspected of participating in demonstrations calling for self-determination of the Sahrawi 
population. During the transport to or upon arrival at the police station arrestees are beaten, 
insulted and forced to reveal names of other protestors. The Special Rapporteur expresses 
concern about the alleged abandonment of the victims in rural areas after the assaults. 
Reports indicate that these practices are aimed at punishing and intimidating protestors in 
order to prevent further support for the call for independence. On occasion, protests become 
violent and the security forces are attacked by demonstrators. Even on those occasions, it is 
the duty of law enforcement bodies to ensure public order without resorting to excessive 
violence. During the presence of the mission in La&#226;youne, one such demonstration was 
held. There were some scuffles but, by all accounts, riot police acted with restraint. A few 
demonstrators went to hospital and, after initially being denied treatment, they were in fact 
assisted following the intervention of the local branch of CNDH and all were released 
without serious injury. The Special Rapporteur observes that, if appropriate crowd control 
methods had been applied while he was in town, it should have been possible for police to 
behave in the same manner at all other times, not only in Western Sahara but also 
elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>64. Other reports indicate that Moroccan police forces regularly raid private homes of 
alleged or known supporters of the independence of Western Sahara, in procedures that 
include beating and ill-treatment of the inhabitants. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur visited the Prison of La&#226;youne, the Moulay Hassan Ben El 
Mehdi Hospital in La&#226;youne and the Gendarmerie station in the Port of La&#226;youne. He noted 
that the women&#8217;s section of the prison and the psychiatric centre at the hospital, which had 
been recently renovated, were of a high standard compared to the other sections of the 
prison. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur received credible testimonies relating to torture and ill-
treatment in the Prison of La&#226;youne, including rape, severe beating and isolation up to 
several weeks, particularly of inmates accused of participating in pro-independence 
activities. He observed extreme overcrowding, which had a negative impact on the level of 
hygiene, quality of nutrition, access to health care and general health of the inmates. In 
addition, he received reports about denial of health care. With regard to the events 
surrounding the closure of the Gdeim Izik camp in November 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
is concerned that 25 Sahrawi civilians are being tried before a military court for their 
alleged role in the violent clashes that occurred in Western Sahara. The Special Rapporteur 
received testimonies of torture and ill-treatment, including rape and deteriorating health 
conditions of some of the detainees due to the prison conditions. The trial was repeatedly 
postponed without reasons provided by the court. On 17 February 2013 the military court 
issued its verdict by rejecting all requests to investigate the allegations of torture and 
refusing to order medical examinations in relation to the allegations of rape raised by 
several of the defendants. The military court did not issue a written judgement. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses concern regarding the fact that the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment during the almost two years of pretrial detention have not been investigated. The 
fact that the case is before a military rather than a civilian court contributes to the lack of 
transparency and refusal to investigate the allegations of mistreatment. 
</p>
<p>67. During his visit to the psychiatric hospital in La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, the Special 
Rapporteur noted a lack of equipment and furniture, but decent living conditions for 
patients. Basic drugs were available and stored according to minimum standards. However, 
he noted with concern that the facility has only one psychiatrist, who is competent and 
well-trained but covers a population of several thousand, which exceeds the universally 
established standards. In addition there is also a shortage of paramedical staff.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the new Constitution in July 
2011, marking an important step towards the reinforcement of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the strategic plan of the Interministerial 
Delegation for Human Rights for 2012-2016 and hopes that its implementation will 
further strengthen the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The establishment of the National Human Rights Council (CNDH) is a very 
positive institutional development. It can become an effective monitoring mechanism 
and mediator between the State and its citizens if its recommendations are 
implemented in good faith.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Crucial to the development of an emerging culture of human rights is the effort 
made by the authorities, through the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, to 
address the legacy of past abuses during the &#8220;years of lead&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the acknowledgment of cases of torture during the &#8220;years of lead&#8221;, but 
regrets that senior authorities deny that torture still occurs.   </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>72. <b>In cases involving State security, such as terrorism, membership in Islamist 
movements, or supporters of independence for Western Sahara, there is a pattern of 
torture and ill-treatment by police officers during the arrest process and while in 
detention, in particular, by agents of the National Surveillance Directorate (DST). 
Many individuals have been coerced to confess and sentenced to prison on the basis of 
such a confession. The violations often continue while these individuals are serving 
their sentences.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>When the police or other authorities respond to incidents that involve protests 
or assembly, there is a corresponding increase in the use of excessive force. Whether 
or not the demonstrations are permitted, authorities must comply with international 
standards based on necessity and proportionality in the use of force and respect for 
the right to life and physical integrity.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern about the increase in reported 
violence by security forces against migrants and asylum seekers, particularly in the 
north of the country. National protection mechanisms and investigations are 
insufficient and there is a lack of legal and medical assistance for those subjected to 
torture or ill-treatment.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that, despite the legal provision that 
provides for a lawyer in the first 24 hours upon arrest in ordinary criminal cases, this 
time period seems not to be fully implemented in practice. He expresses particular 
concern with regard to the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03), which provides for police 
custody for up to three consecutive periods of 96 hours with no right to a lawyer, 
except for a half-hour, monitored visit at the mid-point of that period.</b>  
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that the Moroccan judicial system relies heavily 
on confessions as the main evidence to support conviction. Article 293 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure prohibits the admission of any confession or statement made 
under duress, in accordance with international law. However, complaints indicate the 
use of torture by State officials to obtain evidence or confessions during the initial 
stage of interrogation, in particular in counter-terrorism or internal security cases.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur was provided with examples of and statistics on 
persons who have been acquitted despite having confessed to crimes, but he did not 
see concrete examples in which courts applied the exclusionary rule mandated by 
international law with regard to torture.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The present Moroccan forensic system, whereby detainees are subjected to 
forensic examinations performed by doctors with no specific forensic training (clinical 
doctors acting as court &#8220;experts&#8221;), is not in accordance with international standards.  
</b>79. <b>The complaint system regarding allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and 
the investigation, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators, with the exception of a 
very few cases, seems to be provided for in law but not implemented. The Special 
Rapporteur concludes that the complaint mechanisms currently available are neither 
effective nor independent. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment should be admitted 
at any stage of the trial and courts are obliged to launch ex officio investigations 
whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect torture or ill-treatment.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge that CNDH 
has established an increasingly effective monitoring mechanism for many violations of 
human rights, including torture and ill-treatment. These mechanisms apply in most 
areas, including Western Sahara, and were established after the creation of regional 
branches of CNDH. These monitoring mechanisms should be encouraged and 
improved upon, and authorities should respect their findings and implement their </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations. At the same time, they should not be considered as substitutes for 
the complaint mechanisms referred to in the above paragraph.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur thanks the General Delegation for Prison 
Administration and Reintegration for the comprehensive statistics provided regarding 
the prison population and administration of prisons, including various projects to 
improve prison conditions throughout the country. However, the visits conducted to 
detention facilities raised concerns about the fact that conditions in most prisons are 
still alarming due to overcrowding, cases of ill-treatment and abusive disciplinary 
measures, unsanitary conditions, inadequate food and limited access to medical care. 
The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that disciplinary measures such as 
solitary confinement are excessively used and that the procedures and complaints 
mechanisms are not clear. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that CNDH has unimpeded access to 
places of detention and that conditions of detention are increasingly documented. 
However, he expresses concern with regard to the very limited access of non-
governmental organizations to places of detention. In addition, the continuing use of 
incommunicado detention in cases involving perceived threats to national security 
presents a challenge to monitoring activities that requires urgent attention. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the conditions under which prisoners 
are held on death row. These amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Regarding La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, the Special Rapporteur found that 
torture and ill-treatment were inflicted during arrest, at police stations and at the 
prison in La&#226;youne. He also found that excessive force was used during 
demonstrations for the independence of Western Sahara, including kidnappings and 
abandonments in the desert, in order to intimidate alleged protestors. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur also heard testimonies alleging violations committed 
by non-State actors promoting independence of Western Sahara. While expressing 
sympathy with victims, he notes that such allegations fall outside his mandate. Finally, 
the Special Rapporteur regrets that meetings with civil society were monitored by 
authorities and the media and that cameras were awaiting his arrival at every 
location. In La&#226;youne especially this created a climate of intimidation experienced by 
a number of individuals he interviewed during the visit.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>In a spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government, with appropriate assistance from the international community, 
including the United Nations and other actors, take decisive steps to implement the 
recommendations below. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>With regard to legislation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government of Morocco: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Amend article 231-1 of the Criminal Code to ensure that complicity or 
explicit or tacit consent on the part of law enforcement or security personnel or any 
other person acting in an official capacity is specifically covered; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Amend article 224 of the Criminal Code to bring the definition of public 
official into line with the definition of a public servant or other person acting in an 
official capacity contained in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that no person convicted of or prosecuted for the crime of torture 
may benefit from an act of amnesty; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Include in the Criminal Code a specific provision which establishes that 
the order of a superior officer or of a public authority may not be invoked as a 
justification for torture, and provide a protection mechanism for subordinates who 
refuse to obey an order to torture a person who is in their custody; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Amend the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03) to reduce the period of police 
custody from 96 hours (renewable twice); 
 (f) Revise article 290 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to extend to 
infractions and misdemeanours the evidentiary standard already in effect governing 
crimes, so that in all penal trials statements prepared by the police shall be treated as 
one piece of evidence among others, with no presumption as to its truthfulness; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to indicate that where there is 
an allegation of torture or ill-treatment the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to 
prove beyond reasonable doubt that any confession made has not been obtained by 
unlawful means; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Amend article 84 of the Prisons Act (No. 23/98) to empower regional 
directors to authorize civil society organizations to visit the institution; and amend 
article 10 of the implementing decree of Act No. 23/98 to enlarge the scope of activities 
of non-governmental organizations in that regard; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Amend article 134 of the Criminal Code in order to ensure that all 
offenders suffering from a mental disability are placed in a psychiatric institution, 
regardless of the degree of the offence. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>With regard to safeguards and prevention, the Special Rapporteur
