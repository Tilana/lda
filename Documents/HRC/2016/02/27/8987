<p><b>  Mission to Guatemala 
</b>(20&#8211;28 July 2008) 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Mr. Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, 
visited Guatemala from 20 to 28 July 2008. During the mission the Special Rapporteur 
examined the status of the right to education at the different educational levels, i.e. early 
childhood, primary, secondary and higher education. 
</p>
<p> In the present report the Special Rapporteur analyses the main features of the 
Guatemalan education system in terms of organization, coverage, infrastructure, State 
expenditure and current government policy, as well as various special programmes such as 
intercultural bilingual education, the National Programme for Educational Self-
Management (PRONADE) and national literacy training. 
 The Special Rapporteur observed a number of challenges facing the education 
system. He notes with concern the low level of investment in education, which is 
approximately 2 per cent of gross domestic product (the lowest in the region), and that 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education is in practice confined to the issue of bilingualism, 
with the teaching of indigenous languages solely for students in the first three years of 
primary schooling in a very small number of State schools and only in some languages.

</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also notes the trend towards privatization of education, 
which undermines the established principle of free education, and the fact that 80 per cent 
of secondary education is in the hands of private schools, which makes it impossible to 
ensure education for all at the lower and upper secondary levels. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur considers that the Guatemalan Government should ensure 
that investment in education is increased and take steps to secure national political 
consensus so that the State grants an adequate budget to fulfil its obligation in this regard. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes the regularization scheme for unbudgeted teachers and 
PRONADE teachers and also the creation of new posts. He recommends, inter alia, an 
increase in the budget for intercultural bilingual education in proportion to the population 
served, a stronger participation by the Office of the Deputy Minister for Intercultural 
Bilingual Education and the establishment of the criteria of multiculturalism, 
interculturalism and multilingualism in order that the specificities of indigenous 
communities are represented.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Mr. Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, 
visited Guatemala from 20 to 28 July 2008. He visited the cities of Guatemala and 
Quetzaltenango. The Special Rapporteur had the honour to be received by H.E. the 
President of the Republic, the Minister of Education, the Deputy Ministers of Education 
and Foreign Affairs, the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Presidential Commission on 
Human Rights, the President of the Education Commission of Congress and other national 
and local authorities. 
</p>
<p>2. In some 40 meetings the Special Rapporteur interacted with over 300 representatives 
of civil society, including indigenous leaders, teachers, students, parents, teachers&#8217; 
organizations and representatives of United Nations system organizations in Guatemala. He 
had an opportunity to visit primary and secondary schools and a regional campus of the 
University of San Carlos (USAC), two penitentiary centres, one adult night school and 
formal and non-formal education projects of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as 
well as other related State institutions such as the National Literacy Training Committee 
(CONALFA). The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government 
for the invitation extended to him and for providing him with the opportunity to meet all the 
authorities relevant to his mandate and to all the people whom he met in the course of his 
visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to education: principles, norms and standards 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>3. The State of Guatemala is a party to international human rights instruments such as 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (accession in 1992), the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1992), the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1990), 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(1983), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(1982), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990), the Protocol against the 
Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to Prevent, Sanction and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 97 concerning Migration for Employment, 1949 
(accession in 1952), and No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries, 1989. They all contain specific provisions on education and commit States to 
adopt all necessary measures to protect, respect and promote the exercise of the right to 
education for all within their territories without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>4. Article 46 of the Constitution lays down that &#8220;in human rights matters, treaties and 
conventions accepted and ratified by Guatemala shall take precedence over domestic law&#8221;. 
National legislation and international instruments on human rights ratified by Guatemala 
establish the State&#8217;s obligation to make available and provide education to its inhabitants 
without discrimination. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/8/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-13008 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal framework and national policies 
</b></p>
<p>5. The two main statutory texts on education in the country are the 1985 Political 
Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala (Section four: Education), whose principles are 
referred to above, and the National Education Act (Legislative Decree No. 12-91 of 1991). 
</p><p>6. The Peace Agreements of 1996, which establish educational reforms, constitute the 
framework within which the changes outlined below are being carried out. Of special 
importance in the implementation of the Peace Agreements was the setting up of the Joint 
Commission on Educational Reform under Governmental Decision No. 262-97, dated 20 
March 1997, whose purpose was to devise a reform of the education system consistent with 
the Peace Agreements, in particular the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. The Consultative Commission on Educational Reform (CCRE) was established by 
Governmental Decision No. 748-97 of 29 October 1997, its term being extended for a 
further four years by Governmental Decision No. 145-2001. 
</p>
<p>7. As stipulated in article 74 of the Constitution, education is compulsory and free of 
charge for the age group from 6 to 15 years, covering the pre-primary, primary and lower 
secondary school levels. 
</p>
<p>8. The State of Guatemala has adopted the necessary regulatory and legislative 
measures to create an education system aimed at guaranteeing the exercise of the right to 
education. Within a general context, the regulatory framework is governed by the articles of 
the Constitution that refer to education and by the National Education Act. For the 
implementation of both sets of general norms there are other laws and regulations that refer 
to more particular aspects of the education system and which will be mentioned specifically 
in the course of the present report, according to the topics to which they relate. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution recognizes the right to education, stipulating that it &#8220;guarantees the 
freedom of education and teaching&#8221;, requiring the State to &#8220;make available and provide 
education for its inhabitants without discrimination&#8221;.1 It also affirms that the aims of 
education are &#8220;the all-round development of the human person and knowledge of the reality 
and culture of Guatemala and the world&#8221;.2 In accordance with the Constitution, primary and 
lower secondary education are free of charge and compulsory.3 With regard to literacy 
training, the Constitution declares this to be an &#8220;urgent national need&#8221;, referring to the 
&#8220;social obligation to contribute to it&#8221;, and commits the State to &#8220;organize and promote it 
using all necessary recourses&#8221;.4 As regards bilingual education, the Constitution lays down 
that at &#8220;schools established in areas with a predominantly indigenous population, 
instruction shall be preferably given in bilingual form&#8221;.5 
</p>
<p>10. On 12 January 1991, Congress adopted the National Education Act (Legislative 
Decree No. 12-91), which seeks to &#8220;strengthen and reinforce the education system (&#8230;) in 
order to meet the social needs and requirements of the country and its multilingual, multi-
ethnic and multicultural reality, which call for a regionalized, bilingual approach with a 
decentralized administrative structure at the national level&#8221;.6 The Act recognizes, as 
fundamental principles, that education is an inherent right of the human person and an

<p>National Education Act). </p>

</p>
<p>obligation of the State,7 being &#8220;aimed at the all-round development and advancement of 
human beings through an ongoing, gradual and progressive process&#8221;. The country&#8217;s 
multicultural context is also recognized in the Act, which states that education &#8220;is defined 
and framed within a multilingual, multi-ethnic and multicultural setting on the basis of the 
communities which comprise it&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>11. Article 33 of the National Education Act sets out the State&#8217;s education obligations, 
which include: (a) promoting free and compulsory education; (b) promoting and 
encouraging education without discrimination; (c) guaranteeing the all-round development 
of every human being and knowledge of the country&#8217;s reality; (d) according priority to 
education in resource allocation under the national budget; (e) encouraging and 
guaranteeing literacy training as a matter of urgency by providing and using the necessary 
resources; (f) constructing school buildings and premises for official centres of education; 
and (g) providing all official centres of education with the infrastructure, school furniture 
and equipment necessary for effective teaching and learning.9 
</p>
<p>12. In accordance with the National Education Act, the education institutional 
framework is constituted by the national education system, which is defined as an 
&#8220;organized and interrelated set of elements, processes and actors through which education 
is imparted in a manner consistent with the characteristics, needs and interests of 
Guatemala&#8217;s historical, economic and cultural reality&#8221;.10 It is composed of the Ministry of 
Education, the educational community and centres of education11 and comprises two 
subsystems, i.e. formal education and non-formal or parallel education.12 
</p>
<p><b> III. Main features of the Guatemalan education system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Structure and organization of the education system 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Pre-primary education 
</b></p>
<p>13. Pre-primary education is for children from 4 to 6 years of age. It is compulsory by 
law but in practice is not always provided owing to the shortage of establishments. Three 
forms of pre-primary education are offered: infant; bilingual pre-primary (Spanish and 
Mayan languages) and accelerated pre-primary. The first two programmes provide an 
average of two hours&#8217; care per day. Accelerated pre-primary education consists of a 
preparatory programme for children of 6 years of age, which is provided for 35 days during 
school vacations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Primary education 
</b></p>
<p>14. Primary education is compulsory for children from 7 to 14 years of age. It covers six 
years of study, divided into two three-year stages, the basic stage and the supplementary 
stage, at the end of both of which a diploma is awarded. The working schedule is five hours 
per day.

</b></p>
<p>GE.09-13008 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Secondary education 
</b></p>
<p>15. Secondary education comprises a basic or general stage (lower level) of three years&#8217; 
duration and a specialized or vocational stage (upper level), whose duration is two or three 
years depending on the course chosen. On completion of the first stage, a study diploma is 
awarded, and, on completion of the second stage, a certificate is awarded, allowing the 
pursuit of an occupation and entry into university. The options offered to students at the 
specialized stage include two-year arts and science courses, three-year training courses 
leading to a commercial, industrial, agricultural or technical qualification, and a three-year 
teacher-training course. The basic stage is compulsory by law, although the lack of 
establishments at this level constitutes a significant restriction. The specialized stage is 
optional. The working schedule for secondary education is from five to six hours per day. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Higher education 
</b></p>
<p>16. Higher education is offered by one national university and nine private universities. 
There are three-year technical courses at the intermediate higher level, then bachelor&#8217;s 
degree courses (generally two years of study) and, at the post-graduate level, master&#8217;s 
degree and doctorate courses. 
</p>
<p>17. The school year comprises a total of at least 180 tuition days. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Coverage 
</b></p>
<p>18. As regards coverage, Guatemala&#8217;s primary enrolment rate is 94.46 per cent, which 
means that virtually the whole but not the entire child population between 7 and 12 years of 
age is enrolled at this level of schooling. However, it is important to bear in mind that this 
rate refers to enrolled children but does not take into account actual retention and 
completion rates, which are factors that lower the education coverage rate. 
</p>
<p>19. The very high dropout levels mean that Guatemala continues to have the lowest 
primary completion rates (72.5 per cent in 2006) for the whole region.13 Secondary 
enrolment rates (34.7 per cent for the basic stage and 20 per cent for the specialized stage) 
are the lowest in Latin America.14 
</p>
<p>20. Major inter-ethnic disparities in access to education can be observed. Primary 
enrolment and completion rates are particularly low in the departments of Alta Verapaz and 
Quich&#233;, two of the departments with a high proportion of indigenous inhabitants. A 
systematic disparity between boys and girls is also apparent. According to data for 2003, 
the percentage of enrolled students who fail to complete primary schooling on time is 
greater in the case of girls (43 per cent) than boys (37 per cent).15

<p><b>8</b> GE.09-13008 
</p>
<p><b> C. Free education 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Constitution and the National Education Act stipulate that education imparted 
by the State is free of charge. Nevertheless, a presidential decision of 1968, which is still in 
force, regulates charges for school meals and other levies applied by the country&#8217;s official 
educational establishments. That presidential decision furnishes local authorities and school 
management bodies with the means to impose financial collections of any kind. With 
regard to &#8220;voluntary fees&#8221;, many complaints have been presented to the media concerning 
enrolment charges made by State schools. Such charges include not only enrolment fees but 
also requests relating to school equipment, uniforms and meal costs.16 
</p>
<p><b> D. Infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>22. The issue of educational infrastructure is particularly worrying in Guatemala. 
Several organizations pointed out to the Special Rapporteur the absence of reliable and 
precise data on the number of educational facilities existing in the country. The Office of 
the Human Rights Ombudsman put the number of centres of education at around 25,800. 
</p>
<p>23. According to a document on the status of the education system, 49 per cent of 
schools do not have drinking water, 36 per cent are without electrical power and 8 per cent 
report that their roof is in poor condition, 5 per cent that their walls are in poor condition 
and 8 per cent that their floor is in poor condition. It is also stated in that document that, 
according to the National System of Indicators, 15 per cent of establishments in the official 
sector meet the necessary quality standards to operate.17 
</p>
<p>24. The National Education Act lays down that the State has an obligation to construct 
&#8220;school buildings and premises for official centres of education&#8221; and to provide &#8220;all official 
centres of education with the infrastructure, school furniture and equipment necessary for 
effective teaching and learning&#8221;. However, the law does not specify which institution or 
entity is responsible for executing or coordinating that directive. According to the 
information received, it is the development councils, municipal authorities, NGOs and 
social funds which have undertaken to develop the educational infrastructure. In view of the 
foregoing and the current infrastructure situation, the Ministry of Education is working in 
conjunction with Congress in an effort to have responsibility for coordinating all matters 
relating to educational infrastructure handed over to it. 
</p>
<p>25. Under the Ministry of Education Organizational Regulations, amended in 2007, the 
Directorate for Educational Coverage and Infrastructure (DIGECOBER) was established 
with, in regard to infrastructure, the tasks of &#8220;undertaking studies, making 
recommendations and coordinating with government agencies, cooperative bodies and 
NGOs the execution of school infrastructure policies and plans within the national 
education system&#8221;. This new directorate would have an essential role in evaluating the 
needs of communities in regard to educational infrastructure and maintenance of school 
premises and would assist the work of the Ministry if responsibility for coordinating related 
matters were assigned to it. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 The Government reported that Governmental Decision No. 226-2008 had been issued, stipulating, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, that the provision of education as a public service was free and that entry to and enrolment 
and attendance at pre-primary, primary and secondary centres of education were accordingly not 
subject to, conditional upon or linked to any compulsory or voluntary payment.

<p>GE.09-13008 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. State expenditure on education 
</b></p>
<p>26. Social spending by the State of Guatemala on education is allocated under different 
budgetary categories. The following general distinctions can be made: 
</p>
<p> (a) Spending by institution: This is usually about 2 per cent of gross domestic 
product (GDP), which is earmarked for the Ministry of Education; 
 (b) Spending by purpose and function: This represents between 2.5 and 2.7 per 
cent of GDP. It is a cross-cutting expenditure, being distributed among different State 
institutions which are not attached to the Ministry of Education but which themselves 
discharge educational responsibilities involving different sectors of the population. Of these 
institutions, mention can be made of the Adolfo V. Hall Institute, the Office of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman, the University of San Carlos, etc.; 
</p>
<p> (c) Spending by item: This relates to expenditure which is invested in various 
official institutions by way of salaries, educational materials, infrastructure, transfers, etc. 
</p>
<p>27. In 2007, the Ministry of Education had a budget of some 5,800 million quetzals 
(about 737 million United States dollars). According to the transparency portal of the 
Ministry of Public Finance, the Ministry of Education had implemented 75.75 per cent of 
the annual budget as at 9 November 2007. The budget allocated for 2008 is 6,500 million 
quetzals (about 826 million dollars). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Special programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Intercultural bilingual education 
</b></p>
<p>28. In 1995, the State established the Directorate for Intercultural Bilingual Education 
(DIGEBI) as the governing body for intercultural bilingual education (IBE) for the Mayan, 
Xinka and Gar&#237;funa communities. The main objectives of DIGEBI are scientific and 
technical advancement of IBE; strengthening of the identity of the country&#8217;s indigenous 
peoples; curriculum development, implementation and evaluation; advancement, 
strengthening and preservation of the Mayan, Xinka and Gar&#237;funa languages through 
educational activities; and development of social bilingualism among the Mayan-speaking 
student population and harmonious coexistence between peoples and cultures.18 Bilingual 
education is offered only up to the third primary grade, with no provision for the other 
educational levels. It is apparent, however, that a large portion of the budget needed by 
DIGEBI for its operation is met through international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>29. Under Governmental Decision No. 377-2007, the Ministry of Education adopted 
new internal organization regulations, which allocated increased responsibilities to 
DIGEBI. The purpose of the organizational structure, with new divisions and technical 
departments, is, according to the Ministry of Education, to guarantee the right to 
intercultural bilingual education. However, several indigenous organizations have 
expressed their concern since they believe that the withdrawal of the finance and media 
functions and other responsibilities could have a negative impact on the functioning of the 
bilingual education system. 
</p>
<p>30. Despite the progress achieved in this regard since 1995, bilingual education still 
faces major challenges in fully meeting international standards. In 2007, the DIGEBI

</p>
<p>restructuring undertaken by the Ministry of Education was opposed by a large proportion of 
specialized organizations since they believed that such restructuring jeopardized the 
continuity of bilingual education. In March 2008, the new Ministry of Education authorities 
submitted a public policy on bilingual education, which was favourably received by the 
organizations, who undertook to support its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National Programme for Educational Self-Management 
</b></p>
<p>31. With a view to expanding educational coverage, the National Programme for 
Educational Self-Management (PRONADE) was established in 1993 in order to &#8220;increase 
the coverage and improve the quality of education services in rural areas and encourage 
community participation&#8221;.19 This has made it possible to raise primary enrolment rates, 
especially in departments having high indigenous concentrations and in rural regions, and 
has provided a means of involving communities through the community educational 
committees (COEDUCAs) and parents&#8217; committees. 
</p><p>32. One of the most interesting aspects of this Programme is community participation in 
education management from teacher selection to ongoing supervision of teaching activities. 
Under the Programme, each community is organized as an educational committee with 
separate legal status and responsibility for financial resource administration and teacher 
recruitment for the operation of the community self-management schools (EACs).20 
33. PRONADE teachers&#8217; pay conditions differ from those of teachers in the formal 
education sector. Under the Law on Advancement and Classification of the National 
Teaching Profession,21 the contractual relationships of PRONADE teachers are established 
directly with the community educational committees and not with the Ministry of 
Education. 
</p>
<p>34. The educational committee members&#8217; work is not remunerated, which can affect the 
communities, since most are in situations of vulnerability and poverty. According to a 
report by ActionAid and Colectivo de Educaci&#243;n para Todas y Todos,22 each community 
educational committee member spends some 48 days per year on school administration, 
which can have an impact on an already poor household economy and consequently affect 
the exercise of other rights, such as the right to work. 
</p>
<p>35. According to the information received, during 2007 PRONADE served a total of 
455,437 children living in 4,678 communities in 21 departments of the Republic, 83 per 
cent of whose schools are located within communities in situations of extreme poverty, the 
level of coverage thus achieved being 94.46 per cent of children in primary education.23 
</p>
<p>36. However, one of the main problems relates to coverage at the pre-primary and lower 
and upper secondary levels, with almost two million children outside the education system 
owing to financial problems, child labour or domestic work of girls. It should be recalled

on child labour&#8221;.24 In this connection, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has affirmed the importance of education in eliminating child labour and the 
obligations set out in article 7, paragraph 2, of Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the 
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour,25 which was ratified by Guatemala in 2001. 
</p>
<p>37. To develop secondary education, a pilot programme involving national distance-
learning secondary institutes under community self-management (INTACs) was set up 
within PRONADE and in 2007 extended to eight communities, to the benefit of 198 first-
grade, 150 second-grade and 197 third-grade students. 
</p>
<p>38. As regards the budget earmarked for this programme, provision is made for 
PRONADE in the national budget prepared by the Ministry of Public Finance; also, funds 
or donations are received from &#8220;national or foreign individuals or corporate entities&#8221;.26 The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that each community self-management school received a 
monthly allocation to cover the costs of school meals, educational equipment, including 
teaching materials, and teachers&#8217; pay, plus 1,500 quetzals (about 190 dollars) for minor 
infrastructure repairs. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National literacy training 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Constitution of Guatemala declares that literacy training is a &#8220;matter of national 
urgency&#8221; and a &#8220;social obligation&#8221; which must be organized and promoted by the State 
using &#8220;all necessary resources&#8221;.27 To comply with this constitutional mandate, Congress 
adopted in 1986 the National Literacy Act (Decree No. 43-86) and its implementing 
regulations. 
</p>
<p>40. With regard to the establishment of mechanisms for the development of literacy 
programmes, the National Literacy Training Committee (CONALFA) was set up under that 
Decree as the coordinating body for literacy training in the country with responsibility for 
defining and approving the country&#8217;s literacy policies and schemes, promoting literacy 
training and approving programmes and budgets, in addition to discharging administrative 
duties.28 CONALFA&#8217;s membership comprises the Minister of Education, the Minister of 
Culture and Sport, the Minister of Urban and Rural Development, the Minister of Labour 
and Social Welfare, the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Food and the Minister of the 
Interior. It also includes representatives from the academic sector (University of San 
Carlos), the private sector and the National Development Council.29 
</p><p>41. The National Literacy Act stipulates that beneficiaries of literacy programmes must 
be persons deemed illiterate who are resident in the country and aged 15 years or over.30 
Under its implementing regulations, priority will be accorded to persons between 15 and 30 
years, then to persons between 31 and 45 years and finally to persons over 46 years.31 It is

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.09-13008 
</p>
<p>important to bear in mind that the official education system has to guarantee schooling up 
to the age of 14 years. CONALFA pointed out in this connection that there are 
approximately 42,000 young persons aged 13 and 14 years who are not served by either 
system and who have to wait until they reach the regulation age to benefit from literacy 
programmes.  
</p>
<p>42. During 2007, 139,373 females and 66,586 males enrolled on literacy programmes, 
of whom 39,065 females and 16,816 males enrolled on bilingual programmes. One of the 
major obstacles to achieving illiteracy reduction targets in Guatemala is student dropout, 
which is about 40 per cent of enrolments. With a view to lowering this rate, CONALFA 
has, following a community initiative and with the support of NGOs, set up literacy training 
in conjunction with production programmes executed by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Livestock and Food. The Special Rapporteur also noted a lack of dissemination of 
CONALFA literacy programmes. 
</p>
<p>43. Despite the restrictions observed during visits to penitentiary centres, the Special 
Rapporteur could see that literacy programmes were offered to many inmates. Nevertheless, 
it was also apparent that prisoners did not have instructional materials or textbooks; thus the 
success of such programmes continues to be limited. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges facing the education system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Low level of investment in education 
</b></p>
<p>44. In Guatemala, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP remained 
static at around 2.7 per cent of GDP during the period from 2001 to 2007. It is the lowest 
funding level in Central America and one of the lowest in Latin America (where the 
average is 4.6 per cent of GDP), which is inconsistent with the extent of the country&#8217;s 
educational shortcomings and with the fact that Guatemala is the largest economy in 
Central America. Per capita, public expenditure fell in real terms between 2001 and 2007 
from 354.6 to 329.1 quetzals per annum (from 45 to 41 dollars), which has a detrimental 
impact on the quality of education of Guatemalans.32 While a spending level of 2.8 per cent 
of GDP was reached in 2008,33 it hardly represents any increase on the 2001 budgetary 
allocation (2.8 per cent).  
</p><p>45. Article 89 (1) of the National Education Act, adopted by Congress under Legislative 
Decree No. 12-91, provides for an education appropriation of not less than 35 per cent of 
current revenue of the general State budget. However, in 2007, the Ministry of Education&#8217;s 
budget in relation to the total government budget was 13.45 per cent, the lowest ratio in the 
last four years.34 According to the 2007 report of the Social Expenditure Monitoring Centre, 
the Ministry of Education saw its budget reduced by 344.3 million quetzals in the 
readjustment.35 Further analysis by educational level reveals that cuts ranging from 9 to 
15.5 per cent have occurred. Pre-primary education is the most affected, with a reduction of 
87.1 million quetzals on the 561.6 million quetzals allocated in the readjustment, the largest 
reductions affecting urban teaching, textbook provision and feeding programmes. Primary

</p>
<p>33
 The budget allocated in 2008 was over 6,500 million quetzals and a budget of over 7,588 million

<p>GE.09-13008 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>education has undergone a 10.7 per cent cut in the regular system, with a reduction of 344 
million quetzals on revenue of 3.973 million quetzals, and shows decreases principally in 
allocations for urban teaching and rural bilingual education, textbooks, food and grants for 
girls. Lower secondary education, which is relatively less affected than the other levels, has 
undergone a cut of around 4 per cent, with a reduction of 16.4 million quetzals on 422.8 
million. There are also cuts at the upper secondary level, in this case amounting to 9 per 
cent overall.36 
</p>
<p>46. In summary, textbook provision has been insufficient and there have been 
significant budget reductions on food and, to a lesser extent, equipment supplies and 
educational grants, resulting in a decrease of 160.6 million quetzals for support 
programmes excluding the instructional kit.37 
</p>
<p>47. On examining budgetary developments in the Ministry of Education&#8217;s main 
programmes, the Special Rapporteur observed that most efforts focused on the primary 
level, both under the official programme and under PRONADE. According to the latest 
data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), primary education in 2006 accounted for 66 per cent of public expenditure on 
education, while 8 per cent and 10 per cent were earmarked for pre-primary and secondary 
education respectively. With regard to bilingual education, the Monitoring Centre for 
Education of Indigenous Peoples reports that, of the total budget earmarked for teachers&#8217; 
pay in the public sector, only 6 per cent is earmarked for bilingual teachers&#8217; pay. The 
Special Rapporteur also observed that a large portion of the budget needed by DIGEBI for 
its operation was met through international cooperation, a trend which could be maintained 
given that the budget approved for 2008 represented a 12 per cent reduction compared with 
the 2007 budget. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur considers it necessary that the legislation in force be 
complied with so that the State grants an adequate budget to fulfil its obligation in this 
regard and that that budget should not be regressive. The Special Rapporteur considers it 
necessary to introduce a tax reform that will enable sufficient revenues to be collected in 
order that investment in education can be increased by 0.5 per cent of GDP per annum. 
There is also an urgent need to improve efficiency in the execution of spending earmarked 
for social programmes and especially for the education sector since, even with the current 
meagre budget, not all the resources budgeted for the education system are being invested. 
He considers it essential that the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman oversee the steps 
to secure political consensus in this regard and calls for the early entry into operation of the 
National Education Council, with appropriate funding so that it can progress as a body with 
the capacity to participate in public policy formulation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Education of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>49. Indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education is in practice confined to the issue of 
bilingualism despite the fact that plans and programmes established some years previously 
had incorporated culture as a substantive topic. Although the structure of the Ministry of 
Education includes a deputy minister&#8217;s office and a directorate for intercultural bilingual 
education, the fact is that most activities focus on the teaching of indigenous languages for 
students in the first three years of primary schooling only, at a very small number of State

</p>
<p>schools and solely for indigenous pupils, but not on promoting the study of the cultures, 
world views, arts or ancestral traditions of this country&#8217;s first peoples. 
</p>
<p>50. That reductionist view is not only problematic; it also threatens the very existence of 
the original peoples, given that indigenous inhabitants make up a large portion of the 
population. Furthermore, intercultural education should not be restricted to some 
indigenous peoples but should also be aimed at centres of education for non-indigenous 
inhabitants so that a culture of respect for diversity and social commitment can be 
developed. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur noted that intercultural bilingual education constituted one 
of the core policies of the Ministry of Education. However, he also observed that the 
directorate entrusted with its implementation (DIGEBI) had a very limited budget &#8212; it 
receives 6 per cent of the Ministry of Education&#8217;s resources, which, inexplicably, is even 
underutilized &#8212; and that its coordination was the responsibility of a deputy minister&#8217;s 
office with no real operational authority within the Ministry. 
</p>
<p>52. Owing to the magnitude of the challenges facing the country, it is essential to set as 
a benchmark in education policymaking the right of indigenous peoples to education and 
culture and thus to view the linguistic issue as a structural component and not as an end in 
itself. To address this problem, the Special Rapporteur considers it necessary to promote the 
participatory design of a State policy for education that will make it possible to regulate the 
National Education Act on the basis of Guatemala&#8217;s international obligations and the 
intercultural needs of the country. 
</p>
<p>53. Mainstreaming indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in all ministerial measures should make 
curricular activities a vehicle for strong affirmative action in their favour so that the 
specificities of indigenous peoples are not seen as an adjunct to the basic national 
curriculum, in which indigenous communities do not always feel represented. Underlying 
all these considerations is the conviction that a standardized and monolithic education 
system is by definition opposed to social diversity and unable to respond to the educational 
needs of the indigenous and mixed-race peoples as well as other members of Guatemalan 
society. 
</p>
<p>54. The low self-esteem which the Special Rapporteur noted in some indigenous 
inhabitants regarding their languages and cultures clearly indicates the impact of exclusion. 
It is therefore necessary to implement affirmative action as a matter of national urgency to 
promote and enhance the status of indigenous languages and cultures in order to show to all 
members of society the benefits of a culturally and linguistically focused education. 
</p>
<p>55. Indigenous teachers cannot foster the education of citizens proud of their cultures if 
they themselves are neither aware of nor respect their identities. In this connection, it is also 
necessary to promote an indigenous-language literacy training scheme for public officials 
which includes at least the instrumental use of the mother tongues of peoples living in 
regions where they work and the development of awareness of the value of cultures. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also observed the low level of bilingual education coverage 
in a country whose indigenous population is close to half the total. In 2006, 74 per cent of 
children between 7 and 12 years of age who were enrolled in the education system received 
lessons solely in Spanish, while only 13 per cent received lessons in Spanish and a Mayan 
language. 
</p>
<p>57. Also, according to the education monitoring centre of the National Standing 
Commission on Educational Reform (CNPRE) (2007), the percentage of indigenous 
students enrolled in the period 2003&#8211;2006 grew by 0.8 per cent only, and, although access 
to primary education increased in the last year, the trend is still unfavourable for inhabitants 
of rural areas (where 70 per cent of the population living in poverty or extreme poverty </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/8/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-13008 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>reside). Indigenous student attendance rates in secondary education are equally worrying 
and show no signs of change. At the lower secondary level, indigenous students account for 
less than one fifth and, at the upper level, less than one tenth. 
</p>
<p>58. The vast majority of indigenous teachers work in primary education, generally 
owing to the stagnation of secondary education and to serious limitations on teacher 
training offered at higher levels. Furthermore, the budget earmarked for indigenous 
teachers&#8217; pay is much lower when compared with other sectors (they receive between 1,800 
and 1,900 quetzals per month, i.e. between about 229 and 242 dollars) and it has 
accordingly proved difficult to recruit bilingual teachers. It should be emphasized that the 
situation is becoming more problematic, with teacher-training colleges weakened and 
failing to allow for the historical needs of indigenous peoples, which include their world 
views and educational traditions. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the number of qualified bilingual teachers 
still fell far short of requirements. Of 90,000 teachers nationwide, only 20,000 are 
indigenous and, of these, 13,000 have bilingual teaching posts or training and are present in 
only 18 of the 24 indigenous communities. In the face of this shortage, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that intercultural bilingual education be strengthened and its 
coverage expanded and that specialist teachers be trained or priority be given to the 
recruitment of bilingual indigenous teachers to new posts offered. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned that only 40 per cent of the 32 
education commitments set out in the 1996 Peace Agreements have been fulfilled. He is 
struck by the absence of regulations implementing the 2003 National Languages Act, the 
inability to set up the Mayan university and the serious shortcomings in compliance with 
the obligations laid down in ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>61. Against that background, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment, 
adopted by the new Government in its education policy for 2008&#8211;2012, to strengthen 
intercultural bilingual education through a budget increase and discussion of the IBE model 
in Guatemala with representatives of indigenous organizations, respecting their world 
views, teaching resources, materials and textbooks, with increased bilingual teacher 
recruitment in the different levels and forms of education and improvements in the working 
conditions established in the legislation on expanding intercultural bilingual education. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur suggests that indigenous issues should be mainstreamed in 
all Ministry of Education policies in order to promote the study of indigenous languages 
and cultures, not only for indigenous but also for white and mixed-race students. The 
opportunity which Guatemala has for establishing genuine intercultural education could 
mean both a significant contribution to social peace and also the creation of a regional 
leadership role on a key issue for the human development of the Central American 
countries.38 
</p>
<p><b> C. Privatization of education 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur noted the trend towards privatization of education, which 
undermines the principle of free education as established in international human rights 
instruments and conflicts with the principles of education for all and with article 71 of the 
Constitution. Governmental Decision No. 99-68, which authorizes special levies, should be 
repealed immediately. The Special Rapporteur observed that there were no cost-free State 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38
 The Government reported that DIGEBI had prepared textbooks and materials in 13 different 
</p>
<p>languages, which were in the process of being distributed to classrooms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/8/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.09-13008 
</p>
<p>schools. In several schools visited, teachers were paid by impoverished, indigenous head-
of-household mothers. In this way, costs are passed on to families, who have to decide 
whether to send their children to school or to work. 
</p>
<p>64. It is striking to note that 80 per cent of secondary education is in the hands of private 
fee-paying schools, which makes it impossible for thousands of families to ensure lower or 
upper secondary schooling for their children owing to their poverty status. Secondary 
education faces many obstacles to its advancement, such as the lack of teachers and 
infrastructure, with low levels of coverage in cities and rural areas.  
</p>
<p>65. The lack of centres of education and of educational opportunities generally also 
forces many adolescents and young persons of school age to enrol at night schools, which 
do not meet the necessary minimum standards to offer them quality education or an 
atmosphere appropriate to their age and psychopedagogical characteristics. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur also noted a high degree of privatization in higher 
education. Article 84 of the Constitution stipulates that &#8220;the University of San Carlos [the 
only State university] shall be granted an exclusive allocation of not less than 5 per cent of 
current revenue of the general State budget&#8221;. However, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that Congress earmarks around 3 per cent of current revenue to the State 
university. 
</p>
<p>67. The low level of investment in the State university system prevents it from 
strengthening its participation in teachers&#8217; professional development or from responding 
more effectively in communities where there is discrimination. It has also forced it to offer 
a number of &#8220;self-financing&#8221; courses, which are dependent on students&#8217; ability to pay and 
which therefore never or virtually never reach rural and indigenous inhabitants, who are 
normally also unable to meet the costs of or requirements for entry into higher education. 
</p>
<p>68. The means for building up the scientific, technological and cultural skills required 
by the country to make qualitative progress in its development and the advancement of its 
peoples are linked to the need to guarantee secondary and university education. For that 
reason and to enhance enjoyment of the right to education, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that support be given to plans for expanding and strengthening secondary 
education and the State university. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Employment situation of teachers 
</b></p>
<p>69. In Guatemala there are 13,000 &#8220;unbudgeted&#8221; teachers, whose salaries are below the 
minimum wage and who do not enjoy the same rights as official or budgeted teachers. Such 
teachers are hired by the Ministry of Education as &#8220;auxiliary specialists&#8221; for a 10-month 
period (from 2 January to 31 December) with no sick leave and are subject to a 
performance appraisal every two years. Unbudgeted teachers have not had continuity of 
employment or enjoyed the same conditions of work stability or welfare protection as their 
other colleagues and are not offered the same terms of pay. 
</p>
<p>70. Over the last 20 years, various teacher classifications have been created in State 
education: category 001 teachers, who are budgeted teachers recruited on the basis of 
competition and merit; category 021 teachers, who are unbudgeted teachers within the 
Ministry of Education but hired as &#8220;auxiliary specialists&#8221; under contractual arrangements 
and not employment schemes; and teachers who are employed under the PRONADE 
project, whose recruitment is in the hands of families. There are also teachers working for 
the <i>Fe y Alegr&#237;a</i> programme and municipal teachers paid by the local authority, whose 
salaries are lower than those of regular teachers. </p>

<p>71. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern regarding the tensions between 
teachers and the authorities owing to the loss of purchasing power of salaries and the 
demands for pay rises and regularization of their status. The Special Rapporteur has noted 
some progress in post allocation with leaders of the National Assembly of Teachers (ANM) 
and Union of Education Workers of Guatemala (SETEG) and the Ministry of Education, 
and these improvements have been accompanied by better pay for teachers. Nevertheless, at 
the end of 2007, only teachers with over 9 years of service (in some cases over 13 years) 
could just manage to meet the cost of the basic shopping basket from their salaries. The 
remainder are within a group of poorly paid teachers who have to spend time pursuing other 
productive, income-generating activities, resulting in diminished quality of education for 
Guatemalan children. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur noted the Government&#8217;s efforts to regularize the 
employment status of a large number of teachers, whose system of recruitment to date has 
infringed their labour rights. The present Government has agreed to discontinue some forms 
of recruitment, such as PRONADE and the &#8220;auxiliary specialist&#8221; classification, which 
violated the employment rights of teachers, whose pay levels force them into multiple 
employment, and has undertaken to introduce a competitive examination procedure, under 
which teachers take up budgeted posts. In May 2008, the Ministry of Education and 
SETEG signed the first Collective Agreement on Working Conditions, aimed at regulating, 
harmonizing and advancing the mutual interests and relations of the Ministry of Education 
and all its workers with a view to enhancing their well-being. The present Government has 
also set up the Solidarity Programme, which includes medical and bereavement care for 
teachers and their relatives. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the regularization scheme for 20,000 unbudgeted 
teachers and 12,000 PRONADE teachers, and the creation of 10,000 new posts on a 
competitive basis.39 The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the Government&#8217;s decision to 
discontinue PRONADE and absorb it within the regularization scheme. That process has to 
be carried out in an efficient and orderly fashion, without haste and in an equitable manner 
for all. 
</p>
<p>74. Moreover, 70 per cent of teachers in Guatemala have only completed secondary 
education, the teaching workforce is very small and the quality of teaching is generally 
poor. Also, in Guatemala, unlike in other countries of Central America, no pay incentives 
have been introduced to encourage teachers to work in rural or disadvantaged areas. 
Therefore, the challenge seen by the Special Rapporteur is to provide teachers with the 
necessary tools to perform their duties through in-service training and skills development 
and the recognition of their daily work, which will directly contribute to improved quality 
of education in the country. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur considers that the efforts of the Government and of society 
as a whole to improve the standards of the national education system should include as a 
core element the provision of resources to the University of San Carlos so that the 
execution of programmes for the professional development of the teaching force can 
become part of those efforts. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>39
 The Government reported that over 47,000 teachers were being recruited on permanent contracts and 
</p>
<p>20,000 on temporary contracts, which would be offered to them under the regular budgetary category 
through the respective selection notifications. </p>

<p><b> E. Inclusive education 
</b></p>
<p>76. The 6- to 18-year-old school population with disabilities is estimated at 22 per cent 
of all students. In the education system, some 14,000 students have some form of identified 
disability. Their disabilities are often the result of illnesses, malnutrition problems in 
infancy, the legacy of the armed conflict or accidents. Many of the children suffering from 
a disability do not attend school either because the centres of education are not equipped to 
teach them or because their disabilities are considered by many in the Mayan culture to be a 
divine punishment. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur noted the need to set up special care programmes for 
students with disabilities, with specialist teachers and materials adapted to their particular 
needs.40 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur also observed the need to include a gender perspective in 
education policies with the aim of offering programmes on sexual and reproductive health 
education in the school curriculum, given the high maternal mortality rates and the 
existence of serious cases of sexual and gender-based violence against women and female 
children and adolescents, and in view of the need to build human relations founded on 
respect for all. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>79.<b> The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Guatemala, civil society 
representatives and United Nations agencies for their cooperation in what proved to 
be a successful visit. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that education is the true 
engine of development and applauds the Government&#8217;s determination in 
endeavouring to improve resource allocation for education, its self-criticism in 
recognizing the huge challenges and its resolve not to be discouraged by what is 
certainly an unattractive prospect. That commitment should be supported by all 
sectors of society, including, first and foremost, Congress. A major effort is 
nonetheless necessary to reach national strategic agreements that are not questioned 
with changes of government or municipal authorities. In this connection, the Special 
Rapporteur notes with concern the low level of investment in education, which is 
approximately 2 per cent of GDP (the lowest in the region), although the President of 
the Education Commission of Congress assured him that for 2009 there would be an 
increase for education equivalent to 0.5 per cent of GDP. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Special Rapporteur noted that indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education was 
in practice confined to the issue of bilingualism despite the fact that plans and 
programmes established some years previously had incorporated culture as a 
substantive topic. Although the structure of the Ministry of Education includes a 
deputy minister&#8217;s office and a directorate for intercultural bilingual education, most 
activities focus on the teaching of indigenous languages for students in the first three 
years of primary schooling only, at a very small number of State schools and solely for 
indigenous pupils and in a few languages, but not on promoting the study of the 
cultures, world views, arts or ancestral traditions of this country&#8217;s first peoples.

 The Government reported that the Inclusive Schools for Special Children Programme announced in 
</p>
<p>October 2008 aimed to cater in 2009 for 9,000 children with disabilities or special educational needs, 
with the support of 200 educators and 200 peripatetic teachers. </p>

<p>GE.09-13008 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Special Rapporteur observed that existing legislation, including 
constitutional provisions, revealed a gulf between the law and its practical application. 
Constitutional principles on education must cease to be a dead letter and become 
everyday practice guiding concrete actions. The exclusion, discrimination and even 
racism which still persist in Guatemala have well-known historical roots and affect 
primarily indigenous populations and communities of mixed descent living in rural 
areas and, within them, children and young persons. In the sphere of education, these 
social problems have given rise to marked disparities and imbalances in enrolment 
and dropout rates, which hamper the realization of the human right to education, 
affecting over one million children. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Special Rapporteur also notes that the trend is towards privatization of 
education, which undermines the principle of free primary and lower secondary 
education, as established in international human rights instruments, and conflicts with 
the principles of education for all and with article 71 of the Constitution. Many 
families have to meet various school fees and expenses, ranging from small 
contributions to the payment of teachers&#8217; salaries. It is also striking to note that 80 per 
cent of secondary education is in the hands of private schools, which makes it 
impossible for thousands of families to ensure lower or upper secondary schooling for 
their children owing to their poverty status. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur could nevertheless observe progress in early childhood 
education coverage (48 per cent in 2006). It is encouraging to note major progress in 
primary enrolment, which must now be supplemented by sustained efforts to reduce 
the high dropout rates. Also, the conditional cash transfers programme being 
promoted by the Government is a scheme which is boosting education, as are the 
various vouchers granted both to students and to teachers. The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges and appreciates these endeavours and calls upon the competent 
authorities to continue and expand them. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In the light of these conclusions, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations to the Government of Guatemala: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
with a view to developing the legal and institutional mechanisms for its 
implementation and establishing an inclusive education model; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Repeal of Governmental Decision No. 399-68, which authorizes 
education levies payable by families; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Creation of a legal mechanism to ensure an increase in investment in 
education of 0.5 per cent of GDP per annum so that the rate remains constant until it 
progressively reaches 6 per cent of GDP, with priority given to combating 
discrimination in education and promoting quality. Public oversight of this 
mechanism should be fostered and individuals and communities should be guaranteed 
the possibility of demanding it. The Special Rapporteur calls for a reform of tax policy 
to allow the necessary revenues to be collected so that the State can meet its education 
obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Setting up and entry into operation as soon as possible of the National 
Education Council, as established under the Constitution, and of other consultative, 
advisory and decision-making bodies on education policies that are essential to 
building democratic and participatory societies. The National Education Council 
should receive appropriate funding so that it can progress as a body with the capacity 
to participate in education policymaking. It should also take over education reform 
monitoring under its mandate to avoid starting from scratch, commencing with an 
examination of Guatemala&#8217;s education commitments; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/8/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.09-13008 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Securing of national political consensus so that the State grants an 
adequate budget to fulfil its obligation in this regard. That budget should not be 
regressive and efforts should be made to reach national agreements that are not 
overturned with each change of government; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Promotion of the participatory design of a State policy for education that 
will make it possible to regulate the National Education Act on the basis of 
Guatemala&#8217;s international obligations and the intercultural needs of the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Incorporation of gender mainstreaming in education policymaking to 
foster the inclusion of sexual and reproductive health education in the school 
curriculum;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Stronger involvement of the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in 
mechanisms for the enforceability and justiciability of the right to education; 
 (i) Implementation of affirmative action as a matter of national urgency to 
promote and enhance the status of indigenous languages and cultures in order to show 
to all groups of society (including non-indigenous groups) the benefits of a culturally 
and linguistically focused education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Establishment, within all ministerial departments, of the criteria of 
multiculturalism, interculturalism and multilingualism in the design and 
implementation of projects and programmes developed at the Ministry of Education; 
 (k) Mainstreaming of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in all ministerial measures, 
which should make curricular activities a vehicle for affirmative action in their favour 
so that the specificities of indigenous peoples are not seen as an adjunct to the basic 
national curriculum, in which indigenous communities do not always feel represented; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Review of the role of the Office of the Deputy Minister of Intercultural 
Bilingual Education so that it can be accorded greater decision-making authority both 
in the development of curriculum policies and in the general administration of 
institutional processes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Ensuring of an equitable and appropriate ministerial distribution in the 
programming and execution of loans granted by international organizations to the 
national education system for the educational advancement of indigenous peoples; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Support for plans to expand and strengthen State secondary and 
university education, with the provision of greater resources to those levels, without 
any reduction in funds earmarked for the lower levels, and the training of a larger 
number of teachers so that State education is made accessible to all. The State 
university (University of San Carlos) should be provided with adequate resources, as 
allocated to it by law, to allow the execution of programmes for the professional 
development of the teaching force; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) Improvement of school infrastructure (with priority given to the 
supplying of water and electricity to centres of education) since very serious 
challenges still exist owing to the lack of financial resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) Increase in the intercultural bilingual education budget in proportion to 
the population served by the 13 departmental directorates for intercultural bilingual 
education in 2009; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/8/Add.3

<p><b> (q) Execution of the first phase of the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education,41 covering public officials and members of the municipal authorities and 
councils, in accordance with the mandate established by the Constitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (r) Continued implementation of the cash transfers programme, which 
makes it possible to help ease the financial burden of families wishing to send their 
children to school. The arrangements should allow the correct identification of the 
beneficiary population, technical follow-up and linkage of the programme to the 
country&#8217;s budgetary developments so that it does not become a process based on 
favouritism, to which end it would be necessary to improve the monitoring 
mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (s) Guaranteeing of the legal, technical and administrative processes and 
resources necessary to achieve a genuine and effective transformation of the 13 
departmental directorates for education into directorates for intercultural bilingual 
education;

<p><b> (t) Development of direct and positive encouragement of the recruitment of 
bilingual teachers so that new teaching posts are assigned to serving the educational 
needs of indigenous communities. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that 
intercultural bilingual specialists be hired for the purpose of providing specialized 
teaching support in intercultural bilingual classes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (u) Promotion of an indigenous-language literacy training scheme for public 
officials which includes at least the instrumental use of the mother tongues of peoples 
living in regions where they work and the development of awareness of the value of 
cultures. The Special Rapporteur also recommends the establishment of clear 
guidelines and the effective application of the intercultural bilingual education 
methodology in initial teacher training, in particular that offered by intercultural 
bilingual teacher-training colleges; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (v) Preparation of textbooks and educational materials for the Gar&#237;funa and 
Xinka peoples and of intercultural bilingual education support and reference 
materials and textbooks for lower secondary education and initial teacher training; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (w) Development of an effective care system for indigenous children who 
have for various reasons moved to the large cities, in particular the capital, in order to 
alleviate loss of identity and acculturation. To that end, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends the adequate provision of teachers and educational materials to enable 
such children to receive an education of cultural and linguistic relevance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (x) Setting up of special care programmes for students with disabilities, with 
specialist teachers and materials adapted to their special needs.
