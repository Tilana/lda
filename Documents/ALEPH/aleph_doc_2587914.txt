Article II
The Credits
Section 2.01         Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Loans to
the Borrower during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (a) such Lender’s
Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (b) the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding
the total Commitments. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower
may borrow, repay and reborrow the Loans.
Section 2.02         Loans and Borrowings.
(a)          Borrowings; Several Obligations. Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by
the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required
to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments are several
and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.
(b)         Types of Loans. Subject to Section 3.03, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar
Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by
causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
30
(c)          Minimum Amounts; Limitation on Number of Borrowings. At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less
than $1,000,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, an ABR Borrowing
may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments or that is required to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.08(e). Borrowings of more than one Type
may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of four (4) Eurodollar
Borrowings outstanding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to
request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Maturity Date.
(d)          Notes and Colombian Notes. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of
the Borrower in substantially the form of Exhibit A, and a single Colombian Note of the Borrower in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, dated, in the case of (i) any Lender party hereto as of the date of this Agreement, as
of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) any Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption,
as of the effective date of the Assignment and Assumption, payable to such Lender in a principal amount equal to its
Maximum Credit Amount as in effect on such date, and otherwise duly completed. In the event that any Lender’s Maximum
Credit Amount increases or decreases for any reason (whether pursuant to Section 2.06, Section 12.04(b) or otherwise),
the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered on the effective date of such increase or decrease, a new Note payable
to such Lender in a principal amount equal to its Maximum Credit Amount after giving effect to such increase or decrease,
and otherwise duly completed. The date, amount, Type, interest rate and, if applicable, Interest Period of each Loan made
by each Lender, and all payments made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books
for its Note. Failure to make any such recordation shall not affect any Lender’s or the Borrower’s rights or obligations in
respect of such Loans or affect the validity of such transfer by any Lender of its Note.
Section 2.03         Requests for Borrowings. To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of
such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three
Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00
noon, New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that no such notice shall be required for any
deemed request of an ABR Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.08(e).
Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in substantially the form of Exhibit B, and signed by the
Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02:
(i)          the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
(ii)         the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)        whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
(iv)        in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”;
31
(v)         the amount of the then effective Borrowing Base, the current total Revolving Credit Exposures (without regard to the
requested Borrowing) and the pro forma total Revolving Credit Exposures (giving effect to the requested Borrowing); and
(vi)        the location and number of the Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
requirements of Section 2.05.
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no
Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Each Borrowing Request shall constitute a representation by the
Borrower that the amount of the requested Borrowing shall not cause the total Revolving Credit Exposures to exceed the
total Commitments (i.e., the lesser of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts and the then effective Borrowing Base).
Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall
advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested
Borrowing.
Section 2.04         Interest Elections.
(a)          Conversion and Continuance. Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing
Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.04. The
Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such
portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans
comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)          Interest Election Requests. To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.04, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section
2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date
of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by
hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in substantially the form of
Exhibit C and signed by the Borrower.
(c)          Information in Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)          the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with
respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
information to be specified pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(ii) and (iii) shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)         the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
32
(iii)        whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv)        if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(d)          Notice to Lenders by the Administrative Agent. Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting
Borrowing.
(e)          Effect of Failure to Deliver Timely Interest Election Request and Events of Default and Borrowing Base
Deficiencies on Interest Election. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a
Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default or a Borrowing Base Deficiency has occurred and is
continuing: (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing (and any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be ineffective) and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
Section 2.05         Funding of Borrowings.
(a)          Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof
by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 pm, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent
most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower
designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Loans made to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.08(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the
Issuing Bank. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for its Loan in any particular place
or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for its Loan in any
particular place or manner.
(b)          Presumption of Funding by the Lenders. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available
on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing
available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the
case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.
33
Section 2.06         Termination and Reduction of Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.
(a)          Scheduled Termination of Commitments. Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the
Maturity Date. If at any time the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts or the Borrowing Base is terminated or reduced to
zero, then the Commitments shall terminate on the effective date of such termination or reduction.
(b)          Optional Termination and Reduction of Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.
(i)          The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts;
provided that (A) each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be in an amount that is an integral
multiple of $100,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (B) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate
Maximum Credit Amounts if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section
3.04(c)(i), the total Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
(ii)         The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Aggregate Maximum
Credit Amounts under Section 2.06(b)(i) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to
this Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be irrevocable; provided, that a notice of termination of the Aggregate Maximum Credit
Amounts may be conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or another event, in which case, such notice
may be revoked by the Borrower (with notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date of such
notice of termination) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit
Amounts shall be permanent and may not be reinstated. Each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall
be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with each Lender’s Applicable Percentage.
Section 2.07         Borrowing Base.
(a)          Initial Borrowing Base. For the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the first
Redetermination Date, the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $200,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Borrowing Base may be subject to further adjustments from time to time pursuant to Section 2.07 or Section 9.11(d).
34
(b)          Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations. The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually in
accordance with this Section 2.07 (a “Scheduled Redetermination”), and, subject to Section 2.07(d), such redetermined
Borrowing Base shall become effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders on
May 1st and November 1st of each year, commencing May 1st, 2016. In addition, the Borrower may, by notifying the
Administrative Agent thereof, and the Administrative Agent may, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, by notifying the
Borrower thereof, one time during any 12 month period, each elect to cause the Borrowing Base to be redetermined
between Scheduled Redeterminations (an “Interim Redetermination”) in accordance with this Section 2.07.
(c)          Scheduled and Interim Redetermination Procedure.
(i)          Each Scheduled Redetermination and each Interim Redetermination shall be effectuated as follows: Upon receipt
by the Administrative Agent of (A) the Reserve Report and the certificate required to be delivered by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c), and, in the case of
an Interim Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.12(b) and (c), and (B) such other reports, data and supplemental
information, including, without limitation, the information provided pursuant to Section 8.12(c), as may, from time to time, be
reasonably requested by the Majority Lenders (the Reserve Report, such certificate and such other reports, data and
supplemental information being the “Engineering Reports”), the Administrative Agent shall evaluate the information
contained in the Engineering Reports and shall, in good faith, propose a new Borrowing Base (the “Proposed Borrowing
Base”) based upon such information and such other information (including, without limitation, the status of title information
with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties as described in the Engineering Reports and the existence of any other Debt) as
the Administrative Agent deems appropriate in its sole discretion and consistent with its normal oil and gas lending criteria
as it exists at the particular time. In no event shall the Proposed Borrowing Base exceed the Aggregate Maximum Credit
Amounts.
(ii)         The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Proposed Borrowing Base (the
“Proposed Borrowing Base Notice”):
(A)         in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination (1) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering
Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner,
then on or before the April 15th and October 15th of such year following the date of delivery or (2) if the Administrative
Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections
8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then promptly after the Administrative Agent has received complete
Engineering Reports from the Borrower and has had a reasonable opportunity to determine the Proposed Borrowing Base
in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i); and
(B)         in the case of an Interim Redetermination, promptly, and in any event, within fifteen (15) days after the
Administrative Agent has received the required Engineering Reports.
35
(iii)        Any Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved by all of
the Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii); and any Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the
Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or be deemed to have been approved by the Required Lenders as
provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii). Upon receipt of the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice, each Lender shall have fifteen
(15) days to agree with the Proposed Borrowing Base or disagree with the Proposed Borrowing Base by proposing an
alternate Borrowing Base. If at the end of such fifteen (15) days, any Lender has not communicated its approval or
disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent of such Proposed Borrowing Base which would decrease or maintain the
Borrowing Base then in effect, such silence shall be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Borrowing Base. If, at the
end of such 15-day period, all of the Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing
Base then in effect have approved, or the Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would
decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect have approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the
Proposed Borrowing Base shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d). If,
however, at the end of such 15-day period, all of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, have not approved or
deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Administrative Agent shall poll the Lenders to ascertain the highest
Borrowing Base then acceptable to a number of Lenders sufficient to constitute the Required Lenders and, so long as such
amount does not increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective
on the date specified in Section 2.07(d).
(d)          Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base. After a redetermined Borrowing Base is approved by all of the
Lenders or approved or deemed to be approved by the Required Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(iii),
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the amount of the redetermined Borrowing Base (the
“New Borrowing Base Notice”), and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective and applicable to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders:
(i)          in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering
Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner,
then on May 1st or November 1st, as applicable, following such notice, or (B) if the Administrative Agent shall not have
received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely
and complete manner, then on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such notice; and
(ii)         in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such notice.
Such amount shall then become the Borrowing Base until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date, the next Interim
Redetermination Date or the next adjustment to the Borrowing Base under Section 2.07(e), Section 2.07(f) or Section
9.11(d), whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled Redetermination or Interim Redetermination
shall become effective until the New Borrowing Base Notice related thereto is received by the Borrower.
(e)          Failure to Cure Title. If the applicable Credit Party does not cure any title defect or discharge any Lien pursuant to
Section 8.13(b) to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent within sixty (60) days following the earlier of (A) the date on
which the Parent or the Borrower shall have given the notice referred to in this Section, (B) the date a Responsible Officer
of the Parent or the Borrower has become aware of such title defect or Lien and (C) the date that the Administrative Agent
has notified the Parent or the Borrower of such title defect or Lien, then the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders
may cause the Borrowing Base to be reduced by an amount equal to the value (or such portion thereof which has been
impaired) assigned to such Hydrocarbon Interests in the most recent Borrowing Base.
36
(f)          Reduction of Borrowing Base Related to Swap Agreements and Asset Dispositions.
(i)          If any Swap Agreement in respect of commodities to which the Parent or any Credit Party is a party is Liquidated,
and the aggregate the value assigned to the Liquidated portion of such Swap Agreement in the then effective Borrowing
Base, when aggregated with the value assigned to (A) the Liquidated portion of all Swap Agreements in respect of
commodities Liquidated since the last Scheduled Redetermination Date, plus (B) all Oil and Gas Properties disposed of
pursuant to Section 9.11(d) since the last Scheduled Redetermination Date, is in excess of five percent (5%) of the then
effective Borrowing Base, then contemporaneously therewith, the Borrowing Base then in effect shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the value, if any, assigned to the Liquidated portion of such Swap Agreement in the then effective
Borrowing Base, as determined by the Administrative Agent and approved by the by the Majority Lenders.
(g)          The Borrowing Base shall also be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 9.11(d).
(h)          Determinations; Adjustments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all
determinations and redeterminations and adjustments by the Administrative Agent (and any determinations and decisions
by each of the Lenders or the Required Lenders in connection therewith, or in connection with the provisions of Section
9.11(d), including any thereof approving or disapproving a proposed redetermination or redetermination by the
Administrative Agent or effecting any adjustment to any element included in a Reserve Report or the determination or
redetermination of the Borrowing Base) shall be made by any such Person as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion
and consistent with its normal oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the particular time, and any such determination,
redetermination or adjustment shall consider any other relevant information or factors, including without limitation, any
additional Debt or other obligations that have been incurred or that the Parent and the Subsidiaries intend or expect to
incur that such Person may deem appropriate in its sole discretion.
Section 2.08         Letters of Credit.
(a)          General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of US Dollar
denominated Letters of Credit for its own account or for the account of any of its Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability
Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed the LC Commitment; provided that the Borrower may not request the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of Letters of Credit hereunder if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists at such
time or would exist as a result thereof. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions

37
(i)          requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended;
(ii)         specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day);
(iii)        specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.08(c));
(iv)        specifying the amount of such Letter of Credit;
(v)         specifying the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to

such time, the current total Revolving Credit Exposures (without regard to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit) and the pro forma total Revolving Credit Exposures
(giving effect to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of
Credit).
A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and each notice shall constitute a representation
and warranty by the Borrower that), after giving effect to the requested issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as
applicable, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not
exceed the total Commitments (i.e., the lesser of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts and the then effective Borrowing
Base).
If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank’s standard
form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.
(c)          Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date
one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year
after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
(d)          Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount
thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to
each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.08(e), or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.08(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default, the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency or
reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever.
38
(e)          Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower
shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement
not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have
received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not
been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i)
the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that if such LC Disbursement is not less than
$1,000,000, the Borrower shall, subject to the conditions to Borrowing set forth herein, be deemed to have requested, and
the Borrower does hereby request under such circumstances, that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and
such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to
the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(e), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to
the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such
Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this Section
2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated
above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)          Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.08(e)
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other
document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit
Agreement, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might,
but for the provisions of this Section 2.08(f), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against,
the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any
Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred
to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing
thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by
the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank’s
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply
with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank
shall be deemed to have exercised all requisite care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and
without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either
accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
39
(g)          Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to
any such LC Disbursement.
(h)          Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, until the Borrower shall have
reimbursed the Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a Borrowing under Section 2.08(e)),
the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to
but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
Loans. Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.08(h) shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest
accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be
for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i)          Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become
effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
3.05(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (a) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (b)
references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or
to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank
hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations
of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall
not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
40
(j)          Cash Collateralization.
(i)          If (A) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative
Agent or the Majority Lenders demanding that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the outstanding LC Exposure pursuant to
this Section 2.08(j), (B) the Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in
connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), or (C) the Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize a
Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(B), then the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize such LC
Exposure or the excess attributable to such LC Exposure, as the case may be, as of such date plus any accrued and
unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to Cash Collateralize pursuant to this Section 2.08(j) shall become
effective immediately, and the Borrower’s obligation to Cash Collateralize shall become immediately due and payable,
without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 10.01(h),
Section 10.01(i) or Section 10.01(j).
(ii)         The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, an
exclusive first priority and continuing perfected security interest in and Lien on each account (a “Collateral Account”) in
which the Borrower has Cash Collateralized any obligation hereunder and all cash, checks, drafts, certificates and
instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held in such account, all deposits or wire transfers made thereto, any and
all investments purchased with funds deposited in such account, all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets
and other Property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise payable in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of
the foregoing, and all proceeds, products, accessions, rents, profits, income and benefits therefrom, and any substitutions
and replacements therefor (collectively, the “Cash Collateral”).
(iii)        The Borrower’s obligation to Cash Collateralize pursuant to this Section 2.08(j) shall be absolute and
unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion
of such amount under the terms of a Letter of Credit, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be
subject to any defense or be affected by a right of set-off, counterclaim or recoupment which any Credit Party may now or
hereafter have against any such beneficiary, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person
for any reason whatsoever.
(iv)        Each Collateral Account and all Cash Collateral shall secure the payment and performance of the Credit Parties’
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion
and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over each Collateral Account and the Cash Collateral. Other than
any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion
of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits,
if any, on such investments shall accumulate in each Collateral Account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC
Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the
Credit Parties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If the Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize
hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and the Borrower is not otherwise required to pay to the
Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section
3.04(c) or Cash Collateralize a Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(B), then such amount (to
the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default
have been cured or waived.
41
(k)          Use of Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuing Bank shall have no obligation
hereunder to issue, and shall not issue, any Letter of Credit (i) if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or if
any Governmental Requirement relating to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank
refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing
Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not
otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which the Issuing Bank in good
faith deems material to it, or (ii) if the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing
Bank applicable to letters of credit generally; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements or directives
thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in the implementation thereof, and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines,
requirements or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case
pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed not to be in effect on the Effective Date for purposes of clause (ii)
above, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.
(l)          Issuing Bank Reports to the Administrative Agent. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, any
Issuing Bank that is not the Administrative Agent or an Affiliate thereof shall, in addition to its notification obligations set
forth elsewhere in this Section, report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) periodic activity (for such period or recurrent
periods as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent) in respect of Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank,
including all issuances, extensions, amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancelations and all disbursements
and reimbursements, (ii) reasonably prior to the time that the Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of
Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the stated amount of the Letters of Credit issued,
amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which the Issuing Bank
makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iv) on any Business Day on which the
Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to the Issuing Bank on such day, the date of
such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement, and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank.
42
(m)          LC Exposure Determination. For all purposes of this Agreement, the amount of a Letter of Credit that, by its terms
or the terms of any document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof
shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether
or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at the time of determination.
Section 2.09         Replacements of Lenders under Certain Circumstances.
(a)          With the consent of the Administrative Agent, not to be unreasonably withheld, the Borrower shall be permitted to
replace any Lender that (i) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.03 or Section
5.05, (ii) is affected in the manner described in Section 3.03(b) and as a result thereof any of the actions described in such
Section is required to be taken, or (iii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank, lending institution or other
financial institution; provided that (A) such replacement does not conflict with any requirement of Law, (B) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (C) the replacement bank or institution shall
purchase, at par, all Loans and the Borrower shall pay all other amounts, including pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.03
or Section 5.05, as the case may be, owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of replacement, (D) the replacement
bank or institution, if not already a Lender, and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), (E) the replaced Lender
shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.04(a) (provided, that the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (F) any such replacement
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have
against the replaced Lender.
(b)          If any Lender (such Lender, a “Non-Consenting Lender”) (i) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment,
waiver, discharge or termination that pursuant to the terms of Section 12.02 requires the consent of all of the Lenders
affected or the Required Lenders and with respect to which the Majority Lenders shall have granted their consent, or (ii)
does not approve a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have
approved such proposed increase, then provided no Event of Default then exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless
such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent), with the consent of the Administrative Agent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to assign its Loans and its
Commitments hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and if a
Commitment is being assigned, the Letter of Credit Issuer); provided that: (A) all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such
Non-Consenting Lender being replaced (other than principal and interest) shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting
Lender concurrently with such assignment, and (B) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such
Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In
connection with any such assignment, the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the
replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 12.04.
(c)          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that any assignment pursuant to the
terms of this Section 2.09 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender making such assignment need not be a party thereto.
43
Article III
Payments of Principal and Interest; Prepayments; Fees
Section 3.01         Repayment of Loans. The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Termination Date.
Section 3.02         Interest.
(a)          ABR Loans. The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(b)          Eurodollar Loans. The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate
for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate.
(c)          Post-Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or if any
principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Credit Party hereunder or under any other
Loan Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and including any
payments in respect of a Borrowing Base Deficiency under Section 3.04(c), then, upon notice thereof to the Borrower from
the Administrative Agent, all Loans outstanding, in the case of an Event of Default, and such overdue amount, in the case
of a failure to pay amounts when due, shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to two
percent (2%) plus (i) in the case of overdue principal, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto, and (ii) in the
case of all other overdue amounts, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided
in Section 3.02(a), but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(d)          Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
for such Loan and on the Termination Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to Section 3.02(c) shall be payable
on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than an optional prepayment of an ABR
Loan prior to the Termination Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the
date of such repayment or prepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(e)          Interest Rate Computations. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless
such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times
when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366
days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and be binding upon the parties
hereto.
44
Section 3.03         Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
(a)          the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate
and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining (including, without limitation, by means of an Interpolated Rate) the
Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b)          the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate, as
applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining
their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as
promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of
any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made either as an ABR Borrowing or at an alternate
rate of interest determined by the Required Lenders as their cost of funds.
Section 3.04         Prepayments.
(a)          Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 3.04(b).
(b)          Notice and Terms of Optional Prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an
ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each
such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or
portion thereof to be prepaid; provided, that a notice of prepayment of all outstanding Loans may be conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities or another event, in which case, such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (with
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date of such notice of termination) if such condition is
not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise
the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be
permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a
Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02 and any payments to the extent required by Section 5.02.
(c)          Mandatory Prepayments.
(i)          If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts pursuant to Section
2.06(b), the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the total Commitments, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the
Borrowings on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, and (B) if
any excess remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, Cash Collateralize such excess as
provided in Section 2.08(j).
45
(ii)         Upon any redetermination of or adjustment to the amount of the Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(a)
through (d), if the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the redetermined or adjusted Borrowing Base, then the
Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess and/or add to the
Mortgaged Property Oil and Gas Properties having value, as determined by the Administrative Agent and the Required
Lenders, equal to or greater than such excess, or a combination thereof and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of
the Borrowings or adding such Oil and Gas Properties to the Mortgaged Property as a result of an LC Exposure, Cash
Collateralize such excess as provided in Section 2.08(j). The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment, add
such Oil and Gas Properties and/or Cash Collateralize such excess (A) in the case of a redetermination pursuant to
Section 2.07(a) through (d), no later than the date that is 90 days following the date it receives the New Borrowing Base
Notice in accordance with Section 2.07(d); and (B) in the case of adjustment pursuant to Section 2.07(e) on the date the
adjustment occurs; provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.04(c)(ii) must be made on or
prior to the Termination Date.
(iii)        Upon any adjustments to the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 9.11(d), if the total Revolving Credit Exposures
exceeds the Borrowing Base as adjusted, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate principal
amount equal to such excess or add to the Mortgaged Property Oil and Gas Properties having value, as determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, equal to or greater than such excess, or implement a combination thereof,
and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings or adding such Oil and Gas Properties to the Mortgaged
Property as a result of an LC Exposure, Cash Collateralize such excess as provided in Section 2.08(j). The Borrower shall
be obligated to make such prepayment, add such Oil and Gas Properties and/or Cash Collateralize such excess in the
case of an adjustment to the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 9.11(d), on or prior to the Business Day following the date
that the relevant Liquidation, sale or other disposition occurs; provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to
this Section 3.04(c)(iii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.
(iv)        Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied, first, ratably to any ABR
Borrowings then outstanding, and, second, to any Eurodollar Borrowings then outstanding, and if more than one Eurodollar
Borrowing is then outstanding, to each such Eurodollar Borrowing in order of priority beginning with the Eurodollar
Borrowing with the least number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto and ending with the Eurodollar
Borrowing with the most number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto.
(v)         Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in
the prepaid Borrowings. Prepayments pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 3.02.
(d)          No Premium or Penalty. Prepayments permitted or required under this Section 3.04 shall be without premium or
penalty, except as required under Section 5.02.
46
Section 3.05         Fees.
(a)          Commitment Fees. Subject to Section 4.03(c)(i), the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of
the unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to
but excluding the Termination Date (it being understood that the LC Exposure shall constitute usage of the Commitments
for purposes of this Section 3.05(a)). Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case such commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365
days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).
(b)          Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a
participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin
used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender’s LC
Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the date of this Agreement to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Commitment terminates
and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall
accrue at the rate of 0.250% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure; provided that in no event shall such fee be less than $500 during any quarter, and (iii) to the Issuing Bank, for its
own account, its standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of
March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day,
commencing on the first such date to occur after the date of this Agreement; provided that all such fees shall be payable on
the Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Termination Date shall be payable on demand. Upon notice
thereof to the Borrower from the Administrative Agent, during the continuation of an Event of Default, the fees payable
pursuant to this Section 3.05(b) shall increase by 2.00% per annum over the then-applicable rate. Any other fees payable
to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 3.05(b) shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation and
fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate, in which case such fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year),
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(c)          Fee Letter. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Person therein
specified, the fees payable in the amounts and at the times stated in the Fee Letter.

Article IV
Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
Section 4.01         Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a)          Payments by the Borrower. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether
of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 5.01, Section 5.02,
Section 5.03 or otherwise) prior to 1:00 pm, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds,
without defense, deduction, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Fees, once paid, shall be fully earned and shall not be
refundable under any circumstances. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices specified in Section 12.01,
except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall
be made in US Dollars.
(b)          Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second,
towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c)          Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting
in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving
such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in
LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to
which the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it
may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
48
Section 4.02         Presumption of Payment by the Borrower. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders
or the Issuing Bank that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower
has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day
from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Section 4.03         Defaulting Lenders.
(a)          If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b), Section 2.08(d),
Section 2.08(e), Section 4.02, Section 5.03(f) or Section 12.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender’s
obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid in cash, and/or (ii) hold any such
amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender
under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion.
(b)          If a Defaulting Lender (or a Lender who would be a Defaulting Lender but for the expiration of the relevant grace
period) as a result of the exercise of a set-off shall have received a payment in respect of its Revolving Credit Exposure
which results in its Revolving Credit Exposure being less than its Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit
Exposures, then no payments will be made to such Defaulting Lender until such time as such Defaulting Lender shall have
complied with Section 4.03(c) and all amounts due and owing to the Lenders have been equalized in accordance with
each Lender’s respective pro rata share of the Secured Obligations. Further, if at any time prior to the acceleration or
maturity of the Loans, the Administrative Agent shall receive any payment in respect of principal of a Loan or a
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement while one or more Defaulting Lenders shall be party to this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall apply such payment first to the Borrowing(s) for which such Defaulting Lender(s) shall have
failed to fund its pro rata share until such time as such Borrowing(s) are paid in full or each Lender (including each
Defaulting Lender) is owed its Applicable Percentage of all Loans then outstanding. After acceleration or maturity of the
Loans, subject to the first sentence of this Section 4.03(b), all principal will be paid ratably as provided in Section 10.02(c).
(c)          Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then
the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(i)          Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 3.05.
49
(ii)         The Commitment, the Maximum Credit Amount and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall
not be included in determining whether all Lenders, the Required Lenders or the Majority Lenders have taken or may take
any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 12.02); provided that (A) any
waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender pursuant to Section 12.02
(other than Section 12.02(b)(ii)), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender and (B) any redetermination, whether
an increase, decrease or affirmation, of the Borrowing Base shall occur without the participation of such Defaulting Lender,
but the Commitment (i.e., such Defaulting Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Borrowing Base) of such Defaulting
Lender may not be increased without the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
(iii)        If any LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(A)         all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting
Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (for the purposes of such reallocation the Defaulting
Lender’s Commitment shall be disregarded in determining the Non-Defaulting Lender’s Applicable Percentage) but only to
the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s LC
Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments, (y) the conditions set forth in Section 6.02
are satisfied at such time, and (z) the sum of each Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure plus its reallocated
share of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment; provided that
no such reallocation will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting
Lender;
(B)         if the reallocation described in Section 4.03(c)(iii)(A) cannot, or can only partially, be effected, then the Borrower
shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent Cash Collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing
Bank only the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any
partial reallocation pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(A)) pursuant to Section 2.08(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is
outstanding;
(C)         if the Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to Section
4.03(c)(iii)(B), then the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
3.05(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is
Cash Collateralized;
(D)         if the LC Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(A), then the fees
payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.05(a) and Section 3.05(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-
Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Percentages; and
50
(E)         if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither Cash Collateralized nor reallocated
pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender
hereunder, all commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to
the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and all letter of credit fees
payable under Section 3.05(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank
until such LC Exposure is Cash Collateralized and/or reallocated.
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long
as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its
obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Bank shall not
be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Bank shall have entered into arrangements
with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of
such Lender hereunder.
(d)          In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender
has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender and such Lender is no longer a
Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s
Commitment and on such date, if necessary, such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans and/or participations in
Letters of Credit of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such
Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; provided that no adjustments will be made
retroactively with respect to fees accrued while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to
the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-
Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having
been a Defaulting Lender.
Article V
Increased Costs; Break Funding Payments; Taxes; Illegality
Section 5.01         Increased Costs.
(a)          Eurodollar Changes in Law. If any Change in Law shall:
(i)          impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted
LIBO Rate);
(ii)         subject any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes described in Section 5.03 or
Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves,
other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)        impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar
Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar
Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender or the Issuing Bank (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, the
Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
51
(b)          Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s capital or on
the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s policies
and the policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time
to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such
reduction suffered.
(c)          Certificates. A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 5.01(a)
or (b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such
Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.
(d)          Effect of Failure or Delay in Requesting Compensation. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the Issuing
Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or
the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 5.01 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 365 days prior to
the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 365-day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 5.02         Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other
than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion
of any Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure
to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or
(d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.04, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for
the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted
LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have
been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for
such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for US
Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.
52
A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Section 5.03         Taxes.
(a)          Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any
Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law;
provided that if any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required to deduct any Taxes from such payments,
then (i) in the case of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased
as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 5.03(a)), the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party or the Administrative
Agent shall make such deductions and (iii) such Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)          Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties. The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse the Administrative
Agent for the payment of any Other Taxes.
(c)          Indemnification by the Credit Parties. The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative
Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Credit Party hereunder or
in connection with any Loan Document or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent,
such Lender or the Issuing Bank (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section 5.03) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate of the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth in
reasonable detail the amount of such payment or liability under this Section 5.03 shall be delivered to the Borrower and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)          Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any
Credit Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
53
(e)          Tax Documentation. Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to
payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it
previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other
than such documentation set forth in the immediately succeeding sentence below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed
cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of
FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with
their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 5.03(e),
“FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f)          Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days
after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has
not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.04(c)(ii)
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case,
that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to
set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by
the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under
this Section 5.03(f).
54
(g)          Tax Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund
of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.03, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only
to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 5.03 with respect
to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender incurred as a result of receiving such refund or in connection with paying over such
refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the
amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to
repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no
event will the Administrative Agent or a Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph
(g) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position
than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to
such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional
amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 5.03 shall not be construed to require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it
deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(h)          Defined Term. For purposes of this Section 5.03, the term “Lender” includes Issuing Bank and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
Section 5.04         Designation of Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts
payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03, as the case may be, in the future and (b) would not subject such Lender
to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The
Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.
Section 5.05         Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for
any Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans, including without
limitation any illegality due to any economic or financial Sanctions, either generally or having a particular Interest Period
hereunder, then (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof and such Lender’s
obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended (the “Affected Loans”) until such time as such Lender may
again make and maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (b) all Affected Loans which would otherwise be made by such
Lender shall be made instead as ABR Loans (and, if such Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the

improvements, fixtures and equipment owned in whole or in part by any Credit Party that are necessary to conduct normal

(vi)       sixth, any excess, after all of the Secured Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, shall be paid
to the Borrower or as otherwise required by any Governmental Requirement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts received from the Parent or any Guarantor that is not an “eligible contract
participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations (it being
understood, that in the event that any amount is applied to the Secured Obligations other than Excluded Swap Obligations
as a result of this clause, the Administrative Agent shall make such adjustments as it determines are appropriate to
distributions pursuant to clause fourth above from amounts received from “eligible contract participants” under the
Commodity Exchange Act to ensure, as nearly as possible, that the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to the
Secured Obligations described in clause fourth above by the holders of any Excluded Swap Obligations are the same as
the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to other Secured Obligations pursuant to clause fourth above).
Article XI
The Agents
Section 11.01       Appointment; Powers. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise
such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and neither the Borrower nor any Guarantor shall have rights
as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
93
Section 11.02       Duties and Obligations of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the
Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing (the use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the
Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable law; rather, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties), (b) the Administrative Agent shall
have no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except as provided in Section 11.03,
and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Parent or any Subsidiary that is communicated to or obtained
by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall be
deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by
the Borrower or a Lender, and shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of
any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith
or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth
herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article VI or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative
Agent or as to those conditions precedent expressly required to be to the Administrative Agent’s satisfaction, (vi) the
existence, value, perfection or priority of any collateral security or the financial or other condition of the Parent or any
Subsidiary or any other obligor or guarantor, or (vii) any failure by the Borrower or any other Person (other than itself) to
perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or the performance or observance of any
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein. For purposes of determining compliance
with the conditions specified in Article VI, each Lender shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to
be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from such Lender prior to the
proposed closing date specifying its objection thereto.
94
Section 11.03       Action by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary
action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by
the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Majority
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 12.02) and in all cases the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or
under any other Loan Documents unless it shall (a) receive written instructions from the Majority Lenders or the Lenders, as
applicable, (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided
in Section 12.02) specifying the action to be taken and (b) be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all liability and expenses which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding
on all of the Lenders. If a Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite Lenders in the written instructions (with indemnities) described
in this Section 11.03; provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to
such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Administrative
Agent be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this
Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law. If a Default has occurred and is continuing, neither the Global
Coordinator or the Arranger shall have any obligation to perform any act in respect thereof. The Administrative Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders or the Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
12.02), and otherwise the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it hereunder or under
any other Loan Document or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in
connection herewith or therewith including its own ordinary negligence, except for its own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct.
Section 11.04       Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely
upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon and each of the Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby waives the right to
dispute the Administrative Agent’s record of such statement, except in the case of gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may deem
and treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof permitted hereunder shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.
Section 11.05       Subagents. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and
any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding Sections of this Article XI shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the
Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
95
Section 11.06       Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
successor Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.06, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or
without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation or removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York,
New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to
its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article XI and Section 12.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Section 11.07       Agents as Lenders. Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in
its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Parent or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
Section 11.08       No Reliance. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and each other Loan
Document to which it is a party. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from
time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The
Agents shall not be required to keep themselves informed as to the performance or observance by the Parent or any
Subsidiary of this Agreement, the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or to inspect
the Properties or books of any Credit Party. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent or the Arranger shall have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or
business of the Borrower (or any of its Affiliates) which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Affiliates.
In this regard, each Lender acknowledges that Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is acting in this transaction as special counsel to the
Administrative Agent only, except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in any legal opinion or any Loan Document.
Each other party hereto will consult with its own legal counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in connection with the
Loan Documents and the matters contemplated therein.
Section 11.09       Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the
Parent or any Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall
have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise:
96
(a)          to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the
Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective
agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Section 12.03) allowed in
such judicial proceeding; and
(b)          to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that
the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative
Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative
Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 12.03.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or
adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations
or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.
Section 11.10       Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold
from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. Without limiting the provisions of
Section 5.03(a), Section 5.03(c) or Section 5.03(f), each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall, and does hereby, indemnify the
Administrative Agent, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any and all
Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax
from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate
form was not delivered or not property executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a
change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective). A certificate as to the
amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or the Issuing Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off
and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 11.10. The agreements in this
Section 11.10 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or
the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other
Secured Obligations.
97
Section 11.11       Authority of Administrative Agent to Release Collateral and Liens.
(a)          Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver any
instruments, documents, termination statements, assignments, documents and agreements necessary or desirable, or
reasonably requested by the Borrower to evidence and confirm the release of any Guarantor or Collateral pursuant to this
Section 11.11, all without the further consent or joinder of any Lender or the Issuing Bank, at the Borrower’s sole cost and
expense.
(b)          The Lenders and the Issuance Bank hereby irrevocably agree that any Liens granted to the Administrative Agent
by the Credit Parties on any Collateral shall be automatically released (i) in full, upon the termination of this Agreement and
the payment in cash of all Obligations hereunder (except for contingent indemnification obligations in respect of which a
claim has not yet been made and except for Letters of Credit that have been cash collateralized to the satisfaction of the
Issuing Bank or as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the Issuing Bank shall have been made), (ii) upon the sale
or other disposition of such Collateral (including as part of or in connection with any other sale or other disposition
permitted hereunder) to any Person other than another Credit Party, to the extent such sale or other disposition is made in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that
effect provided to it by any Credit Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to the extent such Collateral
is comprised of property leased to a Credit Party, upon termination or expiration of such lease, (iv) if the release of such
Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of the Lenders whose
consent may be required in accordance with Section 12.02), (v) to the extent the property constituting such Collateral is
owned by any Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, and (vi) as required to effect any sale or other disposition of Collateral in
connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Security Instruments.  Any such
release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those being released)
upon (or obligations (other than those being released) of the Credit Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Credit
Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral except to the
extent otherwise released in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Documents.  Additionally, the Lenders and the
Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably agree that the Guarantors shall be released from the Guaranty Agreement (in each case,
solely with respect to the guarantee of the Obligations hereunder) upon consummation of any transaction permitted under
the terms of this Agreement and resulting in such Subsidiary ceasing to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary or Material
Subsidiary.
Section 11.12       Colombian Security Documents. Each Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, on
behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with
respect to the Collateral and the Colombian Security Documents and any other Security Instruments governed by the laws
of Colombia. Each Secured Party further authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute on its behalf, directly or through
attorneys-in-fact duly appointed for such purposes (including, without limitation, pursuant to a power of attorney in form and
substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), and to accept the benefits of, each of the Colombian Security
Documents and any other agreements or documents as may be necessary or advisable in connection with the grant of, or
attachment or perfection of, the security interest granted to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties,
pursuant to the Colombian Security Documents or any other Security Instruments governed by the laws of Colombia
(including, but not limited to, the execution, amendment, modification, waiver, supplement, cancellation and/or termination,
of the Colombian Security Documents and the filing and registration of any amendment, supplement, release and/or
cancellation before any competent registry in Colombia, in connection with the Colombian Security Documents).
98
Section 11.13      The Global Coordinator and the Arranger. None of the Mandated Lead Arranger, Lead Manager, or the
Arranger shall have any duties, responsibilities or liabilities under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents other
than their duties, responsibilities and liabilities in their capacity as Lenders hereunder.

Section 12.02       Waivers; Amendments.
(a)          No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to exercise and
no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under any of the Loan Documents
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
of the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall
in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 12.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of
whether the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of
such Default at the time.
100
(b)          Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof nor any Security Instrument nor any provision thereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and
the Majority Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment or the Maximum Credit Amount of any Lender without the written
consent of such Lender, (ii) increase the Borrowing Base without the written consent of each Lender, decrease or maintain
the Borrowing Base without the consent of the Required Lenders, or modify Section 2.07 in any manner without the
consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender); provided that a Scheduled Redetermination may be postponed
by the Majority Lenders, (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest
thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, or reduce any other Obligation hereunder or under any other Loan
Document, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) postpone the scheduled date of payment or
prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or any other Obligation hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or reduce the amount of, waive or
excuse any such payment, or postpone or extend the Termination Date without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (v) change Section 4.01(b) or Section 4.01(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) waive or amend Section 3.04(c), Section 6.01, Section
8.14, Section 9.06(c), Section 10.02(c) or Section 12.15 or change the definition of the term “Material Subsidiary”, “Reserve
Report”, “Subsidiary”, or “Unrestricted Subsidiary”, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) release any Guarantor
(except as set forth in the Guaranty Agreement), release all or substantially all of the Collateral (other than as provided in
Section 11.11), without the written consent of each Lender, or (viii) change any of the provisions of this Section 12.02(b) or
the definitions of “Required Lenders” or “Majority Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or under any other Loan Documents or
make any determination or grant any consent hereunder or any other Loan Documents, without the written consent of each
Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent, any other Agent, or the Issuing Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, such other Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) any supplement to Schedule 1.02(b) (Eligible Buyers) or Schedule 7.13 (Subsidiaries) shall be effective
simply by delivering to the Administrative Agent a supplemental schedule clearly marked as such and, upon receipt, the
Administrative Agent will promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Lenders, (b) any Security Instrument may be supplemented
to add additional collateral with the consent of the Administrative Agent and (c) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
(or other applicable Credit Party) may enter into any amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or enter into any agreement or instrument to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or
enhancement of any security interest in any Mortgaged Property or Property to become Mortgaged Property to secure the
Secured Obligations for the benefit of the Lenders or as required by any Governmental Requirement to give effect to,
protect or otherwise enhance the rights or benefits of any Lender under the Loan Documents without the consent of any
Lender. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Administrative Agent, the Parent and the Borrower may amend,
modify or supplement any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect
or inconsistency so long as such amendment, modification or supplement does not adversely affect the rights or obligations
of any Lender, and (ii) the Administrative Agent, the Parent and the Borrower may amend other provisions of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the extent explicitly permitted to do so by the terms of this Agreement or of any
other Loan Document.
Section 12.03       Expenses, Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a)          The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel (which

single firm of local or regulatory counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction and a single firm of special counsel for each
relevant specialty, in each case for the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole) and other outside
consultants for the Administrative Agent, the reasonable travel, photocopy, mailing, courier, telephone and other similar
expenses, and the cost of environmental invasive and non-invasive assessments and audits and surveys and appraisals,
in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery and administration (both before and after the execution hereof and including advice of counsel to the
Administrative Agent as to the rights and duties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect thereto) of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendments, modifications or waivers of or consents related to the
provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all

registration, recording or perfection of any security interest contemplated by this Agreement or any Security Instrument or

connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment

under this Section 12.03, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including, without
limitation, all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans or Letters of Credit.
101
(b)          The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, the Arranger, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and defend and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and related expenses, including the
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel (which shall be limited to a single firm of counsel for all Indemnitees, taken as
a whole, and, if reasonably necessary, a single firm of local or regulatory counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction and a
single firm of special counsel for each relevant specialty, in each case for all Indemnitees, taken as a whole and, solely in
the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest (as reasonably identified by an Indemnitee) where the Indemnitee
affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict, one additional firm of counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for
the affected Indemnitees similarly situated, taken as a whole), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this agreement or any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or the parties to any other
Loan Document of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by any other Loan Document, (ii) the failure of any Credit Party to comply with the terms of any
Loan Document, including this Agreement, or with any Governmental Requirement, (iii) any inaccuracy of any
representation or any breach of any warranty or covenant of any Credit Party set forth in any of the Loan Documents or any
instruments, documents or certifications delivered in connection therewith, (iv) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds therefrom, including, without limitation, (A) any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under
a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such
Letter of Credit, or (B) the payment of a drawing under any Letter of Credit notwithstanding the non-compliance, non-
delivery or other improper presentation of the documents presented in connection therewith, (v) any other aspect of the
Loan Documents, (vi) the operations of the business of the Credit Parties by the Credit Parties, (vii) any assertion that the
Lenders were not entitled to receive the proceeds received pursuant to the Security Instruments, (viii) any Environmental
Law applicable to the Credit Parties or any of their Properties or operations, including, the presence, generation, storage,
release, threatened release, use, transport, disposal, arrangement of disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials on or at
any of their Properties, (ix) the breach or non-compliance by any Credit Party with any Environmental Law applicable to
any Credit Party, (x) the past ownership by any Credit Party of any of its Properties or past activity on any of their Properties
which, though lawful and fully permissible at the time, could result in present liability, (xi) the presence, use, release,
storage, treatment, disposal, generation, threatened release, transport, arrangement for transport or arrangement for
disposal of Hazardous Materials on or at any of the Properties owned or operated by any Credit Party or any actual or
alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any Property owned or operated by any Credit Party, (xii)
any environmental liability related in any way to any Credit Party, (xiii) any other environmental, health or safety condition
in connection with the Loan Documents, or (xiv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto, and such indemnity shall extend to each Indemnitee notwithstanding the sole or concurrent
negligence of every kind or character whatsoever, whether active or passive, whether an affirmative act or an omission,
including without limitation, all types of negligent conduct identified in the restatement (second) of torts of one or more of
the Indemnitees or by reason of strict liability imposed without fault on any one or more of the Indemnitees; provided that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted
from (1) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (2) a material breach by such Indemnitee
of its obligations under this Agreement or (3) claims of one or more Indemnitees against another Indemnitee (other than
claims against the Agent or the Arrangers in their capacities as such) and not involving any act or omission of the Borrower
or any of its Related Parties. This Section 12.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that
represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
102
(c)          To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent, the Arranger or the
Issuing Bank under Section 12.03(a) or (b), each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, the Arranger or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against
such Agent, the Arranger or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
(d)          To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower and the Parent shall not assert, and each hereby waives,
any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit
or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e)          All amounts due under this Section 12.03 shall be payable promptly (but not later than ten (10) days) after written
demand therefor.
Section 12.04       Successors and Assigns.
(a)          The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of
Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent
shall be null and void), (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in
accordance with this Section 12.04 and (iii) no Lender may assign to the Borrower, an Affiliate of the Borrower, a Defaulting
Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender all or any portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement
or all or any portion of its Commitments or the Loans owing to it hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the
extent provided in Section 12.04(c)) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.
103
(b)          (i)           Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 12.04(b)(ii), any Lender may assign to one or more assignees
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:
(A)         the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if such assignment is to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, is to any other assignee
and, if the Borrower has not objected to such assignment within five (5) Business Days of notice thereof, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have consented to such assignment; and
(B)         the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
to an assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.
(ii)          Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A)         except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender
subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B)         each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement;
(C)         the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
(D)         the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;
and
(E)         in no event may any Lender assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the
Borrower, any Affiliate of the Borrower or any natural person.
104
(iii)        Subject to Section 12.04(b)(iv) and the acceptance and recording thereof, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.04 shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 12.04(c).
(iv)        The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at
one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders, and the Maximum Credit Amount of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans
and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower,
the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In connection
with any changes to the Register, if necessary, the Administrative Agent will reflect the revisions on Annex I and forward a
copy of such revised Annex I to the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and each Lender.
(v)         Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an
assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 12.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment
required by Section 12.04(a), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has
been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 12.04(b).
(c)          (i)          Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell
participations to one or more banks or other Persons (other than the Parent or the Borrower, any Affiliate thereof, or any
natural person) (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 12.02 that
affects such Participant. In addition such agreement must provide that the Participant shall be bound by the provisions of
Section 12.03. Subject to Section 12.04(c)(ii), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 5.01, Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein including the requirements
under Section 5.03(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 5.03(e) shall be delivered to the
participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
Section 12.04(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.08 as
though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 4.01(c) as though it were a Lender.
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain
a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of
each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the
identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or
its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to
establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and
such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
105
(ii)         A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s
interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”). Any such Participant
Register shall be available for inspection by the Administrative Agent at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice; provided that the applicable Lender shall have no obligation to show such Participant Register to
the Borrower except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan, commitment, letter of credit or
other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(d)          Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 12.04
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a
security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.
(e)          Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations
of any Lender or any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require
any Credit Party to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the “Blue Sky” laws of any state.
106
Section 12.05       Survival; Revival; Reinstatement.
(a)          All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or
other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on
any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is
outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Section 5.01, Section 5.02,
Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 and Article XI shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the
Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision
hereof or thereof.
(b)          To the extent that any payments on the Secured Obligations or proceeds of any Collateral are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession,
receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Secured
Obligations so satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and the
Administrative Agent’s and the Lenders’ Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement and
each Loan Document shall continue in full force and effect. In such event, each Loan Document shall be automatically
reinstated and the Borrower shall take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders to effect such reinstatement.
Section 12.06       Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
(a)          This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of
which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.
(b)          This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES HERETO AND THERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN
ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
107
(c)          Except as provided in Section 6.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by
the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken
together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Agreement by telecopy, facsimile or other similar electronic means (e.g. .pdf) shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
Section 12.07       Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 12.08       Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (of
whatsoever kind, including, without limitations obligations under Swap Agreements) at any time owing by such Lender or
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any of and all the obligations of any Credit Party owed
to such Lender now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section 12.08 are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender or its Affiliates may have.
Section 12.09       Governing law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a)          This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York except to the extent that United States Federal law permits any Lender to contract for, charge, receive, reserve or
take interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State where such Lender is located.
(b)          Any legal action or proceeding with respect to the Loan Documents may be brought in the courts of the State of
New York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this
agreement, each party hereby accepts for itself and (to the extent permitted by law) in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each party hereby irrevocably waives any objection,
including, without limitation, any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it
may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such respective jurisdictions. This
submission to jurisdiction is non-exclusive and does not preclude a party from obtaining jurisdiction over another party in
any court otherwise having jurisdiction.
(c)          In addition, to the extent that any Credit Party or Affiliate thereof may be entitled, in any jurisdiction in which judicial
proceedings may at any time be commenced with respect to this agreement or any other Loan Document, to claim for itself
or its revenues, assets or properties any immunity from suit, the jurisdiction of any court, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of a judgment, set-off, execution of a judgment or any other legal process, and to the extent
that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed such immunity (whether or not claimed), such Person irrevocably
agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such
jurisdiction and hereby agrees that the foregoing waiver shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United States of America, as amended, and is intended to be irrevocable for the
purpose of such Act.
108
(d)          The Borrower hereby designates, appoints and empowers, ample and sufficient, to C T Corporation System (the
“Process Agent”), with offices on the date hereof at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York, 10011, as its designee,
appointee and agent with respect to any such action or proceeding in New York to receive for and on its behalf service of
any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents which may be served in any such proceeding and agrees that
the failure of such agent to give any advice of any such service of process to the Borrower shall not impair or affect the
validity of such service or of any claim based thereon. If for any reason the Process Agent shall cease to be available to act
as such, the Borrower agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in New York City reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent on the terms and for the purposes of this provision. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at the address specified in Section 12.01 or such other address as is
specified pursuant to Section 12.01 (or its assignment and assumption), such service to become effective thirty (30) days
after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of a party or any holder of a Note to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against another party in any other
jurisdiction.
(e)          Each party hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, trial by jury in
any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document and for any counterclaim therein; (ii)
irrevocably waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any such
litigation any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or damages other than, or in addition to, actual
damages; (iii) certifies that no party hereto nor any representative or agent of counsel for any party hereto has represented,
expressly or otherwise, or implied that such party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers;
and (iv) acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications contained in this Section
12.09.
Section 12.10      Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of
reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in
interpreting, this Agreement.
109
Section 12.11      Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain
the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that
the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed
to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights
hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section
12.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any Swap Agreement relating to the
Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 12.11 or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this
Section 12.11, “Information” means all information received from any Credit Party relating to the Credit Parties and their
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by a Credit Party; provided that, in the case of information received from any
Credit Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person
required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 12.11 shall be considered to have
complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of
such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Section 12.12      Interest Rate Limitation. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Lender shall conform strictly to
usury laws applicable to it. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as to any Lender under
laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of America or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be
mandatorily applicable to such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that event,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents or any agreement entered into in connection with or
as security for the Notes, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law
applicable to any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender under any of the Loan
Documents or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Notes shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount allowed by such applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be
credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the
Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower); and (ii) in the event
that the maturity of the Notes is accelerated by reason of an election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of
Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such
consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender may never include more than the maximum
amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be
canceled automatically by such Lender as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be
credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the
Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or
agreed to be paid to any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted
by law applicable to such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the stated term of the Loans
evidenced by the Notes until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does
not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (i) the amount of
interest payable to any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender
pursuant to this Section 12.12 and (ii) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest
otherwise payable to such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender computed at the
Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to such Lender in respect of such
subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such
Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have
been payable to such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section 12.12.
110
Section 12.13      Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of US Dollars is of
the essence, and the stipulated currency shall in each instance be the currency of account and payment in all instances. A
payment obligation in one currency hereunder (the “Original Currency”) shall not be discharged by an amount paid in
another currency (the “Other Currency”), whether pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any Other
Currency or in another place except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the payee of
the full amount of the Original Currency payable by it under this Agreement. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any
court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Original Currency into the Other Currency, the rate of exchange
that shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent or any
Lender hereunder could purchase Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day
on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Credit Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the
Administrative Agent or any other Person under any Loan Document (in this Section called an “Entitled Person”) shall,

Schedule 7.05
Litigation
1.          Ecopetrol S.A. (“Ecopetrol”) vs. Gran Tierra Energy Colombia, Ltd. and Petrolifera Petroleum (Colombia)
Ltd (collectively “GTEC”)
GTEC and Ecopetrol, the contracting parties of the Guayuyaco Association Contract, are engaged in a dispute
regarding the interpretation of the procedure for allocation of oil produced and sold during the long-term test of
the Guayuyaco-1 and Guayuyaco-2 wells, prior to GTEC's purchase of the companies originally involved in the
dispute. There was no agreement between the parties, and Ecopetrol filed a lawsuit in the Contravention
Administrative Tribunal in the District of Cauca (the “Tribunal”) regarding this matter. During 2013, the Tribunal
ruled in favor of Ecopetrol and awarded Ecopetrol 44,025 bbl of oil. GTEC has filed an appeal of the ruling to the
Supreme Administrative Court (Consejo de Estado) in a second instance procedure. At June 30, 2015, and
December 31, 2014, Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra”) had accrued $2.4 million in the interim unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements in relation to this dispute.
2.          GTEC vs. Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbons Agency) (“ANH”)
Gran Tierra’s production from the Costayaco Exploitation Area is subject to an additional royalty (the “HPR
royalty”), which applies when cumulative gross production from an Exploitation Area is greater than five MMbbl.
The HPR royalty is calculated on the difference between a trigger price defined in the Chaza Block exploration and
production contract (the “Chaza Contract”) and the sales price. ANH has interpreted the Chaza Contract as
requiring that the HPR royalty must be paid with respect to all production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area and
initiated a noncompliance procedure under the Chaza Contract, which was contested by Gran Tierra because the
Moqueta Exploitation Area and the Costayaco Exploitation Area are separate Exploitation Areas. ANH did not
proceed with that noncompliance procedure. Gran Tierra also believes that the evidence shows that the
Costayaco and Moqueta fields are two clearly separate and independent hydrocarbon accumulations. Therefore, it
is Gran Tierra’s view that, pursuant to the terms of the Chaza Contract, the HPR royalty is only to be paid with
respect to production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area when the accumulated oil production from that
Exploitation Area exceeds five MMbbl. Discussions with the ANH have not resolved this issue and Gran Tierra has
initiated the dispute resolution process under the Chaza Contract by filing on January 14, 2013, an arbitration
claim before the Center for Arbitration and Conciliation of the Chamber of Commerce of Bogotá, Colombia,
seeking a decision that the HPR royalty is not payable until production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area
exceeds five MMbbl. Gran Tierra supplemented its claim on May 30, 2013. The ANH filed a response to the claim
seeking a declaration that its interpretation is correct and a counterclaim seeking, amongst other remedies,
declarations that Gran Tierra breached the Chaza Contract by not paying the disputed HPR royalty, that the
amount of the alleged HPR royalty is payable, and that the Chaza Contract be terminated. Gran Tierra filed a
response to the ANH's counterclaim and filed its comments on the ANH's responses to Gran Tierra's claim. The
ANH filed an amended counterclaim and Gran Tierra filed a response to the ANH's amended counterclaim. On
April 30, 2015, total cumulative production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area reached 5.0 MMbbl and Gran Tierra
commenced paying the HPR royalty payable on production over that threshold. The estimated compensation
which would be payable on cumulative production if the ANH's claims are accepted in the arbitration is $66.3
million plus related interest of $24.8 million. Gran Tierra also disagrees with the interest rate that the ANH has used
in calculating the interest cost. Gran Tierra asserts that since the HPR royalty is denominated in the U.S. dollar, the
contract requires the interest rate to be three-month LIBOR plus 4%, whereas the ANH has applied the highest
legally authorized interest rate on Colombian peso liabilities, which during the period of production to date has
averaged approximately 29% per annum. At March 31, 2015, based on an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus
4% related interest would be $4.9 million. At this time no amount has been accrued in the interim unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements nor deducted from Gran Tierra's reserves for the disputed HPR
royalty as Gran Tierra does not consider it probable that a loss will be incurred.
Schedule 7.05 – Page 1
Additionally, the ANH and Gran Tierra are engaged in discussions regarding the interpretation of whether certain
transportation and related costs are eligible to be deducted in the calculation of the HPR royalty. Discussions with
the ANH are ongoing. Based on the Gran Tierra's understanding of the ANH's position, the estimated
compensation which would be payable if the ANH’s interpretation is correct could be up to $42.1 million as at
June 30, 2015. At this time no amount has been accrued in the interim unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements as Gran Tierra does not consider it probable that a loss will be incurred.
