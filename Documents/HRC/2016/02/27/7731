<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, Najat Maalla M&#8217;jid, undertook an official visit to Kyrgyzstan from 15 to 
26 April 2013, at the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Bishkek, Osh, Jalalabad, Karakol 
and villages in the Ysyk K&#246;l lake region. At the national level, she met with representatives 
of the ministries of Foreign Affairs; Social Development; Internal Affairs; Justice; Health; 
Education and Science; Labour, Migration and Youth; Employment; and Culture, 
Information and Tourism. She also met with representatives of the Supreme Court, the 
Office of the General Prosecutor, the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Statistical 
Committee. At the Parliament, she met with the committee on international affairs, the 
committee on social policy of Parliament, and some individual members. At the district and 
local levels, she met with representatives of mayor&#8217;s offices, governor&#8217;s offices, social, 
educational and health departments, prosecutors, inspectors of children&#8217;s affairs, the police, 
and family and child support departments. 
</p>
<p>3. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur also visited eight residential institutions 
for children, both private and public, including child support centres run by the Ministry for 
Education, rehabilitation centres run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a mother and infant 
home run by the Ministry of Health, a family type home, a centre for street children, and 
others institutions, including private residences. The Special Rapporteur was particularly 
grateful to have been able to meet and interact with children and victims in those centres. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also met with the United Nations country team and 
representatives of other international organizations, including the European Union, the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the World Bank, and other 
representatives of the international community. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses her appreciation to the Government for the 
support it provided in planning and coordinating her visit. She also thanks civil society 
organizations, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for their valuable assistance and support 
before, during and after her mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Kyrgyzstan gained its independence in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, and embarked on a transition to a democratic system of governance. Its population 
of 5.5 million has a majority of Kyrgyz (72 per cent), while Uzbeks (14.4 per cent) and 
Russians (6.6 per cent) are the main ethnic and linguistic minorities. 
</p><p>7. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan endured a severe economic 
crisis that led to a decrease in the quality and standard of living, and growth in poverty. 
Furthermore, the outbreak of inter-ethnic violence in June 2010 in the south of the country 
had a serious impact on the human rights situation in the country. Kyrgyzstan is now one of 
the poorest countries in the region. Social development indicators, such as infant mortality, 
chronic child malnutrition and illiteracy, remain below the average for the region, and 
Kyrgyzstan ranks 125th on the human development index. Children below 14 years of age 
are estimated to account for almost 30 per cent of the population, with 43.3 per cent of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>those children living in poverty and 7.7 per cent in extreme poverty. Child poverty in rural 
areas is even higher at 46.3 per cent. In the light of the economic situation, one major factor 
supporting the subsistence of poorer families is the remittances sent by Kyrgyz labour 
migrants working abroad. It is estimated that between 800,000 and 1.2 million Kyrgyz 
citizens (some 15 per cent of the country&#8217;s population) currently work outside Kyrgyzstan, 
predominately in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Labour migrants are estimated to 
send home the equivalent of up to 29 per cent of GDP, making Kyrgyzstan the third most 
remittance-dependent country in the world. 
</p>
<p>8. Geographically, Kyrgyzstan also faces other challenges. It is located on major 
narcotics-trafficking routes from Tajikistan and Afghanistan to the Russian Federation and 
Europe. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) noted the importance of 
Kyrgyzstan for the transit of opiates to the Russian Federation, and the destabilizing effect 
this had on the country, including fuelling crime and criminal networks.1 The Special 
Rapporteur also noted that widespread corruption in the public sector, fostered by low 
salaries and lack of adequate resources for public servants, remains a key issue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Government of Kyrgyzstan has ratified numerous international human rights 
instruments, many directly relevant to children&#8217;s rights, including the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (accession in 1994) and the Optional Protocols thereto on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict (2003) and on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography (2003). Kyrgyzstan has also ratified the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) and 
Minimum Age Convention , 1973 (No. 138). 
</p><p>10. Kyrgyzstan has also ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and 
Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption of 29 May 1993. In that regard, a decree 
on the ratification of the Convention was approved by Parliament on 29 June 2012. 
Kyrgyzstan is also party to the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and 
of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others (1996), the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (2003), and has ratified the Protocol 
against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the Convention 
(2003).  
11. Regionally, Kyrgyzstan is also a party to the Agreement on Cooperation in 
Combating Trafficking in Persons, Human Organs and Tissues (2005) of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the CIS Programme of Cooperation in 
Combating Human Trafficking (2011&#8211;2013).

<p><b> III. Situational analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>12. The exact scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in 
Kyrgyzstan is difficult to measure. According to official information and statistics provided 
by the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, there were few reported cases of child sale and 
prostitution throughout the country, and no reported cases of child pornography. There 
were also no reported cases of prosecutions for child sex tourism. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>13. Sale of children, in particular for international adoption, has also been an issue of 
concern. An investigation conducted in 2008 by the Office of the Prosecutor General 
revealed serious irregularities and corrupt practices in the intercountry adoptive system, 
noting that, from 2004 to 2008, 235 children had been adopted by international adoptive 
parents, despite the fact that most of them could have been adopted nationally. Moreover, 
there were some indications that some children had been intentionally falsely diagnosed as 
disabled, and court decisions had been rushed through in a matter of days. This situation led 
to the imposition of a moratorium on the adoptive system in 2009. Furthermore, an 
investigation ultimately led to 197 criminal prosecutions and the dismissal of many judges 
and government officials who had been involved in decision-making on the cases 
investigated. Since the moratorium, efforts have been made by the Government to avoid the 
situation through the development of new legislation on the issue (see paras. 35&#8211;38 below). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution, sexual abuse and violence  
</b></p>
<p>14. Despite the relative lack of data on the phenomenon of child prostitution, the Special 
Rapporteur learned, during her mission, of practices warranting serious concern. 
In particular, the Special Rapporteur was informed of the operation of &#8220;saunas&#8221;, especially 
in Bishkek. Essentially operating as brothels, the saunas regularly exploit girls as 
prostitutes. She also learned that minors were exploited as street prostitutes. Street children 
were particularly at risk of being recruited into prostitution. According to some civil society 
organizations, as many as 20 per cent of prostitutes working in Bishkek are minors, 
reportedly both boys and girls.2 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the increasing number of cases of child 
sexual abuse and violence. According to recent official statistics provided by the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs, the past four years have witnessed an increase in the total number of 
reported sex crimes committed against minors. Prosecutions under article 133 of the 
Criminal Code (on sexual abuse against persons known to be under the age of 14 years) 
rose from eight cases in 2009 to 13 in 2012. Prosecutions pursuant to article 132 of the 
Criminal Code (on sexual intercourse and other sexual acts with a person under the age of 
16 years) also rose from 22 cases in 2009 to 36 cases in 2012. Rape cases increased from 
44 cases in 2009 to 82 in 2012. Furthermore, cases of forced marriage with a person under 
the age of 17, which includes cases of bride kidnapping, rose from seven criminal cases in 
2009 to 13 in 2012.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1

</p>
<p>16. In 2011, 278 victims of trafficking &#8211; of which no children were identified &#8211; were 
reportedly placed in adaptation centres, with only six criminal cases initiated against 
traffickers. UNICEF has found that no reliable information on the extent of human 
trafficking, and particularly on child trafficking, exists in Kyrgyzstan.3 The Special 
Rapporteur notes, however, that official data do not necessarily reflect the true scale and 
scope of the issue in Kyrgyzstan.4 Such underreporting is also due to the clandestine and 
underground nature of the phenomena, social taboos and fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>17. Child sex tourism is not yet a dominant industry in Kyrgyzstan; no specific research 
or data on the crime are currently available. To date, there are no official records of Kyrgyz 
tourists sexually abusing children in foreign countries. The Special Rapporteur notes, 
however, that tourism has been identified by the Government as a key area for development 
and should also be considered an area that requires further attention. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>18. To date, no reports have been received of domestic production of child pornography, 
although the lack of reports does not necessarily mean that this phenomenon does not exist 
in the country. As Internet usage continues to expand, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
combating online child sexual exploitation should become a priority. Recent research 
indicates that Kyrgyz web users can freely access more than 100 pornographic websites, of 
which 61 per cent of the sites identified contain images of child abuse.5 There are currently 
no deterrence mechanisms in place to prevent access by adults and children to pornographic 
material with images of exploited children. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Root causes and risk factors 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur observed a number of multidimensional factors that are 
increasing the vulnerability of children, and in particular girl children, to sale and sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>20. Poverty gravely affects children in Kyrgyzstan, particularly in remote regions. 
Impoverished families often do not have the resources to care for their children properly, 
which in turn leads to high rates of school dropout. Although exact estimates of out-of-
school children vary greatly according to the source, children living in rural areas and from 
poor and/or non-Kyrgyz-speaking families are much more likely to be out of school. In 
addition, street children, children without registration documents, children living with a 
disability, children of migrants and children affected by ethnic conflicts are particularly 
vulnerable to exclusion.6 
</p>
<p>21. The percentage of child labourers in Kyrgyzstan is very high, with more than a 
quarter of children aged between 5 and 14 years involved in child labour, according to the

 The lack of statistical data and research on the problem was also highlighted in 2007 by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations on Kyrgyzstan 
(CRC/C/OPSC/KGZ/CO/1), para. 9.

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>ILO definition. According to the national definition, child labour rates are even higher, 
ranging from around one third of children aged between 5 and 11 to more than half of 
children aged between 12 and 14, and more than 60 per cent of children aged between 15 
and 17. 
</p>
<p>22. In addition, dysfunction in families, such as pervasive alcohol abuse and widespread 
patterns of domestic violence, contribute significantly to the vulnerability of children.7 One 
tragic consequence is when children take to the streets because their home is no longer a 
safe place. 
</p>
<p>23. In the context of widespread poverty and the high rates of unemployment, there is a 
growing trend of migrating parents leaving their children in the care of either their 
grandparents or relatives for significant periods of time. These guardians are often ill-
equipped, economically or emotionally, to tend to the needs of the children left in their 
care. These children, known as &#8220;social orphans&#8221;, thus often lose the protection offered by 
their immediate family and face significant psychological, educational and social 
challenges, which increase their vulnerability to exploitation.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned at the lack of sustainable programmes 
to strengthen families and parenting, and at the lack of social services for children and 
families at risk, including children of migrants left behind. Services for families, where 
available, are often underfunded or insufficient. In particular, there is a lack of trained 
social workers with adequate skills and resources at the local level to identify and assist 
families and children in need. Only around 12 per cent of children have any access to 
preschool services. 
</p>
<p>25. Another key concern of the Special Rapporteur was the high rate of children in 
institutions. Risk factors within residential institutions include the lack of official registers 
and documentation of children, lack of monitoring, and lack of trained personnel to identify 
adequately potential child victims. These gaps make it potentially easier for the sale of 
children, particularly in view of the high demand for international adoption. 
</p>
<p>26. Furthermore, early and forced marriage of girl children is still practiced in Kyrgyz 
society; bride kidnapping still occurs, despite criminal laws forbidding such practices (see 
para. 41 below). The rate of pregnancy among girls between 10 and 14 years of age is high, 
most owing to interfamily sexual abuse and lack of access to sexual education.8 
</p>
<p>27. Similarly, despite a lack of reported cases of child sex tourism, the emerging tourism 
industry of Kyrgyzstan and the global market for sex tourism, the transnational nature of 
such crimes coupled with the absence of any meaningful control or regulation place the 
country at high risk of becoming a destination for potential child sex tourist predators. This 
is compounded by the almost complete absence of measures to ensure child safety online, 
and the non-involvement and lack of regulation of private Internet service providers and 
telecom companies. 
</p>
<p>28. Overall, the Special Rapporteur noted that, in the light of these combined emerging 
risk factors and the highly profitable nature of the commercial sexual exploitation of 
children, children in Kyrgyzstan are increasingly at risk of becoming victims of sale, 
prostitution and pornography.

</p>
<p><b> C. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the important work that the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan has, within a relatively short period, undertaken to better integrate international 
human rights standards into the national legal system, by adopting numerous laws, policy 
frameworks and plans of action relevant to protecting the rights of children. With reference 
to the child protection system, many positive changes have been instituted since 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Constitution of 2010 contains specific provisions on children&#8217;s rights. Article 16 
states that the principle of ensuring the best interests of the child is effective in Kyrgyzstan, 
and article 36 establishes the family as the foundation of society. While care for children, 
and the education and appropriate living conditions necessary for their development remain 
the responsibility of the parent or other person (art. 36, para. 3), the State is required to 
ensure the maintenance, upbringing and education of child orphans and children deprived 
of parental care. Furthermore, article 36 stipulates that each child has the right to the 
standard of living necessary for his or her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social 
development. The Constitution also explicitly forbids slavery, human trafficking and child 
labour (art. 23). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Children&#8217;s Code 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Children&#8217;s Code of 2012 is the most important development in recent years in 
the protection of children&#8217;s rights in Kyrgyzstan. The new law, a revision of the Children&#8217;s 
Code of 2006, developed with the assistance of UNICEF and with the input of civil society 
organizations, draws heavily on the standards established by the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, and is based on key human rights principles, including the best interest of the 
child and the protection of children from all forms of violence (art. 4). Article 16 of the 
Code stipulates that the State must provide for the personal security of the child and protect 
him or her from physical and (or) psychological, sexual violence, cruel, rude or degrading 
treatment, involvement into criminal activity and commitment of anti-social and other acts. 
</p>
<p>32. Importantly, the Code stresses the importance of the prevention of the separation of 
the child from the family and ensuring the right of the child to a family environment, 
including to live and be raised in a family (arts. 4 and 7). In this regard, the Code creates 
strong gatekeeping mechanisms to prevent children from being separated from their 
families when other options can be found. A decision to place a child in an institution must 
now be taken by a court and used as a last resort (arts. 21 and 36.3.2). 
</p><p>33. Another key achievement of the revised Code is the inclusion of child protection 
among the competencies of local self-governance bodies. These bodies are best placed and 
informed about the situation of children and of families within their jurisdiction. 
34. Although the Special Rapporteur welcomes the Children&#8217;s Code as a ground-
breaking step towards the protection of children&#8217;s rights in Kyrgyzstan, she regrets that 
some of the definitions in the Code do not comply with international legal standards. In 
particular, she notes that the use, recruiting or offering of a child for prostitution, 
production of pornography or pornographic performances is listed as one of the worst forms 
of child labour rather than an offence in itself. She also remains concerned that article 60 of 
the Code provides for the secrecy of adoption. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Legislation regulating adoption practices 
</b></p>
<p>35. Following an investigation conducted in 2008 by the Office of the Prosecutor 
General, serious irregularities and corrupt practices in intercountry adoption system led to 
the announcement of a moratorium in 2009.  
</p>
<p>36. By September 2011, new intercountry adoption legislation was approved by 
Parliament and the Government of Kyrgyzstan. Key outcomes of the new law include the 
condition that intercountry adoption only be considered an option when national adoption is 
unfeasible, and the establishment of an authorized body to regulate all aspects of such 
adoption, including accreditation of agencies and the development of a national database of 
potentially adoptable children. Moreover, software for an electronic database on children 
left without parent care was completed and presented to the Ministry of Social 
Development, thereby meeting the principles of the Hague Convention. Unfortunately, as at 
August 2013, the database was still not operational. At the current time, hard copies of 
documents are collected and kept at the district level.  
</p>
<p>37. It should also be noted that chapter 8 of the Children&#8217;s Code puts in place certain 
safeguards to regulate adoption. The Code stipulates that intercountry adoption is only 
allowed in cases where it is not possible to place children with families of Kyrgyz citizens, 
or by their relatives, and establishes clear regulations for cases where intercountry adoption 
would be allowed (arts. 44 and 66). Furthermore, the Code strictly prohibits the adoption of 
children for commercial purposes or for financial gain (art. 47). The Criminal Code 
(arts. 160-1) further specifies in which cases adoption is illegal. 
</p><p>38. In 2012, the Government approved a commission to accredit adoption agencies. The 
commission, which comprises representatives from the ministries of Social Development, 
Education and Science, Health, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, the National Security 
Committee and two local non-governmental organizations, accredited 10 adoption agencies 
in 2012, thereby signalling the recommencement of intercountry adoption. However, 
although a relevant regulation stipulated that the commission had the final say in deciding 
which agencies would receive accreditation, they were changed at the last moment by the 
Government, leaving the ultimate decision on accreditation to the Minister of Social 
Development. Since this fundamental change, the new regulation has undergone repeated 
official anti-corruption examinations by the Parliament&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Committee and 
the Ministry of Justice. By August 2013, a new regulation on the accreditation of foreign 
organizations working in the area of intercountry adoption had been developed and 
circulated among ministries for their revision and approval. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Criminal laws addressing the sale, trafficking, sexual abuse and exploitation 
of children 
</b></p>
<p>39. Laws on the sale of children, child trafficking, child prostitution and child 
pornography, and other sexual crimes against children, are largely regulated by the 
Criminal Code, which was amended most recently in July 2013 to include provisions on 
child trafficking, rape, violent acts of a sexual nature and involvement in prostitution. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Sale of children 
</i>40. The Criminal Code considers the sale of persons a form of trafficking, and carries a 
term of imprisonment of five to eight years. Where the same act involves a juvenile, the 
sentence increases to eight to 15 years of imprisonment, with property seizure (art. 124). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>41. Forced and underage marriage and bride kidnapping are illegal under Kyrgyz law. 
Article 154 of the Criminal Code states that forced marriage with a person under the age of 
consent (17 years) is a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of 100 to 500 estimate 
indicators9 or by correctional work for up to two years or up to five years of imprisonment. 
If the victim is under 16, the penalty increases. If a marriage is the result of a kidnapping, a 
sentence of three to seven years of imprisonment is envisaged. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Child prostitution 
</i>42. The Criminal Law considers forced prostitution a form of unlawful exploitation that 
constitutes trafficking punishable by five to eight years of imprisonment. Where the crime 
is committed against a juvenile, the sentence increases to eight to 15 years of imprisonment, 
with property seizure (art. 124). 
43. The act of forcibly involving someone in prostitution by means of violence or the 
threat of its use, blackmail, destroying or damaging property or by means of fraud is 
punishable by a fine equivalent to 500 to 1,000 estimate indicators or by detention for a 
term of up to three years. The recent amendments now provide for acts involving a young 
child in prostitution to be punishable by 10 to 15 years of imprisonment (art. 260). One 
important limitation to the provision is the requirement of forcible involvement, involving 
violence or a threat of violence, blackmail, destroying or damaging property, or fraud. 
Cases where prosecutors are unable to prove the forcible nature of involvement are not 
prosecuted. It was reported that cases under this provision were only prosecuted where 
child victims or their parents asked for an investigation. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 157 also stipulates that the involvement of a juvenile in &#8220;the commission of 
anti-social actions, which includes prostitution and sexual acts committed by persons over 
18 years old, are subject to a sentence of one to three years of detention or up to three years 
of imprisonment. The sentence can be extended for up to five years if the acts are 
committed with the use or threat of physical violence. 
</p>
<p>45. The Criminal Code further stipulates that the organization or maintenance of 
premises for the purpose of prostitution is punishable by a fine equivalent to 100 to 300 
estimate indicators or by detention for a term from two to five years, with confiscation of 
property (art. 262). 
</p><p>46. The Government recently considered amending the Administrative Liability Code to 
make prostitution an administrative offence, punishable by fines of up to 1,500 soms ($30) 
and imprisonment of up to 15 days for repeat offences within a year. The law applied 
regardless of the age of the &#8220;offender&#8221;, thereby penalizing child victims of prostitution. On 
18 February 2013, the proposed amendment was withdrawn; the Special Rapporteur 
learned, however, that the proposal might in fact be tabled again in future. She emphasizes 
that children should never be convicted of any offence of prostitution, as they are always 
victims of sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Child pornography 
</i>47. Article 262 of the Criminal Code provides that production of pornographic materials 
for the purpose of sale, distribution and advertising is punishable by a fine equivalent to 
200 to 300 estimate indicators or by detention of up to two years. 
</p>
<p>48. The Criminal Code also states that the involvement of a juvenile in acts connected 
with the production of materials or objects of a pornographic character committed by a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
  The estimate indicator is based on the minimum statutory monthly pay. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>person over 18 years is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to eight years. The 
same act, if committed with the use or threat of physical violence, carries a maximum 
sentence of 10 years; and if committed against a minor, 15 years. 
</p>
<p>49. Article 133 states that the commission of lecherous acts (indecent assault) without 
violence against a juvenile is punishable by one to three years of imprisonment. The same 
offence committed against a young child is punishable by five years of imprisonment and a 
prohibition on holding any pedagogical position for up to three years. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that, although no definition of lecherous act is provided in the Criminal 
Code, legal commentary has noted that it may include such acts as sexual intercourse in the 
presence of a juvenile, showing a juvenile pornographic images or touching a juvenile&#8217;s 
genitals. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur noted that child pornography is not specifically defined in 
the law, and no offences are envisaged for computer-related use, access to or simple 
possession of child pornography. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Child trafficking 
</i>51. Article 124 of the Criminal Code is, as mentioned above, a broad provision that 
establishes that trafficking, including recruiting, transport, harbouring, reception, transfer, 
purchase or sale of a person or any another unlawful transaction, whether with or without 
that person&#8217;s consent, involving the use of force, blackmail, fraud, deception or kidnapping 
for the purpose of further exploitation or other interests is punishable by a term of 
imprisonment of five to eight years, with or without the seizure of property. The sentence 
may be extended to up to 15 years with property seizure if the acts are committed against a 
juvenile or minor.  
52. In November 2011, the national Law on Preventing and Countering Human 
Trafficking was amended. This amended law focuses on providing assistance to victims of 
trafficking. If a victim of human trafficking is a child, child protection services are to be 
informed immediately (art. 27). 
53. The Special Rapporteur also learned that the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan had recently 
been considering a new proposal that would prevent women under the age of 22 from 
migrating abroad without parental consent and thereby from potentially becoming victims 
of abuse and trafficking. Although the proposal was ostensibly tabled to protect vulnerable 
young women from the risk of abuse, including trafficking, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that, while it is important to take precautionary measures, any proposal made must be 
proportionate and reasonable, and not infringe on the human rights of these women. 
</p>
<p><i> (e) Other laws concerning child sexual abuse 
</i>54. The Criminal Code contains many articles (129, 130, 132, 133) related to child 
sexual violence, abuse and assault. However, the Special Rapporteur highlights that despite 
the fact that many of these offences exist de jure, a number of procedural loopholes have 
contributed to the failure to effectively prosecute these crimes. The definition of a young 
child as a girl child in the Code is problematic, given that boys also may be victims of rape. 
The Special Rapporteur also noted with concern that the offender&#8217;s subjective belief is 
relevant to age determination; thus, the court only applies the penalty according to the age 
that the offender believes the victim to have been. 
</p>
<p>55. To date, a large proportion of the cases of sexual abuse against minors have been 
reconciled under procedural loopholes owing to pervasive taboos with regard to child 
sexual exploitation, which has led parents to prefer monetary reconciliation of the case to 
avoid going to court. To a large degree, the recent amendments to the Criminal Code, 
which has increased sentences to over five years for a number of key provisions regarding </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>the abuse of children, will ensure that this mechanism is no longer used to avoid the 
prosecution of perpetrators. Other obstacles to prosecution, however, remain (see paras. 71&#8211;
76 below). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>56. Kyrgyzstan has a fragmented child protection system that includes several State 
structures at the central and local levels. Since 2010, the Government has, with the support 
of UNICEF and civil society organizations, implemented many positive changes to child 
protection institutions and the policy framework. 
</p>
<p>57. In April 2011, the Ministry of Social Protection (subsequently renamed the Ministry 
of Social Development) was designated as the authorized body on all child protection 
issues. The Ministry in turn created the Department on Development of Social Services for 
Children and Families (subsequently renamed the Child Protection Department). The 
Ministry retains responsibility for three psycho-neurological residential institutions for 
severely disabled children. It also retains responsibility for overseeing intercountry 
adoption, which was formerly under the purview of the Ministry of Education. 
</p>
<p>58. Other ministries play an important role in child care. The Ministry of Health is 
responsible for three infant homes, although it does not have any clear operational protocols 
for the early detection of child sexual exploitation or abuse. The Ministry of Education 
manages the largest number of residential institutions (see paras. 81&#8211;89 below). 
</p><p>59. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for the centres for the adaptation and 
rehabilitation of children. It also oversees all aspects of public security, including policing 
and juvenile justice. Within the Ministry at the local level, an inspector for the affairs of 
minors has been designated, while operations officers investigate all cases regarding 
minors, including cases where crimes are committed either by or against juveniles. The 
Special Rapporteur noted that a unit in the Ministry is mandated to deal with cybercrimes; 
she was, however, informed that the unit still has little expertise in detecting child 
pornography, and does not play a role in the oversight and regulation of the use of the 
Internet. 
</p>
<p>60. The Ministry of Justice plays a leading role in the development of legislation, as 
well as in the protection of children&#8217;s rights and the provision of guaranteed legal 
assistance. An important development in this regard is a new law passed in 2011, which 
guarantees legal assistance in criminal cases involving low-income and juvenile offenders. 
The Special Rapporteur commended the establishment of a working group that is currently 
drafting new legislation and revising the Crime Code, Crime Procedural Code and Crime 
Executive Code in order to bring legislation in compliance with international standards and 
norms in the area of human rights.  
</p>
<p>61. The relatively new Ministry of Youth, Labour, Migration and Employment is the 
body authorized to address issues of human trafficking and child labour, and also deals with 
the consequences of external migration. The Ministry is responsible for the implementation 
of the human trafficking control programme (2013&#8211;2016). The goal of the programme is to 
ensure planned and coordinated operation of government agencies and to strengthen 
cooperation with international and non-governmental organizations in the field of 
trafficking. The Special Rapporteur notes that, while this is the third such programme to 
have been implemented, there has been very little evaluation and follow-up on the previous 
two. Regarding labour, the Ministry is also aware of the large number of children working 
in streets and markets, and is responsible for the implementation of the State programme of 
action to eliminate the worst forms of child labour. Regarding its mandate on youth, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Ministry focuses predominately on job placement for young people; to date, it appears not 
to have tackled the issue of child exploitation. 
</p>
<p>62. The Ombudsman reviews complaints and monitors human rights in Kyrgyzstan, 
including the right to unimpeded access to closed institutions. The Ombudsman may also 
make direct legislative proposals, accept complaints directly from victims and lodge cases 
against authorities. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that there is a low level of 
awareness of the existence of the office among the broader population. Moreover, owing to 
a lack of child-sensitive complaint mechanisms, the Office of the Ombudsman has to date 
received very few complaints from child victims. One encouraging development was the 
establishment, in November 2012, of a small unit specifically tasked with tackling 
children&#8217;s rights issues. At one stage, the post of Ombudsman for children was proposed, 
but the idea was rejected; the post of Deputy Ombudsman for Children was however 
established. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in mid-2013, the Office of the Ombudsman 
was plagued by allegations of corruption, and the Ombudsman was dismissed by 
Parliament in June 2013. She also notes that it is vital to ensure that the Office of the 
Ombudsman is not only fully independent of State institutions, but also transparent. 
</p>
<p>63. The Office of the Prosecutor General, which oversees the prosecution of criminal 
cases against perpetrators of crimes against children, also plays a very important monitoring 
role for public institutions by ensuring that they adequately protect children in accordance 
with their specific mandates. While the Special Rapporteur learned much about this 
monitoring role, she urges the Prosecutor General to pay equal attention to its role in the 
criminal prosecution of perpetrators of offences against children. 
</p>
<p>64. Overall, while the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note the numerous institutions 
and ministries involved in child rights, she expresses concern at the multiplicity of 
institutions and policies, which may contribute to an overlap of mandates and, in particular, 
at the lack of coordination between these institutions at the local and central levels. Of 
further concern are the frequent structural changes within ministries and the unclear 
division of responsibilities. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the issue of 
multiplicity of mandates and lack of coordination between ministries has now been 
somewhat mitigated by the mandate given to the Ministry of Social Development to take 
the lead in children&#8217;s issues across the board. Nevertheless, she remains concerned that the 
limited budget and relatively weak political position of the Ministry, compared with other 
ministries, may further delay and inhibit the implementation of commitments on child 
rights and weaken the status of the institutional mechanisms promoting those rights across 
government. The Special Rapporteur noted that there is a pervasive lack of monitoring of 
and follow-up on policies and programmes within the ministries. Coupled with an acute 
shortage of financial and human resources and a high turnover of staff across all ministries 
concerned with children&#8217;s rights, the institutional framework regarding child rights remains 
fragile.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Policies and programmes to address the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policies on child protection 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made by the authorities to address 
the situation of vulnerable children by establishing new policies for the protection and 
promotion of their rights. 
</p>
<p>66. On 13 December 2011, the Government approved the Strategy for the Development 
of Social Protection (2012&#8211;2014) of the people of the Kyrgyz Republic. The new policy 
involves a number of activities aimed at the social protection of children and families in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>difficulty, including the prevention of homelessness, institutionalization and neglect, and 
the rehabilitation of children in conflict with the law. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the 
strategy will overcome some of the shortcomings of the 2011 Social Protection Strategy, 
which aimed to provide financial help to children in low-income families, but reportedly 
failed to reach all families in need and, in particular, was not effective in delivering social 
assistance to low-income families. 
</p>
<p>67. Other relevant policies and strategies include the Inter-agency Plan on Child 
Protection and Social Services (2009&#8211;2011), the State programme of action for the 
elimination of the worst forms of child labour (2008&#8211;2011), the National Sustainable 
Development Strategy (2013&#8211;2017), the Strategy for Development of Social Protection 
2012&#8211;2014 and a national programme on the juvenile justice system reform, which is 
expected to be approved by the end of 2013. Moreover, individual ministries have their 
own specific policies, including in the fields of health, education and justice, that have an 
impact on various aspects of child protection. 
</p>
<p>68. More recent plans relevant to the issues examined by the Special Rapporteur include 
the human trafficking control programme (2013&#8211;2016) (see para.  61 above) and the inter-
agency plan for optimizing the management and financing of residential institutions (2012&#8211;
2014) (see para. 89 below). 
</p><p>69. The Special Rapporteur notes that emphasis should be placed on the implementation 
of the above-mentioned initiatives through funding, training and awareness-raising to 
ensure that they lead to meaningful change on the ground for children. She also noted the 
lack of effective monitoring of past and current policies and programmes, despite the 
inclusion of the principle of monitoring and evaluation in most policies. This lack of 
periodic review of achievements and obstacles on the basis of clear indicators and 
accountability precludes any meaningful assessment of the impact of policies and their 
effect on child protection. 
</p>
<p>70. The overall child protection system is characterized by an acute shortage of financial 
and human resources. In particular, the high turnover of staff within government agencies, 
at both the local and national levels, has a severe impact on the State&#8217;s ability to effectively 
implement its programmes and policies. Moreover, the lack of resources has hampered the 
ability of public institutions to protect the rights of Kyrgyz children. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur noted a lack of follow-up monitoring and evaluation of current 
programmes and policies. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Investigation and prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur noted that official statistics did not reflect the scale of the 
issue, given that cases of abuse are not systematically reported, investigated or prosecuted. 
While a number of cultural factors play a role, such low levels of reporting are also partly 
due to the failure of the State to investigate adequately and prosecute cases and to assist 
victims. 
</p>
<p>72. With regard to the exploitation of children in saunas, the use of such establishments 
as de facto brothels and the presence of minors working there are apparently public 
knowledge. The authorities, however, reportedly turn a blind eye to these facts, given that 
they allow the saunas to continue to operate and fail to conduct any meaningful inspections 
to investigate allegations of child sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p>73. Moreover, labour inspections, which should be supervised by the Ministry of 
Labour, do not appear to be carried out on a regular basis and are not focused on child 
sexual exploitation in places of known concern. The Special Rapporteur was informed by 
the Ministry itself that when inspections are carried out, the establishments are informed 
beforehand as a matter of protocol and in order not to disrupt business, a procedure that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>effectively defeats the purpose of inspections by allowing employers and exploiters to 
remove any children and conceal any exploitative practices. The Special Rapporteur 
moreover learned that, since the restructuring of the Ministry of Labour in 2013, labour 
inspectors are no longer employed or mandated to conduct inspections, thereby leaving a 
serious gap in the monitoring processes. Furthermore, despite the allegations made by civil 
society organizations of cases of abuse in residential schools, no labour or even general 
inspections of institutions are carried out at regular intervals. 
</p>
<p>74. Even when cases are detected, victims often face the challenge of how to proceed to 
prosecution. The decision to prosecute may be left to family members or, if the child victim 
resides in a residential institution, to its director. Families and institutions do not always 
have the knowledge or capacity to commence legal proceedings, and may also face 
practical challenges: funding is not readily available for legal representation for child 
victims and there is no easily accessible pool of experienced lawyers, owing to the poor 
degree of legal expertise in this field and a lack of publicly funded lawyers. Prosecution 
also involves the additional hurdle of overcoming social stigma, given that parents and 
family members are often reluctant to publicize cases revealing sexual abuse.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur learned that, even when cases of child exploitation are 
brought to the attention of the authorities, child victims are often not adequately protected 
during the interrogation and preparation process. In particular, she observed the total 
absence of a child-sensitive methodology for dealing with cases involving child victims of 
sexual abuse. Children are interrogated by police officers and give their statements in the 
same way as adults, in public areas of police stations, with little regard for their privacy or 
specific needs. Few, if any, opportunities exist for girl victims to give their testimony of 
their experiences with policewomen or other female professionals in a secure, reassuring 
setting. There is also a lack of awareness in the judiciary and police forces about the nature 
of sexual abuse, as shown by the widespread perception that victims are somehow to blame, 
and the punitive approach often taken to child victims. Court processes involving children 
do not provide any safeguards, and children are often forced to sit next to the perpetrator in 
court. Such practices contribute to the re-victimization of the child. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur encourages the current reform on the juvenile justice system as well as 
the adoption of the National Program for the Development of Justice for Children. 
</p>
<p>76. Another major challenge is the deep-rooted corruption and impunity among law 
enforcement officers. The Special Rapporteur learned of reports of serious and endemic 
corruption of police officers, who allegedly participate themselves in the exploitation of 
children for sexual purposes. She also heard numerous allegations of police officers 
exploiting girls for sex, both in saunas and on the street. These officers allegedly abuse the 
girls sexually and physically, then often steal their earnings as a &#8220;fine&#8221; for committing the 
&#8220;crime&#8221; of sex work. Other practices involve detaining girls in the police station for the 
alleged crime of prostitution, then releasing them only after the performance of sexual acts. 
One particularly abhorrent practice reported was that of police asking prostitutes, including 
child victims of prostitution, for free sexual services as <i>subotnik</i>, a Soviet-era practice of 
volunteer community service, in exchange for not being arrested for prostitution. This 
practice allegedly takes place even when officers are aware that the girls are underage. The 
Special Rapporteur notes, however, that under Kyrgyz law, sex work is currently neither a 
crime nor an administrative offence;10 the &#8220;fines&#8221; threatened by the police for alleged 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 
 The Government recently considered an amendment to the Administrative Liability Code making 
prostitution punishable by a fine of up to 1,500 soms ($30) and imprisonment for up to 15 days for 
repeat offences within the same year. On 18 February 2013, however, the amendment was withdrawn. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>prostitution are thus actually bribes.11 The threat of or actual detention of girls for alleged 
prostitution is thus a corrupt practice entrenched in the intrinsic power and impunity of the 
police and lack of awareness of the law on the part of victims, including children. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Assistance and care for child victims 
</b></p>
<p>77. Specific steps have been taken to improve assistance and care for child victims. 
To date, one hotline for children has been established by the Bishkek Child Protection 
Centre with the support of UNICEF. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that the 
hotline is now fully financed by the Office of the Mayor of Bishkek, and hopes that the 
initiative can be replicated throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>78. Moreover, as a result of the Children&#8217;s Code (see paras. 31&#8211;34 above), family and 
child support departments and commissions for children&#8217;s affairs have been established at 
the district level: the departments are responsible for developing individual plans for 
children in difficulty. In 2012, 11,000 such plans were reportedly developed. The 
commissions are composed of legal representatives, including from the Office of the 
Prosecutor General, the police and education, health and social protection authorities. Non-
governmental and other organizations may be seconded to the commissions. Their main 
function is to approve the individual plans developed by the departments, and monitor their 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>79. At the sub-district level (<i>ayil okmotu</i>), a single (or several in larger municipalities) 
leading specialist on social issues is responsible for the identification, assessment and 
provision of support for families and children in difficulty. The specialist is responsible for 
several villages and, as stipulated in the Children&#8217;s Code, reports to the head of the 
municipality and the local parliament. The specialist is also required to provide assistance 
to family and child support and social protection departments at the district level. The lack 
of sub-district representation, limited staff and the lack of transportation, however, make 
the implementation of statutory duties difficult for family and child support departments, 
particularly with regard to vulnerable children in remote areas. Individual case management 
is often weak. Moreover, the capacity of departments to provide comprehensive and 
sustainable care, regular follow-up for children and support to families remains insufficient. 
</p>
<p>80. Overall, while developments in the assistance and services for child victims are 
significant, it is essential that such assistance and services be made readily available to all 
children without discrimination, and provide for child-sensitive counselling and reporting 
mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur therefore urges the Government to scale up the use of 
hotlines and strengthen referral systems at the local level. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Residential institutions 
</b></p>
<p>81. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur visited a number of public (managed by the 
ministries of Education and Science, Health and Social Development, and Internal Affairs) 
and private residential institutions.12 
</p>
<p>

<p> 12 The Child Support Centre for Child Victims of Abuse and Violence, the Rehabilitation and 
Adaptation Centre for Homeless and Street Children, the Oktyabrskoe Residential Institution

Shelter and the Hachida Shelter. </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur noted that care conditions in the residential facilities varied. 
The most common infrastructural problems encountered were due to the absence or poor 
conditions of washing and sanitary facilities. Moreover, almost all the residential 
institutions visited suffered from a lack of resources, which have an impact on their ability 
to provide children with adequate facilities and the services that they require.  
</p>
<p>83. Although the Special Rapporteur met with children in institutions who were victims 
of sexual abuse and exploitation, she regrettably observed a widespread lack of early 
detection in the institutions, often involving the absence of detection mechanisms and 
reporting facilities, as well as a lack of training for staff members to recognize abuse 
indicators. She also noted a lack of readily available psychosocial follow-up mechanisms 
for child victims actually identified.  
</p>
<p>84. Although the Special Rapporteur did learn of allegations of abuses against children 
in institutions, she observed a general lack of oversight and independent monitoring of 
possible abuse in the facilities themselves. She was also concerned at the insufficient 
separation of girls&#8217; and boys&#8217; living quarters in many institutions, and the lack of child-
friendly complaint mechanisms. She was also informed of reports that certain institutions 
sent children out to work during the day to earn money for the institutions, which is a clear 
violation of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that the Children&#8217;s Code now requires a 
court order for the placement of a child in a residential institution. Proper implementation 
of this provision will, it is hoped, drastically reduce the number of children in institutions.  
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur also observed that patterns of institutionalization of 
children, entrenched during the Soviet period, are still evident throughout the country. She 
was informed that the number of children deprived of parental care and children with 
disabilities in institutions for children rose in Kyrgyzstan between 2005 and 2010.  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that residential institutions are funded 
according to their capacity, which creates a financial incentive to keep them full. 
Furthermore, given the meagre cash transfers to poverty-targeted families to assist with 
supporting children and the lack of alternative support mechanisms, families unable to care 
for their children often take their children to institutions with the aim of securing better 
education and regular meals for them. Indeed, recent research by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan 
indicates that 94 per cent of children living in residential institutions in Kyrgyzstan are not 
orphans of both parents, but have been placed there because their families cannot afford to 
keep them.13 Moreover, some residents in institutions are street children who have been 
rounded up. 
</p>
<p>88. The number of non-governmental private residential institutions has grown in recent 
years. The Special Rapporteur observed that no evaluation of these institutions is actually 
carried out, despite the provisions of the 2012 Children&#8217;s Code regarding accreditation of 
facilities serving children in difficult living conditions. There appears to be no 
comprehensive list of all institutions currently registered. Furthermore, owing to a lack of 
disaggregated data and of regular inspections of private institutions, the number of children 
residing in institutions is unclear. The Special Rapporteur noted a lack of consistency in the 
categorization of institutions, and therefore the urgent need to ensure that all institutions are 
properly categorized and registered.

<p>89. In the light of the above-mentioned challenges, in 2011, a study supported by 
UNICEF was conducted to analyse the situation of residential institutions throughout the 
country. The analysis subsequently served as a basis for an inter-agency plan on optimizing 
the management and financing of residential institutions, adopted by the Government on 
7 December 2012. In accordance with the plan, the Ministry of Social Development 
developed a database on all institutions and their accreditation status. Minimum standards 
of care for all residential institutions, both public and private, were developed and approved 
by governmental decree No. 691 on 9 October 2012. Although the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes this development, she notes the need for regular independent monitoring to 
ensure full compliance, in both public and private institutions. In this regard, she welcomes 
the law adopted on 12 July 2013 establishing the National Centre for the Prevention of 
Torture, which allows for visits to all closed institutions, including residential institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Prevention, capacity-building and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur was informed of various training and capacity-building 
initiatives on children&#8217;s rights offered to stakeholders in both governmental and non-
governmental institutions. She did, however, observe an overarching lack of awareness and 
understanding of the phenomenon of child sexual exploitation. In particular, she noted the 
need to change the perception of child victims of sexual exploitation, to viewing them as 
victims rather than adopting a punitive approach to prostitution. She therefore encourages 
the organization of further training initiatives tailored to address a wide range of children&#8217;s 
rights issues, such as sexual tourism, online pornography and cybercrime involving 
children, thereby meeting the specific needs of professionals dealing with child victims and 
witnesses, such as teachers, police officers, judges, prosecutors and health and social 
workers. 
</p>
<p>91. Specifically with regard to child pornography, the Special Rapporteur observed that 
all authorities with whom she met had an insufficient awareness of child sexual exploitation 
online. A complete lack of control over Internet service providers, ready access to 
information and communications technologies by all users, including children, weak 
control mechanisms in high-risk areas, such as cyber cafes, and the lack of awareness and 
expertise on the issue among government officials, including within policing and justice 
services, all contribute to this phenomenon escaping the scrutiny of the authorities. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur noted that mechanisms to protect children from 
pornography have not yet been sufficiently developed in Kyrgyzstan; for example there is 
currently no legal means to detect and block pornography sites. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of a parliamentary working group to study 
legislation on Internet regulation, and looks forward to its recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Child participation 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur noted that the active participation of children is not 
mainstreamed and effective in institutions and in initiatives that concern them, and that few 
child-led initiatives actually exist. For example, although there is a Deputy Ombudsman for 
Children, access by children to the Office of the Ombudsman is difficult and could benefit 
from more local offices and resources. 
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur therefore notes the need for greater, systematic participation 
of children in policies and programmes affecting them. She recalls that child participation 
entails the right of each child to express his or her views and to have those views taken into 
consideration in all matters that concern that child&#8217;s life, with the objective of influencing 
decision-making and achieving change. Children are not simply victims, or vulnerable to 
becoming victims; they can and should take part actively in finding solutions, and must 
therefore be empowered to fight for their own protection and that of their peers. </p>

<p><b> 7. Corporate social responsibility and transnational cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Involvement of the private sector 
</i>94. With regard to the Internet, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that private 
companies, including Internet service providers, mobile phone operators and search 
engines, have not adopted any codes of conduct or self-regulating mechanisms and do not 
have the legal obligation to report violations, block access to sites or retain material for a 
specific period of time for the purposes of investigation and legal proceedings. In a similar 
way, the tourism and travel industry has not adopted the Code of Conduct for the Protection 
of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism. 
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that the media are not involved in 
developing awareness-raising programmes regarding the promotion of children&#8217;s rights and 
their safety on line. The participation of the private sector through public/private 
partnerships is lacking. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) International and regional cooperation 
</i>96. The sale and sexual exploitation of children have become increasingly international 
phenomena owing to the development of information technologies, trafficking networks, 
tourism and migration. Kyrgyzstan must therefore enhance its bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation to address these crimes, particularly with regard to extraterritorial jurisdiction, 
extradition, the exchange of information among law enforcement authorities, mutual legal 
assistance and the seizure and confiscation of proceeds relating to cases described in the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the fact that the Government has taken 
significant steps to introduce new laws, most notably the Children&#8217;s Code, and other 
policies to strengthen the protection of children from sale, prostitution and 
pornography and, of children&#8217;s rights in general. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Government is, however, struggling to ensure a sustained impact on the 
lives of vulnerable children owing to the unknown extent of the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography in the country. Existing policies on child rights 
are weak and are also limited by the lack of resources and a failure to implement 
adequate monitoring and evaluation systems not only of legislative and institutional 
policies and programmes but also for institutions working with children. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Kyrgyzstan must continue to work towards the implementation of all the range 
of instruments and strategies at its disposal to ensure a comprehensive national child 
protection strategy centred on children&#8217;s rights, in coordination with the Strategy for 
the Development of Social Protection and the new national programme on justice for 
children currently being developed. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>For the Government of Kyrgyzstan to consolidate its achievements, overcome 
the remaining challenges and ensure the effective protection of all children without </b></p>

<p><b> (e) Strengthening the family and child support department at the local level, 
including by providing a larger and more sustainable budget for the recruitment of 
social workers, increasing the number of inspectors of children&#8217;s affairs, and 
improving the training of teachers in schools. These positions should be accompanied 
by clear job descriptions, and include ongoing training in areas of key competences. 
For individuals and agencies working with children at the local level, the Government 
should make an effort to lighten the bureaucratic workload and focus on more direct 
and sustainable work with children, families and communities. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Government should furthermore promote strong preventive measures to 
protect vulnerable children by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Investing and developing family strengthening programmes for both 
parents and relatives of children, including by ensuring greater economic support and 
empowerment, psychosocial support and parenting to families at risk;  
</b></p>

<p><b> (c) Providing communities with information, thereby helping to break down 
taboos about child victims of sexual crimes and sexual offences against children in 
general; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Providing online programmes on sex education, reproductive health and

</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Government should also provide alternatives to the institutionalization of 
children by: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Establishing clear categories and norms for shelters, and ensuring that 
all residential institutions are properly registered; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Implementing the inter-agency plan on optimizing the management and 
financing of residential institutions (2012&#8211;2014), including by providing an adequate 
budget and, in particular, ensuring the development and monitoring of minimum 
standards of care for all residential centres, both public and private; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensuring ready access to social services for families and children living 
in difficult circumstances with the aim of ensuring that children remain in familiar 
surroundings, preventing further psychological trauma and preserving child-parent 
relationships; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Favouring family- or community-based environments, including foster 
families and other caregivers, and incorporating family support and counselling over 
institutional or residential care; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Registering all institutions, which must be required to provide monthly 
reports on the children, and detailed information on their care and transfer; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Creating an independent monitoring and supervision system for the 
above-mentioned centres, assessing the degree of compliance with standards of 
children&#8217;s rights. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government develop a 
reliable and standardized information system by: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Strengthening the national statistics committee and training local actors 
to collect data on child victims and children at risk; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establishing a standardized, computerized and centralized information-
gathering system capable of disaggregating data by sex, age, type of violation and 
measures taken, as well as harmonizing data collection and processing methods; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Conducting surveys to ensure better understanding and knowledge of 
the evolution of risk factors and trends in the sale and sexual exploitation of children. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Government should also promote effective child participation by: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Expanding child-friendly spaces and mechanisms for the exchange of 
information and for consultations; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Ensuring the systematic participation of child in the design of and 
follow-up activities to programmes and strategies relating to their rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Promoting, with the participation of children, sustainable education and 
awareness-raising campaigns in schools and communities, including rural and remote 
communities, by all forms of media, information and communication technologies, 
including social networking tools. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government implement regular

levels with a view to making it more accessible to children, and facilitating its capacity 
to conduct independent monitoring; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establishing child protection indicators to follow up policies and 
measure their impact on the situation of children&#8217;s rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Developing effective accountability mechanisms through the effective 
regulation and monitoring of child protection standards at all levels. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Government should in addition promote corporate social responsibility by:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Involving Internet service providers and telecommunication companies 
in the protection of children against online sexual exploitation, by restricting access to 
harmful or illegal content by filtering, blocking and monitoring programmes; 
providing tools that allow parents and caregivers to control the content of users; 
providing children and their parents with information and user-friendly tools; ending 
the use of the Internet and new technologies for the grooming of children; reporting 
offending content to police; and establishing accessible telephone or web-based 
hotlines; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Encouraging tourism and travel agencies to adopt the Code of Conduct 
for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism.</b> 
</p>
<p>109. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen transnational cooperation among law enforcement and 
justice agencies by sharing information relating to the detection of crimes, the 
identification of child victims and the prosecution of offenders; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen institutional capacities and implement effective child 
protection systems through the ongoing technical and logistical assistance of United 
Nations agencies and the international community.
