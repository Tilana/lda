</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 4<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Independent International 
Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic </b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> With no end in sight, the Syrian conflict has continued to intensify. Civilians, Syrians of all 
</p>
<p>backgrounds, have been the subject of crimes against humanity and war crimes, as well as 
</p>
<p>other serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross violations of their human 
</p>
<p>rights. These transgressions are massive in extent and scope. 
</p>
<p>Within the overall civilian population, groups and communities have been specifically 
</p>
<p>targeted by one or more of the warring parties. Furthermore, there are groups and communities 
</p>
<p>on which the war has left a distinct mark. Often individuals suffer on the basis of multiple 
</p>
<p>aspects of their identity, including their gender, age, ethnicity, religion and profession. 
</p>
<p>Civilians are suffering the unimaginable, as the world stands witness. Without stronger 
</p>
<p>efforts to bring parties to the peace table, ready to compromise, current trends suggest that the 
</p>
<p>Syrian conflict &#8211; and the killing and destruction it wreaks &#8211; will continue for the foreseeable 
</p>
<p>future. 
</p>
<p>From the interviews gathered by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic, a resonant cry for peace and accountability rings out. It is the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the warring parties and influential States to seek peace, and the particular 
</p>
<p>obligation of the Security Council, in the context of the war in the Syrian Arab Republic, to 
</p>
<p>open a path to justice.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/24, 
</p>
<p>the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic presents 
</p>
<p>its findings based on investigations conducted from 10 January to 10 July 2015.1
 
This report 
</p>
<p>should be read in conjunction with previous reports of the Commission.2  
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Commission&#8217;s investigations remain curtailed by the denial of access to the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>3. The methodology employed by the Commission was based on standard practices of 
</p>
<p>commissions of inquiry and human rights investigations. The commission relied primarily 
</p>
<p>on first-hand accounts. 
</p>
<p>4. The information contained herein is based on 335 interviews conducted in the region 
</p>
<p>and from Geneva. Since September 2011, 3,840 interviews have been conducted by the 
</p>
<p>Commission.  
</p>
<p>5. Photographs, video recordings, satellite imagery and medical records were collected 
</p>
<p>and analysed. Reports from Governments and non-governmental sources, academic 
</p>
<p>analyses and United Nations reports formed part of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>6. The standard of proof is met when the Commission has reasonable grounds to 
</p>
<p>believe that incidents occurred as described. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conflict dynamics  
</b></p>
<p>7. With no end in sight, the Syrian conflict has continued to intensify across an 
</p>
<p>increasing number of complex and often unpredictable frontlines. Benefitting from support 
</p>
<p>provided by a variety of external backers, including States and individuals, warring parties 
</p>
<p>have battled vehemently to expand geographically. This has repeatedly brought chaos and 
</p>
<p>destruction to new localities hosting local communities and internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>(IDPs). Simultaneously, sporadic but persistent fighting and bombardment also occurred in 
</p>
<p>multiple low-scale and static battlefields, where involved actors lack the necessary 
</p>
<p>manpower and supplies to break the stalemate. 
</p>
<p>8. None of the belligerents seem either close to collapse or positioned to secure an 
</p>
<p>outright military triumph. After more than four years of fighting, all have secured sufficient 
</p>
<p>support channels, territorial gains and operational capabilities to sustain them for several 
</p>
<p>more years. Without stronger efforts to bring parties to the peace table, ready to 
</p>
<p>compromise, current trends suggest that the Syrian conflict &#8211; and the killing and destruction 
</p>
<p>it wreaks &#8211; will continue for the foreseeable future. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chair), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Vitit Muntarbhorn 
</p>
<p>and Carla Del Ponte. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50, A/HRC/22/59, A/HRC/23/58, A/HRC/24/46, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/65 and A/HRC/27/60.  </p>


<p>9. While fought mostly by Syrians and largely contained within Syrian territory, the 
</p>
<p>war is increasingly driven by international and regional powers, primarily in accordance 
</p>
<p>with their respective geostrategic interests. Syrian stakeholders, on all sides of the conflict, 
</p>
<p>have gradually lost control over the course of events due to a variety of external factors that 
</p>
<p>have obscured the internal dimension of the war. As the war endures, it displays worrying 
</p>
<p>signs of becoming internationalized. The competition among regional powers for influence 
</p>
<p>has resulted, among other consequences, in an alarming exacerbation of the sectarian 
</p>
<p>dimension, instigated by the intervention of foreign fighters and extremist clerics. 
</p>
<p>10. Government forces3 have struggled against mounting military pressure by anti-
</p>
<p>Government armed groups, as well as Jabhat Al-Nusra and Islamic State of Iraq and al-
</p>
<p>Sham (ISIS), successively losing strategic localities and military positions in several 
</p>
<p>governorates. Unable to advance during most of their recent attacks in Aleppo and southern 
</p>
<p>Dara&#8217;a, Government forces have also failed to prevent the collapse of their external 
</p>
<p>defensive lines during offensives by ISIS and other armed groups in strategic areas such as 
</p>
<p>eastern Homs and Idlib.  
</p>
<p>11. As recognized by President Bashar al-Assad in his July televised address, shortages 
</p>
<p>in loyal manpower, combined with the proliferation of highly active fronts, have 
</p>
<p>constrained Government forces&#8217; ability to react simultaneously throughout the country. As 
</p>
<p>a result, the Government has prioritized highly strategic areas such as Damascus, coastal 
</p>
<p>governorates, and communication lines along the Lebanese borders, the only international 
</p>
<p>borders they still control. Besides continuing aerial bombardments, Government forces 
</p>
<p>relied heavily and regularly on Hezbollah and other foreign Shia militia. In particular, elite 
</p>
<p>units including the Republican Guard and the 4th Division have been significantly affected 
</p>
<p>by casualties and war attrition.  
</p>
<p>12. Anti-Government armed groups, ranging from Free Syrian Army (FSA) affiliates to 
</p>
<p>groups such as Ahrar Al-Sham, made important tactical gains along frontlines with 
</p>
<p>Government forces in Idlib, Dara&#8217;a and Aleppo governorates. While intermittently fighting 
</p>
<p>ISIS and its allies in northern Aleppo countryside and southern Damascus, they have 
</p>
<p>increasingly collaborated with Jabhat Al-Nusra and groups such as Ansar Al-Deen and 
</p>
<p>Jund Al-Aqsa, apparently prioritizing present operational necessities over ideological and 
</p>
<p>political divergences.4  
</p>
<p>13. Significant improvements in coordination and access to logistical support have 
</p>
<p>contributed to enhanced overall operational performance, leading to fresh advances. 
</p>
<p>Divisions over ideology and politics, as well as infighting over resources and territory, 
</p>
<p>persist and may continue to undermine unity and coherence within their ranks in the future. 
</p>
<p>14. Jabhat Al-Nusra, the Syrian affiliate of Al-Qaida, has played a key role during 
</p>
<p>armed groups&#8217; recent gains in Idlib, where it regularly operates in close proximity with 
</p>
<p>groups from different ideological backgrounds. Composed mainly of Syrian militants &#8211; in 
</p>
<p>contrast to ISIS &#8211; it has reinforced its hold on large parts of Idlib governorate, devolving 
</p>
<p>resources and efforts on local governance. With a particular focus on putting security and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The term &#8220;Government forces&#8221;, unless specified otherwise, includes the Syrian Armed Forces, 
</p>
<p>intelligence forces and associated foreign and local militias, including Hezbollah, the <i>shabbiha</i>, 
</p>
<p>popular committees and National Defence Forces.  
</p>
<p> 4 While in some Syrian governorates, Jabhat Al-Nusra has undertaken major operations in concert with 
</p>
<p>anti-Government armed groups, these coalitions generally arise out of operational necessity rather 
</p>
<p>than genuine ideological engagement. In all references to Jabhat Al-Nusra in this report, the 
</p>
<p>Commission continues to regard the group as a terrorist entity as designated by Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 2170 (2014). </p>


<p>justice mechanisms in place, the group has consolidated its influence over communities, 
</p>
<p>imposing its extremist ideology. 
</p>
<p>15. Relations between Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS have been characterized mainly by 
</p>
<p>distrust and conflict. They have clashed predominantly over control of resources, despite 
</p>
<p>rare instances of collaboration in isolated fronts such as Al-Yarmouk camp in Damascus 
</p>
<p>city, and the western Qalamoun area in Rif Damascus.  
</p>
<p>16. ISIS has consolidated its influence over large parts of northern and eastern 
</p>
<p>governorates while dramatically escalating its attacks targeting Government forces&#8217; 
</p>
<p>positions and towns in Homs and Hasakah governorates. The terrorist group has also 
</p>
<p>expanded into new areas in the centre and the south as far as Dara&#8217;a and Suweida 
</p>
<p>governorates by absorbing new loyalties among local militant groups operating far beyond 
</p>
<p>its strongholds. 
</p>
<p>17. Following significant losses in Raqqah at the hands of the Kurdish armed group, the 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Protection Units (YPG), ISIS adopted a new modus operandi incorporating 
</p>
<p>extensive use of suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and hit-and-run tactics. 
</p>
<p>The international coalition against ISIS has recently expanded, strengthening its capacity to 
</p>
<p>fight ISIS. Its airstrikes, however, have degraded the group&#8217;s operational performance only 
</p>
<p>when conducted alongside YPG ground operations.  
</p>
<p>18. The YPG &#8211; supported by local armed groups and the international coalition 
</p>
<p>airstrikes &#8211; have advanced in north-eastern Syrian governorates. After clearing the canton 
</p>
<p>of Ayn Al-Arab/Kobane5
 
(Aleppo), they seized the border crossing of Tal Abyad (Raqqah) 
</p>
<p>in a significant victory against ISIS, connecting Kobane and Al-Jazire into a contiguous 
</p>
<p>zone.  
</p>
<p>19. Providing most of the fighting forces, the YPG has fought on different fronts 
</p>
<p>alongside a variety of armed groups including Arab tribes, Assyrian militia, and FSA-
</p>
<p>affiliated factions. Geographically, YPG forces have advanced recently into Arab-
</p>
<p>dominated areas beyond Kurdish territories, stirring resentment among some local 
</p>
<p>communities. 
</p>
<p>20. In an effort to bring warring parties to the negotiating table, United Nations Special 
</p>
<p>Envoy Staffan de Mistura submitted a new proposal to the Security Council on 29 July, 
</p>
<p>aimed at reaching a Syrian-owned framework document on the implementation of the 2012 
</p>
<p>Geneva Communiqu&#233;. After extensive consultation with belligerents and influential States, 
</p>
<p>the Special Envoy proposed the formation of four subject-specific working groups which 
</p>
<p>would address the following themes: &#8220;safety and protection for all&#8221;; &#8220;political and 
</p>
<p>constitutional issues&#8221;; &#8220;military and security issues&#8221;; and &#8220;public institutions, 
</p>
<p>reconstruction and development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. The uninterrupted flow of refugees into neighbouring countries continues to 
</p>
<p>destabilize the region and severely affect the livelihoods, public services and availability of 
</p>
<p>basic commodities in the hosting communities. These economic and social challenges, 
</p>
<p>compounded by security concerns, have prompted neighbouring countries to adopt border 
</p>
<p>management measures which, in the words of High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio 
</p>
<p>Guterres, &#8220;limit refugees&#8217; chances of reaching safety&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. The protection space for Syrians trying to escape the conflict is steadily shrinking. 
</p>
<p>Serious funding shortfalls endanger the lives of the most vulnerable segments of Syria&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>displaced population.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 Hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Kobane&#8221;.  </p>


<p><b> III. Impact of the Syrian conflict on various civilian groups and 
communities 
</b></p>
<p>23. Civilians continue to be the main victims of the Syrian conflict. As violence has 
</p>
<p>engulfed their lives, schools and neighbourhoods, civilians have fled to dwindling safe 
</p>
<p>havens inside the Syrian Arab Republic, or over its borders.  
</p>
<p>24. Within the overall civilian population, some groups and communities have been 
</p>
<p>specifically targeted by one or more of the warring parties. Furthermore, there are groups 
</p>
<p>and communities on whom the war has a distinct impact. Often individuals suffer on the 
</p>
<p>basis of multiple aspects of their identity, including their gender, age, ethnicity, religion and 
</p>
<p>profession. An attack on a civilian population may particularly affect or be directed towards 
</p>
<p>civilian women, or indeed, civilian women of a particular ethnicity, for example. Such is 
</p>
<p>the reality of the war in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>25. The present report examines the impact of the Syrian conflict on some of the most 
</p>
<p>affected groups and communities. It does not, however, offer an exhaustive list &#8211; an 
</p>
<p>impossibility given the richness of the Syrian mosaic.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Civilians 
</b></p>
<p>26. Warring parties conduct hostilities with little, if any, regard for the laws of war and, 
</p>
<p>in particular, its foundational principle of distinction. Regardless of the belligerent 
</p>
<p>involved, the majority of attacks are not directed at a specific military objective or fail to 
</p>
<p>employ a method or means of combat that can be directed at a specific military objective. 
</p>
<p>Indiscriminate attacks on residential areas have led to massive casualties among Syrian 
</p>
<p>civilians.  
</p>
<p>27. Government forces (including paramilitary and foreign and local supporting militia), 
</p>
<p>anti-Government armed groups, Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS all locate military objectives 
</p>
<p>within or near densely populated civilian-inhabited areas, endangering the civilian 
</p>
<p>population.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Ground attacks 
</b></p>
<p>28. As warring parties advanced, they undertook ground attacks on civilian-inhabited 
</p>
<p>villages on frontlines. In the ground attacks detailed below, Government forces, anti-
</p>
<p>Government armed groups, Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS have killed civilian residents. 
</p>
<p>29. In mid-February, Government forces entered Hardetein village (Aleppo). Civilians 
</p>
<p>were shot and killed as they fled.  
</p>
<p>30. Government forces entered Busr Al-Hareer, Miskiya Al-Sharqiya, Miskiya Al-
</p>
<p>Gharbiya and Musetba villages in the Dara&#8217;a countryside in April. While the area was 
</p>
<p>under the control of the FSA, fighters were not present at the time of the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>advance. Government forces killed approximately 40 men and injured 60 others.  
</p>
<p>31. In March, anti-Government armed groups, fighting alongside Jabhat Al-Nusra, 
</p>
<p>attacked and overran Busra Al-Sham (Dara&#8217;a), killing male and female residents. Acting in 
</p>
<p>concert with Jabhat Al-Nusra, armed groups attacked Ishtabraq (Idlib) in April, killing 
</p>
<p>fleeing civilians. In mid-June, Jabhat Al-Nusra fighters executed 24 men in Qalb Lawza 
</p>
<p>(Idlib). 
</p>
<p>32. ISIS executed civilians during its February offensive against Assyrian villages along 
</p>
<p>the Khabour River (Hasakah), including Tel Hermes, Tel Shamran, and Qabr Shamie. At 
</p>
<p>the end of March, it attacked Mabouja (Hama). From 25-27 June, the terrorist group also </p>


<p>launched an attack on Kobane, killing approximately 250 civilians. These attacks are 
</p>
<p>detailed in Section H below. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Aerial bombardments and shelling  
</b></p>
<p>33. The Government has continued aerially bombarding civilian-inhabited localities. 
</p>
<p>Areas of Aleppo, Dayr Az-Zawr, Idlib, Damascus and Dara&#8217;a have come under intense 
</p>
<p>attack, leading to widespread civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>34. Some attacks were directed towards civilian gathering places, specifically markets 
</p>
<p>and transport hubs. In early February, bus gathering points in Baidin and Al-Hayderia 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods of Aleppo city were hit with barrel bombs, killing civilians. In May, the 
</p>
<p>Government launched an airstrike on Jisr Al-Haj, where buses and taxis collect passengers 
</p>
<p>in Aleppo city. Approximately 40 people were killed. The majority were civilians, 
</p>
<p>including several children.  
</p>
<p>35. In May, Government helicopters dropped multiple-barrel bombs on three markets in 
</p>
<p>ISIS-controlled Al-Bab, in northern Aleppo. ISIS was not present inside the markets, which 
</p>
<p>sold vegetables, women&#8217;s clothing and agricultural equipment, respectively. In early June, a 
</p>
<p>Government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb on Jib Al-Quba food market, in Aleppo city. 
</p>
<p>The attack resulted in civilian casualties. There were no military objectives in the market. 
</p>
<p>36. Anti-Government armed groups have shelled civilian-inhabited towns and 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods in Aleppo, Damascus, Idlib and Latakia. Government-controlled 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods in Aleppo city remain under regular bombardment from armed groups. In 
</p>
<p>early May, an unidentified armed group fired a rocket into Al-Mougambo neighbourhood, 
</p>
<p>killing nine civilians. Armed groups periodically cut water to Government-held Aleppo 
</p>
<p>city. 
</p>
<p>37. Anti-Government armed groups continue to fire rockets and mortars into the 
</p>
<p>Jaramana and Sayda Zeinab neighbourhoods of Damascus city, resulting in many civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties. Prior to the ground attacks in Dara&#8217;a and Idlib, anti-Government armed groups 
</p>
<p>and Jabhat Al-Nusra indiscriminately shelled villages as they advanced.  
</p>
<p>38. In April, the international coalition launched an airstrike on Beir Mihli (Aleppo), 
</p>
<p>located along a frontline between the YPG and ISIS. It remains unclear what military 
</p>
<p>objectives were present in the village, but the number of civilian casualties &#8211; reportedly 
</p>
<p>over 60 people &#8211; is of serious concern. Similarly, in a coalition airstrike on Dali Hasan 
</p>
<p>(Aleppo) in June, a family &#8211; including five children &#8211; was killed. The military objective is 
</p>
<p>still to be clarified. 
</p>
<p>39. Investigations are continuing into the alleged use of chemical weapons, in the form 
</p>
<p>of chlorine and/or phosgene gas, in Sermin, Saraqib, Qmenas and Binish, as well as other 
</p>
<p>towns and villages in Idlib in March and April.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Fighting-age men 
</b></p>
<p>40. While few civilians have been left unscathed by the continuing brutality of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian war, it is civilian men who make up the largest community of victims. Civilian men 
</p>
<p>perceived to be of fighting age have been targeted by warring parties during ground </p>


<p>attacks.6
 
They are also the primary civilian victims of enforced disappearance, torture and 
</p>
<p>unlawful killing. 
</p>
<p>41. Consistent with previously documented patterns, men &#8211; particularly those with 
</p>
<p>identification cards showing them to be from restive areas &#8211; are arbitrarily arrested by 
</p>
<p>Government forces. This happened most frequently at checkpoints in Government-
</p>
<p>controlled areas of Damascus and Aleppo cities, as well as on the main routes linking 
</p>
<p>Damascus and Dara&#8217;a governorates. Countless men remain detained due to activities 
</p>
<p>relating to their exercise of freedom of expression or assembly. Others appear to have been 
</p>
<p>detained to pressure family members wanted by the authorities, rendering their detention 
</p>
<p>unlawful.  
</p>
<p>42. While enforced disappearances were first documented during the March 2011 
</p>
<p>protests, subsequent investigations uncovered a countrywide pattern in which mainly adult 
</p>
<p>male civilians have been seized by Government forces and disappeared.  
</p>
<p>43. Most former detainees interviewed by the Commission are adult men. Their 
</p>
<p>treatment is detailed in Section F, below.  
</p>
<p>44. The Government&#8217;s ubiquitous checkpoints have vastly limited the freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement of men seeking to leave opposition-held areas. Civilian men are effectively 
</p>
<p>trapped in areas in which there may be heavy clashes or intense aerial bombardments. Even 
</p>
<p>in calmer areas or periods, the specific threats posed to civilian men from Government 
</p>
<p>checkpoints have prevented them from accessing work and therefore, from being able to 
</p>
<p>provide for their families. Multiple accounts have been documented of women leaving their 
</p>
<p>husbands behind in opposition-held areas to accompany their pre-adolescent sons through 
</p>
<p>the checkpoints and out of the area before they reach an age where they are likely to be 
</p>
<p>stopped by Government forces.  
</p>
<p>45. The Government&#8217;s recent campaign of conscripting men into its armed forces has 
</p>
<p>further inhibited the movement of adult men to and within Government-held areas. 
</p>
<p>46. The majority of those executed by ISIS are adult men. In many instances, ISIS 
</p>
<p>declared the men to be captured fighters or civilian collaborators with Government forces 
</p>
<p>or other armed groups as a justification for murdering them.  
</p>
<p>47. ISIS has also forcibly recruited men and boys. As the group&#8217;s control over the Dayr 
</p>
<p>Az-Zawr countryside has solidified, ISIS reportedly demanded that each family send at 
</p>
<p>least one son to fight with the group.  
</p>
<p>48. In ISIS-controlled areas, specific rules apply to men. These are less restrictive than 
</p>
<p>the rules applying to women and girls over the age of 10, but include a dress code, having a 
</p>
<p>beard of a particular length, and attending Friday prayers at the mosque. Failure to abide by 
</p>
<p>these rules frequently results in lashing. Men found in the company of women to whom 
</p>
<p>they are not related risk a charge of adultery, punishable by death. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Women 
</b></p>
<p>49. Throughout the unrest and conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, women and girls 
</p>
<p>have been targeted on the basis of their gender.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 As documented in the Commission&#8217;s previous reports, those treated as being of fighting age include 
</p>
<p>boys under the age of 18 years. The treatment of male minors, including the violations committed 
</p>
<p>against them, is covered in Sect. D (Children), below. </p>


<p>50. Women have also been targeted because of their familial links, actual or assumed, 
</p>
<p>with male members of opposing warring parties. For the belligerents, the very act of 
</p>
<p>detaining a woman, with all the risks to her person that this implies, appears designed to 
</p>
<p>humiliate not only the woman, but also &#8211; and arguably, primarily &#8211; her male relatives. 
</p>
<p>51. Government forces have arrested female lawyers, journalists and peace activists and 
</p>
<p>those expressing anti-Government sentiments. Women have also been detained in order to 
</p>
<p>force the surrender of male relatives suspected of fighting with, or otherwise supporting, 
</p>
<p>anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>52. Female detainees are imprisoned in squalid, insect-infested cells and subjected to 
</p>
<p>torture and inhuman treatment, as detailed in Section F. Medical care, if available at all, is 
</p>
<p>inadequate. In particular, no care is taken to address women&#8217;s distinct medical and 
</p>
<p>physiological needs.  
</p>
<p>53. Women have suffered rape and other forms of sexual violence by Government 
</p>
<p>personnel while held in detention facilities. Sexual assault has also been committed by 
</p>
<p>Government forces at checkpoints. That women can move more freely than men in 
</p>
<p>Government-held areas has increased their vulnerability to physical and sexual assault, by 
</p>
<p>Government forces and by criminal elements within the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>54. The Government&#8217;s campaign of arrests and disappearance of fighting-age men has 
</p>
<p>had acute economic and social effects on the women left behind. The mental anguish that 
</p>
<p>women endure as a result of the disappearance of their male relatives is a human rights 
</p>
<p>violation in itself. Beyond this, female relatives are often left with no means of supporting 
</p>
<p>themselves or their children. Without confirmation of death, they are in legal limbo, unable 
</p>
<p>to inherit or sell property, or to remarry.  
</p>
<p>55. Anti-Government armed groups have kidnapped women in order to effect prisoner 
</p>
<p>exchanges for women and fighters detained by the Government.  
</p>
<p>56. Approximately 100 women and children were taken hostage by a coalition of armed 
</p>
<p>groups, including Jabhat Al-Nusra and Ahrar Al-Sham, during an attack on Alawite 
</p>
<p>villages in Latakia countryside in August 2013. The hostages (at least half of whom were 
</p>
<p>minors) received limited medical treatment and food. Three elderly women died of treatable 
</p>
<p>ailments while detained. Approximately 40 have been released in prisoner exchanges so far. 
</p>
<p>57. In recent months, Jabhat Al-Nusra assumed control of some towns and villages in 
</p>
<p>the Idlib countryside. Reports are emerging from Maarrat Misrin about the group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>restrictions of personal freedoms, including a requirement that women cover their hair. Two 
</p>
<p>women were reportedly executed in January 2015 in Maarrat Misrin and Hafsarjah, 
</p>
<p>following a local Sharia court&#8217;s finding that they had committed adultery.  
</p>
<p>58. Since ISIS emerged as a force in early 2013, cases of women being stoned to death 
</p>
<p>have been documented. Often accused of having committed adultery, it appears that many 
</p>
<p>were executed for assisting fighters of other groups or for continuing professional activities. 
</p>
<p>In so doing, women came into contact with men to whom they were not related. 
</p>
<p>59. As detailed in Section H, ISIS continues to hold Yazidi women and girls captive in 
</p>
<p>sexual slavery. The terrorist group has also forced Sunni women and girls into marriages 
</p>
<p>with its fighters. 
</p>
<p>60. ISIS has removed women and girls from public life and placed them entirely under 
</p>
<p>the control of male relatives. Women and girls over the age of 10 may not appear publicly 
</p>
<p>without being entirely covered, and may not travel without a close male relative. It is 
</p>
<p>impossible for women whose husbands have died, fled, or are at the battlefront, to leave 
</p>
<p>their homes for any reason without risking punishment.  </p>


<p>61. These rules are punishable by lashing, which is often administered by Al-Hisbah, 
</p>
<p>ISIS&#8217; morality police. An all-female unit of Al-Hisbah, Al-Khansaa, is sometimes 
</p>
<p>responsible for the lashing of women.  
</p>
<p>62. ISIS&#8217; rules against the mixing of the sexes have adversely impacted women and 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; ability to access health care. Many doctors fled ISIS-controlled areas in 2013, and 
</p>
<p>there are very few female doctors present in the region. Consequently, specialist care for 
</p>
<p>women and girls is extremely limited. 
</p>
<p>63. Sieges and the denial of humanitarian assistance have had a distinct impact on 
</p>
<p>women. Lack of food and medical care has adversely affected the health of pregnant 
</p>
<p>women and nursing mothers, as well as contributing to a rise in infant mortality. 
</p>
<p>64. While women continue to be the subject of violations &#8211; including being targeted 
</p>
<p>based on their gender &#8211; to regard women solely as victims is to misunderstand the 
</p>
<p>important and often overlooked female experience of the ongoing war. 
</p>
<p>65. Women make up more than half of Syrian refugees and IDPs. This is due to adult 
</p>
<p>men being away fighting, or having been killed or disappeared. Where families remain 
</p>
<p>intact, adult men from restive areas or from communities perceived to be in support of an 
</p>
<p>opposing faction are often unwilling to move due to fears of arrest, detention or summary 
</p>
<p>execution at checkpoints. Consequently, over the course of the conflict and outside of ISIS-
</p>
<p>controlled areas, the Syrian Arab Republic has seen a rise in female-headed households. 
</p>
<p>Despite confronting great difficulties, women are often the primary caregivers and 
</p>
<p>providers for their children.  
</p>
<p>66. Within the YPG, women make up an essential part of the Kurdish frontline fighting 
</p>
<p>forces. In other areas of the Syrian Arab Republic, women risk their lives to aid their 
</p>
<p>families and communities, for instance by smuggling food and medicine into areas besieged 
</p>
<p>by the various parties to the conflict.  
</p>
<p>67. Women have become powerful voices in advocating for the political resolution of 
</p>
<p>the conflict, though they remain absent from the conferences where high-level diplomatic 
</p>
<p>discussions have taken place. It is essential that women participate fully in current and 
</p>
<p>future political negotiations. The distinctly female experience of a war primarily waged by 
</p>
<p>men must form part of the discussion of how to achieve peace and justice in the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Children 
</b></p>
<p>68. Syrian children&#8217;s lives have been blighted by the war&#8217;s brutality. An untold number 
</p>
<p>have suffered the same violations as adults, without discrimination. Parties to the conflict 
</p>
<p>continue to recruit and use children in the conduct of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>69. ISIS has executed children in Hasakah, Raqqah and Dayr Az-Zawr. In May, ISIS 
</p>
<p>executed a family, including minors as young as 14, in a village in Dayr Az-Zawr. 
</p>
<p>Residents, including children, were made to watch. ISIS has also forced children into the 
</p>
<p>role of executioner. The terrorist group has released videos showing a firing squad of 
</p>
<p>children executing captured men in Palmyra, as well as of a 10-year-old cutting the throat 
</p>
<p>of a captured soldier in Homs. 
</p>
<p>70. Thousands of children have been killed and injured in the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate aerial bombardments on Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Idlib and Dayr 
</p>
<p>Az-Zawr. In May, a barrel bomb hit Al-Rajaa school in a residential neighbourhood of 
</p>
<p>Aleppo city. There were no military positions in the area. At least five children, and several 
</p>
<p>teachers, were killed. </p>


<p>71. Indiscriminate mortar and rocket fire by anti-Government armed groups has killed 
</p>
<p>and maimed children in Aleppo and Damascus cities, as well as in Latakia and Idlib 
</p>
<p>governorates. Some schools, such as Abdulrahman Al-Khazen school in Al-Fahamy 
</p>
<p>(Damascus), moved classes into basements after Jaish Al-Islam launched mortar shells on 
</p>
<p>the capital in February. 
</p>
<p>72. Boys considered to be of fighting age continue to be held at Government 
</p>
<p>checkpoints. Once held, children are imprisoned with adults and tortured in Government 
</p>
<p>detention centres. They suffer the same inhumane conditions of detention as described in 
</p>
<p>Section F. The presence of male and female detainees as young as 11 was recorded in 
</p>
<p>Security Branches 227, 235, 248 and 215 in Damascus. Children have been tortured and the 
</p>
<p>rape of minors was reported in Branches 235 and 215.  
</p>
<p>73. As detailed in Section H, ISIS has sexually enslaved thousands of female Yazidis, a 
</p>
<p>large proportion of whom are under the age of 18. Additionally, the group has forced Sunni 
</p>
<p>Arab girls into marriages with its fighters. 
</p>
<p>74. ISIS kidnapped children, along with their mothers, during attacks on multiple 
</p>
<p>Assyrian villages in February, and from Mabouja, in late March. Children and women were 
</p>
<p>taken hostage by Jabhat Al-Nusra following the attack on Ishtabraq in late April. Children 
</p>
<p>reportedly have been detained by Jabhat Al-Nusra and tortured in Harim prison (Idlib).  
</p>
<p>75. ISIS continues to recruit and train boys as young as six in the use of weapons. 
</p>
<p>Yazidi boys, abducted from Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014, were brought into the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic and separated from their mothers. They are trained alongside 
</p>
<p>underage Syrian boys. Reports of youth training camps known as &#8220;cub camps&#8221; continue to 
</p>
<p>emerge from Dayr Az-Zawr and Hasakah. 
</p>
<p>76. Jabhat Al-Nusra also reportedly engages children in military activities. In March and 
</p>
<p>April, minors were seen manning checkpoints and carrying weapons in Idlib.  
</p>
<p>77. Children are one of the groups most affected by sieges. Of those who have died of 
</p>
<p>malnutrition or dehydration, the majority are young children.  
</p>
<p>78. Lack of access to medical care, whether as a result of deliberate obstruction or the 
</p>
<p>vagaries of war, has profoundly affected children. There is little care available to more 
</p>
<p>vulnerable newborns and vaccination programmes continue to be affected negatively by the 
</p>
<p>conflict. Injured children, like adults, suffer due to a lack of medical supplies. One 
</p>
<p>interviewee witnessed a doctor operating on a 7-year-old child without anaesthesia in Jisr 
</p>
<p>Al-Shughour in April. He described the child as being in such pain that &#8220;he was beyond 
</p>
<p>crying&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>79. Children are being denied access to education. As bombardments of schools 
</p>
<p>increase, so too do reports of the use of schools as military facilities. The Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>placing of weaponry on schools in Jaramana is currently under investigation. In Fajroh 
</p>
<p>village (Hama), ISIS established its headquarters in a school. Additionally, schools in 
</p>
<p>Aleppo and Dara&#8217;a have ceased to function as they became shelters for IDPs. 
</p>
<p>80. As a result of repeated exposure to violence and insecurity, children throughout the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic are exhibiting symptoms of trauma, including psychological and 
</p>
<p>behavioural disorders, as well as post-traumatic stress. The protracted duration of the 
</p>
<p>conflict is weakening these children&#8217;s resilience. </p>


<p><b> E. The displaced 
</b></p>
<p>81. The brutality of the conflict continues to generate unprecedented levels of 
</p>
<p>displacement. With more than 4 million refugees and some 7.6 million IDPs, half of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s population has now been uprooted.  
</p>
<p>82. Many Syrians IDPs now live in official or makeshift camps that dot the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic&#8217;s borders. Others have taken up residence in towns and villages where they have 
</p>
<p>family ties, or where they have been able to find shelter in a place of relative safety. 
</p>
<p>83. The majority of the displaced are women and children. This is a consequence of 
</p>
<p>their being able to move more freely through checkpoints, save for those areas controlled 
</p>
<p>by ISIS. Many have been repeatedly displaced. Some have fled bombardments or ground 
</p>
<p>attacks. Others moved in search of family members and better living conditions, including 
</p>
<p>employment and more readily available &#8211; or affordable &#8211; food and fuel.  
</p>
<p>84. For those who have moved into towns and villages, many have been taken in by 
</p>
<p>residents. Fellow Syrians remain the primary providers of assistance to IDPs. However, in 
</p>
<p>some localities, such as Azaz (Aleppo), the sheer number of IDPs seeking safety has 
</p>
<p>increased tensions between them and residents as the growing demand for basic supplies 
</p>
<p>inflates local prices.  
</p>
<p>85. In makeshift camps, the internally displaced receive little or no support. Shelters are 
</p>
<p>haphazardly built and often fail to keep out the elements. Health services and education for 
</p>
<p>children are largely absent. In official camps, sudden influxes of IDPs fleeing violence may 
</p>
<p>overwhelm services, as reportedly occurred in camps in Idlib following clashes in April and 
</p>
<p>May between Government forces and anti-Government armed groups fighting alongside 
</p>
<p>Jabhat Al-Nusra.  
</p>
<p>86. Camps are often places of insecurity. Concern for the safety of female family 
</p>
<p>members, together with the cost of caring for large families, has led to an increase in early 
</p>
<p>marriages in the camps. This has follow-on consequences for the education, health and life 
</p>
<p>prospects of the Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s young women and girls. For children living as 
</p>
<p>IDPs, they &#8211; as with children living as refugees outside of the Syrian Arab Republic  &#8211; 
</p>
<p>demonstrate clear signs of trauma. Repeated exposure to violence, loss of family, multiple 
</p>
<p>displacements and instability have had a particular deleterious impact on the lives of Syrian 
</p>
<p>children.  
</p>
<p>87. Thousands of Syrians place their lives in the hands of smugglers and traffickers, 
</p>
<p>attempting perilous journeys in unseaworthy boats across the Mediterranean. More than 
</p>
<p>2,000 Syrian refugees have drowned in desperate efforts to reach safety in Europe since 
</p>
<p>2011.  
</p>
<p>88. The global failure to protect Syrian refugees is now translating into a crisis in 
</p>
<p>Southern Europe. The responsibility for the protection of the human rights of these refugees 
</p>
<p>is not being adequately shared or shouldered. Genuine international cooperation and 
</p>
<p>burden-sharing is imperative to address the humanitarian crisis.  
</p>
<p>89. It is essential that countries comply with the principle of non-refoulement and 
</p>
<p>respect their obligations under international customary and conventional law, particularly 
</p>
<p>the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and other 
</p>
<p>relevant regional human rights instruments. </p>


<p><b> F. Detainees  
</b></p>
<p>90. Men, women and children detained in the Syrian Arab Republic by various actors 
</p>
<p>have been subjected to unlawful killing, severe torture and other forms of ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>91. Nowhere are these violations more widespread and systematic than in detention 
</p>
<p>centres of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. Over 600 former detainees &#8211; held 
</p>
<p>in intelligence agencies and prisons &#8211; have been interviewed since August 2011. Almost all 
</p>
<p>have been victims and or witnesses of torture. Many have been present at the death of 
</p>
<p>cellmates.  
</p>
<p>92. An untold number of people, mainly adult men, have died while detained, as a result 
</p>
<p>of torture or poor living conditions inflicted upon the prison population. Authorities 
</p>
<p>consistently fail to order investigations into credible allegations of torture and custodial 
</p>
<p>deaths. Four years into the Syrian conflict, it is evident that the Government is responsible 
</p>
<p>for the deaths of detainees on a massive scale. 
</p>
<p>93. Systematic patterns of torture were documented in Military Security branches 215, 
</p>
<p>227 and 235, Air Force Intelligence in Mezzeh military airport, and other detention 
</p>
<p>facilities run by the Military Intelligence Directorate, the Air Force Intelligence Directorate, 
</p>
<p>the General Intelligence Directorate, the Political Security Directorate and the armed forces. 
</p>
<p>Detainees are held in overcrowded, dirty cells and are not given adequate food or medical 
</p>
<p>care, even for life-threatening conditions.  
</p>
<p>94. Many detainees reported being subjected to prolonged suspension from their arms, 
</p>
<p>resulting in paralysis of limbs. One prisoner witnessed detainees hung by their wrists from 
</p>
<p>trees in a detention facility controlled by the 4th Division in Damascus. Detainees were 
</p>
<p>frequently subjected to electrocution, including of genitals and other sensitive areas, and 
</p>
<p>prolonged and severe beating with objects. In February, a man held in a State-controlled 
</p>
<p>facility in Qamishli witnessed regular torture of emaciated fellow detainees.  
</p>
<p>95. Male detainees were frequently subjected to sexual violence, including rape. In 
</p>
<p>2014, a commander in General Intelligence Directorate&#8217;s Al-Khatib Branch subjected a 
</p>
<p>male detainee to repeated sexual abuse, including rape. Female detainees were also raped 
</p>
<p>and sexually assaulted while in Government detention. 
</p>
<p>96. Non-State armed groups established makeshift places of detention where captured 
</p>
<p>suspected collaborators with the Government or members of enemy factions were held, and 
</p>
<p>sometimes ill-treated and executed. Individuals taken hostage, usually for the purpose of 
</p>
<p>prisoner exchange or to extract ransom, have on occasion died or been murdered while in 
</p>
<p>the custody of armed groups.  
</p>
<p>97. Jabhat Al-Nusra subjected detainees to trials by Sharia courts that did not respect 
</p>
<p>due process, sometimes resulting in summary executions. Civilians abducted from 
</p>
<p>Ishtabraq in late April were detained in Harim prison, run by Jabhat Al-Nusra, in Idlib. 
</p>
<p>Male detainees were reportedly tortured, including being beaten with electric wires. 
</p>
<p>Detainees, including two pregnant women, were given inadequate food and received no 
</p>
<p>medical care. Investigations are continuing with regard to deaths in detention in this 
</p>
<p>facility. 
</p>
<p>98. ISIS continues to treat its detainees with brutality, subjecting some to torture and 
</p>
<p>other ill-treatment, as well as to summary executions after unfair trials. Captured fighters 
</p>
<p>from Government forces or adversary rebel factions were frequently tortured and executed. 
</p>
<p>Bodies of victims are routinely desecrated and put on public display. Prisoners reported 
</p>
<p>being subjected to lashing and other forms of torture.  </p>


<p><b> G. The besieged 
</b></p>
<p>99. Warring parties encircle densely populated areas, preventing civilians from leaving, 
</p>
<p>and blocking humanitarian access. The besieged communities &#8211; thousands of men, women 
</p>
<p>and children &#8211; are forced to live under shocking and inhuman conditions. 
</p>
<p>100. Siege warfare is conducted in a ruthlessly coordinated and planned manner, aimed at 
</p>
<p>forcing a population, collectively, to surrender or suffer starvation. Denial of food, water, 
</p>
<p>electricity and medicine has led to malnutrition and deaths amongst vulnerable groups, such 
</p>
<p>as elderly, infants, young children and persons suffering from chronic illnesses. Trapped 
</p>
<p>without basic necessities and under constant fear of deadly snipers or bombardment, severe 
</p>
<p>psychological trauma and desperation characterize the besieged communities. 
</p>
<p>101. Government forces continue to besiege rebel-controlled districts in eastern and 
</p>
<p>southern Damascus, for the third consecutive year. Civilian residents in these areas have 
</p>
<p>died from starvation, from injuries sustained in aerial bombardments and, as a consequence, 
</p>
<p>from a lack of medical care. A majority of pregnant women in the besieged areas suffer 
</p>
<p>from anaemia, and cases of miscarriage and birth defects have increased noticeably. 
</p>
<p>Sufferers of chronic illnesses, as well as the elderly, have also been particularly affected by 
</p>
<p>the adverse impact of sieges and bombardments on the provision of health care. 
</p>
<p>102. Interviewees from inside Yarmouk camp describe eating domestic animals and 
</p>
<p>leaves in an attempt to survive. In April, it was estimated that 40 per cent of the children 
</p>
<p>remaining in Yarmouk suffer from malnutrition. Those who were willing to risk passing 
</p>
<p>through Government checkpoints &#8211; mainly women and children &#8211; have now fled.  
</p>
<p>103. In places where local truces have been reached between Government and anti-
</p>
<p>Government armed groups, such as Babila and Moadamiyah (Rif Damascus), civilians 
</p>
<p>continue to suffer from shortages of food and medicine. Two infants died of treatable 
</p>
<p>conditions in Moadamiyah in April and May, after the siege of these areas had ended. 
</p>
<p>104. Anti-Government armed groups have imposed sieges around the towns of Nubul and 
</p>
<p>Zahra (Aleppo) and, more recently, around Foua&#8217;a and Kafria (Idlib). The situation in these 
</p>
<p>Idlib towns is reportedly dire &#8211; with shortages of food, water, medicine and electricity. Milk 
</p>
<p>for infants is desperately needed. 
</p>
<p>105. In January, ISIS besieged Al-Jabal, Al-Joura, Al-Ahrabish and Al-Qousour, all 
</p>
<p>densely populated districts of Dayr Az-Zawr city, which remains under Government 
</p>
<p>control. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have since lived with minimum access to food, 
</p>
<p>medicine, water, electricity and fuel. These besieged communities have survived on bread 
</p>
<p>and water. Access to clean water is limited, and cases of diarrhoea, dehydration and 
</p>
<p>gastrointestinal diseases are increasing.  
</p>
<p>106. Children, pregnant women and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Elderly 
</p>
<p>persons with diabetes, anaemia, asthma and other chronic diseases are put at great risk. 
</p>
<p>Their lives are directly endangered by the lack of medicine. In March, a father drowned 
</p>
<p>when attempting to swim across the Euphrates River from the besieged area to find food for 
</p>
<p>his children. Snipers have targeted and killed civilians seeking to escape, including 
</p>
<p>children. In April, a 13-year-old girl died of hunger in Al-Joura. Another teenage girl cried 
</p>
<p>out to her brother in a telephone call, &#8220;Our situation is very bad, just pray to God that he 
</p>
<p>will stop the siege or that he will let us die&#8230; because we cannot take this anymore.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>107. Government officials and soldiers, including their families, have been less affected, 
</p>
<p>receiving basic supplies via Dayr Az-Zayr&#8217;s military airport. 
</p>
<p>108. Wherever sieges are employed, a black market economy has been created for goods 
</p>
<p>that are smuggled in or are ushered through checkpoints following payment of bribes. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, sieges are also a business for those enforcing them and for the most well-</p>


<p>connected trapped inside. In most instances, armed actors remain able to function. It is the 
</p>
<p>civilian population who suffers. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Religious and ethnic communities 
</b></p>
<p>109. All of the Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s religious and ethnic communities are suffering as 
</p>
<p>a result of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>110. Some communities have been specifically targeted, with discriminatory intent, on 
</p>
<p>the grounds of their actual or perceived religious and/or ethnic background, by ISIS and 
</p>
<p>Jabhat Al-Nusra. In some attacks, anti-Government armed groups have acted in concert 
</p>
<p>with Jabhat Al-Nusra. 
</p>
<p>111. In other instances, the motivations for attacks are more complex, resulting from 
</p>
<p>perpetrators conflating a community&#8217;s ethnic and/or religious backgrounds and its 
</p>
<p>perceived political loyalties. Where ethnic or religious groups are believed to be supporters 
</p>
<p>of an opposing warring faction, the entire community has been the subject of discrimination 
</p>
<p>and, in some instances, violent attack. 
</p>
<p>112. The geographic spread of the war &#8211; where the war is being most intensely fought &#8211; 
</p>
<p>has, inevitably, impacted some communities more than others. 
</p>
<p>113. ISIS&#8217;s stated ideology, particularly its posturing as an expansionist caliphate 
</p>
<p>implementing its brand of radical Islam, has motivated its targeting of religious 
</p>
<p>communities it regards as infidels. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the crimes 
</p>
<p>ISIS perpetrated against thousands of Yazidi taken from Sinjar. 
</p>
<p>114. Hundreds of Yazidi women abducted during the ISIS August 2014 attack on the 
</p>
<p>Sinjar region of northern Iraq were forced over the border into the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>One of the earliest ISIS convoys of women and children crossed on 17 August 2014. The 
</p>
<p>majority were taken to Raqqah governorate, though some were moved into Dayr Az-Zawr 
</p>
<p>and Aleppo governorates. More convoys followed. 
</p>
<p>115. Yazidi women were specifically targeted because of their community&#8217;s religious 
</p>
<p>identity, which ISIS believes to be pagan. ISIS has subjected Yazidi women and children to 
</p>
<p>horrific abuse. Women and girls have been sold or gifted (and resold and regifted) to ISIS 
</p>
<p>fighters and tribal leaders in ISIS-controlled Syrian Arab Republic. Others are imprisoned 
</p>
<p>in houses in towns and villages across the Syrian Arab Republic, where they are held in 
</p>
<p>sexual slavery. One young woman described ISIS fighters arriving late at night and 
</p>
<p>surveying the girls as though they were &#8220;in a sheep market&#8221;. Without exception, all 
</p>
<p>interviewees described multiple rapes by several men, including incidents of gang rape.  
</p>
<p>116. Significant numbers of victims have been girls under 18. For example, the gifting 
</p>
<p>and subsequent rape of a 9-year-old Yazidi girl in Tabqa (Raqqah) was reported. Several 
</p>
<p>Yazidi women and girls have committed suicide during their captivity.  
</p>
<p>117. Yazidi women and girls have also suffered severe beatings by their ISIS captors. 
</p>
<p>Some were forced to convert to Sunni Islam, though it does not appear that conversion 
</p>
<p>prevented further sexual and physical abuse.  
</p>
<p>118. The violations committed against Yazidi and other boys in ISIS-controlled Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic, are detailed in Section D above. 
</p>
<p>119. In mid-February, ISIS fighters entered Assyrian Christian villages, including Tel 
</p>
<p>Hermes, along the Khabour River in Hasakah. They forced villagers to remove all Christian 
</p>
<p>imagery from their churches, homes and cemeteries. Fighters threatened to impose jiza &#8211; a 
</p>
<p>tax imposed on non-Muslims living in an Islamic caliphate &#8211; and to kill the local priest if 
</p>
<p>residents did not comply. </p>


<p>120. Following YPG&#8217;s advice that an attack by ISIS was imminent, most residents moved 
</p>
<p>to YPG-controlled territory in February. A small number of lightly armed Assyrian men 
</p>
<p>remained behind to protect their property. In February, ISIS began its attack on 
</p>
<p>approximately 20 Assyrian villages. While advancing, ISIS indiscriminately shelled the 
</p>
<p>villages and, on entering, shot and killed some members of local defence forces. Others 
</p>
<p>were injured while fleeing. 
</p>
<p>121. Approximately 12 men were abducted from Tel Hermes, while two men and an 
</p>
<p>elderly woman were taken from Qabr Shamie. ISIS currently holds more than 200 
</p>
<p>Assyrians hostage, and has requested ransoms, though some hostages were released without 
</p>
<p>payment. Once ISIS captured the villages, its fighters proceeded to destroy churches and to 
</p>
<p>burn and loot houses. The destruction of more than 10 churches has been documented thus 
</p>
<p>far. 
</p>
<p>122. While the ISIS attack on the Assyrian Christian villages formed part of the group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>broader attacks on the YPG throughout the reporting period, the group also targeted 
</p>
<p>villagers on the basis of their religion. This discriminatory intent was demonstrated by the 
</p>
<p>terrorist group&#8217;s specific attacks on Christian symbols and the destruction of churches once 
</p>
<p>ISIS was in control of the villages. While the YPG regained control of some villages, the 
</p>
<p>Assyrian population remains reticent to return. 
</p>
<p>123. ISIS has continued to attack Syrian Kurdish communities. The most lethal attack 
</p>
<p>took place between 25 and 27 June 2015 in Kobane. Fewer than 100 ISIS fighters entered 
</p>
<p>Kobane at around 4 a.m. on 25 June. All wore YPG or FSA uniforms, enabling them to 
</p>
<p>infiltrate the town easily and, initially, to move inconspicuously around. Disguised ISIS 
</p>
<p>fighters went house-to-house, summarily executing civilians. Their snipers deployed in 
</p>
<p>buildings, including the M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res hospital, shooting and killing civilians 
</p>
<p>who came into the streets. Approximately 250 civilians were killed and hundreds more 
</p>
<p>were wounded. Most died in their homes or in the immediate vicinity of their houses. 
</p>
<p>Scores of civilians &#8211; many of them women and children &#8211; were captured and held in 
</p>
<p>buildings containing ISIS&#8217;s sniper positions as human shields. Those taken as human 
</p>
<p>shields either escaped or were rescued by the YPG following clashes. 
</p>
<p>124. In mid-June, immediately prior to the attack on Kobane, ISIS forced remaining 
</p>
<p>Kurds to leave Raqqah and Tabqa cities (Raqqah), under threat of death. 
</p>
<p>125. In recent months, ISIS has conducted multiple car and suicide bombings in YPG-
</p>
<p>controlled areas of Hasakah. In March, during the festival of Nowruz, a car bomb exploded 
</p>
<p>in Hasakah city, killing approximately 50 people and wounding over 150. Other suicide car 
</p>
<p>bombings, in June and July in Hasakah and Qamishli cities, respectively, were directed at 
</p>
<p>military targets, namely YPG checkpoints. As the number of civilian casualties could not be 
</p>
<p>confirmed, it has not been possible to assess the proportionality of these attacks. 
</p>
<p>126. ISIS&#8217;s targeting of the Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s Kurds appears based on actual or 
</p>
<p>perceived Kurdish civilian support of the YPG, which has recently retaken substantial 
</p>
<p>amounts of ISIS-controlled territory in Al-Hasakah, Raqqah, and Aleppo governorates. 
</p>
<p>During their indoctrination of kidnapped Kurdish schoolboys, held between May and 
</p>
<p>September 2014, ISIS railed against the Kurdish lack of adherence to ISIS&#8217; extremist 
</p>
<p>ideology. Despite the YPG&#8217;s success in pushing them back from the city and region, the 
</p>
<p>recent attack by ISIS in Kobane seems intended to terrorize civilians and to prevent the 
</p>
<p>resumption of normal life in these areas. 
</p>
<p>127. In ISIS-controlled areas of Dayr Az-Zawr, the group has destroyed Shia Islamic 
</p>
<p>shrines and graves. While the Shia Muslim population fled long before ISIS took control, 
</p>
<p>ISIS has sought to destroy the history of this religious community in this governorate. </p>


<p>128. In March, ISIS attacked Mabouja. The attack was a part of a series of other attacks 
</p>
<p>by ISIS around Hama, aimed at taking control of the key road that connects Homs with 
</p>
<p>Aleppo. While the village has a majority Ismaili population, its residents also include Sunni 
</p>
<p>Muslims. Civilians living near the roads out of Mabouja were the primary victims of the 
</p>
<p>attack, many killed in their homes. Most victims were Ismaili. ISIS also abducted at least 
</p>
<p>10 people, all Ismailis. 
</p>
<p>129. In April, Jabhat Al-Nusra and anti-Government armed groups attacked Ishtabraq 
</p>
<p>village. Residents are predominantly Alawite but the village appears to have been targeted 
</p>
<p>because of the Alawite community&#8217;s perceived support of the Government. Civilians were 
</p>
<p>shot and killed while fleeing. Ansar Al-Din later published videos online showing the 
</p>
<p>detonation of two Alawite shrines in the village. 
</p>
<p>130. Jabhat Al-Nusra has forced Druze villages in the Syrian Arab Republic to convert to 
</p>
<p>Sunni Islam, on threat of death. In Qalb Lawza, the Druze residents were made to convert 
</p>
<p>once the area came under the control of the terrorist group in January.  
</p>
<p>131. During the attack on Busra Al-Sham in March by Jabhat Al-Nusra and various anti-
</p>
<p>Government armed groups, Shia civilians were killed. In the months prior to the attack, the 
</p>
<p>kidnapping and execution of Shia civilians were documented. Once the groups seized 
</p>
<p>control of Busra Al-Sham, mixed Sunni-Shia couples were threatened, with the Shia spouse 
</p>
<p>being told to leave or be killed. Shia women married to Sunni men were threatened with 
</p>
<p>sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>132. In April, unidentified armed groups detonated explosives inside the Armenian 40 
</p>
<p>Martyrs church in Aleppo. The explosion destroyed this 15th century church, which 
</p>
<p>contained relics and paintings dating back to the 18th century. The attack followed the 
</p>
<p>April shelling of Armenian neighbourhoods in Aleppo. 
</p>
<p>133. Following the YPG&#8217;s retaking of previously ISIS-controlled areas of Tal Abyad in 
</p>
<p>early July and villages in the Tel Tamer region of Al-Hasakah, YPG fighters reportedly 
</p>
<p>looted houses belonging to Arab villagers. Despite some reports alleging forced 
</p>
<p>displacement of Arab communities in these areas, most interviewees stated that they had 
</p>
<p>fled in advance of clashes between ISIS and the YPG, and in fear of coalition airstrikes.  
</p>
<p>134. In Government-held areas, Sunni men from restive areas are in the greatest danger 
</p>
<p>of being detained at checkpoints or during house searches, as they are perceived as likely 
</p>
<p>sympathizers with or supporters of anti-Government armed groups. This community is 
</p>
<p>particularly at risk of being subjected to enforced disappearance, torture and other 
</p>
<p>detention-related violations.  
</p>
<p>135. As communities and groups are, or feel, threatened, they have retreated into areas 
</p>
<p>where they believe themselves to be more protected. This has further strengthened the 
</p>
<p>dangerous perception of a link between some ethnicities and/or religions and political 
</p>
<p>allegiances. Consequently, indiscriminate attacks on areas held by an opposing warring 
</p>
<p>party are increasingly likely to affect specific religious or ethnic communities.  
</p>
<p>136. Government shelling and besieging of areas such as Yarmouk camp and eastern 
</p>
<p>Ghouta impact on the majority Sunni community residents there. As the Government is in 
</p>
<p>control of the skies, the most deadly and often indiscriminate bombardments are of cities, 
</p>
<p>towns and villages inhabited by majority Sunni populations. The presence of opposition 
</p>
<p>fighters among the civilian population in some of these areas does not justify indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>attacks against these locations, nor does it justify the treatment of the area as one target, 
</p>
<p>which often appears to be the case.  
</p>
<p>137. The shelling of the neighbourhood of Sayda Zeinab (Damascus city) by armed 
</p>
<p>groups in eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus) has resulted in casualties amongst the Shia 
</p>
<p>Muslim community, since the makeup of the neighbourhood has become increasingly Shia </p>


<p>Muslim as IDPs have fled there, seeking safety. Shelling by armed groups in Bani Zeid, in 
</p>
<p>the Al-Sulimaniyah neighbourhood of Aleppo city, has resulted in casualties among the 
</p>
<p>Christian residents of this neighbourhood. While Government checkpoints and artillery 
</p>
<p>stations exist in these neighbourhoods, there has been no evident attempt to direct attacks 
</p>
<p>towards military objectives on the part of the armed groups. 
</p>
<p>138. Anti-Government armed groups have besieged Nubul and Zahra (Aleppo) and 
</p>
<p>Foua&#8217;a and Kafria (Idlib) partly based on the perception that these predominantly Shia and 
</p>
<p>Alawite villages support the Government. However, the sieges are also a result of the fact 
</p>
<p>that Popular Committees in both areas are shelling nearby armed group-controlled villages.  
</p>
<p>139. Such situations underline the failure of all parties to take all feasible precautions to 
</p>
<p>protect civilians, and the lack of options available to civilians caught between warring 
</p>
<p>parties. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Medical personnel 
</b></p>
<p>140. Belligerents have subjected medical personnel to attacks, often as part of broader 
</p>
<p>attacks on health-care facilities and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>141. The Government&#8217;s continued use of indiscriminate aerial bombardment has 
</p>
<p>destroyed and damaged hospitals, field hospitals, clinics, medical equipment, drug 
</p>
<p>warehouses and generators, and caused the temporary or permanent closure of health-care 
</p>
<p>facilities. In March, Government helicopters targeted a field hospital in Hama governorate 
</p>
<p>with a barrel bomb, resulting in the killing of two paramedics.  
</p>
<p>142. Helicopters also targeted a field hospital in eastern parts of Aleppo city during 
</p>
<p>March and April. Essential medical equipment was destroyed in the attack and led to the 
</p>
<p>eventual closure of one hospital which provided medical services to hundreds of patients 
</p>
<p>monthly. A primary health clinic was damaged by a barrel bomb in March. Medical and 
</p>
<p>forensic personnel were wounded, and a clearly marked ambulance destroyed, in another 
</p>
<p>barrel bomb attack targeting the entrance of a morgue in May.  
</p>
<p>143. In May, an aerial bomb aimed at an emergency coordination centre in Aleppo 
</p>
<p>destroyed several ambulances. This attack on critical medical infrastructure prevented 
</p>
<p>medical staff from coordinating life-saving services and transporting wounded persons to 
</p>
<p>hospitals. 
</p>
<p>144. Hospitals and medical personnel in Government-controlled areas have been 
</p>
<p>subjected to targeted attacks by anti-Government armed groups and Jabhat Al-Nusra. In 
</p>
<p>January, a car bomb detonated near a field hospital in Dara&#8217;a city, destroying the drug 
</p>
<p>storehouse of the hospital. 
</p>
<p>145. A suicide bomber from Tajamu Nusrat Al-Mathloum, an armed group active in the 
</p>
<p>Latakia countryside, exploded himself in a public hospital in Latakia governorate in 
</p>
<p>February, killing a nurse and a member of the administrative staff. A private hospital in 
</p>
<p>Damascus city was subject to a mortar attack in February, launched by Jaysh Al-Islam from 
</p>
<p>eastern Damascus. 
</p>
<p>146. In June during the attack on Kobane, ISIS fighters held civilians inside a M&#233;decins 
</p>
<p>Sans Fronti&#232;res-supported field hospital, apparently using them as human shields to slow 
</p>
<p>the counter-attack of the YPG and allowing ISIS snipers to continue firing on nearby areas 
</p>
<p>from the roof of the building. The hospital was partly destroyed in subsequent clashes. 
</p>
<p>147. In regions under ISIS control, medical personnel work under regulations and 
</p>
<p>conditions that substantially obstruct their profession and service. Doctors have been 
</p>
<p>threatened and in some cases forced to stop working in public hospitals or private clinics.  </p>


<p><b> J. Human rights defenders and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>148. Human rights defenders and lawyers continue to be specifically targeted for arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention, abductions, enforced disappearances, torture and executions because 
</p>
<p>of their professional activities.  
</p>
<p>149. Government forces use the sweeping 2012 counter-terrorism legislation and its 
</p>
<p>special court to stifle dissent and silence the advocacy efforts of lawyers and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. Human rights and peace activists form the large majority of those detained under 
</p>
<p>article 8 of the anti-terrorism law, which prescribes imprisonment and forced labour for a 
</p>
<p>variety of vaguely defined terrorism-related offenses that include distributing written 
</p>
<p>materials or information.  
</p>
<p>150. In February 2012, Hussein Ghrer, Hani Al-Zaytani and Mazen Darwish were 
</p>
<p>arrested at their workplace, the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, by 
</p>
<p>Syrian Air Force personnel. In March 2014, they were charged with &#8220;publicizing terrorist 
</p>
<p>acts&#8221; and &#8220;promoting terrorist activities&#8221; under article 8 of the anti-terrorism law. Amidst 
</p>
<p>growing calls for their release, their trials had been repeatedly adjourned without 
</p>
<p>explanation. The Commission welcomes the release of Hussein Ghrer and Hani Al-Zaytani 
</p>
<p>in mid-July 2015 and of Mazen Darwish on 10 August 2015, but notes that the charges 
</p>
<p>against the three men remain, as does the spectre of further imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>151. Lawyers who represent clients appearing before the counter-terrorism court are 
</p>
<p>routinely harassed, and in some instances detained. Many have reported being subject to 
</p>
<p>retaliatory actions, including disbarment.  
</p>
<p>152. Anti-Government armed groups have directed attacks against human rights activists. 
</p>
<p>Among the many abducted, disappeared and killed are four human rights activists: Razan 
</p>
<p>Zeitouneh, Wael Hamada, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi, kidnapped from their office 
</p>
<p>in Douma (Rif Damascus) in December 2013. Their fate and whereabouts are unknown. 
</p>
<p>153. ISIS attacked activists trying to communicate the daily suffering of those living 
</p>
<p>under its control. The fate of peace activist Father Paolo Dall&#8217;Oglio, abducted in Raqqah 
</p>
<p>city in January 2014 by ISIS, is unknown. In July, ISIS published the video of the 
</p>
<p>execution of two Syrians accused of working with the activist Hammoud al-Mousa for the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently&#8221; campaign. 
</p>
<p>154. By silencing lawyers and human rights defenders for their roles in the dissemination 
</p>
<p>of human rights abuses, all parties to the conflict perpetuate the culture of impunity 
</p>
<p>prevailing in the Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p><b> K. Journalists 
</b></p>
<p>155. Syria has become the world&#8217;s most dangerous country for journalists, with at least 
</p>
<p>83 killed since late 2011. Violence against journalists continues unabated, forcing scores of 
</p>
<p>Syrian reporters into exile. Media activists still reporting inside the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>operate under constant threat and fear for their lives. 
</p>
<p>156. Journalists continue to be systematically targeted by Government forces for 
</p>
<p>documenting and disseminating information perceived to be supportive of the opposition or 
</p>
<p>disloyal to the Government. Large numbers of journalists are still detained in Government-
</p>
<p>controlled detention centres, where they are subjected to disappearance and torture. An 
</p>
<p>unknown number have died in detention.  
</p>
<p>157. In regions controlled by Jabhat Al-Nusra, offices of media activists perceived as 
</p>
<p>being critical of the group have been raided, and journalists routinely intimidated for </p>


<p>&#8220;writing against the religion&#8221;. Harassment of media workers generates a climate of fear 
</p>
<p>such that journalists have become self-censoring.  
</p>
<p>158. While global media attention focused on harrowing cases of abduction and 
</p>
<p>execution of international journalists by ISIS, Syrian media workers continue to suffer at 
</p>
<p>the hands of the terrorist group. Dozens, both foreign and Syrian, remain in captivity, 
</p>
<p>detained and ill-treated because of their professional activities.  
</p>
<p>159. A media activist from Palmyra (Homs) explained how he was harassed and 
</p>
<p>intimidated by members of ISIS only days following the capture of the city. Having refused 
</p>
<p>to join ISIS, he was arrested and detained for approximately 15 days. His equipment was 
</p>
<p>seized by the group. While in detention, he repeatedly assured his interrogators that he was 
</p>
<p>reporting only violations committed by Government forces. Upon his release, he decided to 
</p>
<p>leave Palmyra in fear of reprisals against him and his family.  
</p>
<p><b> L. Academics 
</b></p>
<p>160. Academics in the Syrian Arab Republic have been the subject of threats and 
</p>
<p>intimidation, leading many to flee the country. Respected in their communities as 
</p>
<p>intellectuals, they are targeted on the basis of their actual or perceived allegiance to one or 
</p>
<p>another of the warring parties. 
</p>
<p>161. In one instance, the 2011 detention of an academic critical of the Government was 
</p>
<p>reported. On release, he fled the country. Investigations continue as to threats by 
</p>
<p>unidentified armed groups to academics working in Government universities. Female 
</p>
<p>academics have faced harassment on the combined basis of their work and their gender. 
</p>
<p>162. With academics fleeing the country, and universities, particularly in Aleppo and 
</p>
<p>Damascus cities, being subjected to shelling and bombardments, the impact of the war on 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s higher education system, its scholars and its students will be felt 
</p>
<p>for decades. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Continuing investigations  
</b></p>
<p>163. Investigations continue into the impact of the conduct of the warring parties on other 
</p>
<p>groups and communities, including but not limited to the elderly, persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>those suffering from chronic illnesses, migrant workers and sexual minorities. 
</p>
<p>164. Sexual minorities have been targeted for execution by ISIS and Jabhat Al-Nusra. 
</p>
<p>The Commission continues to investigate reports of ISIS fighters throwing gay men off 
</p>
<p>high buildings, and their being beheaded by Jabhat Al-Nusra. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>165. <b>The plight of civilians cries out for immediate action to ensure their protection. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The livelihood of the Syrian population is subverted daily by the increasingly 
</b></p>
<p><b>internationalized nature of this non-international armed conflict, as well as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>ferocity of confrontations at the ground level, compounded by the spread of 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremism. 
</b></p>
<p>166. <b>Violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, identified in 
</b></p>
<p><b>this report through the pain and suffering of key groups, communities and </b></p>


<p><b>individuals, are living proof of the rampancy of war crimes and crimes against 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanity, demanding justice, accountability and peace. 
</b></p>
<p>167. <b>The violence is endemic, regrettably proliferating in its scope and extent. 
</b></p>
<p>168. <b>Government forces have directed attacks against the civilian population. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacks have included widespread shelling and bombardment of civilian-inhabited 
</b></p>
<p><b>localities and the targeting of civilians for arrest, detention and disappearance on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis of their association or perceived opposition to the Government. As part of this 
</b></p>
<p><b>widespread attack on the civilian population, in accordance with State policy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government forces have perpetrated crimes against humanity of murder, 
</b></p>
<p><b>extermination, torture, rape, enforced disappearance and other inhumane acts.  
</b></p>
<p>169. <b>Government forces have committed gross violations of human rights and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>war crimes of murder, torture, rape, sexual violence and targeting civilians. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government forces disregarded the special protection accorded to hospitals and 
</b></p>
<p><b>medical personnel. Indiscriminate and disproportionate aerial bombardment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>shelling by Government forces led to mass civilian casualties and spread terror. 
</b></p>
<p>170. <b>Anti-Government armed groups have committed the war crimes of murder, 
</b></p>
<p><b>execution without due process, torture, hostage-taking and attacking protected 
</b></p>
<p><b>objects. 
</b></p>
<p>171. <b>In addition to these war crimes, Jabhat Al-Nusra has recruited and used 
</b></p>
<p><b>children in hostilities. 
</b></p>
<p>172. <b>ISIS has directed acts of violence and terror against the civilian population 
</b></p>
<p><b>under its control in Raqqah, Dayr Az-Zawr, Hasakah, Aleppo, Hama and Homs 
</b></p>
<p><b>governorates. ISIS, a structured group, directs and organizes these acts of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against civilians, evincing an organizational policy. ISIS has committed murder, 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture, rape, sexual slavery, sexual violence, forcible displacement and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>inhumane acts as part of a widespread attack on the civilian population, amounting to 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes against humanity.  
</b></p>
<p>173. <b>ISIS has committed war crimes, including murder, execution without due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process, torture, hostage-taking, rape and sexual violence, recruiting and using 
</b></p>
<p><b>children in hostilities and attacking protected objects, as well as other serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>174. <b>The litany of abuses listed here captures only part of the trauma experienced 
</b></p>
<p><b>by Syrian civilians, as the world stands witness.  
</b></p>
<p>175. <b>It is thus unconscionable that the global community, as well as regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>local actors, are prevaricating in their response to a conflagration which has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>escalating since 2011. This living tragedy demands an expeditious end to the political 
</b></p>
<p><b>procrastination and military escalation. 
</b></p>
<p>176. <b>There can be no substitute for an all-inclusive peace process which has been too 
</b></p>
<p><b>long in coming. Respect for the choice of the Syrian population is paramount. 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Allow the Commission access to the country.

<p>180. <b>The Commission recommends that anti-Government armed groups repudiate

</b></p>
<p>181. <b>The Commission recommends that countries with influence over the warring 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties, in particular the permanent members of the Security Council, work in concert

<p>(e)<b> Create more legal avenues to safety for persons needing protection.

<p><b>These include expanded resettlement, humanitarian admission, flexible visa policies,

<p>183. <b>The Commission recommends that the Human Rights Council support the
