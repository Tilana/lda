<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In all regions, people experience violence and discrimination because of their sexual 
orientation or gender identity. In many cases, even the perception of homosexuality or 
transgender identity puts people at risk. Violations include &#8211; but are not limited to &#8211; 
killings, rape and physical attacks, torture, arbitrary detention, the denial of rights to 
assembly, expression and information, and discrimination in employment, health and 
education. United Nations mechanisms, including human rights treaty bodies and the 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council, have documented such violations for 
close to two decades. 
</p>
<p>2. The Secretary-General expressed his concern in a speech on Human Rights Day 
2010, when he stated:  
</p>
<p>As men and women of conscience, we reject discrimination in general, and in 
particular discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity &#8230; Where 
there is a tension between cultural attitudes and universal human rights, rights must 
carry the day. Together, we seek the repeal of laws that criminalize homosexuality, 
that permit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, that 
encourage violence. 
</p>
<p>3. United Nations entities1 have integrated issues of sexual orientation and gender 
identity into their work, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the 
United Nations Children&#8223;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). 
</p>
<p>4. While not addressing all violations perpetrated in relation to sexual orientation or 
gender identity, the present report highlights critical human rights concerns that States have 
an obligation to address, and highlights emerging responses. It draws on United Nations 
sources, and includes data and findings from regional organizations, some national 
authorities and non-governmental organizations.

<p><b> II. Applicable international standards and obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Universality, equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>5. The application of international human rights law is guided by the principles of 
universality and non-discrimination enshrined in article 1 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, which states that &#8220;all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights&#8221;. All people, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)2 persons, are 
entitled to enjoy the protections provided for by international human rights law, including 
in respect of rights to life, security of person and privacy, the right to be free from torture, 
arbitrary arrest and detention, the right to be free from discrimination and the right to 
freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. The Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action confirms that, &#8220;while the significance of national and regional 
particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in 
mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8221;3 
</p>
<p>6. Non-discrimination is a core human rights principle embodied in the Charter of the 
United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and core human rights treaties. 
Non-discrimination clauses in international instruments typically require that the rights set 
forth be made available to everyone without discrimination, and States ensure that their 
laws, policies and programmes are not discriminatory in impact. For example, under article 
2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, each State party to the 
Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and 
subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the Covenant, without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status. 
</p>
<p>7. The specific grounds of discrimination referred to in the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and other human rights treaties are not exhaustive. The drafters 
intentionally left the grounds of discrimination open by using the phrase &#8220;other status&#8221;. 
Sexual orientation and gender identity, like disability, age and health status, are not 
explicitly mentioned among the grounds listed in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights or the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In 
1994, in the case of <i>Toonen v. Australia</i>, the Human Rights Committee held that States are 
obligated to protect individuals from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation.4 
This position is reflected in later decisions of the Committee,5 and in general comments of 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women.6 In its general comment no. 20, for example, the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 The terms lesbian, gay and bisexual and transgender are used throughout the report, but often 
</p>
<p>abbreviated to LGBT. These terms are used to refer to same-sex behaviour, identities or relationships 
and non-binary gender identities. In several places in the text, discrimination against intersex persons 
is also addressed. 
</p>
<p> 3 A/CONF.157/23, para. 5. 
 4 <i>Toonen v. Australia</i>, communication No. 488/1992 (CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992). 
 5 See, for example, <i>Young v. Australia</i>, communication No. 941/2000 (CCPR/C/78/D/941/2000), 
</p>
<p>para. 10.4; <i>X v. Colombia</i>, communication no. 1361/2005 (CCPR/C/89/D/1361/2005), para. 9; and 
concluding observations on Mexico (CCPR/C/MEX/CO/5), para. 21, and Uzbekistan 
(CCPR/C/UZB/CO/3), para. 22. 
</p>
<p> 6 See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 20 (E/C.12/GC/20), 
para. 32; Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 13 (CRC/C/GC/13), paras. 60 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights observed that &#8220;other status&#8221; included 
sexual orientation. &#8220;States parties should ensure that a person&#8223;s sexual orientation is not a 
barrier to realizing Covenant rights, for example, in accessing survivor&#8223;s pension rights. In 
</p>
<p>addition, gender identity is recognized as among the prohibited grounds of discrimination&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p><b> B. State obligations under international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>8. The obligations of States to prevent violence and discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity are derived from various international human rights 
instruments. These obligations include the ones listed below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. To protect the right to life, liberty and security of persons irrespective of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity  
</b></p>
<p>9. Under article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, &#8220;everyone has the 
right to life, liberty and the security of person&#8221;. Article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights affirms that &#8220;every human being has the inherent right to life. 
This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.&#8221;8 The 
State has an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish and redress deprivations 
of life,9 and to investigate and prosecute all acts of targeted violence. 
</p>
<p>10. Article 33 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees provides that States 
parties have an obligation not to expel or return a refugee to a place where their life or 
freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a 
particular social group or political opinion. In the view of UNHCR, individuals who fear 
persecution on account of their sexual orientation or gender identity may be considered 
members of a &#8220;particular social group&#8221;. State parties to the Convention should ensure that 
such individuals are not returned to a State where their lives or freedom would be at risk 
and, provided the individuals concerned meet the criteria for refugee status, recognize them 
as refugees to be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.10

and 72(g); Committee against Torture, general comment no. 2 (CAT/C/GC/2), para. 21; and 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, general recommendation No. 28 
(CEDAW/C/GC/28), para. 18.  
</p>
<p> 7 E/C.12/GC/20, para. 32. In the same general comment, the Committee refers to the Yogyakarta 
Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation 
and Gender Identity as a source of guidance on definitions of &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; and &#8220;gender 
</p>
<p>identity&#8221; (footnote 25, para. 32). The Principles, which are non-binding, were developed by human 
rights experts. Several United Nations entities have used these definitions to describe sexual 
orientation and gender identity; see for example UNHCR, Guidance Note on Refugee Claims (see 
footnote 1), Handbook on prisoners with special needs; and UNAIDS, &#8220;Review of Legal Frameworks 
and the Situation of Human Rights related to Sexual Diversity in Low and Middle Income Countries&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 8 In its resolution 65/208, the General Assembly urged all States to, inter alia, ensure the effective 
protection of the right to life of all persons under their jurisdiction and to investigate promptly and 
thoroughly all killings, including those targeted at specific groups of persons, such as killings of 
persons because of their sexual orientation.

<p><b> 2. To prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment on grounds of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual orientation or gender identity </b></p>
<p>11. The right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is 
absolute. Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide that &#8220;no one shall be subjected 
to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>12. According to the Committee against Torture, States are obligated to protect from 
torture and ill-treatment all persons, regardless of sexual orientation or transgender 
identity,12 and to prohibit, prevent and provide redress for torture and ill-treatment in all 
contexts of State custody or control.13 The Committee has repeatedly expressed concern 
regarding allegations of such abuses in concluding observations on States parties&#8223; reports.14 
</p>
<p><b> 3. To protect the right to privacy and against arbitrary detention on the basis of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity  
</b></p>
<p>13. The right to privacy is enshrined in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
state that no one should be subjected to &#8220;arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, 
</p>
<p>family, home or correspondence&#8221; Articles 9 of the Universal Declaration and the Covenant 
further protect individuals from &#8220;arbitrary arrest and detention&#8221;. In its general comment no. 
</p>
<p>16, the Human Rights Committee confirmed that any interference with privacy, even if 
provided for by law, &#8220;should be in accordance with the provisions, aims and objectives of 
the Covenant and should be, in any event, reasonable in the particular circumstances&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>14. Since <i>Toonen </i>in 1994, the Human Rights Committee has held that laws used to 
criminalize private, adult, consensual same-sex sexual relations violate rights to privacy and 
to non-discrimination. The Committee has rejected the argument that criminalization may 
be justified as &#8220;reasonable&#8221; on grounds of protection of public health or morals, noting that 
</p>
<p>the use of criminal law in such circumstances is neither necessary nor proportionate.15 In 
their concluding observations, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child have urged States to reform such 
laws and, where relevant, have welcomed their repeal.16 The Working Group on Arbitrary 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Article 2 (1) of the Convention against Torture stipulates that &#8220;each State party shall take effective 
</p>
<p>legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under 
its jurisdiction&#8221;, while article 2 (2) states that &#8220;no exceptional circumstances whatsoever &#8230; may be 
</p>
<p>invoked as a justification of torture&#8221;.

 14 See concluding observations of the Committee against Torture on the United States of America 
</p>
<p>(CAT/C/USA/CO/2), paras. 32 and 37; Ecuador (CAT/C/ECU/CO/3), para. 17; and Argentina 
(CAT/C/CR/33/1), para. 6(g). See also general comment no. 2 (CAT/C/GC/2), para. 22. The 
Committee recommended that States parties should take all necessary measures to prevent such acts, 
including through the review of rules for detention and custody, investigation of all allegations of acts 
of torture or ill-treatment, prosecution and conviction of perpetrators, compensation to victims and 
training of personnel involved in detention and custody. See for example the Committee&#8223;s concluding 
observations on Mongolia (CAT/C/MNG/CO/1), para. 25; Kuwait (CAT/C/KWT/CO/2), para. 25; 
and Colombia (CAT/C/COL/CO/4), para. 11.

<p>Detention has held that detaining someone on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes 
arbitrary detention in breach of article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.17 
</p>
<p><b> 4. To protect individuals from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>15. The right to be free from discrimination is included in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (art. 2) and core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2) and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 2). Article 26 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights guarantees equality before the law, requiring States to prohibit 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>16. In their general comments, concluding observations and views on communications, 
human rights treaty bodies have confirmed that States have an obligation to protect 
everyone from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. The fact 
that someone is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender does not limit their entitlement to 
enjoy the full range of human rights.  
</p>
<p>17. The Human Rights Committee has urged State parties to &#8220;guarantee equal rights to 
all individuals, as established in the Covenant, regardless of their sexual orientation&#8221;,18 and 
welcomed legislation that includes sexual orientation among prohibited grounds of 
discrimination.19 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has affirmed the 
principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in general comments on 
the rights to work, water, social security and the highest attainable standard of health.20 In 
addition, in its general comment on discrimination, the Committee included both sexual 
orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination under the 
Covenant.21 In their general comments and concluding observations, the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women have included recommendations on countering 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.22

</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b> 5. To protect the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly in a non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory manner 
</b></p>
<p>18. Freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly are enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (arts. 19-20) and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (arts. 19, 21-22). Under article 19 of the Universal Declaration, 
&#8220;everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression; this right includes freedom 
to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and 
ideas&#8221;. Under article 20 (1), &#8220;everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
association.&#8221;23  
</p>
<p>19. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits restriction of these 
rights, but only when provided by law and necessary to protect the rights (or, in the case of 
expression, reputation) of others or national security, public safety, public order or public 
health or morals. The Human Rights Committee has confirmed that any such restrictions 
must be compatible with the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant and &#8220;must not 
violate the non-discrimination provisions of the Covenant&#8221;, including, in accordance with 
the Committee&#8223;s jurisprudence, on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.24  
</p>
<p><b> III. Violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Killings, rape and other acts of discriminatory violence 
</b></p>
<p>20. Homophobic and transphobic violence has been recorded in all regions. Such 
violence may be physical (including murder, beatings, kidnappings, rape and sexual 
assault) or psychological (including threats, coercion and arbitrary deprivations of 
liberty).25 These attacks constitute a form of gender-based violence, driven by a desire to 
punish those seen as defying gender norms. 
</p>
<p>21. In addition to &#8220;street&#8221; violence and other spontaneous attacks in public settings, 
those perceived as LGBT may be targets of more organized abuse, including by religious 
extremists, paramilitary groups, neo-Nazis and extreme nationalists. Young LGBT people 
and those of all ages who are seen to be transgressing social norms are at risk of family and 
community violence. Lesbians and transgender women are at particular risk because of 
gender inequality and power relations within families and wider society. 
</p>
<p>22. Violence against LGBT persons tends to be especially vicious compared to other 
bias-motivated crimes. According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
</p>
<p>

adopted by consensus by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/144. Article 7 of the Declaration

 25 Article 2 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women notes that violence 
</p>
<p>against women encompasses violence within the family, within the community, and physical, sexual 
or psychological violence perpetrated and condoned, by the State, wherever it occurs. </p>


<p>Europe (OSCE), homophobic hate crimes and incidents often show a high degree of cruelty 
and brutality and include beatings, torture, mutilation, castration and sexual assault.26 
</p>
<p>23. Quantifying homophobic and transphobic violence is complicated by the fact that 
few States have systems in place for monitoring, recording and reporting these incidents. 
Even where systems exist, incidents may go unreported or are misreported because victims 
distrust the police, are afraid of reprisals or threats to privacy, are reluctant to identify 
themselves as LGBT or because those responsible for registering the incidents fail to 
recognize motives of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Killings 
</b></p>
<p>24. Since 1999, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions has regularly referred to persons being subjected to death threats or killed 
because of sexual orientation and gender identity.27 The current mandate holder recently 
highlighted the murders of at least 31 LGBT persons in Honduras during an 18-month 
period, including a transgender person found dead in a ditch, her body beaten and burned, 
showing evidence of rape and blows to her face from stoning so severe as to render the 
remains virtually unrecognizable.28 In Jamaica, a man was allegedly stabbed and stoned to 
death after police, who reportedly participated in the attack, urged others to beat him 
because he was homosexual.29 The Special Rapporteur on violence against women has 
highlighted the targeted murder of lesbians in South Africa, including a case in which two 
lesbians were beaten, stoned and one stabbed to death.30 
</p>
<p>25. LGBT persons are also among the victims of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; killings, carried out 
against those seen by family or community members to have brought shame or dishonour 
on a family, often for transgressing gender norms or for sexual behaviour, including actual 
or assumed same-sex sexual activity.31 While women are generally the targets of this sort of 
punishment, these attacks can be directed at individuals of any sex. 
</p>
<p>26. Reports from regional and non-governmental organizations point to a pattern of 
targeted violence. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights noted &#8220;an 
upsurge of intolerance against sexual minorities&#8221; in Cameroon, and the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly addressed related concerns in Latin America 
and the Caribbean.32 OSCE reported 44 bias-motivated murders of LGBT persons in 2009

<p>on the basis of partial data from 22 of its Member States.33 The European Parliament and 
the Council of Europe have also regularly expressed concern at incidents in which LGBT 
persons have been targeted and killed, including murders of gay men in the Netherlands and 
Sweden, and the killing of a homeless transgender woman in Portugal.34 
</p>
<p>27. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs in the United States of America 
reported 27 bias-motivated murders of LGBT persons in 2010, up from 22 in 2009.35 The 
Trans Murder Monitoring project, which collects reports of murders of transgender persons 
in all regions, lists 680 murders in 50 countries during the period from 2008 to 2011.36  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other violence, including rape 
</b></p>
<p>28. Non-lethal violence directed at individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation or 
gender identity is less consistently documented by special procedures, largely because of 
underreporting and a protection gap in terms of existing mandates. Nevertheless, several 
mandate holders have highlighted individual cases and voiced concern at the prevalence of 
such violence. In her 2010 report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on 
human rights defenders noted that she had sent 47 communications regarding defenders 
working on LGBT issues during the previous year; killings of LGBT human rights 
defenders were alleged in five communications, with rape and sexual violence, including 
against males, being reported in a further six.37 
</p>
<p>29. Allegations of lesbians being attacked, raped, forcibly impregnated and otherwise 
punished because of sexual orientation come from many regions.38 The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed grave concern about reported 
sexual offences committed against women on account of their sexual orientation.39 The 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women recently reported alleged incidents of gang 
rapes, family violence and murder experienced by lesbian, bisexual and transgender women 
in El Salvador, Kyrgyzstan and South Africa,40 where the Rapporteur noted that &#8220;lesbian 
women face an increased risk of becoming victims of violence, especially rape, because of 
widely held prejudices and myths&#8221;, including &#8220;for instance, that lesbian women would 
change their sexual orientation if they are raped by a man&#8221;.41

</p>
<p>against Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
have addressed so-called &#8220;curative&#8221; or &#8220;corrective&#8221; rape, perpetrated by men who claim their intent is 
to &#8220;cure&#8221; women of their lesbianism. See, for example, the concluding observations of the Committee 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>30. The Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders has expressed deep concern 
regarding &#8220;denigration campaigns and violent threats against defenders of lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual and transgender rights.&#8221;42 The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights defenders noted in 2007 that those defending the rights of LGBT and intersex 
persons had had their houses and offices raided, and been attacked, tortured, sexually 
abused, threatened and killed, adding that &#8220;a major concern in this regard is an almost 
</p>
<p>complete lack of seriousness with which such cases are treated by concerned authorities&#8221;.43  
</p>
<p>31. Where available, national crime figures indicate high levels of violence targeted at 
individuals on the basis of their actual or presumed sexual orientation or gender identity. In 
the United States, for example, Government figures show numbers of bias-motivated 
incidents against gay, lesbian and bisexual people rank second only to racist incidents and 
on par with incidents against members of religious minorities.44 In the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the only European Union state to publish official data 
on prosecutions for LGBT-related hate crimes, 988 criminal cases were initiated in 2007, of 
which 759 resulted in convictions.45  
</p>
<p>32. A recent Council of Europe report found &#8220;Hate-motivated violence and hate crimes 
against LGBT persons take place in all Council of Europe member states.&#8221;46 A survey 
conducted in 2008 in the United Kingdom by the non-governmental organization 
Stonewall, with Government support, found that a third of lesbians and a quarter of gay 
men experienced a hate crime or incident (including verbal aggression) in the preceding 
three years.47 In a Slovenian study, 53 per cent of lesbian and gay respondents reported 
experiencing violence in the past because of their sexual orientation.48 A 2011 report of the 
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found that lesbian and bisexual women 
are more likely to experience sexual and other assaults in private settings than gay or 
bisexual men, who are more likely to be attacked by unknown perpetrators. The 
perpetrators are usually young men in groups.49 
</p>
<p>33. Treaty bodies have expressed concern about rhetoric used to incite hatred and 
related violence.50 Such language can be used by political and community leaders to stir up

<p>homophobic sentiment or harass individuals.51 In each case, LGBT people and those 
advocating related rights are at risk of violence and discrimination as a result. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur on torture has noted that &#8220;members of sexual minorities are 
disproportionately subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment because they fail to 
conform to socially constructed gender expectations. Indeed, discrimination on grounds of 
sexual orientation or gender identity may often contribute to the process of the 
dehumanization of the victim, which is often a necessary condition for torture and ill-
treatment to take place.&#8221;52 In 2010, the Special Rapporteur noted that, in detention facilities, 
there was usually a strict hierarchy, and that those at the bottom of the hierarchy, such as 
gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender persons, suffered double or triple discrimination.53 
The Special Rapporteur has highlighted the susceptibility of male-to-female transgender 
prisoners to physical and sexual abuse if placed within the general prison population.54   
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has also reported incidents in which individuals were 
subjected to victimization by police and prison guards and authorities failed to take 
reasonable measures to prevent violence against detainees perceived as LGBT.55 For 
example, in a police station in Indonesia, a man and his male partner were allegedly 
severely beaten and sexually abused by police officers a day after reportedly having been 
assaulted by 16 civilians.56 In Uzbekistan, a male human rights defender charged with 
homosexuality was reportedly beaten by police and threatened with rape with a bottle.57 A 
lesbian couple in Brazil was allegedly beaten at a police station and forced to perform oral 
sex.58 In Greece, detainees in a lesbian, gay and transgender section of a prison were 
reportedly denied access to an outside yard for two years, confined to their cells and a 
corridor at all times.59 The Special Rapporteur has also reported transsexual women being 
intentionally beaten on their breasts and cheekbones to burst implants and release toxins.60   
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women has highlighted similar cases. In 
2006, she detailed allegations of <i>metis</i> in Nepal being beaten by police, who demanded 
money and sex.61 In 2011, she described a case in El Salvador in which a transgender 
woman was placed in a male-only prison and detained in a cell with gang members, where 
she was raped more than 100 times, sometimes with the complicity of prison officials.62

gender identity/gender expression. 
</p>
<p> 62 A/HRC/17/26/Add.2, paras. 28-29. </p>


<p>Other cases have been documented by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on human rights defenders.63  
</p>
<p>37. One issue highlighted by United Nations experts is the &#8220;medically worthless&#8221; 
practice of subjecting men suspected of homosexual conduct to non-consensual anal 
examinations to &#8220;prove&#8221; their homosexuality.64 Such examinations have been condemned 
by the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, which has held that the practice contravenes the prohibition 
of torture and ill-treatment.65  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right of asylum for those persecuted because of sexual orientation or 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>38. UNHCR estimates that at least 42 States have granted asylum to individuals with a 
well-founded fear of persecution owing to sexual orientation or gender identity, although 
the precise figure is unclear. Some States grant asylum even without a clear policy in this 
regard, while others do not track reasons for granting refugee status or asylum. 
</p>
<p>39. Even in countries that recognize these grounds for asylum, practices and procedures 
often fall short of international standards. Review of applications is sometimes arbitrary and 
inconsistent. Officials may have little knowledge about or sensitivity towards conditions 
facing LGBT people.66 Refugees are sometimes subjected to violence and discrimination 
while in detention facilities and, when resettled, may be housed within communities where 
they experience additional sexuality and gender-related risks. Refoulement of asylum-
seekers fleeing such persecution places them at risk of violence, discrimination and 
criminalization. In some cases, they are returned with instructions to &#8220;be discreet&#8221;, an 
approach criticized by UNHCR.67  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discriminatory laws  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Laws criminalizing same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other laws used to penalize individuals because of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>40. Seventy-six countries retain laws that are used to criminalize people on the basis of 
sexual orientation or gender identity.68 Such laws, including so-called &#8220;sodomy laws&#8221;, are 
often relics of colonial-era legislation. They typically prohibit either certain types of sexual 
activity or any intimacy or sexual activity between persons of the same sex. In some cases,

<p>(ILGA), Brussels, May 2011, p. 9. </p>


<p>the wording used refers to vague and undefined concepts, such as &#8220;crimes against the order 
of nature&#8221; or &#8220;morality&#8221;, or &#8220;debauchery&#8221;.69 What these laws have in common is their use 
to harass and prosecute individuals because of their actual or perceived sexuality or gender 
identity.70 Penalties range from short-term to life imprisonment, and even the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>41. The criminalization of private consensual homosexual acts violates an individual&#8223;s 
rights to privacy and to non-discrimination and constitutes a breach of international human 
rights law. In <i>Toonen v. Australia,</i> the Human Rights Committee found that &#8220;adult 
consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of &#8222;privacy&#8223;&#8221; under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to the Committee, it is 
irrelevant whether laws criminalizing such conduct are enforced or not; their mere 
existence continuously and directly interferes with an individual&#8223;s privacy.71 Since <i>Toonen</i>, 
the Committee, other treaty bodies and special procedures have repeatedly urged States to 
reform laws criminalizing homosexuality or sexual conduct between consenting adults of 
the same sex,72 and have welcomed their repeal.73 
</p>
<p>42. Special procedures mandate holders have emphasized the link between 
criminalization and homophobic hate crimes, police abuse, torture, and family and 
community violence, as well as constraints that criminalization places on work of human 
rights defenders working to protect the rights of LGBT persons. The Special Rapporteur on 
health noted that &#8220;sanctioned punishment by States reinforces existing prejudices, and 
legitimizes community violence and police brutality directed at affected individuals.&#8221;74 The 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions noted that criminalization increases social 
stigmatization and made people &#8220;more vulnerable to violence and human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p>including death threats and violations of the right to life, which are often committed in a 
climate of impunity.&#8221;75  
</p>
<p>43. Since 2000, laws criminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults have 
been repealed in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cape Verde, Georgia, Fiji, 
India, the Marshall Islands, Nepal, Nicaragua, Panama and the United States, together with 
dependent territories of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In some cases, the courts 
have overturned these laws; in others, repeal has resulted from a legislative process. In the 
context of the universal periodic review, several States &#8211; including Mauritius, Nauru, Palau, 
Sao Tome and Principe, and Seychelles &#8211; have accepted recommendations to decriminalize 
homosexuality. 
</p>
<p>  
 69 See A/HRC/10/21/Add.3, paras. 56-58. 
 70 These laws may also be used in &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; efforts. See, for example, E/CN.4/1995/111, para.

heterosexual relationships, which treaty bodies have held to be discriminatory.76 
</p>
<p><b> B. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>45. In at least five countries the death penalty may be applied to those found guilty of 
offences relating to consensual, adult homosexual conduct. In addition to violating rights to 
life, privacy and non-discrimination, application of the death penalty in these circumstances 
violates article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
provides that, in countries that have not abolished the death penalty, a &#8220;sentence of death 
may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;.77 The Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Committee have confirmed that use of the death penalty for non-
violent acts, including sexual relations between consenting adults, constitutes a violation of 
international human rights law.78 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions has noted that &#8220;death sentences 
may only be imposed for the most serious crimes, a stipulation which clearly excludes 
matters of sexual orientation.&#8221;79 Commenting on the situation in parts of Nigeria, the 
Special Rapporteur stated that, &#8220;in relation to sodomy, the imposition of the death sentence 
for a private sexual practice is clearly incompatible with Nigeria&#8223;s international 
obligations.&#8221;80 Addressing the response that there was a de facto moratorium on executions, 
the Special Rapporteur stated, &#8220;the &#8222;mere possibility&#8223; that it can be applied threatens the 
</p>
<p>accused for years, and is a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
Its status as a law justifies persecution by vigilante groups, and invites abuse.&#8221;81 
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest and detention  
</b></p>
<p>47. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has stated that detaining someone for 
offences relating to sexual orientation or gender identity, including offences not directly 
related to sexual conduct, such as those pertaining to physical appearance or so-called 
&#8220;public scandal&#8221;, breaches international law. In 2002, the Working Group considered a case 
involving 55 men arrested at a discotheque and charged with &#8220;debauchery&#8221; and &#8220;social 
dissension&#8221;. It concluded that the arrests were discriminatory, in violation of articles 2 and 
26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that the detention was 
arbitrary.82 The Working Group has since reaffirmed its position on several occasions.83

<p><b> VI. Discriminatory practices 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Human Rights Committee has urged State parties to &#8220;guarantee equal rights to 
all individuals, as established in the Covenant, regardless of their sexual orientation.&#8221;84 
States have a &#8220;legal obligation &#8230; to ensure to everyone the rights recognized by the 
</p>
<p>Covenant &#8230; without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.&#8221;85 Both the Human 
Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have called 
regularly on States to enact laws prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sexual 
orientation and have welcomed legislation that includes sexual orientation among the 
prohibited grounds of discrimination.86  
</p>
<p>49. Explicit constitutional guarantees of protection from discrimination on grounds of 
sexual orientation apply in six countries,87 while in several others such guarantees are 
incorporated into regional or provincial-level constitutions.88 In other countries (including 
Canada, Colombia, Hong Kong (China), India and Nepal), general language on non-
discrimination has been interpreted by courts as providing equivalent protection. 
</p>
<p>50. Discriminatory practices persist in all regions. Sometimes, Government policies 
have a direct discriminatory impact; in other cases, the absence of applicable national laws 
facilitates discrimination by private actors. The section below examines several areas where 
individuals are particularly susceptible to discriminatory treatment, marginalization and 
restrictions on enjoyment of rights because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It 
is not exhaustive: areas of concern not addressed here include discrimination in access to 
justice, housing and social benefits, and discriminatory dress codes that restrict men 
dressing in a manner perceived as feminine and women dressing in a manner perceived as 
masculine, and punish those who do.89  
</p>
<p><b> A. Discrimination in employment

from any discrimination in access to and maintenance of employment. The Committee on

<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has confirmed that the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights &#8220;prohibits discrimination in access to and 
maintenance of employment on grounds of &#8230; sexual orientation&#8221;90 and noted concern 
about discrimination directed at &#8220;disadvantaged and marginalized groups and 
individuals.&#8221;91 According to the Committee, &#8220;any discrimination in access to the labour 
market or to means and entitlements for obtaining employment constitutes a violation of the 
Covenant.&#8221;92  
</p>
<p>52. Fifty-four States have laws prohibiting discrimination in employment based on 
sexual orientation.93 In the absence of such laws, employers may be able to fire or refuse to 
hire or promote people simply because they are thought to be homosexual or transgender. 
Benefits that accrue to heterosexual employees may be denied to their LGBT counterparts - 
from parental or family leave to participation in pension and health-care insurance schemes. 
In <i>X v. Colombia </i>and<i> Young v. Australia</i>, the Human Rights Committee found that failure 
to provide pension benefits to an unmarried same-sex partner, when such benefits were 
granted to unmarried heterosexual couples, was a violation of rights guaranteed by the 
Covenant.94  
</p>
<p>53. Discrimination can lead to harassment and violence within and outside workplace 
confines.95 Surveys indicate that verbal harassment of LGBT employees is commonplace.96 
</p>
<p><b> B. Discrimination in health care 
</b></p>
<p>54. Article 12 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights provides that States parties to the Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. The Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has indicated that the Covenant proscribes any 
discrimination in access to health care and the underlying determinants of health, as well as 
to means and entitlements for their procurement, on the grounds of sexual orientation and 
gender identity.97  
</p>
<p>55. The criminalization of homosexuality may deter individuals from seeking health 
services for fear of revealing criminal conduct, and results in services, national health plans 
and policies not reflecting the specific needs of LGBT persons. The Special Rapporteur on 
health observed: &#8220;Criminal laws concerning consensual same-sex conduct, sexual 
orientation and gender identity often infringe on various human rights, including the right

are&#8230; Discrimination may cause poverty, just as poverty may cause discrimination.&#8221;

<p>to health.&#8221;98 In <i>Toonen</i>, the Human Rights Committee rejected the claim that laws 
criminalizing consensual same-sex conduct were a necessary public health measure, noting 
that such laws risk driving many of those at risk underground.99 Since then, the Secretary-
General, special procedures and UNAIDS have drawn attention to the negative health 
impact of criminalization.100 
</p>
<p>56. In countries where no criminal sanctions exist, homophobic, sexist and transphobic 
practices and attitudes on the part of health-care institutions and personnel may nonetheless 
deter LGBT persons from seeking services, which in turn has a negative impact on efforts 
to tackle HIV/AIDS and other health concerns.101 Concerns of potential patients include 
breaches of confidentiality, further stigma and violent reprisals.102 The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern about lesbian, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex women as &#8220;victims of abuses and mistreatment by health service 
</p>
<p>providers&#8221;.103 Special procedures have also criticized the practice of so-called &#8220;reparative&#8221; 
therapy intended to &#8220;cure&#8221; individuals of their homosexual attraction, as being unscientific, 
potentially harmful and contributing to stigma.104 
</p>
<p>57. In many countries, transgender persons face particular difficulties in their access to 
health care. Gender reassignment therapy, where available, is often prohibitively expensive 
and State funding or insurance coverage is rarely available. Health-care professionals are 
often insensitive to the needs of transgender persons and lack necessary professional 
training.105 In addition, intersex children, who are born with atypical sex characteristics, are 
often subjected to discrimination and medically unnecessary surgery, performed without 
their informed consent, or that of their parents, in an attempt to fix their sex.106   
</p>
<p><b> C. Discrimination in education

of their sexual orientation or gender expression, sometimes leading to their being refused

<p>admission or being expelled.107 LGBT youth frequently experience violence and 
harassment, including bullying, in school from classmates and teachers.108 Confronting this 
kind of prejudice and intimidation requires concerted efforts from school and education 
authorities and integration of principles of non-discrimination and diversity in school 
curricula and discourse. The media also have a role to play by eliminating negative 
stereotyping of LGBT people, including in television programmes popular among young 
people. 
</p>
<p>59. The Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child have expressed concern about 
homophobic discrimination in schools, and called for measures to counter homophobic and 
transphobic attitudes.109 According to UNESCO, &#8220;it is often in the primary school 
playground that boys deemed by others to be too effeminate or young girls seen as tomboys 
endure teasing and sometimes the first blows linked to their appearance and behaviour, 
perceived as failing to fit in with the heteronormative gender identity.&#8221;110 
</p>
<p>60. Isolation and stigma generate depression and other health problems and contribute to 
truancy, absenteeism, children being forced out of school111 and, in extreme cases, 
attempted or actual suicide.112 A survey in the United Kingdom found that almost 65 per 
cent of lesbian, gay and bisexual youth had been bullied in schools because of their sexual 
orientation and more than a quarter had been physically abused.113 These findings are 
mirrored by results of studies carried out in other countries.114  
</p>
<p>61. A related area of concern is sex education. The right to education includes the right 
to receive comprehensive, accurate and age-appropriate information regarding human 
sexuality in order to ensure young people have access to information needed to lead healthy 
lives, make informed decisions and protect themselves and others from sexually-transmitted 
infections.115 The Special Rapporteur on the right to education noted that &#8220;in order to be 
comprehensive, sexual education must pay special attention to diversity, since everyone has 
the right to deal with his or her own sexuality.&#8221;116

<p><b> D. Restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>62. Under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
&#8220;everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either 
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
The Covenant also affirms that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to freedom of association 
with others...&#8221; (art. 22), and that &#8220;the right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized&#8221; (art. 
21). Under the Covenant, States parties may limit enjoyment of these rights only insofar as 
restrictions are provided for by law and necessary to protect rights of others, national 
security, or public safety, order, health or morals. Any such restrictions should be 
compatible with the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant and should not be 
discriminatory.117 
</p>
<p>63. Various bodies within the United Nations system have addressed restrictions on 
rights of people whose advocacy addresses sexuality and gender issues.118 Where States 
require legal registration of non-governmental organizations, LGBT groups have had 
applications rejected or their legal registration revoked.119 The threat of deregistration has 
been used to curtail advocacy on sexuality and gender issues and intimidate individuals in 
the organizations concerned. Police have raided offices of LGBT groups and confiscated 
computer hard drives and contact lists of clients and supporters, thereby exposing others to 
risk of harassment or violence.120 Where computer files have contained information about 
sexual orientation and HIV prevention, including about condom use, staff and volunteers of 
LGBT groups have sometimes been arrested or harassed.121 The personal reputations of 
defenders who support rights related to gender and sexuality have been challenged and 
maligned, including through allegations related to sexual orientation, in efforts to suppress 
their advocacy.122 Special procedures have highlighted risks faced by women defenders 
owing to the perception that they are &#8220;challenging accepted socio-cultural norms, traditions, 
perceptions and stereotypes about femininity, sexual orientation, and the role and status of 
women in society.&#8221;123 
</p>
<p>64. LGBT defenders and supporters of related rights have been subjected to violence 
and harassment when convening meetings or cultural events, or participating in LGBT 
&#8220;equality marches&#8221;. In some States, such events are denied police protection or permits, 
sometimes under guise of threats to public morals or safety, which privileges the 
antagonists rather than those claiming rights. In the absence of effective police protection, 
advocates and marchers have sometimes been physically attacked and harassed by State 
and non-State actors, including &#8220;skinhead&#8221; and fundamentalist groups.124 In 2010, the 
European Court of Human Rights fined the Russian Federation for violating rights related 
to assembly, discrimination and remedy after the State banned LGBT parades in Moscow

<p>on grounds of public safety. The Court stated that &#8220;mere existence of a risk is insufficient 
</p>
<p>for banning the event&#8221;.125 
</p>
<p>65. Special procedures have raised concerns regarding restrictions on freedom of 
expression &#8211; including direct censorship, bans on dissemination of information and 
restrictions on legitimate advocacy &#8211; purportedly justified on grounds of alleged threats to 
public health, morality or State security.126 Restrictions on information on sexual 
orientation, including those allegedly intended to protect &#8220;public decency&#8221;, can have a 
deleterious impact on public health efforts, including in relation to transmission of the HIV 
virus.127 
</p>
<p><b> E. Discriminatory practices in the family and community 
</b></p>
<p>66. While families and communities are often an important source of support, 
discriminatory attitudes within families and communities can also inhibit the ability of 
LGBT people to enjoy the full range of human rights. Such discrimination manifests itself 
in various ways, including through individuals being excluded from family homes, 
disinherited, prevented from going to school, sent to psychiatric institutions, forced to 
marry, forced to relinquish children, punished for activist work and subjected to attacks on 
personal reputation. In many cases, lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people are 
especially at risk owing to entrenched gender inequalities that restrict autonomy in 
decision-making about sexuality, reproduction and family life.128 
</p>
<p>67. Family or community members often enforce gender norms and punish 
transgressions. In 1997, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women noted, &#8220;the 
community may also be the site of restrictions on and regulations of female sexuality &#8230; 
Women who &#8230;live out their sexuality in ways other than heterosexuality are often 
</p>
<p>subjected to violence and degrading treatment.&#8221;129 United Nations mechanisms and non-
governmental organizations have documented a range of gender-specific violations targeted 
at women &#8211; including forced marriage, forced pregnancy, and rape in marriage &#8211; some of

sometimes reflected in decisions regarding child custody; for example, the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights has admitted a case concerning a lesbian mother and her daughters seeking redress for 
a decision by the Chilean authorities to deny custody based on sexual orientation: see <i>Karen Atala 
and Daughters v. Chile</i>, Case 1271-04, report No. 42/08, OEA/Ser.L/<i>V</i>/II.130 Doc. 22, rev. 1 (2008).

<p>which are enacted as forms of punishment for assumed or actual sexual orientation or 
behaviour.130 
</p>
<p><b> F. Denial of recognition of relationships and related access to State and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other benefits 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Human Rights Committee has held that States are not required, under 
international law, to allow same-sex couples to marry.131 Yet, the obligation to protect 
individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation extends to ensuring that 
unmarried same-sex couples are treated in the same way and entitled to the same benefits as 
unmarried opposite-sex couples.132 
</p>
<p>69. In some countries, the State provides benefits for married and unmarried 
heterosexual couples but denies these benefits to unmarried homosexual couples. Examples 
include pension entitlements, the ability to leave property to a surviving partner, the 
opportunity to remain in public housing following a partner&#8223;s death, or the chance to secure 
residency for a foreign partner. Lack of official recognition of same-sex relationships and 
absence of legal prohibition on discrimination can also result in same-sex partners being 
discriminated against by private actors, including health-care providers and insurance 
companies. 
</p>
<p>70. The Human Rights Committee has welcomed measures to address discrimination in 
this context. In its concluding observations on Ireland, the Committee urged the State party 
to ensure that proposed legislation establishing civil partnerships not be &#8220;discriminatory of 
non-traditional forms of partnership, including taxation and welfare benefits.&#8221;133 
</p>
<p><b> G. Gender recognition and related issues 
</b></p>
<p>71. In many countries, transgender persons are unable to obtain legal recognition of their 
preferred gender, including a change in recorded sex and first name on State-issued identity 
documents.134 As a result, they encounter many practical difficulties, including when 
applying for employment, housing, bank credit or State benefits, or when travelling abroad. 
</p>
<p>72. Regulations in countries that recognize changes in gender often require, implicitly or 
explicitly, that applicants undergo sterilization surgery as a condition of recognition. Some 
States also require that those seeking legal recognition of a change in gender be unmarried, 
implying mandatory divorce in cases where the individual is married. 
</p>
<p>73. The Human Rights Committee has expressed concern regarding lack of 
arrangements for granting legal recognition of transgender people&#8223;s identities. It has urged 
States to recognize the right of transgender persons to change their gender by permitting the 
issuance of new birth certificates and has noted with approval legislation facilitating legal 
recognition of a change of gender.135

<p><b> VI. Emerging responses 
</b></p>
<p>74. There are many examples, in all regions, of initiatives developed by States and non-
State entities that seek to address violence and discrimination on grounds of sexual 
orientation and gender identity. While all such initiatives are too numerous to mention, the 
examples below illustrate the kinds of actions identified in the course of preparing the 
present study. 
</p>
<p>75. Many Member States have instituted training programmes for law-enforcement 
officials to sensitize them to bias-motivated violence against LGBT persons and help them 
to recognize, register and respond to reports of such crimes. In some countries, including 
Spain and Honduras, special prosecutors have been appointed to investigate and bring cases 
to trial. In South Africa, a national task team on homophobic and transphobic hate crime 
has been established following consultations with the LGBT community.136 Some States, 
including Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, the Netherlands and Uruguay, have used the 
Yogyakarta Principles to help guide policy responses to incidents of violence and 
discrimination.137 
</p>
<p>76. There are many examples of public information campaigns, sometimes developed 
with State support, designed to address societal prejudice. In Brazil, the Government has 
supported a public education campaign implemented under the slogan &#8220;Brazil without 
</p>
<p>Homophobia&#8221;. Similar initiatives, often led by civil society, have been launched in 
countries in all regions. Celebrities have played an important role as message-carriers in 
such campaigns. 
</p>
<p>77. Examples of initiatives to counter homophobia and transphobia in educational 
institutions include teacher-training programmes, the establishment of &#8220;safe spaces&#8221; for 
LGBT youths in schools, and awareness-raising campaigns. In Australia, the publicly-
funded Safe Schools Coalition (www.safeschoolscoalitionvictoria.org.au) offers teacher 
training and learning materials. In China, the Boys and Girls Clubs Association of Hong 
Kong (www.bgca.org.hk) offers counselling in schools and youth centres. In Ireland, an 
anti-homophobia video shown in schools has been watched by half a million people 
online.138 In the United States, gay-straight alliances or clubs have been established in more 
than 4,000 high schools.139 
</p>
<p>78. National human rights institutions can play an important role. For example, in 2011, 
the Kenya Human Rights Commission produced the report, &#8220;The Outlawed Amongst Us: A 
Study of the LGBTI Community&#8223;s Search for Equality and Non-Discrimination in Kenya&#8221;. 
The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions has facilitated dialogue 
among member institutions, with positive contributions from national institutions in 
</p>
<p>  
 136 See www.justice.gov.za/m_statements/2011/20110504_lbgti-taskteam.html (accessed 9 November 
</p>
<p>2011). 
 137 While not legally binding, the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity provide guidance to States on 
related human rights issues and legal standards. In the universal periodic review process, several 
Governments have committed to using the Principles in future policy development. In addition, the 
Organization of American States may consider the creation of a special rapporteur on LGBT-related 
violations.

<p>Australia, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, the Philippines, the 
Republic of Korea and Thailand.140 
</p>
<p>79. Some States &#8211; inter alia, Australia, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Portugal, the United 
Kingdom and Uruguay &#8211; have made it easier for transgender and intersex persons to obtain 
legal recognition of a change of gender or to indicate a gender other than male or female. 
The New Zealand Human Rights Commission recently concluded a two-year consultation 
to identify human rights concerns of transgender persons.141  
</p>
<p>80. Finally, recognizing that safeguarding the rights of LGBT persons is a multifaceted 
undertaking, the Government of Norway recently published a plan of action intended to 
mobilize eight Government departments to implement a series of specific measures.142 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The present report summarizes only some of the information gathered by 
United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures, regional and non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations on violence and discrimination based on actual or perceived sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity. A more comprehensive analysis of the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges facing LGBT and intersex persons would require a more extensive study 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, in future, regular reporting. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Nevertheless, on the basis of the information presented herein, a pattern of 
human rights violations emerges that demands a response. Governments and inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental bodies have often overlooked violence and discrimination based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual orientation and gender identity. The mandate of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires it to address this gap: the Council should promote </b>&#8220;<b>universal respect for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction 
</b></p>
<p><b>of any kind and in a fair and equal manner.</b>&#8221;<b>143 With the adoption in June 2011 of 
</b></p>
<p>resolution 17/19, the Council formally expressed its &#8220;<b>grave </b>concern&#8221; regarding 
</p>
<p><b>violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Further 
</b></p>
<p><b>action is now needed, especially at the national level, if individuals are to be better 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected from such human rights violations in future. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The recommendations to Member States set out below, which are not 
exhaustive, draw on measures recommended by United Nations human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that Member States:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  Investigate promptly all reported killings and other serious incidents of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence perpetrated against individuals because of their actual or perceived sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity, whether carried out in public or in private by State or 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-State actors, and hold perpetrators accountable, and establish systems for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recording and reporting of such incidents;

<p><b>investigate thoroughly all reported incidents of torture and ill-treatment, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecute and hold accountable those responsible; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that no one fleeing persecution on grounds of sexual orientation 
</b></p>
<p><b>or gender identity is returned to a territory where his or her life or freedom would be 
</b></p>
<p><b>threatened, and that asylum laws and policies recognize that persecution on account 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Repeal laws used to criminalize individuals on grounds of homosexuality 
</b></p>
<p><b>for engaging in consensual same-sex sexual conduct, and harmonize the age of consent

</b></p>
<p><b>rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>85. The High Commissioner recommends that the Human Rights Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Keep regularly informed and updated on incidents of violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination linked to sexual orientation and gender identity;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Encourage existing special procedures to continue to investigate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>report on human rights violations affecting individuals on the basis of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity within the context of their specific mandates.</b>
