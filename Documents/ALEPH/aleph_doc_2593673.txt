Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited, condensed, consolidated
financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial
position of Applied Minerals, Inc. ("Applied Minerals" or "the Company" or "we") and its
results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Such financial
statements have been condensed in accordance with the applicable regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company's
Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for such year. The results of operations for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the entire year.
NOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Applied Minerals is the owner of the Dragon Mine located in the Tintic Mining District of the
State of Utah from where it produces halloysite clay and iron oxide. The Company is
currently mining and selling its DRAGONITETM and AMIRONTM products and is also in
various phases of commercial scale trials with several organizations in various markets
with respect to uses of its products.
Applied Minerals is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware. The
common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol AMNL.
NOTE 3 – LIQUIDITY
The Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and use of cash in
operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's net loss was
$3,731,884 and cash used in operating activities was $1,528,002. At June 30, 2016, the
Company had working capital of $1,338,077, which includes $919,913 of accrued PIK Note
interest, which the Company expects to pay in-kind and $167,841 of payables for which
the Company believes it has a statute of limitations defense. In addition, during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, the Company commenced generating revenue under a take-
or-pay supply agreement for AMIRON iron oxide and reduced exploration costs related to
activities at the Dragon mine. Based on the Company's cash balance at June 30, 2016 and
its cash usage expectations, it believes it will have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations
for at least the next 12 months.
On June 24, 2016, the Company raised $1.64 million through the private placement of
10,933,333 units at $0.15 per unit. Attached to each unit sold was one share of common
stock and a five-year warrant to purchase 0.3 shares of the Company’s common stock. As
a result of the sale, the Company issued 10,933,333 shares of common stock and warrants
to purchase 3,280,000 shares of common stock at $0.25 per share. The warrants have a
term of five years and do not contain a provision that allows for a cashless exercise.
NOTE 4 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Exploration-Stage Company
From 1997 through 2008, the Company’s sole source of revenue and income was derived
from its contract mining business through which it provided shaft sinking, underground
mine development and mine labor services. At December 31, 2008, the Company
discontinued its contract mining efforts due to economic conditions and the desire to
concentrate its efforts on the commercialization of the halloysite clay deposit at the
Dragon Mine. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company was, and still is, classified as an
exploration company as the existence of proven or probable reserves have not been
demonstrated and no significant revenue has been earned from the mine. Under the
SEC’s Industry Guide 7, a mining company is considered an exploration stage company
until it has declared mineral reserves determined in accordance with the guide and staff
interpretations thereof.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied
Minerals, Inc. and its inactive subsidiary in northern Idaho.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In these
condensed consolidated financial statements, the PIK Note derivative liability, stock
compensation and impairment of long-lived assets involve extensive reliance on
management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a term of three
months or less. The Company minimizes its credit risk by investing its cash and cash
equivalents, which sometimes exceeds FDIC limits, with major financial institutions
located in the United States with a high credit rating.
8
Table Of Contents
Receivables
Trade receivables are reported at outstanding principal amounts, net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts. Management evaluates the collectability of receivable account
balances to determine the allowance, if any. Management considers the other party’s
credit risk and financial condition, as well as current and projected economic and market
conditions, in determining the amount of the allowance. Receivable balances are written
off when management determines that the balance is uncollectable. No allowance was
required at June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
follows:
Estimated
Useful Life
(in years)
Building and Building Improvements
   5 – 40
Mining equipment
   2 – 7
Office and shop furniture and equipment   3 – 7
Vehicles
     5
Depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $338,333
and $326,684, respectively. Depreciation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 totaled $674,420 and $652,905, respectively. The Company currently does not
capitalize any amounts to its mineral resources and therefore does not have any depletion
expense.
Fair Value
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also
establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes
between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own
assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
Level 2 – Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable;
and
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are
developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant
would use.
Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:

The recorded value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of
cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other current assets, and accounts payable and
accrued expenses approximates the fair value at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. Based on borrowing rates
currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, and the remaining short-
term period outstanding, the carrying value of notes payable other than PIK Notes
approximates fair value. Estimated fair values of the PIK Notes Payable approximate
$23,463,323 and $21,789,259, respectively, at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (based
on Level 2 inputs).

Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company periodically reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to determine
whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustment to such carrying amounts.
Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such
events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying amount.
If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically
calculated using discounted expected future cash flows where observable fair values are
not readily determinable. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate
the fair value of assets. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial
statement carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue includes sales of halloysite clay and iron oxide, and is recognized when title
passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Title passes to the
buyer based on terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined based on
related contractual arrangements with the Company’s customers.
Mining Exploration and Development Costs
Land and mining property are carried at cost. The Company expenses prospecting and
mining exploration costs. At the point when a property is determined to have proven and
probable reserves, subsequent development costs will be capitalized and will be charged
to operations using the units-of-production method over proven and probable reserves.
Upon abandonment or sale of a mineral property, all capitalized costs relating to the
specific property are written off in the period abandoned or sold and a gain or loss is
recognized.
Income taxes
The Company uses an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets
and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, using enacted tax
rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable
income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A valuation allowance is
provided for the portion of the Company’s net deferred tax assets for which it is more
likely than not that they will not be realized.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of certain state
jurisdictions. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to
income tax matters in income tax expense.
The Company follows the provision of ASC Topic 740-10, “Income Taxes”, relating to
recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. It also
provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods and requires increased disclosures. This guidance provides that the tax
effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in our financial statements, only if
the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical
merits of the position. As of June 30, 2016, no amounts are included in the financial
statements for unrecognized tax benefits.

Table Of Contents
Stock Options and Warrants
The Company follows ASC 718 (Stock Compensation) and 505-50 (Equity-Based
Payments to Non-employees), which provide guidance in accounting for share-based
awards exchanged for services rendered and requires companies to expense the
estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite service period.
Per share data
Loss per share for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is
calculated based on 97,889,350 and 95,653,519 weighted average outstanding shares of
common stock. Loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, is calculated based on 97,556,480 and 95,381,825 weighted average
outstanding shares of common stock.
At June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company had outstanding options and
warrants to purchase 24,276,950 and 18,929,402 shares of Company common stock, and
had notes payable which were convertible into 38,676,225 and 31,590,709 shares,
respectively, of the Company common stock, none of which were included in the diluted
computation as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Environmental Matters
Expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current
operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures resulting from the
remediation of existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to
future revenue generations are expensed. Liabilities are recognized when environmental
assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated.
Estimates of such liabilities are based upon currently available facts, existing technology
and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of
inflation and other societal and economic factors, and include estimates of associated
legal costs. These amounts also reflect prior experience in remediating contaminated
sites, other companies’ clean-up experience and data released by The Environmental
Protection Agency or other organizations. Such estimates are by their nature imprecise
and can be expected to be revised over time because of changes in government
regulations, operations, technology and inflation.  Recoveries are evaluated separately
from the liability and, when recovery is assured, the Company records and reports an
asset separately from the associated liability.
Based upon management’s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities, it
does not believe that any reclamation or remediation liability exists at June 30, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, that changes the
accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance
requires the recognition in the income statement of the income tax effects of vested or
settled awards. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an
employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes and not classify the award as a liability
that requires valuation on a mark-to-market basis. In addition, the guidance allows for a
policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis.
The guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statement and related
disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases,
which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under Accounting Standards Update
2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a
lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that
represents the lessee's right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease
term. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its
financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes
(Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Accounting Standards
Update 2015-17 simplifies current guidance and requires companies to classify all
deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Accounting
Standards Update 2015-17 can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and is
effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The
Company does not anticipate the new guidance will have a material effect on its financial
statements and related disclosures.
In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU 2015-03, which requires that debt issuance costs
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction to the carrying amount of the
associated debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Currently debt issuance costs are
recognized as an asset. The ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017
and is required to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial
statements and related disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Update
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on revenue recognition. The new
standard provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue contracts with
customers as well as requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable
users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
relating to customer contracts. Companies have an option to use either a retrospective
approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the standard.
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those years
beginning after December 15, 2016, the original effective date of the standard. The
Company does not anticipate the new guidance will have a material effect on its financial
statements and related disclosures.
Comparative Information
We have reclassified certain prior year information to conform with the current year's
presentation.
NOTE 5 - INCOME TAX
Income tax provisions or benefits for interim periods are computed based on the
Company's estimated annual effective tax rate. Based on the Company's historical losses
and its expectation of the continuation of losses for the foreseeable future, the Company
has determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized
and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.

Series A Notes
On November 3, 2014 (“Issue Date”), the Company issued, in a private placement pursuant
to investment agreements, $19,848,486 principal amount of 10% PIK-Election Convertible
Notes due 2018 ("Series A Notes") in exchange for $12,500,000 in cash and the
cancellation of previously-issued warrants held by one investor.
Below are key terms of the Series A Notes:
Maturity- November 3, 2018, provided that the Stated Maturity Date may be extended to
November 3, 2019 at the option of the Company (the “Extension Option”) if (i) the Company has
delivered written notice of its exercise of the Extension Option to the Holder not more than
ninety (90) nor less than thirty (30) days prior to November 3, 2018 and (ii) the Company has
delivered a certificate, dated as of November 3, 2018, certifying that no Default or Event of
●
Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, further that the Stated Maturity Date shall be
extended to the maturity date of the Series 2023 Notes or any Replacement Financing, as
applicable, upon the occurrence of a Specified Event (“Specified Extension”).
Exercise Price- initially $0.92 per share and will be (i) adjusted from time to time pursuant anti-
dilution provisions and (ii) reduced by $0.10 per share if the Company elects to exercise its
Extension Option.
Stated Interest: 10% payable semiannually in arrears, provided that the interest rate shall be
reduced to 1% per annum on the principal amount of the Note upon the occurrence of the
Specified Event, as defined below.
Specified Event- means the event that may occur after the second anniversary of the Issuer
Date if: (i) any amounts under the Series 2023 Notes or any Replacement Financing are
outstanding, (ii) the VWAP for the preceding 30 consecutive Trading Days as determined by
the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith is in excess of the Exercise Price, (iii) the
closing Market Price of the Common Stock is in excess of the Exercise Price on the date
immediately preceding the date on which the Specified Event occurs, (iv) no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and (v) the Issuer has delivered a certificate to each
holder of Series A Notes certifying that the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above
have been met.
Extension Option- If stock price is lower than current exercise price ($0.92) prior to the stated
maturity (November 3, 2018), then the Company can elect an Extension Option, whereby the
maturity is extended by one year (see Maturity definition), but with a reduction in exercise price
by $0.10.
Liquidated Damages- The company is required to pay the noteholders 1% of the principal
amount of the Series A Notes if a Registration statement is not filed and effective within 90
days of the inception date (and further damages for every 30 days thereafter). The Company
has accrued $200,000 as Other Expense as of December 31, 2014 due to a delay in such
filing.
The number of shares issuable under the Notes may be affected by the anti-dilution provisions
of the Notes. The antidilition provisions adjust the Exercise Price of the Notes in the event of
stock dividends and splits, issuance below the market price of the Common Stock, issuances
below the conversion price of the Notes, pro rata distribution of assets, rights plans, tender
offers, and exchange offers.

These Series A Notes were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future
cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. In
addition to the customary anti-dilution provisions the notes contain a down-round
provision whereby the conversion price would be adjusted downward in the event that
additional shares of the Company’s common stock or securities exercisable, convertible
or exchangeable for the Company’s common stock were issued for cash consideration
(e.g. a capital raise) at a price less than the conversion price.
Therefore, the estimated fair value of the conversion feature of $9,212,285 (based on
observable inputs using a Monte Carlo model) was bifurcated from the Series A Notes and
accounted for as a separate derivative liability, which resulted in a corresponding amount
of debt discount on the Series A Notes. In addition, an additional debt discount of
$7,348,486 was recorded as a result of the difference between the $12,500,000 of cash
received and the $19,848,486 of principal on the Series A Notes. This combined debt
discount of $16,560,771 is being amortized using the effective interest method over the 4-
year term of the Notes as Interest Expense, while the PIK Note Derivative is carried at fair
value (using a Monte Carlo model) until the Notes are converted or otherwise
extinguished. Any changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Table Of Contents
In May 2015, November 2015 and May 2016, the Company issued $992,424, $1,042,045,
and $1,094,148, respectively, in additional PIK Notes to the holders to pay the semi-annual
interest.
At June 30, 2016, the fair value of the Series A PIK Note Derivative was estimated to be
$3,626,505, which includes the value of the additional PIK Notes issued in May 2015,
November 2015, and May 2016 for the semi-annual interest payments due. The change in
the fair value of the derivative represents a decrease in valuation of $5,585,780 from the
November 3, 2014 inception date.
Series 2023 Notes
In August 2013, the Company received $10,500,000 of financing through the private
placement of 10% mandatory convertible Notes due 2023 ("Series 2023 Notes"). The
principal amount of the Notes is due on maturity. The Company can elect to pay semi-
annual interest on the Series 2023 Notes with additional PIK Notes containing the same
terms as the Series 2023 Notes, except interest will accrue from issuance of such notes.
The Company can also elect to pay interest in cash. In February 2016, August 2015 and
February 2015, the Company issued $638,141, $607,753 and $578,812, respectively, in
additional PIK Notes to the holders to pay the semi-annual interest. In February 2014 and
August 2014, the Company issued $525,000 and $551,250, respectively, in additional PIK
Notes to the holders to pay the semi-annual interest.
The Series 2023 Notes convert into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of
$1.40 per share, which is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments; these anti-
dilution adjustments reduced the conversion price to $1.36 after the issuance of the Series
A Notes and then to $1.28 after the issuance of 10,933,333 units for proceeds of $1.64
million on June 24, 2016. As of issuance, principal amount of the Series 2023 Notes were
convertible into 7,500,000 shares of the common stock, into 7,720,588 shares after the
issuance of the Series A Notes and 8,203,125 shares of common stock after the issuance
of the 10,933,333 units.. The holders may convert the Series 2023 Notes at any time. The
Series 2023 Notes are mandatorily convertible after one year when the weighted average
trading price of a share of the common stock for the preceding ten trading days is in
excess of the conversion price. The Series 2023 Notes contain customary representations
and warranties and several covenants. The proceeds are being used for general corporate
purposes. No broker was used and no commission was paid in connection with the sale of
the Series 2023 Notes. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the
covenants.
These Series 2023 Notes were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future
cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. In
addition to the customary anti-dilution provisions the notes contain a down-round
provision whereby the conversion price would be adjusted downward in the event that
additional shares of the Company’s common stock or securities exercisable, convertible
or exchangeable for the Company’s common stock were issued for cash consideration
(e.g. a capital raise) at a price less than the conversion price. Therefore, the estimated fair
value of the conversion feature of $2,055,000 (based on observable inputs using a Monte
Carlo model) was bifurcated from the Series 2023 Notes and accounted for as a separate
derivative liability, which resulted in a corresponding amount of debt discount on the
Series 2023 Notes. The debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest
method over the 10-year term of the Series 2023 Notes as Interest Expense, while the PIK
Note Derivative is carried at fair value (using a Monte Carlo model) until the Series 2023
Notes are converted or otherwise extinguished. Any changes in fair value are recognized
in earnings.
At June 30, 2016, the fair value of the PIK Note Derivative was estimated to be $230,329,
which includes the value of the additional PIK Notes issued in February 2016, August
2015, February 2015, August 2014 and February 2014 for the semi-annual interest
payments due. The change in the fair value of the derivative represents a decrease in
valuation of $1,824,671 from the August 2, 2013 inception date.

awards intended to be performance-based. Under the LTIP, 8,900,000 shares are
authorized for issuance. The STIP does not refer to a particular number of shares under
the LTIP, but would use the shares authorized in the LTIP for issuance under the STIP. The
CEO, the CFO, and named executive officers, and directors, among others are eligible to
participate in the LTIP and STIP. Prior to the adoption of the LTIP and STIP, stock options
were granted under individual arrangements between the Company and the grantees, and
approved by the Board of Directors.
On May 11, 2016, the Board of Directors has adopted the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan
(the “Plan”). The Plan, administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board allows
for the following types of incentive awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, performance shares, performance units or other stock-based award.
Such awards may be issued to employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The
aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued or used for reference
purposes with respect to which awards may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed
two million.
The fair value of each of the Company's stock option awards is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in
the table below. Expected volatility is based on an average of historical volatility of the
Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life
of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury
Bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the
award.
The significant assumptions relating to the valuation of the Company's options issued for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows on a weighted average
basis:

Overview
Applied Minerals, Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “us”) is focused primarily on (i) the
development, marketing and sale of our halloysite clay-based DRAGONITE™ line of
products for use to improve the performance of end-products in application markets such
as flame retardant additives for plastics, nucleation, thermosets and adhesives,
reinforcement, molecular sieves and catalysts, ceramics, binders, cosmetics, controlled
release carriers and environmental remediation and (ii) the development, marketing and
sale of our AMIRON™ line of iron oxide products for pigmentary and technical
applications.
The Company owns the Dragon Mine, which has significant deposits of high-quality
halloysite clay and iron oxide. The 267-acre property is located in southwestern Utah and
its resource was mined for halloysite on a large-scale, commercial basis between 1949 and
1976 for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. The mine was idle until 2001 when the
Company leased it to develop its halloysite resource for advanced, high-value
applications. We purchased 100% of the property in 2005.
Halloysite is an aluminosilicate clay that possesses a tubular morphology with a hollow
lumen (pore). Traditionally, halloysite has been used to manufacture porcelain, bone china
and catalysts used in the petroleum cracking process.
A significant amount of academic and industrial research has been performed on the
commercial uses of halloysite clay beyond porcelain products and ceramic-based
catalysts. This research has identified a wide array of application areas in which the
unique morphology of halloysite can be utilized to either enhance the performance of
existing applications or create new high-performance ones. Since 2009, management has
been primarily focused on developing halloysite-based products, marketed under the
DRAGONITE™ trade name, for advanced applications, such as, but not limited to,
reinforcement additives for polymer composites, flame retardant additives for polymers,
controlled release carriers for paints and coatings, strength reinforcement additives for
cement, concrete, mortars and grouts, rheology additives for drilling fluids, environmental
remediation media, and carriers of agricultural agents. The clays used in these advanced
applications sell for significantly higher prices than those used in more traditional
applications.
In addition to the development of its halloysite resource, management has also developed
a line of iron oxide-based products for the pigmentary and technical markets. The Dragon
Mine has a resource of 3.3 million tons of natural iron oxide mineralized material, which is
comprised primarily of goethite and hematite. The resource possesses a high-quality
natural iron oxide. High-quality iron oxides have commercial uses in a number of high-
value applications within the pigmentary and technical markets. The Company’s AMIRON
product line includes semi-transparent and opaque pigments for the construction,
concrete, paints and coatings, and plastics and rubber industries. AMIRON’s technical
oxides, due to their particularly high surface area of 25 m2/g – 125 m2/g and reactivity, can
be used as the media for the removal of toxins from waste and drinking water, as a catalyst
for desulfurization, and a foundry sand additive.
The Company has a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons per
annum that is currently dedicated to the processing of its AMIRON product., The Company
has a smaller processing facility with a capacity of 5,000 – 10,000 tons per annum that is
currently dedicated to its halloysite resource.
In late 2015, the Company entered into a $5 million take-or-pay supply agreement for its
AMIRON product. The $5 million portion of the take-or-pay agreement is expected to be
completed by June 2017. In July, 2016 the Company received an order for 5 tons of
DRAGONITE from a leading zeolite/molecular sieve manufacturer, which plans to carry out
a commercial-scale trial of a halloysite-based molecular sieve product. The Company is
involved in a number of advanced-stage product development projects with customers
that operate within industries that include, but are not limited to, catalysts and oilfield
services. The Company has engaged leading special material distribution organizations,
HORN, Brandt Technologies and KODA Distribution Group for the U.S. and Fimatec LTD
for Korea. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors
established an Operations Committee to which it appointed Mario Concha and Robert
Betz. The purpose of the Operations Committee is to advise the Company’s management
team on how best to execute its operations, marketing and sales strategies.
Applied Minerals is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware. The
common stock trades on the OTCQB under the symbol AMNL.

Revenue generated during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $1,112,467
compared to $65,848 of revenue generated during the same period in 2015, an increase of
1,589.5%. This increase was due primarily to the sale of AMIRON iron oxide through a take-
or-pay supply agreement entered into by the Company on November 2, 2015. During the
three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company, through the take-or-pay supply
agreement, generated $1,022,468 of revenue. This agreement did not exist during the
same period in 2015. Also contributing to the revenue increase during the quarter was
$57,200 of sales of DRAGONITE halloysite clay for use in a specialty zeolite application
that were not realized during the same period in 2015 and $8,500 of sales of DRAGONITE
to two customers for use as an additive in plastic applications. Partially offsetting the
increase in revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2016, was the absence of
$28,000 in sales of DRAGONITE to a distributor located in Taiwan that occurred in the
same period in 2015, and a $12,000 decline in sales of DRAGONITE to a customer for use
as a binder in a ceramic application due primarily to a timing difference.
Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $2,210,380
compared to $2,869,281 of operating expenses incurred during the same period in 2015, a
decrease of $658,901 or 23.0%. The decline in operating costs was driven by primarily by a
$707,047 decline in exploration costs and a $180,539 decline in general and administrative
expense, partially offset by a $217,036 increase in product costs driven primarily by the
effect of the Company’s take-or-pay supply contract for its AMIRON iron oxide, which was
not in effect during the same period in 2015.
Production costs incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $220,970
compared to $3,934 of costs incurred during the same period in 2015, an increase of
$217,036 or 55.2%. These costs consist primarily of the direct labor, energy and material
expenditures required to produce saleable product. The increase in costs incurred during
the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were associated, in large part, to the production of the
Company’s AMIRON iron oxide product related to the fulfillment of its take-or-pay supply
contract, which was not in effect during the same period in 2015.
Exploration costs incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $584,150
compared to $1,291,197 of exploration costs incurred during the same period in 2015, a
decrease of $707,047 or 54.8%. Exploration costs are associated with the Company’s
activities at its Dragon Mine location, excluding costs associated with production. The
decline was driven primarily by a $395,402 decrease in wages and wage-related expense
due to a reduction in headcount at the Company’s Dragon Mine operation. This reduction
in headcount resulted from the planned completion of certain underground exploration
activities during the third quarter of 2015. Expenses related to underground development,
such as materials and supplies, equipment rental, ground support expense and drilling
supplies, declined by $267,175 due to the aforementioned completion of underground
development at the Dragon Mine. Professional services expense decreased by $53,500
due to the elimination of geological consulting related to the completion of planned
characterization of the Dragon Mine property. Outside lab expenses at the Dragon Mine
decreased by approximately $24,400 due to the Company’s decision to establish a lab on-
site during the first half of 2015.

Table Of Contents
General and administrative expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30,
2016 totaled $1,066,927 compared to $1,247,466 of expense incurred during the same
period in 2015, a decrease of $180,539, or 14.5%. The Company’s selling and
administrative expenses are associated primarily with its New York operations.
The largest component of the Company’s general and administrative expense includes
wage, wage-related and equity-based expense. Wage expense for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 totaled $432,289, a decline of $27,400 compared to the same period in 2015.
This decline was driven by a decline of $68,100 in wages related to staff reductions and of
$33,000 related to a reduction in wages of certain employees, partially offset by $74,000 of
additional wages related to the hiring of a Director of Sales during the period. Wage-related
expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by approximately $16,000.
The increase was related primarily to a $7,500 increase in workers’ compensation expense
due to a timing difference in recognizing the expense and a $7,800 increase in employee
health care expense.
Equity-based expense totaled $238,064 during the quarter, an increase of $130,404 when
compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in
the number of equity-based options outstanding at June 30, 2016 compared to the number
outstanding at June 30, 2015. Equity-based compensation expense for employees for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 was $162,901, an increase of $87,770 when compared
to the similar period in 2015, which was due primarily the payment of equity-based rather
than cash bonuses. Equity-based compensation for directors was $75,163 during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $59,160 when compared to the same
period in 2015, which was driven by the directors’ decision to take a larger portion of their
compensation in equity-based grants. These increases were partially offset by a decline in
equity-based compensation expenses for consultants. Total compensation for the
Company’s directors (cash and equity) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was
$125,650, a decline of $4,460 when compared to the same period in 2015.
Expenses associated with professional services totaled $36,538 during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, a decline of $148,802 when compared to the same period in 2015.
The decrease was driven primarily by a $47,500 reduction in expense related to the
utilization of outside legal firms, the elimination of $39,500 of consulting expense related to
product development, a $39,700 decline in accounting expenses and the absence of a
$24,700 expense related to the valuation of fixed assets incurred during 2015.
Expense incurred for shareholder services totaled $16,400 during the period, a decline of
$59,700, driven primarily by a reduction in fees paid for investor relations services.
Expenses incurred for property taxes, licenses and fees increased by $37,200 during the
period due, in large part, to the timing of the recognition of the expenses.
Operating loss incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $1,097,913
compared to a loss of $2,803,433 incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of
$1,705,520 or 60.8%. The decrease in operating loss during the quarter was due to a
1,589.5% increase in revenue and a 23.0% decrease in operating expense. The Company’s
performance under its take-or-pay supply agreement during the quarter and its focus on
the reduction of non-revenue related operating expense were the primary drivers of the
decline in operating loss.
Net loss for the three-month period ending June 30, 2016 was $3,185,359 compared to a
loss of $2,728,876 incurred during the same period in 2015, an increase of $456,483, or
16.7%. The increase in net loss was due primarily to a $2,055,619 decline in the gain on
revaluation of PIK Note derivative, a $264,246 increase in interest expense due to an
increase in the principal amount of the Company Series 2023 and Series A PIK Notes, and
selling expense of $15,900 related to the sale of non-core real estate, partially offset by a
$1,705,520 increase in operating income, the absence of $145,600 in PIK Note penalty
expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2015, and a $27,500 dividend
payment received from the Company workers’ comp insurance provider.

Revenue generated during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2,114,095, compared
to $228,595 of revenue generated during the same period in 2015, an increase of 824.8%.
This increase was due primarily to the performance under a take-or-pay supply contract
the Company has for its AMIRON iron oxide. During the six months ended June 30, 2016,
the take-or-pay supply agreement accounted for $1,864,772 in sales of AMIRON, which did
not occur during the same period in 2015. DRAGONITE sold for use in a molecular sieve
application increased by $171,600 during the period. These increases were partially offset
by the absence of $79,200 in sales of AMIRON to a distributor, the absence of $39,000 in
sales of DRAGONITE to an injection molder of plastic components and the absence of
$28,500 of sales of DRAGONITE to Taiwan-based distributor.
Total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $4,513,104
compared to $5,707,328 of operating expenses incurred during the same period in 2015, a
decrease of $1,194,224 or 20.9%. The decline in operating costs was driven primarily by a
decline of $1,506,600 in explorations costs and a $179,639 decline in general and
administrative expense, partially offset by an increase of $470,500 in production costs.
Production costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $476,670
compared to $6,170 of costs incurred during the same period in 2015, an increase of
$470,500 or 76.3%. These costs consist primarily of the direct labor, energy and material
expenditures required to produce saleable product. The increase in costs incurred during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 were associated, in large part, to the production of the
Company’s AMIRON iron oxide product related to the fulfillment of its take-or-pay supply
contract, which was not in effect during the same period in 2015.
Exploration costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $1,111,878
compared to $2,618,478 incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of $1,506,600
or 57.5%. Exploration costs are associated with the Company’s activities at its Dragon
Mine location, excluding costs associated with production. The decline was driven
primarily by a $856,000 decrease in wages and wage-related expense due to a reduction in
headcount at the Company’s Dragon Mine operation. This reduction in headcount
resulted from the planned completion of certain underground exploration activities.
Expenses related to underground development, such as materials and supplies,
equipment rental, ground support expense and drilling supplies, declined by $411,833 due
to the aforementioned completion of underground development at the Dragon Mine.
Professional and consulting services expense decreased by $208,442 due primarily to the
elimination of geological consulting work related to the completion of planned
characterization of the Dragon Mine property and the elimination of the use of outside labs
for geological testing purposes.
General and administrative expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $2,250,136 compared to $2,429,775 of expense incurred during the same period in
2015, a decrease of $179,639, or 7.4%. The Company’s selling and administrative
expenses are associated primarily with its New York operations.

Table Of Contents
The largest component of the Company’s general and administrative expense includes
wage, wage-related and equity-based compensation to employees, directors and
consultants. Wages for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $1,076,180, an
increase of $156,664 when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due
primarily to $112,500 in performance bonus payments paid to the Company’s CFO,
General Counsel and a third employee that were not paid during 2015, $145,500 in wages
paid to two new sales employees who were not employees during the same period in 2015,
a $75,000 bonus payment paid to the Company’s CEO during the period that was paid in
the fourth quarter of 2014, and $25,000 of wages paid to the Company’s General Counsel
during the period that were paid in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by $138,600 of
wages not paid to employees during the period who left the Company during 2015 and
$62,300 in reductions in wage expense for certain existing employees.
Expense associated with equity grants totaled $365,045 during the period, an increase of
$157,197 when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was driven primarily by
an increase in the number of equity-based options outstanding at June 30, 2016 compared
to the number outstanding at June 30, 2015. Equity-based compensation expense for
employees for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $229,358, an increase of $64,077
when compared to the same period in 2015, which was due primarily to the payment of
equity-based rather than cash-based bonuses. Equity-based compensation expense for
directors was $127,747 during the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $95,596
when compared to the same period in 2015, which was driven by the directors’ decision to
take a larger portion of their compensation in equity-based grants. Total compensation for
the Company’s directors, both equity-based and cash-based, for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 was $245,360, a decline of $720 when compared to the same period in 2015.
The increases in equity-based compensation expense for both employees and directors
were partially offset by a relatively small decline in equity-based compensation expenses
for consultants.
Expenses associated with professional services totaled $95,238 during the period, a
decline of $221,490. The decline was driven primarily by a $79,800 decrease in fees
associated with the utilization of outside legal firms, a $70,800 decline in fees paid to a
consulting firm used for product development, a $36,800 decline in fees paid for
accounting services due to a reduction in certain regulatory filings and the elimination of
$24,700 in expenses related to the valuation of certain of the Company’s fixed assets by a
consulting firm during the comparable period in 2015.
Expenses incurred for property taxes, licenses and related fees declined by $26,200
during the period.
Operating loss incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2,399,009
compared to a loss of $5,478,733 incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of
$3,079,724 or 56.2%. The decrease in operating loss during the quarter was due to an
824.8% increase in revenue and a 20.9% decrease in operating expense. The Company’s
performance under its take-or-pay supply agreement during late 2015 and its focus on the
reduction of certain operating expenses, both at Utah and New York, were the primary
drivers of the decline in operating loss.
Net Loss for the six-month period ending June 30, 2016 was $3,731,884 compared to a
loss of $6,923,341 incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of $3,191,457, or
46.1%. The decline in net loss was due primarily to the $3,079,724, or 56.2%, decline in
operating loss, a $541,100 penalty expense related to the Company’s Series A PIK Notes
in 2015, a $71,037 increase in gain on revaluation of PIK Note derivative, a $108,400 net
gain on the sale of non-core real estate assets and an annual dividend of $27,435 received
from the Company workers’ compensation insurance policy. These gains were partially
offset by a $608,039 increase in interest expense and sales expense of $32,187 incurred
from the sale of the Company’s non-core real estate. The increase in interest expense over
the six months ended June 30, 2015 was due to an increase in the outstanding balance of
PIK Note over the period. This increase was due to the Company’s decision to pay the
interest due on its PIK Notes in additional PIK Notes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and the use of cash in
operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's net loss was
$3,731,884 and cash used in operating activities was $1,528,002. At June 30, 2016, the
Company had working capital of $1,338,077. The calculation of working capital took into
account the following items that reduced working capital but that the Company does not
believe that it will have to pay in cash: $919,913 of accrued PIK Note interest, which the
Company expects to pay in-kind and $167,841 of payables for which the Company
believes it has a statute of limitations defense. Based on the Company’s current cash
balance and it cash usage expectations, it believes it will have sufficient liquidity to fund its
operations for at least the next 12 months.
Cash used in operating activities during the first six months of 2016 was $1,528,002
compared to $4,731,175 of cash used during the same period in 2015. The primary driver
behind the $3,203,173 reduction in cash used by operating activities was the $3,191,457
reduction in the Company’s net loss. As described before, the decrease in net loss was
driven primarily by an 824.8% increase in revenue and a 20.9% decrease in operating
expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities partially offset the reduction in
cash used by operating activities during the period.
Cash provided by investing activities during 2016 was $432,161 compared to $17,995 used
during the same period in 2015. The increase in cash generated by investing activities
during the period resulted from $552,944 of proceeds generated from the sale of non-core
land owned by the Company in Idaho, partially offset by the purchase of certain capital
equipment during the period.
Cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was $1,467,458 compared to $203,440 of
cash used during the same period in 2015. On June 24, 2016 the Company raised $1.64
million through the sale of 10,933,333 units at $0.15 per unit. Attached to each unit sold
was one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.3 shares of the Company’s
common stock. As a result of the sale, the Company issued 10,933,333 shares of common
stock and warrants to purchase 3,280,000 shares of common stock at $0.25 per share. The
warrants have a term of five years and do not contain a provision that allows for a
cashless exercise.

Total assets at June 30, 2016 were $7,757,085 compared to $8,318,112 at December 31,
2015, a decrease of $561,027 due primarily to the sale of assets held for sale, the
depreciation of property, plant and equipment and a reduction in prepaid assets, partially
offset by an increase in cash from the Company’s recent capital raise and an increase in
accounts receivable resulting from the Company’s performance under its take-or-pay
supply contract. Total liabilities were $25,102,651 at June 30, 2016, compared to
$24,057,762 at December 31, 2015. The increase in liabilities was driven primarily by the
increase in the outstanding balances of the Series 2023 and Series A PIK Notes.
