<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 
21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Luxembourg was held at the 8th meeting, on 
24 January. The delegation of Luxembourg was headed by Nicolas Schmit, Minister of 
Labour, Employment and Immigration. At its 13th meeting, held on 29 January 2013, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Luxembourg. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Luxembourg: Japan, Peru and Romania. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Luxembourg: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation given in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/LUX/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/LUX/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/LUX/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland was transmitted to Luxembourg 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation recalled that Luxembourg had always attached particular importance 
to the universal periodic review mechanism, which helped to strengthen the promotion and 
protection of human rights worldwide. Luxembourg especially welcomed the fact that the 
universal periodic review allowed an open and critical exchange of views on the human 
rights situation in each country. The country had spared no effort in the implementation and 
follow-up of the recommendations made during the first cycle.1 
</p>
<p>6. As a staunch defender of multilateralism with the United Nations at its core, 
Luxembourg wished to contribute fully to the mutual strengthening of the three main pillars 
of the Organization: peace and security, development and human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. Luxembourg had had a non-permanent seat on the Security Council since 1 January 
</p><p>2013. In that capacity, it was committed to contributing actively over the next two years to 
the work of the Security Council, carrying out the main task entrusted to it by the Member 
States under the United Nations Charter: to maintain international peace and security. In 
that regard, Luxembourg remained convinced that there could be neither development 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b>4</b> GE.13-12572 
</p>
<p>without security nor security without development, and that respect for human rights and 
the upholding of the rule of law were essential. 
</p>
<p>8. For its international commitment to be credible, Luxembourg was aware that its 
actions at the national level must demonstrate the same commitment to promoting and 
protecting human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>9. It was in that spirit that Luxembourg had prepared for its universal periodic review. 
The national report was the result of widespread consultation with both the relevant 
authorities and civil society. To that end, in May 2012 Luxembourg had organized two 
consultation meetings on the second cycle of the universal periodic review. The first 
meeting had been aimed at non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society, 
while the second had addressed independent institutions with competence in the area of 
human rights. The Government had paid particular attention to their views in its report. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was available to continue that dialogue. The Ministry 
encouraged the participants to submit their comments on the implementation of the 
recommendations made during the current universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>10. Luxembourg planned to submit a midterm report during the current cycle. The 
comments received from civil society and independent institutions would be useful in the 
preparation of that report. 
</p>
<p>11. The national report of Luxembourg described in detail the progress made on the 
basis of the recommendations issued in 2008. Luxembourg noted the quality of the 
questions submitted in advance by a number of Member States and thanked them for their 
commitment to the work of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>12. In response to the question on avoiding the risk of sexual exploitation of refugee 
children or unaccompanied applicants for international protection, the delegation pointed 
out that their protection was ensured through the appointment of guardians. As a general 
rule, in the absence of a member of the minor&#8217;s extended family in Luxembourg who could 
act as guardian, a juvenile judge appointed one from the social and educational 
professionals at two NGOs that worked with asylum cases. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to measures taken to protect the bond between mothers in prison and 
their children born before or during their incarceration, the delegation indicated that the 
judge could decide that the child should be kept in prison with the mother up to a specific 
age, established on a case-by-case basis, beyond which the child&#8217;s normal psychological 
development would be compromised. The Ministry of Family Affairs had care institutions 
for children of all ages where judges could place the children of incarcerated mothers. The 
caregivers at those institutions could accompany children on visits to prison. The courts 
used all possible means to avoid imprisoning women who were pregnant or had young 
children. 
</p>
<p>14. In response to another question, the delegation said that the age requirement of 25 
was a general condition in order to receive the minimum guaranteed income and did not 
apply to refugees in particular. Under the law, an exception was made for persons under the 
age of 25 who were bringing up a child for whom they received family allowances. 
</p>
<p>15. Luxembourg had submitted its outstanding reports to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination in December 2012. As for the other three outstanding 
reports, it had undertaken to submit them to the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee against Torture as soon as 
possible. The work on the report to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
would also serve to given a new impetus to ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which would be concluded as soon as 
possible. </p>


<p>GE.13-12572 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>16. With regard to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, there were significant legal obstacles 
related to the remit of the European Union in the area of migrant workers. The Council of 
the European Union was competent to issue rules governing immigration and the protection 
of the rights of persons from third countries, including conditions for residence. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to the third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the relevant legislative procedure could start in 2013 and the vote in the parliament 
and depositing of the instruments could take place in late 2013 or early 2014. 
</p>
<p>18. As for the protection of the human rights of asylum seekers and non-refoulement, 
Luxembourg had ratified the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
applied the principle of non-refoulement established in article 33. In addition, the country&#8217;s 
law on the right to asylum and other forms of protection in fact provided that applicants for 
international protection were obliged to remain in the country. The law provided for 
exceptions so that, in compliance with international obligations, applicants could be sent or 
extradited to another member State of the European Union, a third country or an 
international criminal court or tribunal. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to bills concerning the amendment of the legal age for marriage, the 
abolition of the waiting period for remarriage in the event of divorce or widowhood and 
same-sex marriage, the Council of State had just issued its opinions and the texts were 
being discussed in the Legal Affairs Commission of the Chamber of Deputies. 
</p>
<p>20. The national report focused on the difficulties mentioned and criticism expressed by 
international expert bodies and civil society. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to freedom of religion or belief, a report by a group of experts on the 
development of relations between the State and cultural or philosophical communities had 
been published on 4 October 2012. Interested parties had been invited to submit their 
contributions to stimulate a major public debate in the coming weeks. The parties 
concerned included regulated and unregulated cultural communities as well as lay, 
secularist, humanist, agnostic and philosophical associations. 
</p>
<p>22. In the past, issues had been raised regarding the conditions in which foreigners could 
be detained at closed facilities when they were subject to removal orders or decisions 
denying them entry to the country. Various measures had been taken to remedy that 
situation. Firstly, the main aim was clearly to encourage voluntary return before anyone 
was placed in detention. A detention centre had become operational in September 2011. 
Since it had opened, only 444 persons had been placed there, whereas 2,078 persons had 
returned voluntarily to their countries of origin in 2011 and 2012. On average, the 444 
persons held at the centre since September 2011 had been detained for 28 days, but the 
legislation governing the detention centre stipulated that families with children could not be 
kept at the centre for more than 72 hours. Only 17 persons &#8212; 3.9 per cent &#8212; had been 
detained at the centre for 4 months or more.  
</p>
<p>23. House arrest had been introduced as an alternative to detention in 2011. 
</p>
<p>24. Another issue was the situation of undocumented residents who were employed in 
Luxembourg. In that regard, an exceptional, one-off measure had been taken to regularize 
their situation. Undocumented citizens of third countries residing in Luxembourg could in 
certain circumstances obtain residence permits as employed workers. The measure in 
question had been adopted along with changes to the law governing the free movement of 
persons and immigration. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to cooperation with the United Nations, Luxembourg was currently 
doing everything possible to ratify the legal instruments it had signed. Accordingly, since 
the previous review it had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.13-12572 
</p>
<p>and its Optional Protocol, as well as the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. Ratification procedures were also under way for the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>26. In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had deposited the instruments of 
ratification of the amendments made to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court by the Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held in Kampala. Luxembourg had 
demonstrated its strong commitment to fighting impunity by becoming the fourth State to 
ratify all of the amendments made to the Rome Statute by the Review Conference. All of 
those provisions had already been incorporated into domestic criminal law. Luxembourg 
hoped that its ratification of those amendments would encourage other States parties to 
rapidly follow suit. 
</p>
<p>27. Some 44 per cent of the country&#8217;s total population of approximately 525,000 were 
foreigners, and some 160,000 frontier workers crossed the border every day. Nationals of 
more than 170 countries lived in Luxembourg. Luxembourg recognized that such diversity 
was a challenge, but it was also a vital source of cultural enrichment. Over the last few 
decades, Luxembourg had become a State in which people from all over the world lived 
together. Manifestations of intolerance or racism were rare. 
</p>
<p>28. A significant step aimed at facilitating integration into the national community was 
the introduction of dual nationality in 2008. Dual nationality allowed persons who had 
decided to settle permanently in Luxembourg to acquire the country&#8217;s citizenship and to 
demonstrate their attachment to it and willingness to integrate, while at the same time 
maintaining a link with their country and culture of origin by keeping their original 
nationality. 
</p>
<p>29. Efforts to promote equality between men and women and to combat gender 
discrimination were bearing fruit: the participation rate of women in political office and in 
the labour market was constantly increasing, while the wage gap between men and women 
was decreasing. 
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, Luxembourg was resolutely pursuing its international commitment to 
human rights and the link between human rights and development cooperation by allocating 
1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance, despite the 
financial constraints it currently faced. That effort contributed to the effective enjoyment of 
human rights in developing countries, particularly in the area of economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>31. Like all other United Nations Member States, Luxembourg was not above criticism, 
and its international commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights did not 
obviate the need for it to make the same efforts at home that it expected of others. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the interactive dialogue, 61 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>33. Turkey noted the significant advances that Luxembourg had made through the 
introduction of the new Law on Nationality. Government initiatives to discuss religious 
pluralism and secularization were also commendable. It considered that the same right 
granted to European Union nationals who had resided in Luxembourg for at least five years 
to participate in regional elections should be extended to all foreign nationals. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.13-12572 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>34. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged 
Luxembourg to continue exploring measures to incorporate non-national residents into its 
national parliamentary process, including by considering the feasibility of enabling non-
Luxembourg nationals to vote. The United Kingdom was encouraged by the ongoing 
review of legislation relating to domestic violence and measures to combat social exclusion 
among the poorest in society. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. The United States of America expressed concern that both Schrassig prison and the 
State Socio-Educational Centre for Juveniles at Dreiborn operated continuously at or near 
full capacity. It commended Luxembourg for its campaign to promote gender equality, 
noticing, however, that, although there was de jure equal pay, reports indicated that women 
were paid less than men for the same work. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Uruguay highlighted the ongoing progress of Luxembourg in the fields of gender 
equality, equal distribution of family responsibilities and trafficking in persons. It noted

child prostitution. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Viet Nam noted the significant progress that Luxembourg had made in recent years 
in respect of the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms, and cooperation with other 
countries and international human rights mechanisms. Its follow-up to and implementation

Luxembourg of the interdependence among development, security and human rights. Viet 
Nam made a recommendation. 
</p>

made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>41. Bangladesh appreciated the various actions to promote and protect human rights and 
commended the country for action taken to sensitize children to peace and different aspects 
of poverty. It was concerned at the decrease of developmental assistance and noted that the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had expressed 
concerns about the family-reunification procedure. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Belarus stated that the various reservations of Luxembourg to certain international 
agreements limited their implementation in national legislation. No special-procedures 
visits to the country had been organized. It noted the problems related to the deportation of 
asylum seekers and an increase in the demand for child pornography and prostitution, as 
well as in domestic violence and discrimination in the labour market. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-12572 
</p>
<p>43. Bhutan commended the numerous activities carried out to protect and promote 
human rights, including the rights of the child and of persons with disabilities, and to

number of delegations, particularly with regard to combating sexual abuse, child </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-12572 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography. Luxembourg called for cooperation in fighting against 
international crime rings. At the domestic level, the delegation recalled that Luxembourg 
had ratified the main international instruments and that its legislation provided for harsh 
penalties for such offences. 
</p>
<p>64. With regard to implementation measures to combat trafficking in persons, the 
delegation referred to the three relevant acts adopted in 2009 and 2012. The Criminal Code 
provided for extremely harsh penalties in that area. 
</p>
<p>65. Luxembourg would maintain its efforts in the area of official development 
assistance, despite budgetary constraints. The delegation also called on the international 
community to strengthen its efforts to increase official development assistance to 0.7 or 1 
per cent of gross domestic income, recalling that such a step was required to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>66. In response to the questions on the acceptance rate for asylum applications, the 
delegation explained that over the past 18 months the country had received an exceptionally 
large number of applications from citizens of European countries not considered to be at 
risk. Leaving aside that influx, the acceptance rate for asylum applications was generally 
above the European average. 
</p>
<p>67. As for refugee resettlement programmes, the delegation recalled the country&#8217;s 
previous experience in that area and also reported that it intended to carry out new projects 
in 2013 in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees and other European countries. 
</p>
<p>68. Admittedly, there had been delays in the submission of some reports to the treaty 
bodies. Luxembourg undertook to take the steps required to submit its reports on time in the 
future. 
</p>
<p>69. In response to a question on the possibility of visits by Special Rapporteurs to 
Luxembourg, the delegation recalled that all the thematic Special Rapporteurs had a 
standing invitation and that any who wished to visit Luxembourg would be welcome. 
</p>
<p>70. In response to questions on discrimination against women in the labour market, the 
delegation recalled that the domestic law prohibited any difference in pay between men and 
women. Enforcement of that measure was a priority for the country&#8217;s authorities. 
</p>
<p>71. With regard to the rights of persons with disabilities and their access to the labour 
market, the delegation pointed out that companies and government bodies were subject to a 
5 per cent quota. Unfortunately, that target had not yet been met, but a series of initiatives 
would be taken in 2013 in order to achieve it. 
</p>
<p>72. In response to a question on access to a lawyer in the event of arrest, the delegation 
explained that all persons who were arrested had the right to the assistance of a lawyer. The 
bar association ran a 24-hour on-call service for that purpose. 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to financial assistance provided to asylum seekers, the delegation 
explained that asylum seekers were fully provided for by the State. They received 
accommodation and had access to health services, and the children were integrated into the 
national school system. The financial assistance provided directly to refugees had recently 
been brought in line with the amounts provided by neighbouring countries. 
</p>
<p>74. In the area of marriage, the relevant legislation was currently being amended in 
order to ensure perfect equality between men and women, notably by abolishing the waiting 
period for remarriage following divorce or widowhood. The Government was also 
considering the possibility of allowing same-sex marriage. </p>


<p>GE.13-12572 <b>11
