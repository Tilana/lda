<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Albania from 15 to 23 February 2010. The cooperation I received at all 
levels from the Government of Albania during my nine-day trip to Tirana, the region of 
Shkodra and Fush&#235; Kruj&#235; was exemplary. I also met with international officials, 
representatives of domestic and international civil society, academics, witnesses and a 
significant number of families involved in blood feuds. I am grateful to the United Nations 
officials who facilitated my mission and provided support. 
</p>
<p>2. In terms of both economic and social development and respect for human rights and 
the rule of law, Albania has achieved an enormous amount in a very short period of time. 
These impressive achievements will clearly serve it well as it proceeds on the path towards 
candidacy for European Union membership. During my mission, I focused particularly on 
blood feuds and domestic violence, as well as on issues of accountability in relation to other 
alleged killings. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>3. A major objective of my mission was to clarify the situation relating to blood feuds. 
Policies and programmes can only work if based on an accurate and well-rounded 
understanding of the problem. Unfortunately, the statistics on those killed and families 
isolated vary widely from one source to another. Various factors have combined to create 
considerable confusion and misunderstanding. They include terminological imprecision; 
sensationalist media coverage, especially by the international press; international donor 
fascination with an exotic remnant from a feudal era; civil society incentives to be overly 
inclusive in their counting; and Government hypersensitivity and an understandable 
concern to play down the issue. 
</p>
<p>4. In a nutshell, the numbers of blood feud killings in Albania has decreased steadily 
over the past five years, but the phenomenon has not been entirely eliminated. Moreover, its 
broader implications continue to have a corrosive effect on society. The most important 
problems are significant self-isolation by families fearing a revenge killing, and a continued 
belief in the legitimacy of the collective punishment of a wrongdoer&#8217;s family members, 
even when they are completely innocent in the matter. By the same token, exaggeration of 
the magnitude of the problem can significantly hinder reform endeavours. 
</p>
<p><b> A. What is a blood feud? 
</b></p>
<p>5. A blood feud generally begins with an argument, usually between two men whose 
families are neighbours or friends. The argument may have any cause: an accident, a 
perceived insult, a property ownership disagreement, a conflict over access to electricity, 
water or fuel, and so on. The argument escalates into a physical fight, and one man kills the 
other. The victim&#8217;s family then feels that it is &#8220;owed blood&#8221; by the killer&#8217;s family. This debt 
and the related loss of honour can only be satisfied by taking the life of a member of the 
killer&#8217;s family. 
</p>
<p>6. The situation is governed by culturally understood rules, generally derived from the 
<i>kanun</i>, as codified by Lek&#235; Dukagjini in the fifteenth century and updated in the first half of 
the twentieth century by Shtjefen Gje&#231;ov. Despite the importance of these codification 
efforts, the <i>kanun</i> is largely a set of orally transmitted customary rules, the content of which 
differs from region to region and over time. The shared understanding is that the killer&#8217;s 
family is implicated by his act, thus entitling the victim&#8217;s family to take revenge against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-13494 
</p>
<p>them. Generally, it is not permitted to kill a family member in his own home or to kill 
women or children. Thus, when a killing occurs, the male members of the killer&#8217;s family 
immediately &#8220;self-isolate&#8221; and do not leave their home. This self-isolation is maintained 
even where there are no specific threats or assault attempts by the other family. The isolated 
family presumes that an attack is possible, unless the other family offers them a <i>besa </i>(an 
often limited or temporary reprieve from the threat of revenge). They often also feel that, in 
the absence of a <i>besa</i>, honour requires them to remain isolated, even where there has been 
no concrete threat. 
</p>
<p>7. The blood feud continues until the lost blood is avenged, or until the family of the 
deceased man forgives the killer&#8217;s family. When it occurs, forgiveness generally follows 
lengthy mediation, and is formalized in a reconciliation ceremony. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The disputed extent of blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>8. There are deep discrepancies in the statistics concerning blood feuds and related 
killings. At one extreme, media reports have referred to hundreds of blood feud killings per 
year and thousands of children living in isolation. At the other extreme, according to 
Government statistics, such killings fell steadily from 45 in 1998 to one in 2009, while the 
number of isolated children ranges from 36 to 57 countrywide, of which 29 to 45 are in 
Shkodra. The variation depended on whether the sources were police, education or ministry 
officials. Families in isolation were estimated to be from 124 and 133 countrywide. 
</p>
<p>9. The figures used by civil society groups also vary widely. One organization with 
extensive field operations notes that there have been significant reductions over the last five 
years and that there are currently only a few blood feud killings per year. They estimate not 
more than 350 families and between 80 and 100 children to be in isolation nationally. 
However, another prominent organization estimates some 9,800 blood feud killings since 
1991, dropping to a figure still in excess of 30 in 2009. By its calculations, there are 1,450 
families and 800 children in isolation. 
</p>
<p>10. My own carefully considered view is that the correct numbers are much closer to 
those provided by the Government, especially in relation to killings. The figures for 
isolation seem more likely to be an underestimation, but again, not by a large margin. This 
is not to say that the Government statistics are definitive. Their accuracy is qualified by 
inadequate data-gathering and recording techniques, and insufficient coordination. These 
problems were underscored by the inconsistency of various official figures provided to me. 
I am also not aware of any sustained Government effort to reconcile the competing 
statistics. 
</p>
<p>11. Four factors account for the discrepancies among the various figures: definitional 
differences: underreporting; limited coverage of issues; and incentives to overstate. 
</p>
<p>12. In terms of definitions, different actors tend to use different meanings of the term 
&#8220;blood feud&#8221; and of &#8220;blood feud killings&#8221;. The narrowest (&#8220;traditional&#8221;) understanding is 
that a blood feud killing is a premeditated familial avenging of lost blood &#8211; that is, where 
the family of a murdered victim kills a member of the perpetrator&#8217;s family to restore the 
honour and blood lost as a result of the initial murder. A less strict interpretation classifies 
any revenge killing between families as a blood feud regardless of any reference to the need 
to restore blood and honour or of guidance by any <i>kanun</i>-related considerations. Both of 
these understandings are reflected in most police and court statistics, especially since it is 
difficult to prove any specific cultural motivation for a killing. In broader definitions, any 
premeditated murder motivated by any reason of revenge (<i>hakmarrja</i>) between families 
could be a blood feud killing (<i>gjakmarrja</i>). In still broader understandings, even a revenge 
killing without a familial dimension (e.g. killings between gangs) could be counted as blood </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13494 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>feud killings. Because both &#8220;blood feud&#8221; and &#8220;revenge&#8221; are included within the same 
section of the Criminal Code, some official statistics do not distinguish between the two. 
The broadest and most questionable definition would count any killing because it may, at 
some point, lead the victim&#8217;s family to seek revenge against the perpetrator&#8217;s family. An 
equally questionable approach is to count among families characterized as self-isolated 
&#8220;due to blood feud&#8221; cases in which no killing had occurred and without any strong or 
formal element of self-isolation, but where a physical assault, a threat or some intense 
dispute had created a family or neighbourly feud. 
</p>
<p>13. A second factor is underreporting. Killings in remote areas might not be 
systematically reported. Moreover, in some instances, the families might want to avoid all 
State involvement in order to pursue traditional remedies. In addition, statistics based on 
court judgements may be a poor indicator of blood feud killings because the perpetrator of a 
premeditated blood feud killing may be found guilty of a lesser charge, whether because of 
insufficient evidence, a family refusal to testify or corruption leading to a conviction for a 
lesser offence. 
</p>
<p>14. Thirdly, the coverage of Government programmes may be incomplete. For example, 
Government figures on children in isolation are based on its &#8220;Second Chance&#8221; home-
schooling programme, which goes only through ninth grade. Older children are thus not 
covered. Similarly, a combined focus on those killed and the number of self-isolated 
children will go only part of the way towards capturing the overall number of people whose 
lives are seriously affected by blood feuds. 
</p>
<p>15. A fourth factor is the existence of incentives for some groups to overstate the 
magnitude of the problem in order to get funding. While various non-governmental 
organizations do extremely good work on these issues, many officials and independent 
observers expressed concern that a small number of groups deliberately exaggerate for 
fund-raising purposes. International donors do not help the situation when they provide 
funding for blood feud-related programmes without adequate scrutiny. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The causes of blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>16. Commentators attribute the revival of the blood feud to various causes, including the 
post-communist era breakdown of the State, failings in the criminal justice system, 
unresolved property disputes and educational failings. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The criminal justice system 
</b>17. The blood feud phenomenon re-emerged at the end of the communist era and 
increased significantly with the 1997 breakdown in law and order. The absence of effective 
official responses to criminality encouraged the citizenry to revert to traditional 
mechanisms to obtain justice. Suggestions that the criminal justice system is still so 
inefficient and corrupt as to necessitate continuing resort to blood feuds to achieve justice 
appear, however, misplaced. While the justice system does suffer from serious weaknesses 
and considerable corruption, there is no evidence that a perceived law and order vacuum 
explains a continuing attachment to the practice of blood feuds. 
</p>
<p>18. A much more salient problem is that many families involved in blood feuds do not 
see the State&#8217;s criminal justice system as being capable of addressing their concerns, which 
centre around the loss of blood and honour caused by the initial killing. Sentencing a killer 
to prison fails to go to the essence of their conception of justice, which requires restoration 
of the lost blood through either a revenge killing or a voluntary formal reconciliation 
between the families. The actions of the State vis-&#224;-vis the perpetrator are thus irrelevant in 
the families&#8217; evaluation of whether there has been a &#8220;just&#8221; response to the original killing. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13494 
</p>
<p>19. On the other hand, the role of the State in relation to the family in isolation varies. 
For many such families, it is limited at best. Some believe that, in practical terms, there is 
little the State could do to protect them. Others think the State should do little because 
matters of honour and respect must be resolved privately rather than by the police. 
Moreover, many isolated families never receive a specific threat to which police could 
respond; they just believe that the lack of <i>besa </i>means they could be targeted at any time. 
There are, however, cases in which the State could play a more active protection role for 
the isolated family. Offers to monitor are sometimes made, but it is not clear how seriously 
they are followed up. Internal relocation has occurred, but a more systematic programme 
could be developed. Threats could be tracked more effectively and prosecuted far more 
often than has been the case to date. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Property 
</b></p>
<p>20. Property disputes, resulting in large part from the extensive, complex and ongoing 
land reform in Albania are widely acknowledged to be a major cause of blood feuds. This 
was amply confirmed by my investigations, yet neither the Government nor civil society 
has attempted to collect or analyse data on the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Education 
</b></p>
<p>21. Low educational levels, especially in the areas most affected by blood feuds, are also 
an important contributing factor to the decision to respond to killings by employing 
traditional means rather than by using the justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Government efforts to address blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>22. Important steps have been taken in the past five years to address blood feuds. The 
Criminal Code has been amended in important respects (minimum sentences and specific 
criminalization of blood feuds and blood feud killings), specialized police units have been 
created, a high-level coordination committee on blood feuds was established in 2005, and 
the &#8220;Second Chance&#8221; programme provides home schooling for isolated children. Much 
more, however, could and should be done. 
</p>
<p>23. Many interlocutors suggested that there is relatively little that the Government can 
do beyond its existing efforts to eliminate blood feuds and that community groups must do 
the rest themselves. I disagree. The Government has important additional work to do in 
research, community education and outreach. 
</p>
<p>24. In research terms, the deeper cultural underpinnings of the system require better 
understanding, which can be promoted through sustained interdisciplinary research. Such 
research would draw a more accurate picture of the challenges that need to be addressed. 
</p>
<p>25. Community education is important, not only through schooling and training, but also 
through broader community outreach. The latter task includes not just educating citizens 
about the formal justice system but also confronting the lingering notions that collective 
punishment is acceptable. Such notions are utterly incompatible with the assumptions upon 
which Albanian society now operates, and the Government should place a greater 
educational emphasis on the human rights of all individuals. An additional reason for 
greater State involvement is to educate families who, lacking knowledge of <i>kanun</i>, might 
turn for advice only to those civil society interlocutors who rely excessively upon the norms 
of the code in what the interlocutors characterize as a blood feud. While the resulting 
perpetuation of the <i>kanun</i> mentality is not deliberate, it may be an unintended consequence 
of the approach sometimes adopted. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13494 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>26. Finally, the Government could play a stronger role in outreach, especially in 
facilitating efforts to achieve family reconciliation, which thus far has been almost 
completely left to families themselves and civil society. A number of interlocutors informed 
me that they had approached the Government for assistance to end their self-isolation 
through reconciliation, but the State did little in response. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>27. In its report on domestic violence in Albania of March 2009, the country&#8217;s National 
Institute of Statistics reported that 31 per cent of women had experienced violence in the 
home. According to official figures, 15 women have been killed as a result of domestic 
violence in the last two years. These numbers are likely to be an undercount, owing to the 
limitations of Government statistics on the causes of deaths, underreporting by family 
members of &#8220;private&#8221; causes of violence and death, and the possibility of deaths occurring, 
especially in rural areas or informal settlements, without the State being notified. 
</p>
<p>28. The high levels of violence against women by family members, especially husbands, 
has received significant and much-needed attention in Albania in the past few years. The 
Government, with United Nations support, has taken a number of important steps, including 
designing the National Strategy on Gender Equality and Domestic Violence (2007&#8211;2010). 
With donor funding, many police, court and other officials have received domestic violence 
training. Special domestic violence police units have been established, and shelters have 
increasingly been supported. Education campaigns have been launched to begin to change 
the negative social attitudes leading to violence. In addition, civil society groups have been 
very active and extremely effective in their key role of mobilizing efforts by other societal 
actors. 
</p>
<p>29. These efforts have had a positive impact, including a dramatic increase in the 
number of women coming forward to report violence to police officials (from 
approximately 270 in 2007 to over 1,000 in 2009), in the number of protection orders, and 
in offenders prosecuted. Experts working in this area indicated that they have seen 
important changes across the board in officials&#8217; attitudes to domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>30. Domestic violence remains, however, a very large problem and much remains to be 
done, especially with respect to Government budgeting for its programmes. Most financing 
comes from donors. While Albania has 13 shelters for abused women and their children, 
only 4 receive Government funding. A new shelter in Tirana, refurbished by the United 
Nations Development Programme, has Government support but no clear agreed budget 
allocation. During my visit, I was assured by the Government that its funding for this 
shelter, as well as other programmes, would be forthcoming. Despite the Government&#8217;s 
specific assurances, no progress has been made in the funding of the shelter since my visit, 
and this continues to be a matter of real concern. As a matter of high priority, the 
Government should follow through on its commitment to adequately fund the urgently 
needed shelter. 
</p>
<p>31. Gender violence experts reported to me that, while many police have shown an 
increased willingness to assist women, they have not always been provided with the 
knowledge, resources or institutional support to do so more effectively. In some cases, the 
matter is as simple as providing police with the referral details of shelters and psychosocial 
support. Media coverage of domestic violence issues has often been irresponsible and, in 
some cases, extremely harmful to the safety of women.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13494 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Disappearances and killings after the Kosovo war 
</b></p>
<p>32. For a number of years, allegations have been made that a few hundred people were 
taken across the Kosovo-Albania border after June 1999 by the Kosovo Liberation Army 
(KLA). Allegedly, prisoners were held in KLA camps in Albania, some were tortured or 
killed, while others were victims of organ trafficking. Initial investigations were undertaken 
in 2004 by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
former Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>33. Subsequent attempts to investigate have been made by various entities, including by 
the Council of Europe, the Serbian war crimes prosecutor, and the European Union Rule of 
Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX). The Albanian authorities told me their strong belief that 
allegations are politically motivated and absolutely without any foundation. On this basis, 
none of the efforts to investigate have received meaningful cooperation from the 
Government of Albania. While various explanations were offered to me, they amounted in 
practice to a game of bureaucratic and diplomatic ping-pong in which the responsibility for 
not responding to requests for cooperation was moved from one office to the next, with 
each insisting that, if requested by the right authorities and under the proper conditions, 
they would not hesitate to cooperate. The bottom line appeared to be, however, that the 
issue is definitively stalled. 
</p>
<p>34. Following my visit, in March 2010, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that 
Albania was willing to cooperate fully and transparently with investigations into the 
allegations of abuse and killings. This commitment is a positive step, and I will continue to 
monitor its implementation. 
</p>
<p>35. In May 2010, after my mission, the European Union Rule of Law Mission in 
Kosovo arrested a former KLA commander suspected of torturing and mistreating prisoners 
at an illegal KLA detention facility in northern Albania. The arrest by EULEX is a very 
important step forward in ending impunity. It also underscores further the need for the 
Government of Albania to cooperate fully and meaningfully with EULEX and the other 
independent investigators into all allegations of abuse and killings by the KLA or other 
actors in Albanian territory. 
</p>
<p><b> V. G&#235;rdec 
</b>36. The prosecution of those responsible for the lives lost, injuries suffered and property 
destroyed by the explosion at G&#235;rdec in March 2008 is clearly an issue of major 
significance. It is also an issue that is heavily weighted with political implications into 
which I do not wish to enter. My concern is whether the G&#235;rdec deaths have been 
meaningfully investigated and are being effectively prosecuted. All necessary efforts should 
be made by the Office of the Prosecutor General to ensure that justice is both done and seen 
to be done and that, where necessary, requests for the lifting of immunities are made. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Communist-era human rights abuses 
</b>37. Twenty years after the fall of communism, Albania has not dealt comprehensively 
with the killings and other human rights abuses committed during those years. It is widely 
acknowledged that thousands of Albanians were tortured, executed and made to disappear 
by the State, but many victims&#8217; families are unable to learn their loved ones&#8217; fate, and the 
details of the regime&#8217;s abuses have not been accounted for. This is in large part because 
Albania is one of the few former Iron Curtain countries not to have opened the archives of 
its communist-era security services. The small number of prosecutions undertaken in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13494 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>1990s for a specific set of crimes against humanity is no substitute for the broader 
accounting required. 
</p>
<p>38. Until a full accounting is achieved, the Government will not have met its 
international legal obligations to investigate, prosecute and punish abuses. It may also leave 
the country hostage to its past when the rights violations of former officials are not openly 
acknowledged and resolved through judicial mechanisms. When violations are large-scale 
and still politically charged, as is the case in Albania, justice may be best achieved through 
a national commission that could conduct an independent, systematic and sustained 
investigation of communist-era abuses. The Government has instead recently opted to 
establish an institute to study abuses during the communist era, and a task force to uncover 
mass graves from that period of history. I was assured by the Prime Minister that the 
institute will have full access to secret service and all other Government files from that 
time. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. The criminal justice system 
</b>39. A number of interlocutors raised concerns about the impact of corruption in the 
justice system on charges and sentencing for blood feud-related killings. There is at least 
the perception &#8212; widely held &#8212; that bribing a judge may result in a lower sentence. 
Bribing a prosecutor was also seen as a means of reducing the potential charge from that for 
blood feuds, which carries a 20-year minimum sentence, to one that carried a lesser 
sentence. These concerns highlight the need for judicial probity to maintain the ability of 
the justice system to prosecute and punish killings effectively. They also underscore the 
necessity of anti-corruption and oversight measures.  
</p>
<p>40. Interlocutors also raised concerns about the treatment of the constitutional immunity 
of ministers and judges in the Criminal Procedure Code. According to the Code, the 
immunity attaches from the earliest stage of investigation, rather than at the point of charge 
or arrest. This inhibits the ability of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to undertake sensitive 
investigations.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Constitutional Court is a vital component in upholding the rule of law in 
Albania. Two thirds of the judges are due to be replaced by the President in the near future, 
with the consent of the Assembly, when their terms expire. In any such situation, a 
Government runs the risk of being seen to use the opportunity to significantly alter the 
composition of the court in its own favour. It is therefore important for the Government to 
demonstrate that the replacement process is governed by procedures that are both, and can 
be seen to be, fair. It is desirable for the Government to commit itself, in all judicial 
appointments, to transparent procedures formulated to ensure a qualified and independent 
judiciary, and to reflect those procedures in legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Interim conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>While blood feud killings will soon be largely a thing of the past, a belief in the

analysis, using uniform and meaningful definitions, of the blood feud phenomenon 
and its prevalence and manifestation in Albanian society; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Encouraging sustained interdisciplinary research on the issue of blood 
feuds, including its root causes and means of ending both killings and self-isolation, 
perhaps entrusted to a new national institute of criminology; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Consulting the leading scholars and the leaders of the relevant religious 
groups in order to determine how best the Government might: (i) conduct outreach to 
end self-isolation of families in blood feuds; (ii) facilitate more effective forms of 
reconciliation by community leaders of stature; and (iii) ensure mediators have no 
potential conflict of interest of any kind in the issue; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensuring that educational curricula at all levels include an emphasis on 
individual human rights and specifically rebut the contrary message sent by the 
relevant part of the <i>kanun</i>. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>International donors should be more discerning in their funding programmes, 
and should be as concerned about broader issues of violence and problematic 
traditions of collective punishment as they are about the exotic notion of blood feud 
killings. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Government has made significant progress in designing and implementing 
strategies to address high levels of domestic violence. It is important that the 
Government follow through on assurances that programmes and shelters will be 
allocated Government funding. Programme will need to continue to be supported and 
developed through the long term, to erode the deep-seated patriarchal views leading 
to violence, and to increase access to justice for victims. The media should be more 
responsible in its coverage of domestic violence issues.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Disappearances and killings after the Kosovo war 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>Given the strength of the belief, at the highest levels, that allegations of 
hundreds of people killed in Albania after June 1999 are unfounded, it would be in the 
Government&#8217;s best interest to facilitate an independent and objective investigation by 
one or other of the international entities currently focused on the issue.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. G&#235;rdec 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The Prosecutor General should ensure that the events leading to the G&#235;rdec 
explosion are fully investigated, all responsible parties prosecuted and that, where 
necessary, requests for the lifting of immunities are made. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13494 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Communist-era abuses 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>The Government should consider establishing a national commission to 
conduct an independent, systematic and sustained investigation of communist-era 
abuses. In the interim, the Government should ensure that the proposed institute for 
the study of communist-era abuses is given comprehensive access to every available 
source of information about that era and is able to make effective use of its power to 
refer specific cases to the Prosecutor General for consideration.  
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Justice system and anti-corruption reforms 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The Government should legislate criteria and procedures to ensure the high 
professionalism, independence and integrity of judges, especially in relation to the 
Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The Government should amend the Criminal Procedure Code to enable the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to commence investigations of high officials, including ministers 
and judges, without first having to have their immunity lifted. The question of lifting 
immunity need only be addressed in the event that the Prosecutor has enough 
evidence to bring charges. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The Government should develop the capacity and expertise of its statisticians 
and analysts at the National Institute of Statistics and in the relevant ministries to 
collect, analyse and report on criminal justice-related data in accordance with 
internationally accepted standards, to ensure the ability of all actors to make sound 
policy decisions.
