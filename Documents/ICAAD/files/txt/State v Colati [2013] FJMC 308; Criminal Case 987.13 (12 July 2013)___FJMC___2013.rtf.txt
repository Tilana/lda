The Tariffs 

I draw my attention to the recent Judgment Sulua v State [2012] FJCA 33; AAU0093.2008 (31 May 2012).

Their Lordships have analyzed 50 cases prosecutions for "possession of cannabis" contrary to section 5 (a) of the Illicit Drugs Control Act 2004 to assist to draw up a Sentencing guideline proposing the following four categories; as follows:

"(i) Category 1: Possession of 0 to 100 grams of cannabis sativa  a non custodial sentence to be given, for example, fines, community service, counseling, discharge with a strong warning, etc. Only in the worst cases, should a suspended prison sentence or a short sharp prison sentence be considered.

(ii) Category 2: Possession of 100  1000 grams of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be a sentence between 1 to 3 years imprisonment, with hose possessing below 500 grams, being sentenced to less than 2 years, and those possessing more than 500 grams, be sentenced to more than 2 years imprisonment.

(iii) Category 3: Possessing 1,000 to 4,000 grams of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be a sentence between 3 to 7 years, with those possessing less than 2,500 grams, be sentenced to less than 4 years imprisonment, and those possessing more than 2,500 grams, be sentenced to more than 4 years.

(iv) Category 4: Possessing 4,000 grams and above of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be a sentence between 7 to 14 years imprisonment.

Consequently, the four categories mentioned above, apply to each of the verbs mentioned in section 5 (a) of the 2004 Act mentioned above. The weight of the particular illicit drug will determine which category the case falls under, and the applicable penalty that will apply".

5.      
Sentence

I now proceed to consider appropriate sentences on you upon considering the general principle of sentencing under Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and objective of sentencing under section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
