FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Certain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute
“forward-looking statements.”  The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,”
“foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-
looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature.  These forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effect on us.  While management believes that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future
developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate.  All comments concerning our
expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing
operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions.  Our forward-looking
statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and
assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and
our present expectations or projections.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those
summarized below: 
failure to secure or maintain contracts with our largest customers, or non-performance of any of
those customers under the applicable contract;
•competitive conditions in our industry;
•
•
•
•
•the amount of frac sand we are able to excavate and process, which could be adversely affected
by, among other things, operating difficulties and unusual or unfavorable geologic conditions;
•the volume of frac sand we are able to sell;
•the price at which we are able to sell frac sand;
•changes in the long-term supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;
•volatility of fuel prices;
•unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions at our sand mines;
•actions taken by our customers, competitors and third-party operators;
•our ability to complete growth projects on time and on budget;
increasing costs and minimum contractual obligations relating to our transportation services and
infrastructure;
inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of
climate change;
•environmental hazards;
•industrial accidents;
changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and
hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;
•inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;
•facility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions;
•inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;
•reduction in the amount of water available for processing;
•technical difficulties or failures;
•labor disputes and disputes with our excavation contractor;
•late delivery of supplies;
•difficulty collecting receivables;
•inability of our customers to take delivery of our products;
•changes in the price and availability of transportation;
•fires, explosions or other accidents;
•pit wall failures or rock falls;
•the effects of future litigation; and
other factors discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the detailed factors discussed
under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the known material risk
factors and other cautionary statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 in “Risk Factors” and in this Form 10-Q in “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors.”  Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the
date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
1.              ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
Organization 
Emerge Energy Services LP (“Emerge”) is a Delaware limited partnership that completed its
initial public offering (“IPO”) on May 14, 2013 to become a publicly traded partnership.  The
combined entities of Superior Silica Sands LLC (“SSS”), a Texas limited liability company, Allied
Energy Company LLC (“AEC”), an Alabama limited liability company, and Emerge Energy
Services Operating LLC (“Emerge Operating”), a Delaware limited liability company, represent
the predecessor for accounting purposes (the “Predecessor”) of Emerge.  Emerge acquired
Direct Fuels LLC (“Direct Fuels”) in a business combination concurrent with the IPO on May 14,
2013,
References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us” when used for dates or periods ended prior to
the IPO, refer collectively to the Predecessor.  References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us”
when used for dates or periods ended on or after the IPO, refer collectively to Emerge and all of
its subsidiaries, including Direct Fuels.
We are a growth-oriented energy services company engaged in the business of mining,
producing, and distributing silica sand that is a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas
wells. The Sand business conducts mining and processing operations from facilities located in
Wisconsin and Texas.  In addition to mining and processing silica sand for the oil and gas
industry, the Sand business sells its product for use in building products and foundry operations. 
The Fuel business operates transmix processing facilities located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
and in Birmingham, Alabama.  The Fuel business also offers third-party bulk motor fuel storage
and terminal services, biodiesel refining, sale and distribution of wholesale motor fuels,
reclamation services (which consists primarily of cleaning bulk storage tanks used by other
petroleum terminal and others) and blending of renewable fuels. 
On August 31, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement,
dated August 31, 2016 (the “Restated Purchase Agreement”), with Susser Petroleum Operating
Company LLC and Sunoco LP (together, “Sunoco”). The Restated Purchase Agreement
amended and restated in its entirety the previously disclosed Purchase and Sale Agreement,
dated June 23, 2016, between the Partnership and Sunoco in connection with the closing of the
sale by Emerge to Sunoco of all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in our Fuel
business. Pursuant to the Restated Purchase Agreement, Sunoco paid Emerge a purchase price
of approximately $167.7 million in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments
in accordance with the terms of the Restated Purchase Agreement), of which $14.25 million is
placed into several escrow accounts to satisfy potential claims from Sunoco for indemnification
under the Restated Purchase Agreement. Any escrowed funds remaining after certain periods of
time set forth in the Restated Purchase Agreement will be released to Emerge, provided that no
unsatisfied indemnity claims exist at such time.
Accordingly, at March 31, 2016, the assets and liabilities of our fuel business were classified as
held for sale and the results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all
periods presented. We now operate our continuing business in a single sand segment. We report
silica sand activities as our continuing operations and fuel operations as our discontinued
operations. 
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using
generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions to
Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all
information or notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial
statements and should be read together with our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These
financial statements include the accounts of all of our subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements
have been included.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period
presentation. These reclassifications do not impact net income and do not reflect a material
change in the information previously presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

On August 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our Fuel business pursuant to the terms of the
Restated Purchase Agreement. The purchase price was $167.7 million, subject to adjustment
based on actual working capital conveyed at closing. The following escrow accounts were
established at closing:
$7 million of the sales price was withheld as a general escrow associated with certain
indemnification obligations. Any unutilized escrow balance, plus any accrued interest thereon,
will be paid 54 months from the closing date;
$4 million of the sales price was withheld as a hydrotreater escrow to satisfy any cost overruns
of the Birmingham hydrotreater completion. Any unutilized escrow balance, along with any
accrued interest thereon, will be paid 60 days after the substantial completion of the Birmingham
hydrotreater;
$2.25 million of the sales price was withheld as the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS") escrow
account. The unutilized RFS escrow will be released, along with any accrued interest thereon,
no later than four months from the closing date; and
$1 million of the sales price was withheld as a pipeline escrow account. Any unutilized escrow
balance, along with any accrued interest thereon, will be released with the general escrow.
The following table represents the estimated gain on sale from the Fuel business recognized in
the third quarter of 2016 (in thousands). These amounts will be adjusted as more information

3.              OTHER FINANCIAL DATA 
Assets held for sale
We consider assets to be held for sale when management commits to a formal plan to actively
market the assets for sale at a price reasonable in relation to fair value, the asset is available for
immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer and other actions
required to complete the sale have been initiated, the sale of the asset is expected to be
completed within one year and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan.
 Upon designation as held for sale, we record the carrying value of the assets at the lower of its
carrying value or its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, assets held for sale are not depreciated. We will periodically evaluate the
carrying value of our property, plant and equipment based upon the estimated cash flows to be
generated by the related assets. If impairment is indicated, a loss will be recognized.
Discontinued Operations
The results of discontinued operations are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of
ongoing operations for all periods presented. The expenses included in the results of
discontinued operations are the direct operating expenses incurred by the discontinued segment
that may be reasonably segregated from the costs of the ongoing operations of the Company.
The assets and liabilities have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The operating results related to these
lines of business have been included in discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for
further detail.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.6 million and $1.9 million at March 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.  Of these amounts, allowance for doubtful accounts for
continuing operations totaled $3.1 million and $1.4 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.

Contract and project terminations
In 2014 and 2015, we began development of sand processing facilities in Independence,
Wisconsin and other small projects in Ohio and Missouri.  Due to a number of complications,
such as an increase in projected operating costs and a decline in the market price and demand
for frac sand in early 2015, we determined that these projects were no longer economically
viable.  In 2015, we recorded a $9.3 million charge to earnings, of which $9.2 million related to
the Independence, Wisconsin facilities. This charge to earnings included items such as
engineering, legal and other professional service fees, site preparation costs, and writedowns of
assets to estimated net realizable value. 
Management committed to a plan to discontinue these projects in April 2015. In accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 420,
Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, any contract termination charges and estimated values of
continuing contractual obligations for which we will receive no future value will be recognized as
a charge to earnings as of the contract termination date or cease-use date. We estimated these
contract termination charges to be approximately $1.4 million. These liabilities will be reviewed
periodically and may be adjusted when necessary, but we do not expect any such adjustments to
be significant.
During the first quarter of 2016, we negotiated concessions on the majority of our railcar leases
pursuant to which we cancelled or deferred deliveries on rail cars and reduced cash payments
on a substantial portion of the existing rail cars in our fleets. In return for these concessions, we
incurred a contract termination charge of $4 million. We issued at par an Unsecured Promissory
Note in the aggregate principal amount of $4 million with interest payable in cash or, in certain
situations, in-kind, when certain financial metrics have been met. This note bears interest at a
rate of five percent per annum and is due and payable within 30 days

Mining and Wet Sand Processing Agreement
In April 2014, a five-year contract with a sand processor (“Processor”) became effective to
support our sand business in Wisconsin. Under this contract, the Processor financed and built a
wet wash processing plant near our Wisconsin operations. As part of the agreement, the
Processor wet washes our sand, creates stockpiles of washed sand and maintains the plant and
equipment. During the term of the agreement the Processor will own the wet plant along with the
equipment and other temporary structures used to support this activity. At the end of the five-year
term of the agreement or following a default under the contract by the Processor, we have the
right to take ownership of the wet plant and other equipment without charge. Subject to certain
conditions, ownership of the plant and equipment will transfer to us at the expiration of the term.
We accounted for the wet plant as a capital lease obligation. The original capitalized lease asset
and corresponding capital lease obligation totaled $3.3 million.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt instruments.  The carrying amounts
of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable are representative of their fair values due to their short maturities.  The carrying
amounts of our revolving credit facility approximates fair value because the underlying instrument
includes provisions that adjust our interest rates based on current market rates. 
Retirement Plan 
We sponsor a 401(k) plan for substantially all employees that provides for us to match 100% of
participant contributions up to 5% of the participant’s pay.  Additionally, we can make
discretionary contributions as deemed appropriate by management.  Our employer contributions
to these plans for continuing operations totaled $90 thousand and $170 thousand for the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We classified $54 thousand and $89
thousand to Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the three months ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As of July 1, 2016, we have suspended all employer
contributions to this plan.
Seasonality 
For our Sand business, winter weather affects the months during which we can wash and wet-
process sand in Wisconsin.  Seasonality is not a significant factor in determining our ability to
supply sand to our customers because we accumulate a stockpile of wet sand feedstock during
non-winter months.  During the winter, we process the stockpiled sand to meet customer
requirements.  However, we sell sand for use in oil and natural gas production basins where
severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities.  This is particularly true in drilling areas
located in the northern U.S. and western Canada.  If severe winter weather precludes drilling
activities, our frac sand sales volume may be adversely affected.  Generally, severe weather
episodes affect production in the first quarter with effects possibly continuing into the second
quarter. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
We provide credit, in the normal course of business, to customers located throughout the United
States and Canada.  We encounter a certain amount of credit risk as a result of a concentration of
receivables among a few significant customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers and generally do not require collateral.  The trade receivables (as a percentage of
total trade receivables) as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 from such significant
customers are set forth below:

revenues in Canada for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  All
other sales have occurred in the United States.

Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Long-Lived Assets
We believe the decrease in our common units’ market value is attributable primarily to our Sand
business’ decreasing profits and the frac sand industry’s downturn.  Therefore, we have
assessed the recoverability of long-lived assets for our Sand business, and determined that the
carrying values are recoverable from our forecasted cash flows as of March 31, 2016.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2014, August 2015 and May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2015-14, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, respectively,
as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. The new revenue recognition
standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is
recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires entities
to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to
understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017 with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2017 and shall be applied retrospectively to
each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are
evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going
Concern.  This ASU requires an entity to evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate,
raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from
the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new guidance is
effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but
do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities generated by contracts longer than a year on their
balance sheet. The ASU also requires companies to disclose in the footnotes to their financial
statements information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty for the payments they make for
the lease agreements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual periods and
interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted for all entities. We are evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting
guidance.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. This ASU affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their
employees. The ASU is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based

payment award transactions which include the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture
rate calculations.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies for annual periods and interim
periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted this ASU
as of January 1, 2016. As a result, we changed our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as
they occur. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

Following is a summary of our long-term debt: 
 
 
 
Revolving credit facility:

Total long-term debt
Revolving Credit Facility  
On June 27, 2014, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and security
agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) among Emerge Energy Services LP, as parent
guarantor, each of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), and PNC Bank, National
Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “agent”), and the lenders thereto.
The Credit Agreement matures on June 27, 2019 and, prior to giving effect to the amendments
described below, consisted of a $350 million revolving credit facility, which includes a sub-limit of
up to $30 million for letters of credit. Substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers are pledged
as collateral under the Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate equal to either, at our option, (i)
the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus 4.25% or (ii) a base rate, which will be the base
commercial lending rate of the agent, as publicly announced to be in effect from time to time, plus
3.25%. At March 31, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore
$ 301,261
$ 294,547
17
Table of Contents
interest at a weighted-average rate of 5.26%. We also incur a commitment fee of 0.375% on
committed amounts that are neither used for borrowings nor under letters of credit.
The Credit Agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions and requires
maintenance of certain financial covenants. For periods prior to June 30, 2018 or such earlier
time as our total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 3.50 to 1.00 as of
the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters (the “ratio compliance date”), we will be subject to
the following covenants and restrictions:
the $350 million total aggregate commitment under the Credit Agreement will be reduced in an
amount equal to the net proceeds of any notes offerings we may make in the future;
we will be required to maintain at least $25 million of excess availability (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) under the Credit Agreement; and
we will be required to generate consolidated EBITDA in certain minimum amounts beginning
with the quarter ending December 31, 2015 and rolling forward thereafter.
After the ratio compliance date, we will be required to maintain the following financial covenants
•
•
•
•
•
•
in lieu of the covenants and restrictions in place prior to the ratio compliance date: (i) an interest
coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) a total
leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of March
31, 2016, our total leverage ratio exceeded the threshold of 3.50 to 1.00.
In addition, the Credit Agreement places restrictions on our ability to commence certain other
actions, including:
our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us (to permit us to make distributions to
unitholders) if, after giving pro forma effect to such distribution, our total leverage ratio would be
greater than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00, or the excess availability under the Credit Agreement
would be less than the greater of $43.75 million or 12.5% of the total aggregate commitments;
our ability to enter into certain substantial acquisition or merger agreements with third-party
businesses or making certain other investments; and
our ability to make capital expenditures for growth and maintenance through March 31, 2019
above certain amounts per quarter.
On March 1, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement to permit us to
incur certain second lien obligations.
As of March 31, 2016, we had undrawn availability under the Credit Agreement totaling $23.6
million and, as a result, we were not in compliance with the financial covenant to maintain at
least $25 million of excess availability. In addition, we failed to generate sufficient consolidated
EBITDA for the period ended March 31, 2016 to satisfy the covenant under the Credit Agreement.
On April 20, 2016, we notified the agent of this event of default under the Credit Agreement and
began discussions with the agent to obtain a waiver regarding the event of default and to
otherwise arrive at a long-term solution to the Partnership’s liquidity requirements, including the
reduction of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement through the sale of our Fuel
business.
On May 20, 2016, we, the Borrowers, the lenders and the agent entered into Amendment No. 4 to
the Credit Agreement to permit the Partnership and the Borrowers to issue an unsecured
promissory note and warrants to one of our lessors in return for concessions and various long-
term leases. On May 20, 2016, we, the Borrowers, the lenders and the agent also entered into
Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5, among other things, provided a
limited waiver of the event of default under the Credit Agreement for failure to maintain financial
covenants as of March 31, 2016 and provided a period of covenant relief with respect to the
requirements to maintain $25 million of excess availability under the Credit Agreement or to
generate the minimum amounts of consolidated EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
The limited waiver and covenant relief provided in Amendment No. 5 continued until the earlier of
July 8, 2016 or the execution of a definitive agreement for the sale of our Fuel business (as
subsequently amended, the “Covenant Reversion Date”).
Prior to the Covenant Reversion Date, we were subject to the following covenants and
restrictions:
we were restricted from making dividends or distributions to our unitholders, and the Borrowers
were restricted from making dividends or distributions to us; and
we were restricted from making capital expenditures in our Sand business in excess of
$570,000 in the aggregate or from making capital expenditures in our Fuel business for
purposes other than completing installation of hydro treaters at the facilities.
In addition, Amendment No. 5 increased the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the
Credit Agreement to either, at our option, (i) LIBOR plus 5.00% or (ii) the base rate plus 4.00%
and also provided for the following revisions:
•
•
18
Table of Contents
•
•
•
the total aggregate commitment under the Credit Agreement was reduced from $350 million to
$325 million and the sublimit on letters of credit was reduced from $30 million to $20 million;
the dominion period (as defined in the Credit Agreement), whereby our and our subsidiaries’
cash receipts are swept on a daily basis and used to reduce outstanding borrowings, was
extended until the revolving credit facility matures; and
the threshold amounts for an event of default upon the occurrence of judicial actions, judgments
or cross defaults were decreased from $10 million to $5 million.
On May 27, 2016, June 10, 2016, June 15, 2016 and June 17, 2016, we, the Borrowers, the
lenders and the agent entered into Amendments No. 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively, to the Credit
Agreement to delay the onset of the Covenant Reversion Date while we negotiated a purchase
and sale agreement for the Fuel business. We reached a definitive agreement for the sale of the
Fuel business on June 23, 2016. On June 30, 2016, we, the Borrowers, the lenders and the
agent entered into Amendment No. 10 to the Credit Agreement for the purpose of further
extending the Covenant Reversion Date until the earlier of September 2, 2016 or the closing of
the sale of the Fuel business.
On August 31, 2016, we closed the sale of the Fuel business, used the net proceeds therefrom to
repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and entered into Amendment No. 11
to the Credit Agreement with the Borrowers, the lenders and the agent. Amendment No. 11,
among other things, restated the Credit Agreement and provided a full waiver for all defaults or
events of default arising out of our failure to comply with the financial covenant to generate
minimum amounts of adjusted EBITDA during the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016
and September 30, 2016 and the covenant to maintain the minimum amount of excess
availability for any date prior to September 1, 2016.
Pursuant to Amendment No. 11, the Credit Agreement now provides for a maximum $200 million
revolving credit facility with a $20 million sublimit on letters of credit, and requires the Partnership
to maintain the following financial covenants:
a covenant to maintain $20 million of excess availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement),
subject to decrease to $15 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions;
a covenant to limit capital expenditures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to certain maximum
amounts for each quarter through March 31, 2019;
beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2017, a covenant to generate consolidated EBITDA
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) in certain minimum amounts;
beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2018, a covenant to maintain an interest coverage
ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, which is scheduled to
increase to 3.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019; and
a covenant to raise at least $31.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of common
equity by November 30, 2016.
Following our entry into Amendment No. 11, we believe that we will be able to maintain
compliance with the covenants and restrictions under the Credit Agreement, as amended, for at
least the next 12 months.

estimated costs to transport leased railcars from the manufacturer to our site for initial
placement in service. During the first six months of 2016, we completed negotiations with
various railcar lessors pursuant to which we terminated a future order of railcars, deferred
future railcar deliveries and reduced and deferred payments on existing leases. We accrued
$4 million in contract termination charges during the first quarter of 2016. These liabilities are
included in Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We
also incurred $8 million for delivery deferrals in the second quarter of 2016. We issued
warrants to purchase 370,000 common units representing limited partnership interests in the
partnership in exchange of these concessions during the second quarter of 2016. The above
amounts include the impact of all concessions.

Environmental Matter 
On November 21, 2013, the EPA issued a General Notice Letter and Information Request
(“Notice”) under Section 104(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), to one of our subsidiaries operating within
the Fuel business.  The Notice provides that the subsidiary may have incurred liability with
respect to the Reef Environmental site in Alabama, and requested certain information in
accordance with Section 107(a) of CERCLA.  We timely responded to the Notice.  At this time, no
specific claim for cost recovery has been made by the EPA (or any other potentially responsible
party) against us.  There is uncertainty relating to our share of environmental remediation liability,
if any, because our allocable share of wastewater is unknown and the total remediation cost is
also unknown.  Consequently, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss, if any.  We have not recorded a loss contingency accrual as of March 31, 2016 or
December 31, 2015.  In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
In January 2016, AEC experienced a leak in its proprietary fuel pipeline that connects the bulk
storage terminal to the transmix facility located in Birmingham, Alabama. AEC management
notified the controlling governmental agencies of this condition, and commenced efforts to locate
the leak, determine the cause of the leak, repair the leak, and remediate known contamination to
the proximate soils and sub-grade. These efforts remain in progress, and management does not
expect the costs to repair and remediate these conditions to have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Property Value Guarantees
In December 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase certain properties and assume
leases and other related agreements for future development of sand mining and processing
facilities in Wisconsin.  Given the current challenging market conditions
20
Table of Contents
for proppant demand, we do not plan to begin development until the North American oil and gas
markets improve. Under a mining agreement with a local town, we have assumed contingent
obligations to indemnify owners of approximately141 properties for diminution of value
associated with mine operations and limited moving expenses when each landowner decides to
sell a property, even if no mine is yet in operation.  As these contingent liabilities cannot be
reasonably estimated, no liability has been recorded.
6.              RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We do not have any employees.  Our general partner manages our human resource assets,
including fringe benefits and other employee-related charges.  We routinely and regularly
reimburse our general partner for any employee-related costs paid on our behalf, and report
such costs as operating expenses.
7.              EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
Effective May 14, 2013, we adopted our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) for providing
long-term incentives for employees, directors, and consultants who provide services to us, and
provides for the issuance of an aggregate of up to 2,321,968 common units to be granted either
as options, restricted units, phantom units, distribution equivalent rights, unit appreciation rights,
unit award, profits interest units, or other unit-based award granted under the plan.  All of our
outstanding grants will be settled through issuance of limited partner common units.
For phantom units granted to employees in 2013, we currently assume a 43-month vesting
period, which represents management’s estimate of the amount of time until all vesting
conditions have been met. Concurrent with the closing of a secondary offering in June 2014 and
the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment in July 2014, 90,686 of these phantom units
vested and common units were issued. For other phantom units granted to employees, we
assume a 36 to 48-month vesting period. Restricted units are awarded to our independent
directors on each anniversary of our IPO, each with a vesting period of one year.  Regarding
distributions for independent directors and other employees, distributions are credited to a
distribution equivalent rights account for the benefit of each participant and become payable
generally within 45 days following the date of vesting.  As of March 31, 2016, the unpaid liability
for distribution equivalent rights totaled $1.5 million. 
In 2016, we granted 21,000 time based phantom units to certain officers to vest in equal
installments on each anniversary date of the grant over a period of two years.
The following table summarizes awards granted during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded non-cash equity-based
compensation expense of $0.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in selling, general and
administrative expenses.  Non-cash equity-based compensation expense for continuing
operations was $0.2 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
As of March 31, 2016, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the grants discussed
above amounted to $3.0 million to be recognized over a weighted average of 1.07 years.
8.              INCOME TAXES 
Continuing operations
Our provision for income taxes for continuing operations relates to: (i) Texas margin taxes for the
Partnership, and (ii) an insignificant amount of Canadian income taxes on SSS earnings in
Canada (most of our earnings are exempted under a U.S/Canada tax treaty).  For federal income
tax purposes, we report our income, expenses, gains, and losses as a partnership not subject to
income taxes.  As such, each partner is responsible for his or her share of federal and state
income tax.  Net earnings for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable
income reportable to each partner because of differences between the tax basis and financial
reporting basis of assets and liabilities.
The composition of our provision for income taxes for continuing operations is as follows:

Total provision for income taxes$
 
We are responsible for our portion of the Texas margin tax that is included in our subsidiaries’
consolidated Texas franchise tax returns.  For our operations in Texas, the effective margin tax
rate is approximately 0.95% as defined by applicable state law.  The margin tax qualifies as an
income tax under GAAP, which requires us to recognize the impact of this tax on the temporary
differences between the financial statement assets and liabilities and their tax basis attributable
to such tax.
Discontinued operations
Our provision for income taxes for discontinued operations relates to (i) Texas margin taxes for
Direct Fuels, and (ii) federal and state income taxes for Emerge Energy Distributors Inc.
(“Distributor”). Distributor reports its income, expenses, gains, and losses as a corporation and is
subject to both federal and state income taxes. Federal and state income tax expense for
discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $6 thousand
and $97 thousand, respectively.
Effective Income Tax Rate 
Distributor began operations in May 2013.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016,
Distributor’s effective income tax rate was 22%.  For Distributor, there were no significant
differences between book and taxable income. 
9.              EARNINGS PER COMMON UNIT  
We compute basic earnings (loss) per unit by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average
number of common units outstanding including participating securities.  Participating securities
include unvested equity-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to
distributions. 
Diluted earnings per unit is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common units outstanding, including participating securities, and increased further to include the
number of common units that would have been outstanding had potential dilutive units been
exercised.  The dilutive effect of restricted units is reflected in diluted net income per unit by
applying the treasury stock method.  Under FASB ASC 260-10-45, Contingently Issuable
Shares, 170,720 of our outstanding phantom units are not included in basic or diluted earnings
per common unit calculations as of March 31, 2016.  We incurred a net loss for the three months
ended March 31, 2016, and therefore excluded all potentially dilutive restricted units from the
diluted earnings per unit calculation for that period as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

10.              SEGMENT INFORMATION
Segment Information 
We follow segment reporting in accordance with FASB ASC 280-10,  Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. We are actively engaged in locating buyers
for our fuel business. Accordingly, at March 31, 2016, we have discontinued segment reporting.
The assets and liabilities of the fuel business have been accounted for as assets held for sale in
our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. The operating results related to these
lines of business have been included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements
of operations for all periods presented.
11.       DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, and specifies disclosures about fair value measurements. 
This guidance establishes a hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuations used to measure
fair value.  The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. 
•Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration,
for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3 inputs are measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are
both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources.
Our valuation models consider various inputs including (a) mark to market valuations, (b) time
value and, (c) credit worthiness of valuation of the underlying measurement.
A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Our Fuel business utilizes financial hedging arrangements whereby we hedge a portion of our
gasoline and diesel inventory, which reduces our commodity price exposure on some of our
activities.  The derivative commodity instruments we utilize consist mainly of futures traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.  As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had 2 open
commodity derivative contracts to manage fuel price risk.
We do not designate our derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP.  As a result, we
recognize derivatives at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and
losses reflected in interest expense in continuing operations (for interest rate swap agreements)
and cost of goods sold for discontinued operations (for derivative commodity instruments), as
reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Our derivative instruments
serve the same risk management purpose whether designated as a hedge or not.  We derive fair
values principally from published market interest rates and fuel price quotes (Level 2 inputs). 
The precise level of open position commodity derivatives is dependent on inventory levels,
expected inventory purchase patterns, and market price trends.  We do not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
The fair values of outstanding derivative instruments and their classifications within our
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are summarized as follows:

13.       SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On August 8, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an institutional
investor to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $20 million of
the Partnership’s Series A Preferred Units and warrants that may be exercised to purchase
common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the “Private Placement”).
The Securities Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties
accompanied by certain indemnification rights and certain customary and other closing
conditions. The Private Placement closed on August 15, 2016.
ITEM 2.                                                MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Emerge Energy Services LP (“Emerge”) is a Delaware limited partnership that completed its
initial public offering (“IPO”) on May 14, 2013 to become a publicly traded partnership.  The
combined entities of Superior Silica Sands LLC (“SSS”), a Texas limited liability company, Allied
Energy Company LLC (“AEC”), an Alabama limited liability company, and Emerge Energy
Services Operating LLC (“Emerge Operating”), a Delaware limited liability company, represent
the predecessor for accounting purposes (the “Predecessor”) of Emerge. 
References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us” when used for dates or periods ended prior to
the IPO, refer collectively to the Predecessor.  References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us”
when used for dates or periods ended on or after the IPO, refer collectively to Emerge and all of
its subsidiaries, including Direct Fuels LLC (“Direct Fuels”), which was acquired in a business
combination concurrent with our IPO. 
Overview 
We are a publicly-traded limited partnership formed in 2012 by management and affiliates of
Insight Equity Management Company LLC and its affiliates (collectively “Insight Equity”) to own,
operate, acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of energy service assets. 
On August 31, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement,
dated August 31, 2016 (the “Restated Purchase Agreement”), with Susser Petroleum Operating
Company LLC and Sunoco LP (together, “Sunoco”). The Restated Purchase Agreement
amended and restated in its entirety the previously disclosed Purchase and Sale Agreement,
dated June 23, 2016, between the Partnership and Sunoco in connection with the closing of the
sale by Emerge to Sunoco of all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in our Fuel
business. Pursuant to the Restated Purchase Agreement, Sunoco paid Emerge a purchase price
of approximately $167.7 million in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments
in accordance with the terms of the Restated Purchase Agreement), of which $14.25 million is
placed into several escrow accounts to satisfy potential claims from Sunoco for indemnification
under the Restated Purchase Agreement. Any escrowed funds remaining after certain periods of
time set forth in the Restated Purchase Agreement will be released to Emerge, provided that no
unsatisfied indemnity claims exist at such time.
Accordingly, the results of operations of the Fuel business have been classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented and we now operate our continuing business in a single
Sand business. Through our Sand business, we are engaged in the businesses of mining,
processing, and distributing silica sand, a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas
wells. We conduct our Sand operations through our subsidiary SSS, and we believe our SSS
brand has name recognition and enjoys a positive reputation with our customers.
The following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should
be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015, as well as historical condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Major Factors Impacting Comparability Between Prior and Future Periods
Market Trends
Beginning in late 2014, the market prices for crude oil and refined products began a steep and
protracted decline which has continued into 2016. This has greatly impacted the demand for frac
sand as drilling and completion of new oil and natural gas wells has been significantly curtailed
in North America. As a result, we have experienced significant downward pressure on pricing.
We expect drilling and well completion activity levels, based on indications from our customers
and other industry sources, will be weak for the remainder of 2016. While we ultimately expect a
recovery in the frac sand market, we believe that conditions will not significantly improve until
early to mid-2017.
Sale of Fuel Business
In order to improve our competitive positioning and retain upside for the eventual recovery in the
oil and gas cycle, we divested our Fuel business to reduce our debt burden. Please see Note 2
to our financial statements for a detailed discussion of the sale of the Fuel business.
Cost Reductions
In order to conserve liquidity and respond to the industry downturn, we have become increasingly
focused on prudently reducing costs while maintaining our ability to quickly respond to increased
demand when the market begins to recover in the future. We have already implemented plans,
but will continue to aggressively contain costs in the future. As the market trends have had the
most impact on our frac sand business, we have concentrated our efforts on the Sand business.
Such measures include:
We reduced permanent headcount, with most of these reductions occurring in the fourth quarter
of 2015.

We are minimizing the overall cost of sand sold by finding the lowest cost combinations of sand
source, production location and transportation providers wherever possible.
We began shutting down our more expensive wet plants for winter earlier than normal in 2015,
and we delayed opening our mines later than usual for the 2016 mining season.
We have temporarily idled our Wisconsin wet plants with the highest cost per ton, and we have
strategically shifted sourcing of wet sand from higher cost sources to lower cost sources as
demand for our frac sand has decreased.
In 2016, we have temporarily idled or significantly scaled back operations at two of our
Wisconsin dry plants.
We began using new mining techniques at two of our Wisconsin mines in the third quarter of
2015, and introduced these techniques to our Kosse mine in July 2016. We expect to see over
$1 per ton savings for frac sand sourced from these mines as these techniques are fully
implemented and the resulting finished sand is sold.
We have negotiated, and continue to negotiate, price concessions and purchase commitment
concessions from our major vendors, such as railcar lessors, rail transportation providers, mine
operators, transload facilities operators, and professional services providers.
In 2016, we have minimized our capital expenditures to include only those projects with the
•potential for rapid returns, and comply with our bank covenants that limit capital expenditures.
Development of Sand Distribution System
In 2013 and 2014, we developed our sand distribution system through the addition of third-party
transload facilities in the basins in which our customers operate. We are able to charge higher
prices for these in-basin sales than for FOB-plant sales to provide this additional service and
convenience to our customers and to cover related transportation and other services costs.
However, these additional markups for in-basin sales have also been cut due to pricing
pressures during this industry down-cycle, and we expect these logistics-based service markups
to remain weak until the frac sand industry recovers.
Increasing Fixed Costs for Sand
During 2014, our rapidly expanding frac sand business required us to contract for numerous
railcars to be delivered and leased in the future as well as contracting for new transload facilities
discussed above. As our railcar fleet and distribution system has expanded while sales volumes
contracted and sand prices declined, our fixed costs per ton have increased. We have negotiated
concessions with several of our vendors and continue to press for relief on certain of our fixed
costs similar to the pricing relief that we provided to our own customers. It is not certain if we will
be successful in reducing these costs.
Expansion of Sand Resources
In December 2015, we acquired the rights to mine high quality northern white silica sand
reserves in Jackson County, Wisconsin from a subsidiary of Performance Technologies, L.L.C
(“PTL”), which is wholly-owned by Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (NYSE: SSE). We have not
engaged an expert to assess the volume and quality of these sand reserve rights. The assets
acquired include certain owned and leased land, sand deposit leases and related prepaid
royalties, and transferable mining and reclamation permits.  This transaction strengthens our
position in the marketplace with a leading pressure pumper across a number of shale plays in
North America.  In consideration for the assets, PTL and SSS amended and restated the existing
supply agreement between the parties and entered into a new sand purchase option agreement
that provide PTL with a market-based discount on sand purchased from SSS. Under the new
agreements with PTL, SSS has the option to supply the contracted tons from its existing footprint
of northern white sand operations or construct a new sand mine and dry plant in Jackson County,
Wisconsin.  Given the current challenging market conditions for proppant demand, we currently
have no plans to develop this property.
Technology Driven Proppant Products.  
In November 2015, we acquired 11 patents and other intellectual property assets from
AquaSmart Enterprises LLC for their Self-Suspending Proppant technology. The product brand is
marketed as SandMaxx™. While subject to field testing and data validation, this new technology
offers the potential to increase productivity and completion efficiencies in oil and gas wells while
improving pump time, and well site economics. At our Barron dry plant, we recently completed
the construction of a pilot production circuit to produce in excess of 175,000 tons per year of
SandMaxx™ product.  This pilot production circuit uses proprietary and patented technology to
coat all grades of standard frac sand. We are awaiting production data from our initial test wells.
While market acceptance of SandMaxx™ proppant is subject to the successful completion of
field trial testing, we are developing plans for a coating plant that will be necessary in order to
produce commercially viable volumes of SandMaxx™ proppant.
We will continue to work toward transforming our sand business from a commodity business to a
more value-driven approach by developing capabilities and products that assist in enabling us to
increase our presence in larger, more profitable markets.

Contract and Project Terminations
In 2014 and 2015, we began development of sand processing facilities in Independence,
Wisconsin and other small projects in Ohio and Missouri.  Due to a number of complications,
such as an increase in projected operating costs and a decline in the market price and demand
for frac sand in early 2015, we determined that these projects were no longer economically
viable.  In 2015, we recorded a $9.3 million charge to earnings, of which $9.2 million related to
the Independence, Wisconsin facilities. This charge to earnings included items such as
engineering, legal and other professional service fees, site preparation costs, and writedowns of
assets to estimated net realizable value. 
Management committed to a plan to discontinue these project in April 2015. In accordance with
FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, any contract termination charges and
estimated values of continuing contractual obligations for which we will receive no future value
will be recognized as a charge to earnings as of the contract termination date or cease-use date.
We estimated these contract termination charges to be approximately $1.4 million. These
liabilities will be reviewed periodically and may be adjusted when necessary, but we do not
expect any such adjustments to be significant.
During the first half of 2016, we negotiated concessions on the majority of our railcar leases
pursuant to which we cancelled or deferred deliveries on rail cars and reduced cash payments
on a substantial portion of the existing rail cars in our fleets. In return for these concessions, we
issued a total of $4 million of unsecured notes with interest payable in-kind until certain financial
metrics have been met. This note accrues interest at five percent per annum and are due and
payable within 30 days following the date on which financial statements are publicly available
covering the first date on which these financial metrics have been met.
Diesel Fuel
As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
railroads must begin purchasing Tier 4 locomotives, which only accept 15 ppm sulfur diesel,
starting in 2015. As a result, 500 ppm sulfur diesel was phased out of the railroad market
beginning in the middle of 2015. However, the settlement agreement allows us and other
transmix process to sell 500 ppm diesel produced to certain marine markets with no phase-out
date.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we adopted business practices to accommodate
the shift in product mix from our railroad customers. We have worked with the suppliers of our
transmix to mitigate the impact to our bottom line going forward. To remediate this condition long
term, we began construction of two hydrotreaters designed to remove sulfur to the level of 15
ppm.  At 15 ppm sulfur, diesel we derive from transmix can be sold for any legal use including
railroads and on-road transportation.  We installed one unit at our Dallas-Fort. Worth, Texas
facility which became operational in May 2016, and are installing a second unit at our
Birmingham, Alabama facility which will be operational later this year.  We planned to invest
approximately $17 million for both units, of which we had already paid $10.1 million as of 
March 31, 2016.  These hydrotreaters have been sold to Sunoco with the sale of the Fuel
business.
Interim Indicators of Impairment
Goodwill
The $29.3 million balance of goodwill at March 31, 2016 is related solely to our fuel reporting
unit.  As of March 31, 2016, we were actively engaged in locating buyers for our fuel business.
Accordingly, at March 31, 2016, Goodwill is classified as held for sale on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
Long-lived assets
We believe the decrease in our common units’ market value is attributable primarily to our Sand
business’ decreasing profits and the frac sand industry’s downturn.  Therefore, we have
assessed the recoverability of long-lived assets for our Sand business, and determined that the
carrying values are recoverable from our forecasted cash flows as of March 31, 2016.

Revenues
Sand revenues decreased by $66.6 million, primarily due to significant price decreases and a
62% decrease in total volumes sold as a result of the downturn in market demand for frac sand. 
However, we have increased the volumes sold through transload sites from 32% to 61% of total
volumes sold. We typically charge higher prices for sales from transload sites in order to cover
the additional transportation costs.
The major changes from 2015 to 2016 are as follows: 
$39.7 million decrease in sales of Northern White sand (excluding estimated transportation
markups and shortfall revenues), relating primarily to a 61% decrease in volumes sold as well
as decreased pricing in light of current market conditions for frac sand;

•an estimated $24.5 million decrease for significant reductions in markups per ton sold through
transload sites; and
$2.4 million decrease in sales of native Texas sand (from our Kosse plant) due to lower sales
prices.
Cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization) 
Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct costs such as processing plant wages,
royalties, mining, purchased sand, and transportation to the plant or to transload facilities, as well
as indirect costs such as plant repairs and maintenance. Our direct costs of producing sand and
our logistics costs for finished product decreased with our decreased sales.  The most significant
components of the $22.5 million decrease are:
$17.1 million decrease in the total cost to acquire and produce wet and dry sand, due mainly to
lower sales volumes and lower-cost sources for wet sand;
•$11.2 million decrease in rail transportation-related expense, primarily due to:
•$14.0 million decreased rail shipping costs due to decreased volumes sold in-basin; offset by
•$2.1 million increased rail lease expense; and
•$0.7 million increased railcar storage costs;
•$0.5 million increase in costs of transload facilities; and

decline in prices.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased by $1.1 million due to amortization of
intangible assets.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
The $0.9 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is attributable
primarily to:
•$1.7 million increase in bad debt expense; offset by
•$0.6 million in decreased equity-based compensation expense; and
•$0.3 million decrease in outside professional services.
Contract and project terminations
During the first quarter of 2016, we negotiated significant concessions on our railcar leases. In
return for these concessions, we incurred a contract termination charge of $4 million. See Note 3
to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Sources of Liquidity
Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, fund capital expenditures,
including acquisitions from time to time, to service our debt and to pay distributions to partners. 
Our sources of liquidity generally include cash generated by our operations, borrowings under
our revolving credit and security agreement and issuances of equity and debt securities.  We
depend on the Credit Agreement for both short-term and long-term capital needs and may use
borrowings under our Credit Agreement to fund our operations and capital expenditures to the
extent cash generated by our operations is insufficient in any period. Following the sale of our
Fuel business, the use of proceeds therefrom to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit
Agreement and our entry into Amendment No. 11 to the Credit Agreement (described below), we
believe that cash generated from our liquidity sources will be sufficient to meet our working
capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months.
In addition to our continued focus on generating and preserving cash from operations and
maintaining availability under the Credit Agreement, we plan to seek access to the capital
•
markets for additional liquidity through equity and debt offerings. Any new issuances may take
the form of public or private offerings for cash, equity issued to consummate acquisitions or equity
issued in exchange for a portion of our outstanding debt. We may also from time to time seek to
retire or purchase outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or other
debt securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions
on favorable terms or at all.
Revolving Credit Facility
On June 27, 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement which matures on June 27, 2019 and,
prior to giving effect to the amendments described below, consisted of a $350 million revolving
credit facility, which includes a sub-limit of up to $30 million for letters of credit. Substantially all of
the assets of the Borrowers are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a rate equal to either, at our option, (i)
LIBOR plus 4.25% or (ii) a base rate plus 3.25%. At March 31, 2016, our outstanding borrowings
under the Credit Agreement bore interest at a weighted-average rate of 5.26%. We also incur a
commitment fee of 0.375% on committed amounts that are neither used for borrowings nor under
letters of credit.
The Credit Agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions and requires
maintenance of certain financial covenants. For periods prior to the ratio compliance date, we will
be subject to the following covenants and restrictions:
the $350 million total aggregate commitment under the Credit Agreement will be reduced in an
amount equal to the net proceeds of any notes offerings we may make in the future;
we will be required to maintain at least $25 million of excess availability (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) under the Credit Agreement; and
we will be required to generate consolidated EBITDA in certain minimum amounts beginning
with the quarter ending December 31, 2015 and rolling forward thereafter.
After the ratio compliance date, we will be required to maintain the following financial covenants
in lieu of the covenants and restrictions in place prior to the ratio compliance date: (i) an interest
coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) a total
leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of March
31, 2016, our total leverage ratio exceeded the threshold of 3.50 to 1.00.
In addition, the Credit Agreement places restrictions on our ability to commence certain other
actions, including our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, our ability to consummate
acquisitions and our ability to make capital expenditures. Please see Note 4 to our financial
statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 for more information on the restrictions
placed on our operations pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
As of March 31, 2016, we had undrawn availability under the Credit Agreement totaling $23.6
million and, as a result, we were not in compliance with the financial covenant to maintain at
least $25 million of excess availability. On April 20, 2016, we notified the agent of this event of
default under the Credit Agreement and began discussions with the agent to obtain a waiver
regarding the event of default and to otherwise arrive at a long-term solution to the Partnership’s
liquidity requirements, including the reduction of outstanding borrowings under the Credit
Agreement through the sale of our Fuel business.

Table of Contents
On May 20, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement to permit us to
issue an unsecured promissory note and warrants to one of our lessors in return for concessions
and various long-term leases. Also on May 20, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 5 to the
Credit Agreement that, among other things, provided a limited waiver until the Covenant
Reversion Date for the event of default under the Credit Agreement for failure to maintain
financial covenants as of March 31, 2016 and provided a period of covenant relief with respect to
the requirements to maintain excess availability under the Credit Agreement or to generate the
minimum amounts of consolidated EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. We are also
restricted from making distributions to our unitholders. In addition, Amendment No. 5 (i) increased
the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement to either, at our option,
LIBOR plus 5.00% or the base rate plus 4.00%, (ii) extended the dominion period under the
Credit Agreement whereby our and our subsidiaries’ cash receipts are swept on a daily basis
and used to reduce outstanding borrowings and also (iii) reduced the aggregate commitment
under the Credit Facility from $350 million to $325 million.
We entered into Amendments No. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 to the Credit Agreement to delay the onset of
the Covenant Reversion Date until we were able to execute a definitive agreement for the sale of
the Fuel business on June 23, 2016. On June 30, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 10 to
the Credit Agreement to further extend the Covenant Reversion Date until the earlier of
September 2, 2016 or the closing of the sale of the Fuel business. Please see Note 4 to our
financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016 for more information on
Amendments No. 4 through 10 to the Credit Agreement.
On August 31, 2016, we closed the sale of the Fuel business, used the net proceeds therefrom to
repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and entered into Amendment No. 11
to the Credit Agreement with the Borrowers, the lenders and the agent. Amendment No. 11,
among other things, restated the Credit Agreement and provided a full waiver for all defaults or
events of default arising out of our failure to comply with the financial covenant to generate
minimum amounts of adjusted EBITDA during the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30,
2016 and the quarter ending September 30, 2016 and the covenant to maintain the minimum
amount of excess availability for any date prior to September 1, 2016.
Pursuant to Amendment No. 11, the Credit Agreement now provides for a maximum $200 million
revolving credit facility with a $20 million sublimit on letters of credit, and requires the Partnership
to maintain the following financial covenants:
a covenant to maintain $20 million of excess availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement),
subject to decrease to $15 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions;
a covenant to limit capital expenditures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to certain maximum
amounts for each quarter through March 31, 2019;
beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2017, a covenant to generate consolidated EBITDA
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) in certain minimum amounts;
beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2018, a covenant to maintain an interest coverage
ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, which is scheduled to
increase to 3.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019; and
a covenant to raise at least $31.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of common
equity by November 30, 2016.
Following our entry into Amendment No. 11, we believe that we will be able to maintain
compliance with the covenants and restrictions under the Credit Agreement, as amended, for at
least the next 12 months.

Liquidity Trends
Beginning in the second half of 2014 and continuing through the first quarter of 2016, prices for
natural gas, crude oil and refined fuels have been extremely volatile and decreased significantly.
Our cash flows from operating activities are subject to significant quarterly variations as these
volatile commodity prices negatively impact demand for our frac sand as well as our Fuel
business’ exposure to partially-unhedged commodity price risk for refined products. In addition,
upon closing the sale of our Fuel business we will become more dependent on the volatility in
demand for frac sand without the benefit of stable cash flows generated by our Fuel business in
periods of stable commodity prices. Therefore, the cash generated by our operations are driven
by a number of factors beyond our control, including global and regional product supply and
demand, weather, product distribution, refining and processing capacity and other supply chain
dynamics, among other factors. In this current environment, we anticipate that our liquidity needs
will not be met solely by cash generated from operations, and we expect to rely more heavily on
borrowings under the Credit Agreement and issuance of equity and debt securities as sources of
future liquidity.
However, our ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants of the Credit Agreement is
uncertain and will be affected by the amount of cash flow from our operations and events or
circumstances beyond our control, including events and circumstances that may stem from the
condition of financial markets and commodity price levels. If in the future we are unable to comply
with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and the lenders are unwilling to provide us
with additional flexibility or a waiver, we may be forced to repay or refinance amounts then
outstanding under the Credit Agreement and seek alternative sources of capital to fund our
business and anticipated capital expenditures. Any such alternative sources of capital, such as
equity transactions or debt financing, may be on terms less favorable or at higher costs than our
current financing sources, depending on future market conditions and other factors.

unrealized losses on derivative instruments. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities
were also significantly impacted by lower accounts receivable balances resulting from lower
sales of sand and fuel during the first quarter of 2016, a build-up of inventories in 2015, lower
accounts payables and accrued liabilities balances due to lower cost of fuel in 2016 and

Assumes balances outstanding as of March 31, 2016 will be paid at maturity and includes
interest using interest rates in effect at March 31, 2016.
Includes minimum amounts payable under various operating leases for railcars as well as
estimated costs to transport leased railcars from the manufacturer to our site for initial
placement in service. During the first six months of 2016, we completed negotiations with
various railcar lessors pursuant to which we terminated a future order of railcars, deferred
future railcar deliveries and reduced and deferred payments on existing leases. In exchange
for these concessions, we issued at par an Unsecured Promissory Note in the aggregate
principal amount of $4 million with interest payable in cash or, in certain situations, in-kind,
when certain financial metrics have been met. These notes bears interest at a rate of five
percent per annum and are due and payable within 30 days following the date on which
financial statements are publicly available covering the first date on which these financial
metrics have been met. These liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities in our
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We incurred $8 million for delivery deferrals in the
second quarter of 2016. We also issued warrants to purchase 370,000 common units
representing limited partnership interests in the partnership in exchange of these concessions
during the second quarter of 2016. These amounts include the impact of all concessions.

Property Value Guarantees
In December 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase certain properties and assume
leases and other related agreements for future development of sand mining and processing
facilities in Wisconsin.  Given the current challenging market conditions for proppant demand, we
do not plan to begin development until the North American oil and gas markets improve. Under a
mining agreement with a local town, we have assumed contingent obligations to indemnify
owners of approximately141 properties for diminution of value associated with mine operations
and limited moving expenses when each landowner decides to sell a property, even if no mine is
yet in operation.  As these contingent liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability has
been recorded.
ADJUSTED EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined in our Credit Agreement as: net income (loss) plus consolidated
interest expense (net of interest income), income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense, non-cash charges and losses that are unusual or non-recurring less
income tax benefits and gains that are unusual or non-recurring and other adjustments allowable
under our existing credit agreement.   Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial
measure by our management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors
and commercial banks, to assess: 
the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital
structure or historical cost basis of our assets;
the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative
investment opportunities;
•

•
our liquidity position and the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make debt
payments and to make distributions;
our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without
regard to the impact of financing methods and capital structure; and
our debt covenant compliance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to our
Credit Agreement.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because, when
viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, it provides a more
complete understanding of our performance than GAAP results alone.  We also believe that
external users of our financial statements benefit from having access to the same financial
measures that management uses in evaluating the results of our business.  In addition, the
lenders under our credit facility use a metric similar to Adjusted EBITDA to measure our
compliance with certain financial covenants. 
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net

income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial
performance presented in accordance with GAAP.  Moreover, our Adjusted EBITDA as
presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

ITEM 3.                                                QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 
Information about market risks for the three months ended March 31, 2016, does not differ
materially from that discussed under Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2015. 
ITEM 4.                                                 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2016. Based on such
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s
evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter
ended March 31, 2016 that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II                                      OTHER INFORMATION 
ITEM 1.                                      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
Although we are, from time to time, involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations
in the normal course of business, we do not believe that we are a party to any litigation that could
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  We are not
aware of any undisclosed significant legal or governmental proceedings against us, or
contemplated to be brought against us.  We maintain such insurance policies with insurers in
amounts and with coverage and deductibles as our general partner believes are reasonable and
prudent.  However, we cannot assure you that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from
all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that
these levels of insurance will be available in the future at acceptable prices.

Environmental Matter 
On November 21, 2013, the EPA issued a General Notice Letter and Information Request
(“Notice”) under Section 104(e) of CERCLA to one of our subsidiaries operating within the Fuel
business.  The Notice provides that the subsidiary may have incurred liability with respect to the
Reef Environmental site in Alabama, and requested certain information in accordance with
Section 107(a) of CERCLA.  We timely responded to the Notice.  At this time, no specific claim
for cost recovery has been made by the EPA (or any other potentially responsible party) against
us.  There is uncertainty relating to our share of environmental remediation liability, if any,
because our allocable share of wastewater is unknown and the total remediation cost is also
unknown.  Consequently, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if
any.  We have not recorded a loss contingency accrual in our financial statements.  In the opinion
of management, the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
In January 2016, AEC experienced a leak in its proprietary fuel pipeline that connects the bulk
storage terminal to the transmix facility located in Birmingham, Alabama. AEC management
notified the controlling governmental agencies of this condition, and commenced efforts to locate
the leak, determine the cause of the leak, repair the leak, and remediate known contamination to
the proximate soils and sub-grade. These efforts remain in progress, and management does not
expect the costs to repair and remediate these conditions to have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
ITEM 1A.                                                RISK FACTORS 
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors
discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future
results.  The risks described in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the
only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition or future results. 
If we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) continued listing requirements, the
NYSE may delist our common units which would have an adverse impact on the liquidity and
market price of our common units.
Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, we may not be able to meet the
continued listing requirements of the NYSE. As previously disclosed in our press release dated
May 20, 2016 and our Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on May 11, 2016, we were not able to file our Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 in a timely manner. On May 17, 2016, we received a
letter from the New York Stock Exchange Regulation, Inc. informing us that, as a result of our
failure to timely file our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, we are subject to the
procedures specified in Section 802.01E (SEC Annual Report Timely Filing Criteria) of the
NYSE’s Listed Company Manual. We believe that the filing of our Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2016 and the Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 satisfies the NYSE
requirements. In addition, the continued listing requirements on the NYSE require, among other
things; (i) that the average closing price of our common units be above $1.00 over 30 consecutive
trading days and (ii) that our market capitalization be not less than $15 million over 30
consecutive trading days. If we are unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our
common units would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common units could negatively
impact us by reducing the liquidity and market price of our common units, reducing the number of
investors willing to hold or acquire our common units, which could negatively impact our ability to
raise equity financing.
Divestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, requires
additional attention and resources that could divert our management’s focus from continuing
operations, and retained liabilities from businesses that we sell could adversely affect our
financial results.
In the first quarter of 2016, we began the process of divesting our Fuel business and related
product lines, entered into a definitive agreement for the sale on June 23, 2016 and closed the
transaction on August 31, 2016. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively
impact our business, including required separation or carve-out activities and costs and disputes
with buyers or third parties, and also require additional management attention that distract from
continuing operations even after closing. Dispositions also involve continued financial
involvement, as we are required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against,
contingent liabilities related to our Fuel business, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, working
condition of assets and environmental matters. Under these types of arrangements, performance
by the divested business or other conditions outside our control could affect our future financial
results.
We have a history of losses and expect our revenues to decrease in the near-term.
For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we have incurred aggregate losses of $34.2 million.
Our loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $34.4
million and our income from discontinued operations was $0.2 million. There is no assurance
that we will operate profitably or will generate positive cash flow in the future. In addition, our
operating results in the future may be subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors not
within our control, such as the
37

demand for our products, and the level of competition and general economic conditions. As we
transition our business after the close of the sale of our Fuel business to operating solely in the
frac sand industry, we expect a significant decrease in our revenues. Consequently, we expect to
continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flow until we generate significant revenue
from the sale of our continuing products.
ITEM 4.                                      MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling exposure to silica dust,
which includes dust sampling, a respiratory protection program, medical surveillance, training
and other components.  We designed our safety program to ensure compliance with the
standards of our Occupational Health and Safety Manual and U.S. Federal Mine Safety and
Health Administration (“MSHA”) regulations.  For both health and safety issues, extensive
training is provided to employees.  We have organized safety committees at our plants made up
of both salaried and hourly employees.  We perform annual internal health and safety audits and
conduct semi-annual crisis management drills to test our abilities to respond to various
situations.  Our corporate health and safety department administers the health and safety
programs with the assistance of plant environmental, health and safety coordinators.
All of our production facilities are classified as mines and are subject to regulation by MSHA
under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”).  MSHA inspects our
mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has
occurred under the Mine Act.  Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency
Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders
charged against mining operations.  The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also
increased in recent years.  Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory
matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
ITEM 5.                                      OTHER INFORMATION
