<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official mission to 
Jordan from 11 to 24 November 2011. She visited Amman, Karak and Tafila. The objective 
of the visit was to examine the situation of violence against women in the country in a 
comprehensive manner, including violence that is perpetrated within the family, in the 
community, in institutional settings and in the transnational arena.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister of Social Development and the 
Minister of Labour and held consultations with high-ranking officials of the Ministries of 
Justice, Interior, Religious Affairs, Political Development, Health, and Education. She also 
met with judges at the Court of Cassation, the president of the National Centre for Human 
Rights (NCHR), the Ombudsperson, and representatives of the National Council for Family 
Affairs (NCFA) and the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW), including its 
patron, Princess Basma Bint Talal.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of civil society, including 
women&#8217;s organizations, and representatives of United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes. She had the opportunity to visit the government-run Dar Al Wifaq women&#8217;s 
shelter and the Juweidah Reform and Rehabilitation Centre (for women), where she heard 
testimonies from a number of women. The Special Rapporteur also visited health-care and 
education facilities and met with service providers from the Palestinian refugee camps of 
Wehdat, Baqa&#8217;a and Jerash.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation to the Government for its 
openness and full cooperation, prior to and throughout her visit. She is also grateful to the 
United Nations Country Team for the support extended during the visit. The Special 
Rapporteur looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue with the Government and 
other stakeholders on the implementation of her recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The economic and political context of Jordan and its 
</b>implications for women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. The economic development of Jordan is challenged by its limited natural resources; 
only 11.5 per cent of its land is arable,1 it is among the world&#8217;s most water-poor countries, 
and agricultural production is very limited. With 82 per cent of the country&#8217;s population 
being urban-based,2 efforts towards development are mainly focused on its human 
resources. The economy continues to depend highly on foreign aid and overseas 
remittances, mostly sent by skilled Jordanian workers in neighbouring Gulf countries.  
</p>
<p>6. Jordan was classified as a medium Human Development Index country in the latest 
<i>Human Development Report</i>3 and has made considerable advances in achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals in education and health. Jordan has also taken positive 
steps in the eradication of poverty and hunger. It reduced the percentage of population 
</p>
<p>  
 1 World Bank figures for 2009. Available from http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS. 
 2 About 72 per cent of the population is concentrated in the country&#8217;s three largest urban areas.

</p>
<p>living in extreme poverty, from 6.6 per cent down to less than 1 per cent, between 1992 and 
2008.4  
</p>
<p>7. Jordan has a very high dependency ratio, with approximately four non-economically 
active persons per worker.5 Unemployment among young persons and women is a 
particular challenge. This is due to a very young population (37 per cent under the age of 15 
in 20096), but also to the low participation of women in the economy. The total economic 
participation rate in Jordan is 40.1 per cent of the population, and the rate for female 
economic participation is 14.9 per cent.7 It is estimated that in 2009 the unemployment rate 
reached 24.1 per cent among females, compared to 10.3 per cent among males.8 There is 
also a high concentration of unemployment among young persons, with 42.8 per cent of 
unemployed women and 50.1 per cent of unemployed men being in the 15-24 age group.9  
</p>
<p>8. It is estimated that 78 per cent of unemployed females are educated and hold an 
intermediate college or higher diploma.10 This reflects a disparity between the high levels of 
education that women are achieving and their possibilities of integrating into the labour 
market. During her interviews with representatives from the Ministry of Labour, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed how women&#8217;s career choices are to a large extent driven by what 
is perceived as appropriate or safe professions for them, such as jobs within the government 
sector, particularly in the education and health sectors. Women not residing in Amman are 
often discouraged by their families from seeking jobs outside their governorates. Women 
may also be discouraged from entering the workforce, as they will face the double burden 
of housework and formal employment, and more so in a context of a lack of pay parity.11 
Therefore, most married women will not search for a job unless there is a need to 
supplement the family income.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to women&#8217;s political participation, there have been some improvements. 
Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliamentary system. The upper 
house&#8212;the Senate&#8212;is composed of 60 members, who are appointed by the King; there are 
currently nine female Senators. The lower house&#8212;House of Representatives&#8212;is comprised 
of 120 members who are popularly elected; currently, 13 seats are held by women. Whether 
men or women, the 108 candidates who receive the most votes are selected and 12 seats&#8212;
one in each district&#8212;are reserved for those women who obtained the highest percentage of 
votes nationwide, yet not enough to win a seat in the direct election.12  
</p>
<p>10. In 2007 the Government, in the new Municipalities Act (No. 14), introduced a quota 
allocating 20 per cent of municipal seats to women. Currently, 27 per cent of seats are held

<p>by women: 20 per cent through the quota, and 7 per cent elected directly, in addition to one 
female mayor. The quota was further increased to 25 per cent in July 2011. Furthermore, 
women have increasingly assumed high-level positions in the cabinet, with an average of 
three women ministers in each cabinet since 2004.13 Currently there are two women 
ministers in the 29-member cabinet: the Minister of Social Development and the Minister 
of Higher Education.14  
</p>
<p>11. Although the number of women participating in public life is increasing, this does 
not necessarily translate into women&#8217;s issues being more actively discussed or promoted. 
</p>
<p>During interviews with service providers, the Special Rapporteur was informed of how 
some women, particularly in rural areas, are still pressured by men to vote for the 
candidates who are supported by their families or their tribes. Furthermore, the public 
sphere is still mainly dominated by men, so decision-making tends to favour the interests of 
male citizens and continues to reflect social beliefs and value systems that are 
discriminatory against women.15 During a communal meeting, the Special Rapporteur 
witnessed how young women&#8217;s voices were dismissed or silenced by elder traditional 
leaders who questioned their right to speak on behalf of the community. Clearly, the 
perceptions regarding the situation of women and the prevalence of violence against 
women in this region were divergent; yet tribal leaders seemed to have the prerogative to 
rebuff the views of other participants, particularly the younger speakers, and to have the 
final say in the matters that were being discussed during the meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Manifestations of violence against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic abuse and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>12. There is currently no coordinated multi-agency data-collecting and -processing 
mechanism to quantify the prevalence of domestic violence in Jordan. Governmental 
institutions that investigate complaints and provide services to victims, such as the Family 
Protection Department in the Public Security Directorate and the Ministry of Social 
Development, maintain their own records, as do non-governmental and semi-governmental 
organizations working with victims. Similarly, the Ministry of Justice records the cases of 
family violence heard in courts and the Ministry of Health registers all cases of sexual 
abuse and murder of women examined by its forensic experts. 
</p>
<p>13. Other limitations arise from the definitions used to classify the information, as most 
institutions focus on &#8213;family violence&#8214; and not specifically on violence perpetrated against 
</p>
<p>women. Furthermore, challenges relating to underreporting prevent the authorities from 
having an accurate picture of the phenomenon in the country. Reasons for underreporting 
include, among others: fear of family fragmentation, fear of losing custody of children in 
the case of divorce, and fear of affecting the family&#8217;s reputation.16 
</p>
<p>14. According to statistics from the Family Protection Department (FPD), 6,236 cases of 
violence against women and children were examined in 2011.17 Of these cases, 27.5 per 
cent (1,664 cases) were transferred to the courts, 61 per cent (3,782 cases) were transferred

<p>to the Department&#8217;s Social Services Office, and 12.5 per cent (790 cases) were transferred 
to governors. The total amount of cases handled by the Department has steadily increased, 
from 4,312 cases in 2008 to 6,416 in 2009, and 8,605 in 2010, with cases of violence 
against adult women increasing from 675 in 2007 to 1,306 in 2010. However, the 
proportion of cases referred to the above-mentioned institutions (courts, social services and 
governors) has largely remained unchanged.18 
</p>
<p>15. Since 2007, the Department has examined 8,028 cases of sexual, physical and other 
forms of violence against women and girls. Of the 4,975 cases involving adult women, 
1,061 were cases of sexual abuse, and 3,914 were cases of physical abuse.19 It is clear that 
these statistics show a steady increase in the total number of cases received by the 
Department, but it is unclear if this increase is a result of greater awareness and reporting 
among victims, or an increase in the prevalence of family violence. 
</p>
<p>16. According to a 2008 study by NCFA, psychological and verbal violence are the 
most common forms of abuse experienced by women. It is common for husbands to exert 
control over their wives, sometimes limiting their freedom of movement or not allowing 
them to express their opinions.20 It is not uncommon for this violence to escalate to physical 
or sexual violence. The NCFA 2008 report indicates that in 2004, a high percentage of the 
society still believed women to be inferior to men and approved of women being 
disciplined by their husbands for not fulfilling their responsibilities as wives and mothers.21 
Some stakeholders also referred to the deteriorating economic conditions, the lack of 
education and awareness, the influence of violent messages through mass media, and the 
deteriorating communication within families, as factors increasing the risk of domestic 
violence.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to sexual violence, most interviewees stated that this is not a major 
problem in the country. According to information provided by NCHR, there were 67 
reported cases of rape during 2010. The women&#8217;s movement managed to push for changes 
in the Penal Code during 2010 and penalties were increased for perpetrators in cases where 
victims are under the age of 18, have a disability or are under the care or legal authority of 
the perpetrator.22 Through Law No. 8 of 2011, article 292 of the Penal Code was amended 
to include harsher sentences for all cases of rape, and particularly for cases in which victims 
are minors.23 Marital rape is not a crime under the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>18. Currently under the law, rapists may be exempt from punishment by marrying their 
victims. This provision is justified as a way of conferring protection and some sort of 
compensation to the victim, for the social stigma associated with rape. Although this 
provision is allegedly only applied with the full consent of the victim, societal pressures 
may push victims to accept this solution as the only way to be reintegrated into their 
communities.  
</p>
<p>19. Several activists raised the issue of women with disabilities and the greater risks 
they face, not only of experiencing sexual assault and rape, but also of suffering serious 
violations of their reproductive rights, including forced sterilization. It was reported to the 
Special Rapporteur that families resort to this illegal practice to avoid the social stigma 
associated with unwanted pregnancies of disabled women who have been victims of rape.

<p>20. With regard to cases of incest, it is reported that prevalence rates for the last 10 years 
has been three cases per annum per 10,000 inhabitants.24  
</p>
<p>21. Also worth noting is that the law does not provide for legal abortion in cases of 
pregnancies that result from incest or rape. 
</p>
<p>22. Finally, according to some interlocutors, economic violence is also very common. 
Men restrict women from working or force them to do so and then retain their salaries. 
Women are also sometimes pressured to renounce their inheritance rights, or not allowed to 
get married as a way for families to continue receiving their salary.25 By law, women have 
the right to own property, engage in business, work and enjoy their income&#8212;without 
having to obtain the approval of their husbands or guardians. However, it is usually 
expected for women to give away their salaries, either to their guardians or their 
husbands.26 These accepted and expected practices limit women&#8217;s access to financial and 
economic independence, which is a crucial element for women fleeing abusive situations. 
Furthermore, the practice reflects a situation in which women&#8217;s participation in the labour 
market does not generally contribute to their own development or empowerment, and their 
financial contribution to the family income does not translate into greater power or 
influence in decision-making within the family.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender-motivated killings of women in the family  
</b></p>
<p>23. As a result of awareness-raising campaigns carried out in the late 1990s, which 
enjoyed the support of the press, the Royal Family of Jordan and human rights and 
women&#8217;s organizations in the country, the number of gender-motivated killings of women 
in Jordan has steadily decreased in the last years. However, this is still a phenomenon of 
concern in the country, and estimates of the number of so-called &#8213;honour killings&#8214; vary 
between 10 and 25 per year, depending on the source.  
</p>
<p>24. In many of these cases, violence against women is perpetrated by husbands, 
guardians and other male relatives, when women act in ways that are considered 
&#8213;dishonourable&#8214; in the eyes of society. Women, whether married or unmarried, who have 
</p>
<p>engaged in pre- or extra-marital sex even face the risk of being murdered so as to &#8213;restore 
the family honour&#8214;. Moreover, given the high levels of scrutiny under which some women 
</p>
<p>live, leaving the home without permission or talking to an unrelated man are acts that have 
also resulted in the killing of women in the name of &#8213;honour&#8214;.27 
</p>
<p>25. An important gain made by the women&#8217;s rights movement was the amendment of 
article 340 of the Penal Code in 2001, which no longer exonerates perpetrators of crimes 
committed in the name of &#8213;honour&#8214;. However, perpetrators of such crimes may still get 
more lenient sentences under other Penal Code articles, such as article 98, which reduces 
penalties for crimes committed in a fit of rage, and article 99, which reduces by half a 
perpetrator&#8217;s sentence when he is excused by the victim&#8217;s family. Interviews with women at 
risk in both the Juweidah Reform and Rehabilitation Centre and the Dar Al Wifaq women&#8217;s 
shelter revealed that family members, particularly younger brothers, are the main

<p>

 25 NCHR reports on a study undertaken by the Irbid governorate which indicates that 76 per cent of 
</p>
<p>women in the governorate did not receive their full inheritance rights, of which 15 per cent waived 
their rights voluntarily. NCHR, <i>Seventh Annual Report </i>(footnote 11 above), para. 167.

<p>perpetrators of violence and killings committed in the name of honour. Both activists and 
government officials explained how families who are already grieving the loss of their 
daughters, and wishing to avoid further pain, might decide to renounce their right to seek 
justice and have the perpetrator released from prison earlier. According to a study 
conducted by NCFA, of 50 cases of murder of women committed between 2000 and 2010, 
in 78 per cent of the cases perpetrators benefited from reduced sentences due to families 
waiving their personal rights.28   
</p>
<p>26. While perpetrators of honour killing may still benefit from some loopholes in the 
law with regard to sentencing, some criminal courts have increasingly issued stricter 
sentences of up to 10 years in prison. Additionally, the amendments made to the Penal 
Code in 2011 created article 308 bis, which establishes the inadmissibility of mitigating 
factors if the victim is under 18 years old (A/HRC/20/16/Add.5). Furthermore, in July 2009 
the Ministry of Justice established specialized units within five courts to hear cases 
involving so-called honour crimes, which will hopefully create more responsive 
jurisprudence on the matter and improve and expedite efforts to bring perpetrators to 
justice. 
</p>
<p>27. An ongoing issue of concern is the interpretation of preventive detention laws. The 
Crime Prevention Act contains some preventive measures that allow Governors to place 
persons who may constitute a danger to the community in administrative detention. 
However, this provision is also used to detain women whose lives might be threatened by 
their families and who are placed in custody &#8213;for their own protection&#8214;. At the time of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 120 women were in administrative detention in the Juweidah 
Centre, of whom 25 were women at risk of suffering a so-called honour crime.29  
</p>
<p>28. Whether in shelters or in prison, protective custody seems to be the main system 
used to prevent violence against women. Although efforts have been made to refer women 
to the Dar Al Wifaq shelter, it is still common practice for Governors to sign administrative 
orders by which women at risk are sent to the Juweidah Centre, when family reconciliation 
is not possible. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the release of women from 
&#8213;protective detention&#8214; is conditional upon the consent of a male relative and/or a guarantor. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against migrant domestic workers  
</b></p>
<p>29. It is estimated that there are currently 70,000 migrant women working as domestic 
workers in Jordan, of whom only 40,000 are registered.30 Most migrant domestic workers 
come from Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Philippines; they are frequently poor and 
uneducated women with few livelihood opportunities in their own countries. Many are 
single mothers who do not have the financial support of a spouse, and who work abroad to 
support family members back in their home countries.31  
</p>
<p>30. Most of these women come into the country through Jordanian recruitment agencies, 
which sign agreements with agencies in the countries of origin. When a potential candidate 
is identified, the agency in Jordan issues an individual work contract that needs to be

<p>31. Migrant domestic workers arriving in Jordan are usually leaving their home 
countries for the first time. They do not know the language, or the culture in Jordan, and 
usually have little knowledge of their rights or their contractual agreements. It is reported 
that the abuse of migrant domestic workers begins in their home countries, where recruiting 
agencies deceive them with regard to the working conditions and responsibilities specified 
in their contracts. The Special Rapporteur received information indicating that some 
embassies provide short induction sessions to new recruits, but even if/when this is 
provided, most workers are unaware of their rights and of the possible avenues for redress 
in case of abuse. In most cases migrant workers are taken directly to their employers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>homes upon arrival, or they spend a few nights at their recruitment agency, yet have little 
contact with the outside world from the moment they arrive into the country.33  
</p>
<p>32. The most common human rights violations reported against migrant domestic 
workers include being kept forcefully confined within the home, having passports and 
identification documents withheld, receiving salaries that are below the country&#8217;s minimum 
wage of 150 Jordanian dinar (US$ 212) per month, not receiving salaries on time (or at all), 
and being forced to work long hours without any rest. The Special Rapporteur also received 
reports of physical, psychological and sexual abuse perpetrated against migrant domestic 
workers by either employers or staff of recruitment agencies.  
</p>
<p>33. Through confidential interviews, the Special Rapporteur was informed of cases in 
which migrant domestic workers would be coerced to have sexual relations with their male 
employers in exchange for &#8213;gifts&#8214;, better working conditions, or permission to leave the 
</p>
<p>home. There was no real possibility to unilaterally end these relationships given the power 
imbalances and disadvantaged situation of the workers. The Special Rapporteur also 
received reports of women being forced to shave off or cut their hair, and being mistreated 
and beaten by their female employers.    
</p>
<p>34. In most cases of abuse, &#8213;running away&#8214; is the only option for the employees, and 
workers seek assistance from their embassies or their recruitment agencies. Usually migrant 
women just aim to return home, and do not want to get involved in the criminal justice 
process. However, recruiters tend to favour reconciliation between employers and 
employees, so as to avoid financial losses, and may in some cases return workers to abusive 
employers. The Special Rapporteur also received information indicating that recruitment 
agencies are sometimes pressured by corrupt government officials to settle matters in a way 
that favours the employers.  
</p>
<p>35. For the women, obstacles to their return include having to pay &#8213;over-stay&#8214; fines for 
each day they remained in the country without residency status, and securing funds to pay 
for their return flight. Although they are entitled to a ticket paid by their employers, this is 
only the case after they complete two years of service, and even in those cases, employers 
</p>
<p>  
 32 It is reported that although Memorandums of Understanding had been signed between Jordan and the 
</p>
<p>embassies of Sri Lanka (2006), Indonesia (2009) and the Philippines (2010), by August 2010, all 
three countries had formally suspended deployment of their nationals as domestic workers to Jordan. 
As of May 2011, only Sri Lanka had lifted such suspension. The reasons for the suspension include: 
(a) the high number of abuses against migrant domestic workers; (b) the difficulty in returning 
migrant domestic workers stranded at the embassies to their home countries; and (c) the lack of 
progress in negotiating higher salaries with recruitment agencies (Tamkeen and Human Rights 
Watch, <i>Domestic Plight</i>, pp. 22-23). Unfortunately, it was not possible for the Special Rapporteur to 
meet with representatives of these three embassies while in Amman.

<p>do not always comply with this responsibility.34 When the Special Rapporteur visited the 
Juweidah Centre, there were 77 foreign women in detention, most of them domestic 
workers who had fled their jobs, whose employers were refusing to pay for their return 
home, and whose embassies were reluctant to assist.35  
</p>
<p>36. Structural causes of abuse against migrant domestic workers stem from both formal 
and cultural discrimination. Legislation is in itself discriminatory when it states that a 
domestic worker is not allowed to leave the house unless the employer has given her 
permission and has been informed of her whereabouts.36 Yet these restrictions are deemed 
acceptable and normal among employers, even those who strive to provide good working 
conditions to their employees, due to the same overprotective views that restrict the 
independence of Jordanian women. Migrant domestic workers may be kept under tight 
control to avoid their exposure to negative influences and to men, to prevent them from 
&#8213;getting into trouble&#8214; and in some way bringing shame into their employer&#8217;s families.  
</p>
<p>37. An important source of discrimination and abuse is the tendency to &#8213;otherize&#8214; 
foreign women and feed into racist or prejudiced misconceptions about their sexuality and 
moral standing. Some employers will not afford the same kind of &#8213;respect&#8214; to these 
working Asian women that they normally would show towards Jordanian women.37  
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against refugee women 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Palestinian refugees  
</b></p>
<p>38. Currently there are almost 2 million Palestinian refugees registered with the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) who 
live in Jordan.38 Most of them arrived following the Arab-Israeli War in 1948 and were 
granted Jordanian citizenship under the Jordanian Nationality Act of 1954.39 They enjoy all 
political rights, including the right to vote, and also have full access to government services.  
</p>
<p>39. In addition, there is a smaller group of Palestinian refugees who were forced to 
move to Gaza as a result of the 1948 war, and later fled to Jordan when Israel occupied the 
Gaza Strip in 1967. UNRWA estimates that there are currently 136,617 of these ex-Gazan 
refugees living in Jordan. With the exception of a few families, most of these refugees did 
not qualify for citizenship and hold temporary residency permits.40  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur visited Jerash camp, near Amman, where a large number of 
ex-Gazan refugees live and where she met with refugee women, service providers, teachers 
and young refugee students. Most of the interviewees are part of a third generation of ex-
Gazan refugees who were born and raised in Jordan.  
</p>
<p>41. The population of Jerash camp amounts to 20,000 persons living in an area of 
750,000 m2 (0.75 km2). According to a door-to-door survey conducted by UNRWA in May

 40 This does not include a third category of unregistered refugees (estimated by the media at between 
</p>
<p>100,000 and 150,000) who fled Gaza in 1967, do not meet the definition of Palestinian refugee and 
have limited access to both government- and UNRWA-sponsored services.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> 11 
</b></p>
<p>2007, Jerash camp is among the poorest of the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, with 
high unemployment and illiteracy rates.41 The Special Rapporteur was informed that about 
9.8 per cent of the Jerash camp population are currently registered under the UNRWA 
Special Hardship Case programme and receive financial and in-kind assistance from the 
agency.42 UNRWA reports that dwellings are overcrowded, not regularly maintained and 
very cold during the winter. This is coupled with health risks deriving from the lack of an 
adequate sewerage system.  
</p>
<p>42. Ex-Gazan refugees face several legal restrictions deriving from their lack of 
citizenship. Not only are these refugees limited with respect to political rights, such as the 
right to vote, to be represented in parliament or to register a political party, they also face 
restrictions in terms of their access to work, education, health and other rights and benefits. 
</p>
<p>43. With regard to higher education, Gazan refugees are considered as international 
students, which means they have to pay higher fees in both undergraduate and postgraduate 
programmes at universities. The only exception is for those refugees who manage to obtain 
a seat through a Royal Quota that reserves 5 per cent of public university seats for refugee 
camp residents in the country. It is therefore very difficult for ex-Gazan refugee girls to find 
a place in public university, and if they do, it is not necessarily in the faculty of their choice. 
For most of them, the prospect of attending private university is unthinkable due to the 
impossibility of paying the high fees. 
</p>
<p>44. In terms of their access to employment, Gazan refugees are not allowed to work 
within the government, which is currently the major employer in Jordan, particularly for 
women. Furthermore, activities in the spheres of law, agriculture, engineering, journalism 
and accounting may only be carried out by persons enjoying Jordanian nationality or by 
foreigners enjoying &#8213;reciprocal treatment&#8214;, which Gazan refugees do not.43 With regard to 
employment in the health-care sector, which is also an attractive and common area of work 
for women, refugee doctors and nurses are allowed to work if they hold a practicing license, 
but this needs to be renewed every year and is strictly linked to a specific hospital or clinic.  
</p>
<p>45. During interviews with ex-Gazan refugee girls and women, the Special Rapporteur 
heard about the effects that these restrictions have on refugee women, particularly in terms 
of facing extra pressure to marry early as a means to lessen the economic burden on their 
highly disadvantaged families. Another concern shared by refugee girls in Jerash is how 
parents sometimes prioritize the education of their male children, because (a) it will be 
easier for the young men to find jobs, and (b) they feel their daughters will ultimately get 
married and, if employed, will contribute their salaries to their husband&#8217;s families, and not 
</p>
<p>their own.  
</p>
<p>46. This forces refugee girls and women to perpetuate a cycle of economic dependence 
on their male relatives and restricts them from achieving the financial independence that 
would be required for them to gain their own livelihood, which is particularly important if 
they face a situation of abuse.  
</p>
<p>  
 41 The unemployment rate is estimated at 39 per cent, compared to 14 per cent for Jordanians and other 
</p>
<p>Palestinian refugees. The illiteracy rate is 13.8 per cent, compared to 7.5 per cent for the rest of 
Jordan. About 27 per cent of camp residents lived under the poverty line of $1 per day, and the 
percentage increases to 64 per cent when considering a poverty line of $2 per day.  
</p>
<p> 42 While 2.6 per cent of refugee families are identified by UNRWA as Special Hardship Cases, the 
percentage rises to 4.2 per cent among ex-Gaza families. 
</p>
<p> 43 As ex-Gazan refugees do not hold Palestinian nationality either, they are not eligible for these 
entitlements enjoyed by other foreign workers.  </p>

</p>
<p>47. Interviewees confirmed that violence within the community is rare, and that women 
and girls are rarely disrespected or assaulted by men in the camps. Girls know their families 
and the community as a whole will stand by them and protect them if such a situation 
occurred. However, refugee women do not enjoy the same kind of support with regard to 
violence occurring within the family, as the community still regards this issue as a private 
matter that will bring shame to the family if disclosed. Some interviewees explained that 
domestic violence is accepted and sometimes even justified by the society as a form of 
discipline. This largely restricts victims from speaking out and seeking support. Refugee 
women face an additional layer of fear, due to their disadvantaged position before the 
authorities. They will not reach out to the available support systems, such as those provided 
by the Family Protection Department, as this is part of the Public Security Directorate and 
reporting would, in their view, open up a door for further scrutiny and control of their 
communities by the police.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Iraqi and other non-Palestinian refugees  
</b></p>
<p>48. Although Jordan is not a State party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto, the Jordanian authorities hosts asylum-seekers and 
refugees, particularly from Iraq. However, the Government does not refer to them as 
refugees, but as &#8213;guests&#8214;. On 18 June 2011, a general amnesty was issued by the King, 
</p>
<p>which included a waiver of all overstay fees and fines incurred by asylum-seekers and 
refugees in Jordan. 
</p>
<p>49. The Government&#8217;s legal framework with regard to refugees is a Memorandum of 
Understanding signed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) in 1998, which contains the refugee definition, confirms the principle 
of non-refoulement, provides the legal basis for the stay of asylum-seekers in Jordan, and 
allows mandate refugees a maximum stay of six months after recognition. There is no 
possibility of local integration in Jordan, therefore, UNHCR must resettle refugees in third 
countries or assist them to voluntarily repatriate, which is not a plausible option for most 
Iraqis. 
</p>
<p>50. As of 30 September 2011, 33,747 Iraqi and 2,666 non-Iraqi asylum-seekers and 
refugees had been registered with UNHCR in Jordan, of which 16,501 were Iraqi women. 
However, according to official government records, the overall number of Iraqis in 2007 
was between 450,000 and 500,000.44 The presence of large numbers of Iraqis has put a 
strain on the country&#8217;s economy, resources and infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>51. Refugee women are affected by the same conservative attitudes that prevent 
Jordanian women from taking full advantage of their legal rights and that stigmatize victims 
of abuse. Refugee women also suffer from legal inequalities with respect to marriage, 
divorce and child custody. With regard to sexual and gender-based violence, not only do 
refugee women fear the same social stigma and shame associated with these types of 
crimes, but their unwillingness to report and seek justice is exacerbated by the uncertainty 
of their status in the country.   
</p>
<p>52. In 2011, UNHCR dealt with 128 cases of sexual and gender-based violence against 
refugee women, most of which occurred in the home. Causes and risks factors for violence 
against women in the refugee population include loss of security, lack of alternatives to 
cope with socio-economic changes, disrupted roles within the family and community, and a

<p>breakdown of social structures, in addition to the lack of knowledge of their individual 
rights in national and international laws.45 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>53. According to article 6 (i) of the Constitution, all Jordanians are equal before the law, 
and discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, language or religion. In addition, the 
National Charter of 1991 establishes that Jordanian men and women are equal under the 
law and that there shall be no distinction between them in rights and obligations. Despite 
these provisions, there are currently some laws that are discriminatory to women, such as 
those relating to nationality and marriage.  
</p>
<p>54. In early 2011, following the rise of pro-democracy movements in the Arab region 
and in response to demonstrations and protests taking place in the country, King 
Abdullah II initiated a process of political and economic reform, and established the Royal 
Committee on Constitutional Review. This was seen by the women&#8217;s movement as an ideal 
</p>
<p>opportunity to raise the issue of non-discrimination and to advocate for the word &#8213;gender&#8214; 
to be added to article 6 of the Constitution. Women&#8217;s rights activists and organizations 
carried out a nationwide campaign with the support of prominent activists and 
parliamentarians and with the endorsement of JNCW. However, despite the positive 
expectations and popular support for the proposed changes,46 in its final recommendations 
presented in August 2011, the Royal Committee on Constitutional Review did not include 
adding the word &#8213;gender&#8214; to article 6. Despite further lobbying carried out by the women&#8217;s 
movement at the Parliamentary level, the decision was confirmed by the Cabinet and both 
Houses of Parliament, when the Constitutional amendments were passed in September 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>55. During interviews with the Special Rapporteur, several activists argued that 
including the word &#8213;gender&#8214; would have given women an instrument they could use to 
challenge discriminatory laws or policies and help harmonize current legislation with the 
international obligations of Jordan. Among the arguments made by Parliamentarians who 
rejected the amendment was that the Constitution already provides equal rights to &#8213;all 
</p>
<p>Jordanians&#8214; and that the word &#8213;Jordanians&#8214; includes both sexes. However, some NGO 
stakeholders asserted that the addition was rejected due to fears of upsetting the religious 
leadership, who were actively demanding political changes in the country. 
</p>
<p>56. Furthermore, the approved Constitutional amendments included the addition of the 
following text in article 6: &#8213;The family is the foundation of the society. It is founded on 
religion, morals and patriotism. The law preserves its legal entity, strengthens its ties and 
values, protects under it motherhood and childhood and cares for youth and people with 
disabilities and protects them from exploitation.&#8214;47 This text further entrenches a traditional 
view of women as mothers and as individuals in need of protection.  
</p>
<p>  
 45 Information provided by UNHCR during interviews. 
 46 According to the Arab Women Organization (AWO), at least one opinion poll showed that 89 per

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>57. Jordan ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women on 1 July 1992, yet the Convention only became enforceable after its 
publication in the <i>Official Gazette</i> on 1 August 2007.48 The Convention was ratified with 
reservations to article 9, paragraph 2 (regarding nationality), article 15, paragraph 4 
(regarding freedom to choose a place of residence and domicile), and article 16, paragraph 
1 (c), (d) and (g) (regarding marriage and divorce, parental rights and responsibilities, and 
personal rights under marriage, respectively).  
</p>
<p>58. In 2003, the interim Passports Act was enacted, which allowed women and their 
children to obtain passports without the written permission of their husbands. Accordingly, 
in August 2009, Jordan lifted its reservation to article 15, paragraph 4, of the Convention. 
Following her country visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the 1969 Passport 
Act was being reviewed to incorporate the provisions of the interim Act through the proper 
constitutional channels.49 However, while this review is being completed the temporary Act 
has been annulled, including provisions allowing women to obtain their own passports, to 
travel, and to choose a place of residency without the consent of their guardians.50 
</p>
<p>59. Jordan still maintains reservations on article 16 of the Convention, which advocates 
for taking all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters 
relating to marriage and family relations. Under Jordanian law, women still do not enjoy 
equal rights and responsibilities with regard to marriage, divorce, custody issues and 
personal status. Jordan also maintains its reservations to article 9, paragraph 2, and women 
are still denied the right to confer their nationality to their children. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Nationality 
</b></p>
<p>60. Under the current Nationality Act (No. 6 of 1954), only Jordanian men can transmit 
their nationality to their children or their foreign spouse. Jordanian women do not enjoy this 
right when marrying a foreigner, although they may retain their nationality. According to 
Act No. 24 of 1973 on Residence and Foreigners&#8217; Affairs, children and spouses who are not 
Jordanian nationals require a yearly residency permit to access government health services 
and must pay individual annual residency fees. Arguments in support of these provisions 
include that allowing women to transfer their nationality would encourage the immigration 
and assimilation of foreigners, which, in the case of women married to Palestinian men, 
would affect efforts to secure the right of return. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Personal status 
</b></p>
<p>61. Matters of personal status for Muslims in Jordan, including marriage, divorce and 
child custody issues, fall within the jurisdiction of sharia law, on which the Personal Status 
Act (No. 61 of 1976) is based.  
</p>
<p>62. A guardianship system still applies whereby a male relative acts on behalf of an 
unmarried woman under the age of 40 (whether divorced, widowed or single), and she is 
considered his economic dependent. Therefore, marital contracts are signed between a man 
and a woman&#8217;s guardian, with an exception for women marrying for the second time (who

<p>  
 48 As per Court of Cassation decision No. 818/2003, &#8213;international treaties and conventions take

No provision of domestic law may prevail over the provisions of an international convention&#8214;

<p>do not require family approval) or if a sharia judge decides a guardian&#8217;s opposition to the 
marriage is legally unjustified.51  
</p>
<p>63. Amendments made to the Personal Status Act in 2001 and 2010 have introduced a 
number of changes for women, which are considered extremely positive by several 
advocates, as they refer to controversial issues that had not been open to discussion 
previously. For example, the minimum age of marriage was increased for both boys and 
girls to 18 years of age. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the marriage of 
a girl over 15 years of age can still be approved by a judge if he or she finds such marriage 
to be in the best interest of the girl. This provision is exclusive to girls and therefore highly 
discriminatory, as it reinforces views of girls having different rates of physical and 
intellectual development than boys, and further obstructs girls&#8217; possibilities of completing 
</p>
<p>their education before marriage. 
</p>
<p>64. Under article 19 of the Personal Status Act, a woman is entitled to set certain 
conditions before agreeing to marry, such as being entitled to finish her education. It is 
argued, however, that this right is rarely exercised by women, as they are unaware of these 
provisions in the Act or feel they may jeopardize their marriage by attempting to exercise 
them.52 Article 66 of the Act establishes men&#8217;s obligations to provide materially and 
financially for their wives. Men are allowed to marry up to four wives, but only if a judge 
verifies that they are financially capable of providing support to all. Also courts need to 
ensure that women are aware of the existence of other wives. However, this might only be 
communicated after the marriage has taken place as there is no requirement that women be 
consulted or informed prior to the marriage. The practice of polygamy is legally sanctioned, 
but it is not a common practice, mainly due to financial constraints.  
</p>
<p>65. With regard to divorce, men have the right to divorce their spouses without 
providing any reasons. The divorce has to be registered by a court and women are entitled 
to continue receiving financial support for at least a year after the divorce takes place. 
Women are also entitled to keep their dowry in these cases. Women may file for a judicial 
divorce at the sharia court, but they have to provide evidence and witnesses to support their 
application. Grounds for divorce can include domestic abuse, the husband&#8217;s failure to 
provide financially, or unjustified and prolonged absences. It is reported that these divorce 
processes are often lengthy and are usually denied. Alternatively, women can also resort to 
<i>khula</i>, which is the unilateral ending of the marriage where women have to return the 
dowry and renounce any future financial support from husbands. In these cases, women are 
not required to provide a valid reason or justification. This is not a feasible option in a 
context of financial dependence.53  
</p>
<p>66. As regards child custody within marriage, the Personal Status Act only allows for 
men to act as guardians of children. After a divorce, a woman has custody of her children 
until they reach the age of puberty and children then decide who they wish to live with. If a 
woman remarries, she will lose custody of her children, who will return to their father or his 
family. Even when the mother has custody of a child, the father is still considered to be the 
legal guardian and final decision-maker with regard to issues such as the child&#8217;s 
education.54 The Act also allows fathers to prevent their children from travelling abroad 
with their mothers.55

<p><b> 4. Labour  
</b></p>
<p>67. The right to work and to equal opportunities is established through article 23 of the 
Constitution. Article 2 of the Labour Code (Act No. 8 of 1996), defines workers as &#8213;each 
person, male or female, who performs a job in return for wages&#8214;. Similarly, equal 
</p>
<p>consideration of men and women as workers is provided in the Civil Service Ordinance 
(No. 30 of 2007), which regulates employment in the public sector.56 However, there are no 
specific provisions within Jordanian labour laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of 
sex and/or gender.   
</p>
<p>68. Women also face certain legal restrictions (under article 23 of the Constitution and 
article 69 of the Labour Code) to participate in specific activities or engage in night-time 
labour. These provisions are intended as protective measures to ensure safe working 
conditions for women. Through amendments made in 2008, article 29/6 of the Labour Code 
now addresses sexual abuse and harassment, and allows women victims to terminate 
contracts and claim compensation for damages. However, some interviewees reported that 
women are still unaware of these provisions and do not know how to file a claim. 
Furthermore, the Code only provides for compensation if the abuse was committed by the 
employer and does not include cases in which the perpetrator is another employee.57  
</p>
<p>69. Other discriminatory provisions are reflected in the Social Security Act, which refers 
to benefits for surviving spouses of women employees. Unlike the spouses of male 
employees, who would receive their pension automatically, surviving spouses of female 
employees need to meet certain criteria, such as being completely disabled or having no 
other source of income, to receive these benefits.58  
</p>
<p>70. With regard to migrant workers, article 3 of the Labour Code was amended in 
August 2008 to include agricultural workers, domestic workers, cooks, gardeners and other 
migrant workers. Although regulations were issued in October 2009 to monitor 
employment contracts, recruitment methods, and compliance with fair working hours, 
effective inspection by the Ministry of Labour is reportedly still a challenge.59 
</p>
<p><b> 5. The Protection against Family Violence Act  
</b></p>
<p>71. In January 2008, the Parliament enacted the Protection against Family Violence Act 
with the aim of &#8213;preserving family ties and minimizing the impact of criminal acts in cases 
of violence among family members&#8214; (CEDAW/C/JOR/5, para. 29). The Act is also aimed 
at establishing the confidentiality of the proceedings, imposing alternative penalties, and 
establishing precautionary measures for the safety of victims and other family members. 
</p>
<p>72. The Act established &#8213;family reconciliation committees&#8214; to enable parties to find 
amicable solutions before a case is taken to court. According to article 7 of the Act, 
&#8213;preference shall be given to referrals to family reconciliation committees prior to taking 
any of the protective measure stipulated in this Act, providing that the family&#8217;s best interest 
is taken into consideration&#8214;.60 The Special Rapporteur was informed that regulations for the 
Act were recently adopted and family reconciliation committees have been established.

<p>73. The Act provides for the court to issue protection orders when necessary and 
establish penalties against perpetrators for violating protection orders and re-offending. 
Courts might also establish the payment of compensation to victims (CEDAW/C/JOR/5, 
para. 29). The Act allows the police to enter a location where victims are at risk and take 
the necessary measures to protect them from perpetrators. Perpetrators may sign pledges 
promising not to commit any harm, but the police may also decide to remove perpetrators 
from the location, based on their risk assessment. Other protective measures include police 
detaining perpetrators up to 24 hours and courts restricting perpetrators from approaching 
the shelters where victims are living.61   
</p>
<p>74. Despite positive provisions in this legislation, obstacles still remain with regard to 
the definition of violence, which is limited to violence occurring within the family; the 
explicit focus on family reconciliation as a preferred solution; and the low levels of 
implementation of this Act by the courts since it was enacted. The norm is a practice of 
resolving cases through reconciliation and not through accountability measures such as 
prosecution and punishment of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>75. Several national institutions are involved in the fight against family violence, with 
NCFA as the lead organization. It was under the umbrella of NCFA that efforts were 
coordinated in 2005 to launch the National Framework for Family Protection, aimed at 
coordinating all ministerial efforts to assist victims of violence, as well as the National 
Strategy for Family Protection (2005&#8211;2009) to enhance partnerships and coordination 
between governmental and non-governmental institutions working on family affairs. As a 
direct result of these two initiatives, the Protection against Family Violence Act was 
enacted in 2008 and special departments on family violence were established within the 
Ministries of Health, Education, Justice, and Social Development. NCFA also serves as the 
secretariat of the National Team for Family Protection, a multi-agency, high-level technical 
team composed of both governmental and non-governmental institutions that oversee the 
implementation of the National Framework and the National Strategy for Family 
Protection. One of the main contributions of NCFA as regards violence against women has 
been the development and sharing of expertise on family counselling services with both 
governmental and non-governmental service providers.   
</p>
<p>76. Another crucial institution working on the promotion of women&#8217;s rights and the 
elimination of violence against women is JNCW. This Commission is the national 
institution for women and is in charge of promoting the economic, social, cultural and 
political advancement of women through the implementation of the Government&#8217;s National 
Strategy for Women. The strategy for the period 2006-2010 included the elimination of 
violence against women as one of its key objectives, and it strove to develop human rights-
based approaches to the issue. As part of these efforts, the Sham&#8217;a (&#8213;candle&#8214;) network was 
established to monitor the violence against women component of the National Strategy for 
Women and to conduct training and awareness activities for law enforcement officers and 
other actors within the judicial system.  
</p>
<p>77. As the national human rights institution, NCHR has also joined institutional efforts 
to address the issue of violence against women using a human rights-based approach. It is 
in a privileged position to inform national efforts, as part of its mandate includes receiving

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>individual complaints and issuing recommendations on human rights violations, including 
cases of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>78. Finally, specific structures to address violence in the family have been established at 
the ministerial level in at least three crucial ministries:  
</p>
<p>(a) FPD is part of the Public Security Directorate and has a distinct mandate to 
investigate and handle cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse. The department is 
mandated to carry out investigations, follow up on cases, and provide victims with 
specialist services, including legal, social and psychological services. FPD works in close 
partnerships with other institutional stakeholders, particularly with the Ministry of Social 
Development;  
</p>
<p>(b) The Ministry of Social Development is the main institution in charge of 
providing women victims of violence with services, in cooperation with non-governmental 
organizations. In 2007, the Ministry established the Dar Al Wifaq shelter to provide lodging 
and protection for women victims of domestic violence and their children. It is currently 
leading intergovernmental efforts to establish a new centre for, in particular, women who 
are at risk as regards so-called honour killings. As with most of the institutional efforts to 
address this issue, the main goal of the Ministry is to achieve family reconciliation between 
survivors and their families;  
</p>
<p>(c) Within the Ministry of Health, the Woman and Child Health Directorate has 
a specific section on domestic violence, which has designed and disseminated specialized 
manuals and training for medical service providers to identify and refer cases of family 
violence against women and children. Pilot programmes have been launched in three 
hospitals and six health centres in Amman, Zarka and Irbid, and Family Protection 
Committees have been established in each of these institutions, with specialized medical 
staff in collaboration with forensic medicine specialists. The Forensic Medicine Directorate 
within the Ministry has played a pivotal role in raising awareness and providing technical 
expertise in the identification and proper handling of domestic violence cases. 
</p>
<p>79. Although these institutions work in a coordinated manner and have established clear 
referral systems for cases of violence against women, adequate data collection and 
monitoring systems are still lacking. Furthermore, most services provided by these 
institutions are limited to the short term, and no long-term solutions are currently available 
for survivors, particularly for women who do not enjoy any family support and/or who are 
at risk.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Main remaining challenges 
</b></p>
<p>80. The status of women in Jordanian society has been gradually changing, and today 
women enjoy, in principle, equal rights with men with regard to issues such as political 
participation, education and employment. Through the ratification of international human 
rights instruments, amendments to national legislation, and the design and implementation 
of relevant policies and programmes, the Government has taken positive steps towards 
gender equality in the country. Nevertheless, women still suffer discrimination in law and 
in practice. As discussed in section IV above, current legislation still discriminates against 
women in issues such as nationality and citizenship rights, as well as pension and social 
security rights. Even in cases where positive legislative amendments have been made, the 
implementation of the law is still hampered by the persistence of patriarchal cultural norms 
and customs which result in de facto discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>81. Many of the obstacles faced by the Government in its attempts to achieve women&#8217;s 
empowerment, their participation in public and political life and the elimination of violence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> 19 
</b></p>
<p>against women, emerge at the community level, through gender stereotypes that the society 
has come to accept as norms. Several stakeholders, both from the Government and from 
civil society, referred to Jordanian society as a conservative, patriarchal and tribal society, 
in which limitations to women&#8217;s empowerment come from within families and 
communities, including community leaders. Another recurring message from several 
interviewees was that tradition, and not always religion, is at the source of discrimination 
and violence against women in the country. It is in the way that religion is interpreted that 
socially created gender stereotypes which increase society&#8217;s reticence to change are 
perpetuated. Obstacles emanating from traditional and religious leaders, some 
parliamentarians, and local authorities sometimes undermine efforts undertaken by the 
executive branch to promote more progressive views on the role of women within society. 
</p>
<p>82. Although the Jordanian culture is highly respectful of women, among the 
conservative sectors of the country, this respect appears to be conditional upon women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>behaviour and adherence to their traditional roles as mothers, daughters and wives. Some 
sectors of the society still struggle to see women as independent, empowered and 
autonomous individuals. Therefore, many of the efforts to protect women against violence 
tend to be paternalistic and restrictive, under the justification of protection.  
</p>
<p>83. A paternalistic view of women as vulnerable individuals in need of protection is 
particularly evident in the prevalence of the <i>Welaya</i> or guardianship system which is 
currently still in place. Available legal responses to violence against women, which 
prioritize reconciliation and women&#8217;s reintegration into the family structure, are also a 
reflection of the lack of real opportunities for survivors of violence to rebuild their lives 
independently, as this is viewed as socially unacceptable. 
</p>
<p>84. Several interlocutors made reference to being raised in a culture of mistrust and fear: 
fear of the unknown, fear of their male schoolmates or work colleagues, fear of walking 
alone or taking a taxi, and, especially, fear of being judged by society. Fear of social stigma 
is particularly worrying, as it represents as important obstacle for women victims of 
violence, particularly sexual violence, to speak up and seek legal redress. A culture of fear 
also has direct effects on women&#8217;s sense of empowerment and agency and plays a role in 
</p>
<p>their educational and career choices, which are not necessarily based on women&#8217;s real 
interests or the development needs of the country. Choices are thus limited by perceptions 
of security and appropriateness, which then limit women&#8217;s active participation in the 
country&#8217;s economic, political and social development.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Government of Jordan has acknowledged the need to ensure equality and 
non-discrimination for women in the country, and has taken some important steps to 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieve their integration into education, employment and politics. However, given the 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional roles that the majority of women have conventionally undertaken, a purely 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal or programmatic approach will not be sufficient to achieve the ultimate goal of 
</b></p>
<p><b>substantive and not just formal equality.  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Holistic solutions are required that address both the individual empowerment 
of women and also the social, economic and cultural barriers that are a reality in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>lives. Empowerment must be coupled with social transformation to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>systemic and structural causes of inequality and discrimination, which often lead to 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against women.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to address the 
following recommendations to the Government of Jordan. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Law and policy reforms

</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Approve the necessary amendments to include the explicit prohibition of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination on the basis of sex and gender within article 6 (i) of the Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This would provide a more effective legal tool to assist in challenging discriminatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws and policies and also would serve to educate and raise awareness of the human

</b></p>
<p><b>the executive and judicial branches at the national and local levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Provide for additional temporary special measures, including quotas and 
</b></p>
<p><b>preferential treatment, to advance women</b>&#8217;<b>s integration into education and the

</b></p>
<p><b>within the private sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Amend the Labour Code to eliminate any legal restrictions to the 
</b></p>

<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Design and launch targeted awareness-raising campaigns to educate and 
</b></p>
<p>change societal attitudes, particularly those that view women&#8217;s bodies as repo<b>sitories
