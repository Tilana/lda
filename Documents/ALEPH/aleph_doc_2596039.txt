About AFC Energy
AFC Energy plc has developed an alkaline fuel cell system, which converts hydrogen into
"clean" electricity. AFC's key project POWER-UP demonstrated the world's largest operational
alkaline fuel cell system at Air Products' industrial gas plant in Stade, Germany in January 2016. 
The Company is now looking to build upon an already established pipeline of commercial
opportunities and drive the findings from the development phase of the technology into
technically optimised and commercially relevant fuel cell systems.  For further information, please
