<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>visited Malaysia from 23 to 28 February 2015, at the invitation of the Government. In 
</p>
<p>the present report, the Special Rapporteur highlights the country&#8217;s commitment to 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons, as evidenced by its legislative and policy framework, 
</p>
<p>and its multidisciplinary approach in taking anti-trafficking measures, which involves 
</p>
<p>key Government agencies and some civil society organizations (CSOs). She nonetheless 
</p>
<p>expresses concern about, inter alia, the focus on trafficking for the purpose of sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation to the neglect of other forms of trafficking, particularly labour trafficking; 
</p>
<p>and the restrictive national immigration policy focused on rapid deportation of irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants, which does not provide the opportunity for accurate identification of and 
</p>
<p>provision of assistance to victims of trafficking. Other concerns include the placement of 
</p>
<p>victims in shelters without freedom of movement and the capacity gap of enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials which is further exacerbated by reported prevalence of corruption of some 
</p>
<p>officials. On that basis, the Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations to 
</p>
<p>the Government, including with regard to ratification of key international legal 
</p>
<p>instruments, strengthening of national legislation and policies to combat trafficking, and 
</p>
<p>increasing capacity-building activities for government officials. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also encourages the Government to address key gaps in the assistance provided to 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking, especially in terms of providing them with effective remedies, and 
</p>
<p>increasing the involvement of CSOs in the provision of assistance to victims. She also

<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, visited Malaysia from 23 to 28 February 2015, at the 
</p>
<p>invitation of the Government. The objectives of the visit were to examine the prevalent 
</p>
<p>forms of trafficking in persons in the country and to assess the effectiveness of measures 
</p>
<p>taken by the Government to combat trafficking in persons and to protect the human rights 
</p>
<p>of trafficked persons.  
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, Rembau 
</p>
<p>and Kota Kinabalu in the State of Sabah. She met high-level officials, including the 
</p>
<p>Minister and Senior Deputy Secretary General (Security) of Home Affairs, the Director 
</p>
<p>General of the Labour Department (Peninsular) of the Ministry of Human Resources, the 
</p>
<p>Minister of International Trade and Industry, the Minister of Women, Family and 
</p>
<p>Community Development, and the Deputy Secretary General (Multilateral Affairs) of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She also met with the Chief Registrar of the Federal Court, the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General of Police of the Royal Malaysia Police and the Secretary General 
</p>
<p>of the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities. She also exchanged views with 
</p>
<p>members of the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants. 
</p>
<p>3. She interacted with various interlocutors, including the representatives of relevant 
</p>
<p>authorities at the State level, particularly the Sabah State Government in Kota Kinabalu. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also met representatives of CSOs working in the field of trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons. She visited an immigration detention centre (Semenyih), as well as three 
</p>
<p>government shelters for women (Sabah), children (Rembau) and men (Melaka) victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and interviewed some of them. She also met with representatives of the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission and civil society. Finally, she exchanged views with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the United Nations agencies and programmes in the country, as well as 
</p>
<p>representatives of the diplomatic community. The Special Rapporteur expresses her 
</p>
<p>gratitude to the Government for its invitation and cooperation and to the CSOs for their 
</p>
<p>valuable inputs 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the context of Vision 2020, a national programme which aims to propel the 
</p>
<p>country to becoming a developed nation by the year 2020, Malaysia has achieved 
</p>
<p>remarkable economic growth over the last five decades, bolstered by low wages, oil 
</p>
<p>revenues, foreign direct investment targeted at the manufacturing sector and high global 
</p>
<p>demand for its commodities, in particular palm oil.1  
</p>
<p>5. The Malaysian economy relies largely on foreign migrant workers. In an estimated 
</p>
<p>labour force of 12.9 million in 2012, 1.6 million documented and an estimated 1.3 million 
</p>
<p>undocumented foreign workers contributed to its low-wage economic growth strategy.2 The 
</p>
<p>geographic location and extended coastline of Malaysia further draw a large influx of 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>foreign migrant workers from the Asian region, notably from Bangladesh, Cambodia, 
</p>
<p>Indonesia, India, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, 
</p>
<p>Thailand and Viet Nam, who willingly embark on the journey to Malaysia in search of 
</p>
<p>better employment opportunities in the manufacturing, plantation, construction and 
</p>
<p>agriculture sectors and domestic work.  
</p>
<p>6. While not all cases of migration result in trafficking, there are cases of mixed 
</p>
<p>migration that includes asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, who then end up being 
</p>
<p>trafficked. Moreover, the prevalence of undocumented migrant workers increases their risk 
</p>
<p>of becoming victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>7. Malaysia faces challenges as a destination and, to a lesser extent, a transit and source 
</p>
<p>country for men, women, girls and boys subjected to trafficking in persons. As a destination 
</p>
<p>country, it receives trafficked persons, mainly from East Africa, the Middle East and South 
</p>
<p>Asia. Trafficked persons may also transit through Malaysia to destination countries in the 
</p>
<p>Middle East. Malaysians are trafficked to countries such as China, France, Japan, 
</p>
<p>Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  
</p>
<p>8. The present report focuses on the prevalent forms of trafficking in Malaysia as a 
</p>
<p>destination and transit country and assesses the effectiveness of its counter-trafficking 
</p>
<p>responses within the country. The Special Rapporteur learned that the forms of trafficking 
</p>
<p>listed below are particularly widespread in the country.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking for labour exploitation  
</b></p>
<p>9. Typically, cases of labour trafficking in Malaysia involve low- and semi-skilled 
</p>
<p>migrant workers from the Asia and Pacific region intended for arduous and unpleasant 
</p>
<p>work in the agricultural, construction and manufacturing sectors and domestic work. There 
</p>
<p>are also indications that fishermen mainly from Cambodia and Myanmar are trafficked for 
</p>
<p>bonded labour to work on Thai fishing boats in Malaysian waters. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>was informed that those who escape from those boats to the Malaysian coast are often re-
</p>
<p>trafficked to palm oil plantations in Sarawak State. 
</p>
<p>10. Victims of labour trafficking are recruited through fraud and deception about the 
</p>
<p>type and conditions of employment by unscrupulous recruitment agents &#8212; in source 
</p>
<p>countries and Malaysia &#8212; and employers; most commonly victims are exploited through 
</p>
<p>breaches of contracts, payment of excessive recruitment and immigration fees, reduction or 
</p>
<p>non-payment of salary, excessive working hours and a lack of rest days. Many find 
</p>
<p>themselves in a situation akin to debt bondage, trying to repay exorbitant debts owed to 
</p>
<p>traffickers (including recruitment agencies) from their journey when promises of well-
</p>
<p>paying employment turn into exploitative situations.  
</p>
<p>11. Migrant workers are dependent on their employers for their work permit, which is 
</p>
<p>necessary to legally remain in Malaysia. This leaves trafficked workers in a vulnerable 
</p>
<p>position: if they report or escape their exploitative conditions, employers can simply revoke 
</p>
<p>their work permit, making them irregular migrants who will lose their livelihood and be 
</p>
<p>expelled from the country. In some cases, foreign workers&#8217; vulnerability to exploitation is 
</p>
<p>heightened when employers neglect to obtain proper documentation for workers or employ 
</p>
<p>workers in sectors other than those for which they were granted an employment visa. 
</p>
<p>Practices such as employers withholding passports are reportedly common and contribute to 
</p>
<p>the trafficking situation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trafficking for domestic servitude 
</b></p>
<p>12. Over 300,000 migrant domestic workers are estimated to be in Malaysia,3 the 
</p>
<p>majority of whom are women from Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines. While all 
</p>
<p>domestic workers are not victims of trafficking, a large number of those women and girls 
</p>
<p>are trafficked into domestic servitude by employment agencies in their home country or 
</p>
<p>Malaysia or employers in Malaysia, at times with the alleged complicity of State officials. 
</p>
<p>Many fall victims to debt bondage when they assume an initial debt as part of the terms of 
</p>
<p>employment. Widely reported abuses and exploitation that further contribute to the 
</p>
<p>trafficking situation include breaches of contract, excessive recruitment fees, non-payment 
</p>
<p>of salary, deductions from low wages, excessive working hours, a lack of rest days and the 
</p>
<p>withholding of passports. Many domestic workers have also experienced unimaginable 
</p>
<p>physical and mental abuse at the hand of their employers, from being deprived of food to 
</p>
<p>beatings with electrical wires, scalding with hot water, harassment, psychological abuse and 
</p>
<p>sexual assault.  
</p>
<p>13. Owing to the hidden nature of their work, which is carried out in private homes, and 
</p>
<p>to fear of arrest and eventual deportation, such workers are unable to leave their employers 
</p>
<p>and seek redress for human rights violations. In the rare instances where complaints are 
</p>
<p>lodged with the police by the victims or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), those 
</p>
<p>complaints are not acted upon. Instead, it is not uncommon for the victims to be intimidated 
</p>
<p>for having left their employers and to be returned to those employers or their employment 
</p>
<p>agency with threats, rather than being offered protection and alternative employment. 
</p>
<p>14. Moreover, underage victims, whose personal information and age are incorrectly 
</p>
<p>reflected in their passports/documents by recruitment agencies, face additional distress in 
</p>
<p>escaping their abusive employers for fear of being caught and reprimanded for having 
</p>
<p>falsified documents. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Trafficking for sexual exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>15. Malaysia is a destination for the trafficking of women, girls and boys into the sex 
</p>
<p>industry. Factors contributing to trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation 
</p>
<p>include the demand for sexual services, the prevalence of tourism and the existence of a 
</p>
<p>large migrant worker community. Young foreign women (including those from East Africa, 
</p>
<p>the Middle East, the Russian Federation and South Asia) are lured with false promises of 
</p>
<p>legal work in Malaysia, such as domestic work, babysitting, waitressing and modelling, but 
</p>
<p>are subsequently coerced into the commercial sex trade. Since 2014, CSOs have also noted 
</p>
<p>an increase in the prevalence of trafficking in boys for work in the sex industry in Malaysia. 
</p>
<p>Trafficking of children for sexual exploitation is reportedly emerging within communities 
</p>
<p>of irregular migrants.  
</p>
<p>16. Additionally, there is a growing trend of trafficking victims to employers/businesses 
</p>
<p>to gratify the sexual needs of male migrant workers. Some employers are also known to 
</p>
<p>reward the performance of employees by providing sexual incentives. Moreover, there are 
</p>
<p>indications of Vietnamese women and girls who enter into brokered marriages in Malaysia 
</p>
<p>and are subsequently forced into sexual exploitation to repay their &#8220;marriage&#8221; debts, which 
</p>
<p>range from 4,000 to 6,000 United States dollars. Trafficking of Malaysian girls and women 
</p>
<p>for sexual exploitation to tourist destinations within the country has also been noted.

<p>17. As a transit country, victims from Indonesia primarily transit through Malaysia en 
</p>
<p>route to Middle Eastern countries to circumvent anti-trafficking protection measures put in 
</p>
<p>place by their governments. 
</p>
<p>18. Organized crime syndicates are allegedly responsible for some trafficking cases. 
</p>
<p>They usually take advantage of the vulnerable and disadvantaged situations of the victim, 
</p>
<p>arrange for their travel to Malaysia and process their travel documents and visas, including 
</p>
<p>student visas. Once in Malaysia, the victims&#8217; passports are confiscated and they are forced 
</p>
<p>to provide sexual services to repay the debts incurred for their travel. If they refuse, they are 
</p>
<p>beaten up and threatened that if they run away or go to the police they would risk 
</p>
<p>imprisonment before being deported for immigration offences and/or soliciting prostitution. 
</p>
<p>They are watched and accompanied at all times. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Other forms of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>19. Refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia lack recognition of their status or the 
</p>
<p>ability to work legally in Malaysia, which is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating 
</p>
<p>to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol thereto.4 As a result, this category of persons 
</p>
<p>is subject to becoming vulnerable to trafficking. This is especially true for Rohingya from 
</p>
<p>Myanmar, who typically embark on maritime and overland journeys, often via Thailand, to 
</p>
<p>reach Malaysia. Initially smuggled across borders, some are subsequently trafficked to 
</p>
<p>fishing boats and palm oil plantations for labour exploitation, ending up in bonded labour to 
</p>
<p>repay their debts from the transport. Others are held captive and abused in Malaysia until 
</p>
<p>ransom is paid by their relatives. 
</p>
<p>20. There are also indications of child trafficking for the purpose of forced begging 
</p>
<p>among the refugee population, mostly Rohingya children. Most perpetrators in the cases 
</p>
<p>identified are allegedly family members or traffickers who pass off these children as their 
</p>
<p>own.  
</p>
<p>21. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was informed that a significant number of 
</p>
<p>refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons, particularly those from the Filipino and 
</p>
<p>Indonesian communities in Sabah and Rohingya from Myanmar, are increasingly becoming 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking. Their lack of formal recognition significantly restricts their and their 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s ability to obtain education, employment opportunities, health services, freedom 
</p>
<p>of movement and access to justice. This in turn makes them easy prey for unscrupulous 
</p>
<p>traffickers and employers who exploit them with impunity. Their children are vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>being trafficked for labour exploitation. There is also anecdotal information that 
</p>
<p>undocumented older children are easily trafficked for &#8220;drug-running&#8221;. Finally, there are 
</p>
<p>also reports of children being trafficked for adoption purposes from Singapore to childless 
</p>
<p>families in Malaysia (the destination country). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Criminalization of irregular migration and the impact on trafficked 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the economy of Malaysia relies to a large 
</p>
<p>extent on the low- or semi-skilled labour of migrant workers, particularly in such sectors as 
</p>
<p>construction, manufacturing, services, plantation, agriculture and plantations, and domestic 
</p>
<p>work. However, the Special Rapporteur observed that the approach of Malaysia to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Nevertheless, Malaysia provides assistance and protection on a case-by-case basis to some refugees 
</p>
<p>and asylum seekers in collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Refugees and other international organizations. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>migration effectively relies on the criminalization of irregular migrants. Where not 
</p>
<p>carefully designed, such an approach increases the vulnerability of irregular migrants to 
</p>
<p>becoming victims of trafficking because they are criminalized. She cautions that migration 
</p>
<p>projects can turn into trafficking when migrants are placed in exploitative situations during 
</p>
<p>their journeys or at their destination, when their rights are drastically limited or completely 
</p>
<p>denied. The categorization of all migrants as irregular or undocumented is detrimental to 
</p>
<p>the identification of potential victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>23. Irregular migration is prohibited under the Immigration Act (1959). The law 
</p>
<p>envisages severe penalties for convicted undocumented workers, who are subject to fines 
</p>
<p>up to 10,000 Malaysian ringitt, up to five years&#8217; imprisonment and deportation. Whipping 
</p>
<p>(caning) of those convicted for irregular entry is not an uncommon penalty.  
</p>
<p>24. Undocumented migrants who are arrested may legally be held up to 14 days before 
</p>
<p>being brought to a magistrate, contrary to the 24-hour time frame guaranteed in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. Sentences are passed following summary hearings in special immigration 
</p>
<p>courts by magistrates, some of whom have a reportedly low capacity to deal with migration, 
</p>
<p>refugee, asylum or trafficking issues. Given the expedited nature of the proceedings, it is 
</p>
<p>also not clear to what extent judicial guarantees, such as legal representation and the 
</p>
<p>explanation of available remedies, are systematically provided to migrants. Following these 
</p>
<p>hearings, the migrants are placed in detention centres awaiting deportation.  
</p>
<p>25. The strong political inclination towards criminalizing and prosecuting irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants may have unintended negative consequences for the victims of trafficking, in spite 
</p>
<p>of some protection against immigration-related criminal prosecution provided for in the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking Act (2007). Irregular migrants wanting to report abuse, including 
</p>
<p>trafficking and labour exploitation, risk exposing themselves to the real danger of being 
</p>
<p>charged for the offence of &#8220;irregular entry or stay&#8221;, detained and ultimately expelled. As a 
</p>
<p>result, many irregular migrants are afraid to contact the authorities and avoid seeking legal 
</p>
<p>protection and remedies, even when they are entitled to them. This approach, which 
</p>
<p>emphasizes national security, leads to the criminalization of victims for crimes committed 
</p>
<p>while being trafficked and for which they should not be held liable.5  
</p>
<p>26. In order to promote safer labour migration, the Government entered into bilateral 
</p>
<p>memorandums of understanding with several neighbouring countries (see part J below) that 
</p>
<p>facilitate and provide legal avenues for migration and the recruitment of migrant workers 
</p>
<p>from these countries. Furthermore, in an attempt to regularize the situation of irregular 
</p>
<p>migrant workers already in the country, the Government launched the Illegal Immigrant 
</p>
<p>Comprehensive Settlement Programme in 2011, whereby irregular migrants were allowed 
</p>
<p>to register and be either legalized or deported back to their countries without prosecution. It 
</p>
<p>is noteworthy that the handling of irregular migrants by Malaysia has occasionally become 
</p>
<p>an issue of contention with neighbouring countries.  
</p>
<p>27. Nevertheless, opportunities for safe migration for low-skilled labour remain 
</p>
<p>inadequate. The regulation of employment agencies is ineffective, regardless of the fact that 
</p>
<p>licensing of new employment agencies is on hold and licenses of existing agencies will not 
</p>
<p>be extended beyond 2021.

<p>against Transnational Organized Crime (hereinafter, the Trafficking in Persons Protocol) 
</p>
<p>and a number of international human rights instruments, including the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child. It has also ratified the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), the 
</p>
<p>Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) and the Worst Forms of Child 
</p>
<p>Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO).  
</p>
<p>29. Regrettably, Malaysia is not party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
</p>
<p>Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto or the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of 
</p>
<p>Stateless Persons and lacks a formal legislative and administrative framework to address 
</p>
<p>refugee matters. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
</p>
<p>Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 
</p>
<p>2011 (No. 189) and the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, have also 
</p>
<p>not been ratified, while the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) was 
</p>
<p>denounced in 1990. 
</p>
<p>30. At the regional level, Malaysia is a founding member of the Association of 
</p>
<p>Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is party to a number of binding and non-binding 
</p>
<p>instruments including the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration and the Treaty on Mutual 
</p>
<p>Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Among Like-Minded ASEAN Member Countries. It 
</p>
<p>supports the ASEAN sectoral bodies, such as the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion 
</p>
<p>and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children and the ASEAN Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Migrant Workers. As a member of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons and Related Transnational Crime, Malaysia continues to support the practical 
</p>
<p>measures to help combat trafficking in persons and related transnational crime in the Asia 
</p>
<p>and Pacific region.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) National framework 
</b></p>
<p>31. At the national level, slavery and forced labour are prohibited under section 6 of the 
</p>
<p>Federal Constitution.  
</p>
<p>32. The country&#8217;s Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2007 was amended in 2010 and 
</p>
<p>renamed the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act (hereinafter, 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking Act). In accordance with the Trafficking in Persons Protocol, the adopted 
</p>
<p>definition of trafficking in persons is comprehensive and criminalizes all aspects of 
</p>
<p>trafficking, including labour trafficking (sect. 2 (g)). Trafficking in persons for the purpose 
</p>
<p>of exploitation carries a penalty of up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine (sect. 12). The 
</p>
<p>offence of trafficking in persons by means of threat; use of force or other forms of coercion; 
</p>
<p>abduction; fraud; deception; abuse of power; abuse of the position of vulnerability; or 
</p>
<p>payments/benefits to obtain the consent of a person having control over a trafficked person 
</p>
<p>is punishable by between 3 and 20 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine (sect. 13). Profiting from 
</p>
<p>the exploitation of a trafficked person can lead to up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment, payment of 
</p>
<p>fines and forfeiture of the profits from the offence (sect. 15). The offence of bringing in 
</p>
<p>transit a trafficked person through Malaysia or facilitating such act can result in 
</p>
<p>imprisonment of up to 7 years and a fine (sect. 15A). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>33. Trafficking in children is punishable with imprisonment ranging from 3 to 20 years 
</p>
<p>and a fine (sect. 14). In accordance with the Trafficking in Persons Protocol, when the 
</p>
<p>trafficking offence involves children, it is irrelevant whether the consent of the trafficked 
</p>
<p>child was obtained (sect. 16). 
</p>
<p>34. The law envisages punishment for trafficking offences committed by corporate 
</p>
<p>bodies, employees or their agents (sect. 64). Cases of trafficking that occur in Malaysia as a 
</p>
<p>source, transit or destination country are offences under the Act. It is also applicable to 
</p>
<p>offences committed by Malaysian citizens and permanent residents outside Malaysia. 
</p>
<p>(sects. 3 and 4). 
</p>
<p>35. In addition to the Anti-Trafficking Act, other legislation may be invoked to 
</p>
<p>prosecute trafficking or trafficking-related offences. The Penal Code punishes offences that 
</p>
<p>may amount to trafficking and other forms of exploitation, such as trafficking for purposes 
</p>
<p>of prostitution (sects. 372 and 373) and forced labour (sect. 74). It criminalizes habitual 
</p>
<p>dealing in slaves (sect. 371). Prostitution is not a criminal offence per se under the Penal 
</p>
<p>Code, but soliciting prostitution leads to up to one year&#8217;s imprisonment and/or a fine (sect. 
</p>
<p>372 B). Exploitation of a person for the purposes of prostitution; living on or trading in 
</p>
<p>prostitution of another person; and owning and managing brothels lead to up to 15 years&#8217; 
</p>
<p>imprisonment, whipping and payment of fines (sects. 372 and 372A). Moreover, foreign 
</p>
<p>prostitutes or persons living on or receiving the proceeds of prostitution are considered as 
</p>
<p>prohibited migrants and subject to expulsion from the country under section 3e of the 
</p>
<p>Immigration Act (1955). 
</p>
<p>36. The Employment Act (1955) sets out minimum labour protection standards and is 
</p>
<p>applicable to employees whose wages are RM 2,000 and below, and all manual labourers 
</p>
<p>irrespective of their wages. Among other provisions, the Act provides for the limitation of 
</p>
<p>working hours, the provision of paid leave and overtime pay. Its scope extends to foreign 
</p>
<p>employees together with, inter alia, the Employment (Restriction) Act 1968 (Revised 
</p>
<p>1988), which governs employment permits, registration and restrictions for non-Malaysian 
</p>
<p>citizens, and the Immigration Act (1957). Domestic workers, labelled as &#8220;domestic 
</p>
<p>servants&#8221;, are covered by the Employment Act. However, they are excluded from 
</p>
<p>protection under key articles of the law, including those on fair termination of contract 
</p>
<p>(arts. 12 and 14), the minimum number of working days per month (art. 16), maternity 
</p>
<p>provisions (part IX), rest days (part XII), hours of work, holidays and other conditions of 
</p>
<p>service (including annual and sick leave) and termination, lay off and retirement (part 
</p>
<p>XIIA). They are also not within the purview of the Domestic Violence Act (1994), which 
</p>
<p>provides legal protection for victims of violence in the home and supplements the Penal 
</p>
<p>Code. 
</p>
<p>37. The Children and Young Persons (Employment) (Amendment) Act 2010 provides 
</p>
<p>for the conditions of their employment in light work within the family, specific public 
</p>
<p>entertainment, apprenticeships and work sponsored by the Government. It forbids night 
</p>
<p>work and underground work for children and young persons and sets forth hours of work. 
</p>
<p>38. The Private Employment Agencies Act (1981) regulates the recruitment agencies. It 
</p>
<p>requires all recruitment agencies to be licensed and to deposit a security bond, and limits 
</p>
<p>the amount of fees that can be charged for recruitment services. It also provides the 
</p>
<p>Director General of Labour with broad inspection and investigatory powers, including the 
</p>
<p>ability to cancel licences and to dispose of the recruitment bond for breaches. Offences 
</p>
<p>listed in the Act include overcharging for recruitment agency services and providing false </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>or incorrect information. However, complaint mechanisms are unspecified and worker 
</p>
<p>rights and obligations are not defined.6 
</p>
<p>39. The Child Act (2001) establishes standards for the treatment of children and 
</p>
<p>provides for the care, protection and rehabilitation of children in need. The Act prohibits 
</p>
<p>exploitative acts often committed in the process of trafficking, such as the procurement of a 
</p>
<p>child for purposes of prostitution/the purposes of sexual intercourse either within/outside 
</p>
<p>Malaysia (sects. 43 and 44). Moreover, the transfer of custody or control of a child for any 
</p>
<p>valuable consideration is considered an offence under section 48. It also condemns the 
</p>
<p>bringing into Malaysia of a child by false pretences and the taking out of Malaysia a child 
</p>
<p>without appropriate consent of his/her legal custodian (sects. 49 and 52).  
</p>
<p>40. The Passports Act (1966), which also aims at preventing the abduction and 
</p>
<p>trafficking of children, criminalizes the withholding of passports and documents with 
</p>
<p>payment of fine or up to 5 years&#8217; imprisonment or both (sect. 12 (d)). 
</p>
<p>41. Other legislation relevant to cases of trafficking in persons include the Maritime 
</p>
<p>Enforcement Agency Act (2004), the Customs Act (1967), the Security Offences (Special 
</p>
<p>Measures) Act (2012) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 
</p>
<p>(2001). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy framework  
</b></p>
<p>42. Since 2010, Malaysia has been pursuing a five-year National Plan of Action to 
</p>
<p>Combat Trafficking in Persons which focuses on nine programme areas, including 
</p>
<p>strengthening legal mechanisms, joint action of law enforcement agencies, prevention, 
</p>
<p>protection and rehabilitation, capacity-building and partnership. While considering the 
</p>
<p>policy is a positive initiative to address human trafficking, particularly labour trafficking, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur was not provided with any information regarding the achievements 
</p>
<p>generated by the plan, its implementation and monitoring. At the time of the visit, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed that the action plan for 2015&#8211;2020 was being finalized. 
</p>
<p>43. Another policy relevant to the trafficking effort is the policy on the recruitment of 
</p>
<p>foreign workers (1991), which provides guidelines for the treatment of foreign workers. 
</p>
<p>This provides that wages, benefits and terms of conditions of employment should be similar 
</p>
<p>to those for nationals, that migrant workers should have written contracts and that costs of 
</p>
<p>recruitment and repatriation should be borne by the employer. Nevertheless, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur received information that this policy is not often enforced. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>44. The Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants was 
</p>
<p>established in 2008. It is responsible for, inter alia, coordinating the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking Act in cooperation with government departments and international 
</p>
<p>organizations. It is mandated to collect data and monitor migration patterns with a view to 
</p>
<p>formulating and implementing anti-trafficking policies and programmes that focus on 
</p>
<p>prevention and protection of victims. It also advises the Government on developments at 
</p>
<p>the international level (see Anti-Trafficking Act, sect. 7). 
</p>
<p>45. The multidisciplinary structure of the Council is led by the Ministry of Home 
</p>
<p>Affairs, which acts as its secretariat at the national and provincial levels. The Council 
</p>
<p>comprises of the Attorney General and high-ranking officials of various government 
</p>
<p>agencies, including the Ministries of Internal Security; Foreign Affairs; Women, Family 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>and Community Development; Human Resources; Transport; and Information, 
</p>
<p>Communication and Culture. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern the absence of 
</p>
<p>key government offices dealing with industry, trade, plantations and the construction and 
</p>
<p>textile sectors, areas in which human trafficking may take place. She encourages the 
</p>
<p>Government to pursue its intention of enlarging the Council to include additional relevant 
</p>
<p>institutions at the peninsular and State levels.  
</p>
<p>46. The Council is composed of five committees: (a) the Legislation Committee, headed 
</p>
<p>by the Attorney General&#8217;s Chambers; (b) the Victim Protection and Rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>Committee headed by the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development; 
</p>
<p>(c) the Media and Publicity Committee, headed by the Ministry of Information, 
</p>
<p>Communication and Culture; (d) the Special Committee to Study the Issues of Labour 
</p>
<p>Trafficking, headed by the Ministry of Human Resources; and (e) the Enforcement 
</p>
<p>Committee, headed by the Royal Malaysian Police. The main functions of the latter 
</p>
<p>committee are to rescue victims of trafficking and detain perpetrators, investigate cases, 
</p>
<p>prevent trafficking, raise awareness and build capacity of its members. 
</p>
<p>47. Furthermore, the National Human Rights Institution plays an active role in 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons, as it also receives and inquires into complaints of alleged 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, including complaints relating to trafficking in persons, and 
</p>
<p>monitors shelters and detention facilities. It proposes and formulates policies and standard 
</p>
<p>operating procedures, raises awareness and engages with stakeholders at the national, 
</p>
<p>regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur commends the establishment of the Council and its 
</p>
<p>initiatives to combat trafficking. However, she observed that coordination of work between 
</p>
<p>government bodies remains a challenge, partly owing to their varying level of commitment 
</p>
<p>to the issue of trafficking and their understanding of trafficking and its impact on/relevance 
</p>
<p>to their work. Of further concern is the limited information-sharing and disjointed 
</p>
<p>coordination between government bodies at the federal and State levels, particularly noted 
</p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur in Sabah, for instance, where a number of authorities appeared 
</p>
<p>not to be aware of the anti-trafficking initiatives and work undertaken by the Council. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, while five NGOs are formally affiliated with the Council and included in policy 
</p>
<p>discussions, there is a need to widen the scope of civil society participation.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>49. Members of the Enforcement Committee of the Council, namely officers from the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking Unit of the Royal Malaysian Police, the Immigration Department, the 
</p>
<p>Royal Malaysian Customs, the maritime agencies and the Labour Department, have the 
</p>
<p>primary responsibility for identifying trafficked persons in collaboration with each other. 
</p>
<p>The identification of victims is undertaken on the basis of standard operating procedures for 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies dealing with human trafficking and smuggling of migrants developed 
</p>
<p>by the Council in 2013. 
</p>
<p>50. While there is increasing recognition of trafficking for labour exploitation, 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons in Malaysia is viewed primarily as a problem concerning women and 
</p>
<p>children trafficked for sexual exploitation. Statistics from the Royal Police reveal that from 
</p>
<p>2008 to 2014, 509 cases of trafficking for sexual exploitation were identified, while 291 
</p>
<p>cases of trafficking for forced labour were identified and none was identified for other 
</p>
<p>forms of exploitation.7 This is partly explained by the fact that raids and rescues conducted 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 Royal Malaysian Police, statistics provided during the visit of the Special Rapporteur. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>by the police in entertainment/sex industry are the main means of identifying victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur heard allegations of the corruption of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers which often hampers the effective identification of trafficked persons. She was 
</p>
<p>informed of numerous cases in which immigration, police and maritime enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers were directly implicated in trafficking in persons or turned a blind eye to the 
</p>
<p>situations of trafficked persons. The prevalence of corruption coupled with the inadequate 
</p>
<p>capacity of enforcement officers to accurately identify trafficked persons results in deep 
</p>
<p>mistrust of law enforcement officers by trafficked persons and those at risk of being 
</p>
<p>trafficked, such as migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p>52. There are two categories of labour officers within the Labour Department of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Human Resources: generalists, who conduct inspections to identify forced 
</p>
<p>labour in workplaces, and specialists. As they are enforcement officers, specialist labour 
</p>
<p>inspectors are also empowered to identify and investigate cases of trafficking, as well as 
</p>
<p>rescue victims. They also apprehend suspects and testify in court.  
</p>
<p>53. In 2014, a total of 42,804 labour inspections were conducted in the country; 30,228 
</p>
<p>in peninsular Malaysia; 7,952 in Sabah and 4,624 in Sarawak. Specialist labour inspectors 
</p>
<p>investigated seven cases, of which two were identified as cases of trafficking while five 
</p>
<p>cases were referred for investigation under the Employment Act. These figures suggest that 
</p>
<p>cases involving the confiscation of passports or the withholding of salaries are often 
</p>
<p>misidentified as labour offences owing to the absence of clarity on what trafficking for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of labour exploitation is and what are other labour cases, and the fact that labour 
</p>
<p>inspectors specialized in labour trafficking are too few for the number of workplaces and 
</p>
<p>not sufficiently trained.  
</p>
<p>54. Other factors that contribute to the lack of identification of cases of trafficking in 
</p>
<p>sectors typically linked with it is the lack of clear understanding of the issue of trafficking 
</p>
<p>by authorities; an attitude which could hamper national anti-trafficking initiatives. A case in 
</p>
<p>point is the apparent unwillingness of the Ministry of Plantation Industries and 
</p>
<p>Commodities to identify possible situations of trafficking for labour exploitation on the 
</p>
<p>grounds that the palm oil market is highly competitive and tightly regulated and that the 
</p>
<p>frequent use of child labour in this sector is culturally accepted. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>wishes to emphasize that, in an industry relying on low-skilled migrant workers and given 
</p>
<p>the prevalent practice of recruiting foreigners to work in the industry and credible 
</p>
<p>information from stakeholders, the occurrence of human trafficking cannot be excluded 
</p>
<p>from this sector. 
</p>
<p>55. There is also a real danger that victims of trafficking are misidentified as irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants, resulting in their arrest, detention and deportation. Once in the immigration 
</p>
<p>detention centre, the Special Rapporteur found there was no possibility for potential victims 
</p>
<p>to be identified and their deportation reversed. In this regard, she noted that of the four 
</p>
<p>persons she interviewed at random at an immigration detention centre in the course of her 
</p>
<p>visit, two could have been identified as trafficking cases by trained officers. Yet, these 
</p>
<p>persons will be deported without proper assessment of whether or not their return would be 
</p>
<p>safe or whether they will be at risk of re-trafficking.  
</p>
<p>56. In addition, there is a lack of appropriate infrastructures and services designed to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the identification of trafficked persons, such as hotlines dedicated to trafficked 
</p>
<p>victims. The Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development maintains a 
</p>
<p>national helpline, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week to address a variety of 
</p>
<p>social concerns, such as domestic violence and child abuse. Similarly, a Kuala Lumpur 
</p>
<p>police hotline operates 24 hours a day to receive public complaints on a number of issues. 
</p>
<p>Regrettably, these hotlines are available only in Bahasa Malaysia and English, despite the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>fact that trafficked persons in Malaysia mostly speak other languages. The lack of capacity 
</p>
<p>of operators to accurately identify victims from among the callers and to provide 
</p>
<p>information for their protection is an additional aspect that hinders identification. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Protection 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Shelters 
</b></p>
<p>57. Protection officers appointed by the Ministry of Women, Family and Community 
</p>
<p>Development are responsible for the protection, care and supervision of victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in shelters (see Anti-Trafficking Act, sect. 43). Protection for identified or 
</p>
<p>potential victims of trafficking is provided on the basis of interim protection orders and 
</p>
<p>protection orders issued by magistrates. Identified or potential victims of trafficking are 
</p>
<p>placed by enforcement officers in temporary custody and brought before a magistrate 
</p>
<p>within 24 hours for the purpose of obtaining an interim protection order, under which they 
</p>
<p>are placed in a shelter for 14 days while an investigation is carried out. On the basis of the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the inquiry of both the enforcement and the protection officers, the magistrate 
</p>
<p>indicates that a person is a victim of trafficking in need of care and protection by issuing a 
</p>
<p>protection order that places victims from Malaysia and those permanently residing in the 
</p>
<p>country up to two years in a shelter (see Anti-Trafficking Act, sects. 44&#8211;51). Foreigners 
</p>
<p>who are identified as victims of trafficking stay in a shelter for three months before being 
</p>
<p>expulsed to their country of origin. Whereas those not found to be victims are immediately 
</p>
<p>deported. Protection orders can be extended under exceptional circumstances, such as when 
</p>
<p>the victim&#8217;s evidence is still being collected. 
</p>
<p>58. In 2014, 1,684 individuals rescued were granted interim protection orders, of whom 
</p>
<p>303 were granted protection orders and placed in the government shelter. The 
</p>
<p>overwhelming majority of victims identified were female (295 female and 8 male victims) 
</p>
<p>mainly from Indonesia (141), Viet Nam (91) and the Philippines (31).8 
</p>
<p>59. The Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development currently runs eight 
</p>
<p>shelters. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the standard of the three government 
</p>
<p>shelters for children, women and men victim to trafficking that she visited, which were 
</p>
<p>modern, clean and provided limited access to psychological, medical, language and other 
</p>
<p>support services in collaboration with a handful of NGOs. While the committed and 
</p>
<p>dedicated staff in the shelters do their utmost within available resources, there is an evident 
</p>
<p>lack of capacity to provide victims with comprehensive support, including psychological 
</p>
<p>and legal. For instance, although trafficked victims in the shelters come from various 
</p>
<p>countries and speak different languages and dialects, there are no on-site interpreters 
</p>
<p>available to assist them on a daily basis. Furthermore, trafficked persons are not provided 
</p>
<p>with suitable educational and vocational training during their stay in the shelter. Women 
</p>
<p>and girls are provided with vocational training traditionally associated with women, such as 
</p>
<p>sewing, cocking and handicrafts, which may not correspond with their ambitions and 
</p>
<p>talents, or the needs of the labour market.  
</p>
<p>60. What is perhaps more alarming is that assisted victims are kept in closed shelters 
</p>
<p>and deprived of freedom of movement and punished for escaping. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is concerned that, in effect, such shelters are equivalent to detention centres where 
</p>
<p>trafficked persons are treated as criminals in custody rather than victims placed in a refuge 
</p>

<p>for care and protection from further harm. Victims are also prohibited from working while 
</p>
<p>in shelters.  
</p>
<p>61. The fact that they are unable to leave and work outside the shelter is reported to 
</p>
<p>create a strong disincentive among trafficked persons in Malaysia to be identified as such. 
</p>
<p>Nearly all of the victims that the Special Rapporteur interviewed were not clear of the 
</p>
<p>significance of their status and its resulting entitlement and expressed their wish to be 
</p>
<p>released from the shelter to work and pay back debts.  
</p>
<p>62. Some CSOs have the capacity to provide protection and assistance to victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking. However, they are currently not legally considered protection officers and are 
</p>
<p>not able to contribute to the fight against trafficking. Their support is sought on an ad hoc 
</p>
<p>basis because of the lack of enabling legislation designating them as protection officers 
</p>
<p>with a responsibility for the care of victims and the identification of victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur hopes that the pilot project being considered by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Women, Family and Community Development to enable NGOs to manage shelters will be 
</p>
<p>implemented, taking into consideration, inter alia, the need of victims and the capacities 
</p>
<p>and autonomy of NGOs. Additionally, NGO-run shelters are not recognized as official 
</p>
<p>places of refuge for victims of trafficking. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the intention 
</p>
<p>of the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants to bring 
</p>
<p>about the amendment of the Anti-Trafficking Act for a more effective collaboration with 
</p>
<p>CSOs is realized without delay. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-criminalization of trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p>63. Section 25 of the Anti-Trafficking Act provides for the non-criminalization of 
</p>
<p>identified trafficked persons for offences related to their irregular entry and unlawful 
</p>
<p>residence in Malaysia, as well as the procuring and possession of fraudulent travel 
</p>
<p>documents for the purpose of entering the country. However, immunity from 
</p>
<p>criminalization is not provided to all the offences committed by victims as a consequence 
</p>
<p>of their trafficking, although it would be possible to provide such exemptions on a case-by-
</p>
<p>case basis under the general exception part of the Penal Code.9 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Rescue operations  
</b></p>
<p>64. According to information provided by the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
</p>
<p>and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants, in 2014, six integrated operations to rescue victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking were conducted jointly by police, customs, maritime enforcement, immigration 
</p>
<p>and labour officers, in addition to individual operations by those enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>Raids, particularly in the entertainment/sex industry, were the main means of identifying 
</p>
<p>victims.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that such operations often do not fully 
</p>
<p>respect victims&#8217; human rights as victims and points out that the limited information offered 
</p>
<p>to them, often not translated into the victim&#8217;s language, does not take into account why they 
</p>
<p>have been apprehended or what their rights are at the time of the raid and in subsequent 
</p>
<p>interviews and during detention. Physical and emotional abuses by law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers were also mentioned during the interviews. Moreover, images and photographs of 
</p>
<p>such victims regularly feature in the media, in spite of the guarantees of privacy envisaged 
</p>
<p>under the Anti-Trafficking Act. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See, for example, section 94 of the Penal Code which provides general exceptions for acts to which a 
</p>
<p>person is compelled by threats to commit.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>66. Investigation for offences under the Anti-Trafficking Act (sect. 28) is conducted by 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers, who include police, immigration, customs and maritime officers, with 
</p>
<p>the power to arrest, conduct search and seizure, and examine persons. Considered as 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers, labour inspectors are also empowered to identify and respond to 
</p>
<p>trafficking for forced labour. A standard operating procedure for enforcement officers (see 
</p>
<p>para. 49 above) guides the methods of accomplishing tasks and establishes general 
</p>
<p>performance standards, including in the area of investigation, raid, arrest, rescue and 
</p>
<p>networking/coordination among enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>67. A number of factors hamper the effective and swift investigation of trafficking 
</p>
<p>cases. These include limited coordination among enforcement agencies and the lack of 
</p>
<p>skills to handle cases of trafficking, as well as corruption. Moreover, it has been brought to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention that, on several occasions, credible requests to further 
</p>
<p>investigate cases of trafficking of children for begging in well-known hotspots have 
</p>
<p>remained unheeded.  
</p>
<p>68. A corollary of this is the low rate of prosecution. The Attorney General&#8217;s office 
</p>
<p>reported that 38 cases of trafficking were prosecuted in 2014: interestingly, the majority of 
</p>
<p>cases (26 cases) were for forced labour exploitation, while 12 were for sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>However only three convictions were secured in those cases of labour exploitation, two 
</p>
<p>ended in acquittals, one case was thrown out and the rest were still pending trial. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was also informed of penalties against an employer who had 
</p>
<p>confiscated the passports of 29 victims of trafficking and who was fined RM 5,000. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the positive measures taken to prosecute 
</p>
<p>cases of human trafficking. These include the appointment of 28 deputy public prosecutors 
</p>
<p>within the Attorney General&#8217;s Chambers who are specialized in trafficking; the issuance of 
</p>
<p>a directive to investigate all cases involving foreign nationals under the Anti-Trafficking 
</p>
<p>Act, except where the offences committed fall within ordinary criminal law; the issuance of 
</p>
<p>another directive for the referral of all cases of trafficking investigated to the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Chambers before instituting prosecution and offering the possibility of 
</p>
<p>converting charges made against perpetrators under the Penal Code and Immigration Act to 
</p>
<p>charges under the Anti-Trafficking Act; and the introduction of a coding system for 
</p>
<p>registering cases of trafficking to ensure proceedings take priority in court. A standard 
</p>
<p>operating procedure for prosecution launched in 2013 aims to standardize and create a 
</p>
<p>uniform approach to dealing with cases of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>70. The authorities cited the reluctance of victims to cooperate with law enforcement 
</p>
<p>authorities as one of the main reasons for low prosecution rates. While noting that 
</p>
<p>assistance to victims should be provided irrespective of their collaboration with authorities, 
</p>
<p>as provided in the Anti-Trafficking Act and the Trafficking in Persons Protocol, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur wishes to highlight that short reflection periods (three months for foreigners), 
</p>
<p>lengthy human trafficking trials, limited legal assistance and information on the case, 
</p>
<p>confinement in shelters, the inability of victims to work while in confinement, fear of 
</p>
<p>reprisal when reporting traffickers and deportation are factors that further discourage 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking from identifying themselves as such and collaborating with the 
</p>
<p>enforcement authorities. 
</p>
<p>71. Furthermore, in spite of ad hoc training on the Anti-Trafficking Act, prosecutors and 
</p>
<p>judicial officers were not sufficiently familiar with this law. Lack of clarity of what 
</p>
<p>constitutes trafficking for forced labour and what are other labour crimes also emerged as a 
</p>
<p>concern affecting the investigation and adjudication of such cases. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Redress 
</b></p>
<p>72. Compensation and restitution are an integral part of effective remedies for victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking under international law and standards.10 In Malaysia, neither compensation nor a 
</p>
<p>national compensation scheme for victims of trafficking is envisaged under the Anti-
</p>
<p>Trafficking Act. Nevertheless, victims of trafficking may file separate civil and criminal 
</p>
<p>claims for compensation, although information on cases in which victims were awarded 
</p>
<p>such compensations was not available (see Criminal Procedure Code, sect. 426).  
</p>
<p>73. Another important means of redress, specifically for victims of labour trafficking, is 
</p>
<p>the recovery of unpaid wages. While not envisaged under the Anti-Trafficking Act, victims 
</p>
<p>may nevertheless raise claims against their employers through either of two administrative 
</p>
<p>processes, one before the Labour Department for claims concerning wages or any other 
</p>
<p>payments in cash due to them (wrongful deductions, unpaid wages or unpaid compensation 
</p>
<p>in the event of workplace injuries) and the other through the Industrial Relations 
</p>
<p>Department for unfair dismissal (see Employment Act (1955), sect. 69, and Industrial 
</p>
<p>Relations Act (1967)). 
</p>
<p>74. In certain circumstances, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that permanent or 
</p>
<p>temporary residence in itself may be a necessary and appropriate form of remedy. This 
</p>
<p>consideration is particularly pertinent in the case of Malaysia, where trafficked persons 
</p>
<p>returned to their country of origin can be at serious risk of being re-trafficked or of severe 
</p>
<p>violations of their human rights. In this regard, she acknowledges the recent steps taken by 
</p>
<p>the Government to allow victims of labour trafficking to remain and work legally in 
</p>
<p>Malaysia (see para. 77 below). 
</p>
<p>75. Besides operating on the assumption that victims are aware of their rights and 
</p>
<p>systematically benefit from legal assistance, the above-mentioned redress mechanisms 
</p>
<p>require victims to take additional steps and incur costs for lengthy trials. Moreover, tying 
</p>
<p>restitution to the successful conviction of perpetrators in civil and criminal proceedings 
</p>
<p>makes restitution contingent upon victims&#8217; cooperation in judicial processes. This prevents 
</p>
<p>those victims who are reluctant to file complaints against their traffickers, and those whose 
</p>
<p>cases were unsuccessful in court, from obtaining restitution and compensation. There are 
</p>
<p>also concerns that cases resulting in the awarding of compensation are limited to cases of 
</p>
<p>labour exploitation in sectors other than the entertainment/sex industry. Moreover, there is a 
</p>
<p>risk of victims of labour trafficking who file cases against their employers being deported 
</p>
<p>as a result of the cancellation of their work permits by those employers. Finally, the 
</p>
<p>capacity of practitioners to correctly distinguish between cases of labour trafficking and 
</p>
<p>other labour disputes also affects the type of redress awarded to victims. In the face of these 
</p>
<p>obstacles, many victims opt to give up their rights to pursue claims, even if their cases are 
</p>
<p>compelling.11  
</p>
<p><b> H. Repatriation and reintegration  
</b></p>
<p>76. Under the Anti-Trafficking Act, the fate of all victims of trafficking, whether 
</p>
<p>identified or not, is their immediate removal from Malaysia (see Anti-Trafficking Act, 
</p>
<p>sects. 51 and 54, and Immigration Act, sects. 8 and 32). However, it is not clear what the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 Trafficking in Persons Protocol art.6 (6) and the principles and guidelines on human rights and human 
</p>
<p>trafficking, guideline 9.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>procedures of return are and what safeguards are in place to ensure their safety and avoid 
</p>
<p>their re-victimization.  
</p>
<p>77. In January 2012, victims of trafficking were allowed to take up employment in the 
</p>
<p>country after completion of their stay in shelters. Subsequently, the first group of 33 
</p>
<p>victims, composed of Bangladeshi and Indians, took up employment offers. In March 2014, 
</p>
<p>a government policy amending the Anti-Trafficking Act provided victims of labour 
</p>
<p>trafficking who do not require further care and protection with the possibility of working 
</p>
<p>before their protection order runs out. Upon fulfilment of some conditions/requirements, 
</p>
<p>victims involved mainly in cases related to wages dispute can obtain special immigration 
</p>
<p>passes renewable on a monthly basis. These passes cost RM 100, are only renewable for up 
</p>
<p>to three months and do not grant the right to work. Upon securing new employment, the 
</p>
<p>victims are issued with temporary employment work passes. Those who are unable to 
</p>
<p>secure new employment within the stipulated period will be sent back to their countries.12 
</p>
<p>At the time of visit of the Special Rapporteur, eight female victims of trafficking had been 
</p>
<p>allowed to remain and work in Malaysia as domestic workers and as workers in an 
</p>
<p>international hotel through this programme. 
</p>
<p>78. While these are encouraging initiatives, the Government&#8217;s policy may be applicable 
</p>
<p>to only a very limited number of victims of trafficking. Having valid travel documents for 
</p>
<p>entry into Malaysia, a valid contract of employment and the financial means to pay the 
</p>
<p>monthly fees for the special passes are prerequisites for victims to be considered under this 
</p>
<p>programme. They also depend on the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs, embassies 
</p>
<p>and employers&#8217; approval for time off to enable victims to participate in legal procedures. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the scope of this policy restricts its application to victims of trafficking for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of labour exploitation only and does not address other types of exploitation, 
</p>
<p>contrary to both the Anti-Trafficking Act and the Trafficking in Persons Protocol.  </p>
<p><b> I. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Public awareness 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Government has taken a number of measures aimed at preventing trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, primarily in the form of awareness-raising campaigns and publications. In 2014, it 
</p>
<p>launched 5,126 campaigns13 through media such as radio, television and publications to 
</p>
<p>raise public awareness about trafficking issues, and distributed information about 
</p>
<p>trafficking in Bahasa Malaysia, Mandarin, Tamil and other languages. NGOs and the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Institution contribute to the dissemination of information. Yet, 
</p>
<p>despite the increased attention devoted to the issue, some stakeholders have expressed 
</p>
<p>concern about the difficulty of ensuring that these awareness-raising efforts appropriately 
</p>
<p>target trafficked persons, those at risk of being trafficked or otherwise exploited, their 
</p>
<p>employers or employment agencies.  
</p>
<p>80. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges these efforts, she underscores the 
</p>
<p>importance of addressing demand as a prevention strategy, which, in the context of 
</p>
<p>Malaysia, includes demand for exploitative labour and sex. With regard to the demand for 
</p>
<p>exploitative labour of migrant workers, including domestic workers, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>stresses that the protection of labour rights is essential in reducing demand and in 
</p>
<p>preventing exploitation from occurring in the first place. The regulation, licensing and

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>monitoring of recruitment and employment agencies has yet to be effective in preventing 
</p>
<p>exploitation of migrant workers. There is also a critical need to raise the awareness of 
</p>
<p>employers and employment agencies about the labour rights of all workers under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law and standards in order to avoid trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Safe migration 
</b></p>
<p>81. Current immigration practices focus on criminalizing rather than protecting the 
</p>
<p>migrant labour force, which includes victims of trafficking, refugees and asylum seekers, 
</p>
<p>who lack formal recognition in Malaysia.  
</p>
<p>82. In this regard, she wishes to reiterate that more opportunities for safe migration, i.e., 
</p>
<p>legal, gainful and non-exploitative, are needed if Malaysia is to effectively address the 
</p>
<p>demand for exploitable labour and fulfil its obligations to respect, protect and promote the 
</p>
<p>labour rights of all workers, including migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Public-private partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>83. Globally, the prevention of trafficking through public-private partnerships is gaining 
</p>
<p>ground. Through self-regulatory mechanisms such as corporate social responsibility, 
</p>
<p>businesses have taken steps to, inter alia, try to remove from their supply chains trafficked 
</p>
<p>labour.  
</p>
<p>84. In Malaysia, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about the recent initiatives 
</p>
<p>of the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants to engage 
</p>
<p>with the electronic, airline and plantation industries. In this regard, she notes that dialogue 
</p>
<p>and training sessions related to forced labour were provided to four companies within the 
</p>
<p>electronic industry sectors in Shah Alam, Penang and Johor Bahru; collaboration with 
</p>
<p>AirAsia Foundation to implement an AirAsia anti-human trafficking programme was 
</p>
<p>initiated; and dialogues were held with several palm oil associations and the National Union 
</p>
<p>of Plantation Workers.14 She was also encouraged by the recent initiative whereby an 
</p>
<p>international hotel in Kuala Lumpur provided work opportunities for 4 victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking.15 These initiatives are indeed encouraging, although they remain an exception. 
</p>
<p>Preventing trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation and other exploitation being 
</p>
<p>used in national, international and multinational businesses should be the aspiration of all 
</p>
<p>ethical business in Malaysia. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>85. The contribution of and collaboration with CSOs are crucial in the fight against 
</p>
<p>human trafficking. The National Plan of Action 2010&#8211;2015 aspires, inter alia, to establish 
</p>
<p>close engagement and interaction with those CSOs with relevant knowledge and skills in 
</p>
<p>the areas of policy, prevention, protection, rehabilitation and prosecution. However, in 
</p>
<p>practice, only a very limited number of CSOs (five) take part in the Council for Anti-
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants and somewhat contribute to its 
</p>
<p>anti-trafficking work, particularly in the provision of assistance to victims. The need has 
</p>
<p>emerged for immediate steps to be taken to establish the necessary legal framework and

</p>
<p><b> 2. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>86. Malaysia has concluded a number of memorandums of understanding on security 
</p>
<p>and combating transnational organized crime with Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, 
</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Malaysia also 
</p>
<p>benefits from cooperation with the United Nations, international and regional organizations 
</p>
<p>in areas such as training, assistance to victims of trafficking, repatriation and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising. 
</p>
<p>87. At the regional level, Malaysia spearheaded and ratified the Treaty on Mutual Legal 
</p>
<p>Assistance in Criminal Matters Among Like-Minded ASEAN Member Countries. As the 
</p>
<p>current chair of ASEAN, it is working towards the development of a ASEAN convention 
</p>
<p>on trafficking in persons and a regional plan of action to combat trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>Malaysia continues to support the Bali process and is also part of the ASEAN Association 
</p>
<p>of Heads of Police, an arrangement for informal cooperation on law enforcement efforts 
</p>
<p>that could also potentially focus on trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts of Malaysia to fight trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>in persons, as reflected in the promulgation and amendment of the Anti-Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>Act and the multidisciplinary approach to anti-trafficking measures, which involves 
</b></p>
<p><b>key government agencies and some CSOs. Malaysia has also promoted bilateral and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional cooperation with other countries in the region.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>It is difficult to determine the trends and scope of trafficking in Malaysia in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>absence of </b>a comprehensive assessment. Consequently, the State&#8217;s main focus is on 
</p>
<p><b>combating the sexual exploitation of women and girls, with little attention paid to 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking for labour exploitation. The restrictive immigration policy focused on 
</b></p>
<p><b>rapid deportation of irregular migrants does not provide the opportunity for accurate 
</b></p>
<p><b>identification of and provision of assistance to victims of trafficking. There is a gap in 
</b></p>
<p><b>its capacity to quickly and accurately identify victims of trafficking which is further 
</b></p>
<p><b>exacerbated by the prevalence of corruption of some enforcement officials. The rate of 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution of trafficking cases also remains very low, which perpetuates the impunity 
</b></p>
<p>of traffickers and obstructs victims&#8217; access to justice.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur has serious concerns that the stay of victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking in shelters may amount to detention. In addition to infringing fundamental 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights relating to freedom of movement and protection from detention,</b>16<b> this 
</b></p>
<p><b>presents a risk to their well-being. Staff in the shelters, despite being committed and 
</b></p>
<p><b>dedicated, require specialized training and capacity-building. While acknowledging 
</b></p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s efforts to raise awareness, <b>the Special Rapporteur notes that 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention is still at an early stage.

</b></p>
<p>91. <b>On the basis of the above findings, and in the spirit of cooperation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue, the Special Rapporteur offers the following recommendations to Malaysia: 
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Ratify without delay the International Convention on the Protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Ratify, without delay, ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 
</b></p>
<p><b>189); the ILO Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 and ILO 
</b></p>
<p><b>Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No.</b> <b>105);  
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Ratify, without delay, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Establish, with countries of origin, transit and of destination, bilateral 
</b></p>
<p><b>and multilateral agreements for the exchange of information, mutual legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>and safe returns in order to jointly tackle the root causes of trafficking in persons in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the region and implement existing agreements focusing on the human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficked victims. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>With respect to the national framework, she recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>Fast-track the amendment of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti</b>&#8211;
</p>
<p><b>Smuggling of Migrants Act and other relevant policies in compliance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Especially Women and Children. Inter alia, the amendment should focus on human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and victims and provide victims in shelters with freedom of movement, a legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>stay in Malaysia and employment while awaiting the outcome of their legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings and beyond; non-criminalization of victims for all crimes committed in 
</b></p>
<p><b>relation with their status as victims; compensation of victims; and the granting to 
</b></p>
<p><b>NGOs of the status of protection officer to further contribute to the anti-trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>work; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Recognize the need for a foreign workforce and develop and review 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing safe migration pathways, acknowledging that the current approach to 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration management, especially the recruitment of foreign labour via unscrupulous 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment agencies, may favour human trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Amend the Employment Act in order to provide greater protection for 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrant workers, including domestic workers, in accordance with international legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Revise regulation of employment agencies and implement it stringently,

<p><b>and regularly monitor the activities of those agencies already licensed and take 
</b></p>
