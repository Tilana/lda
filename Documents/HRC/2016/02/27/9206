<p><b>Views on conclusions and /or recommendations, voluntary commitments

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>1. At the 18th meeting of the Human Rights Council, on 11 June 2008, during the adoption of 
the final outcome of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) on Guatemala, H. E. Mr. Carlos Ramiro 
Mart&#237;nez Alvarado, Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Guatemala to the United Nations 
and other International Organizations in Geneva, indicated that it was an honour to receive on 
behalf of the Government of Guatemala the report of the UPR Working Group. Guatemala 
welcomed the various recommendations resulting from the review that took place on 6 May 2008. 
Guatemala fully concurs with the concerns on specific issues reflected in the recommendations. It 
reiterated the political will of the current Government of Guatemala and the importance and priority 
that it attaches to the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. Guatemala highlighted the considerable challenge it will be facing to implement in practice 
the recommendations on various issues, noting that it will need to strengthen its actions in the 
following areas: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ratification of international instruments; 
</p>
<p>(b) Improvement of the constitutional and legislative framework; 
</p>
<p>(c) Establishment or strengthening of institutional and human rights infrastructure; 
</p>
<p>(d)  Increasing the already solid cooperation with human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>(e) Adoption of additional measures to combat discrimination and to obtain equality for indigenous 
peoples; 
</p>
<p>(f) Ensuring the right to life, liberty and security; 
</p>
<p>(g) Strengthening the administration of justice and the rule of law; 
</p>
<p>(h) Guaranteeing the freedom of expression, opinion and participation in political life of the 
country;  
</p>
<p>(i) Ensuring effective enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>3. A number of measures were already being taken for adequate follow-up to the 
recommendations and encouragement of actions with a view to their implementation. One of those 
measures has been the convening of government and State institutions that integrate the High Level 
Human Rights Commission, which is coordinated by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, with a view 
to disseminating the recommendations and jointly defining a strategy for follow-up and 
implementation.  
</p>
<p>4. Guatemala highlighted the need to link the UPR recommendations to those made on the same 
issues by treaty monitoring bodies and a number of thematic rapporteurs and working groups that 
have visited the country. Guatemala stated that it will have a comprehensive national plan of action 
to follow -up on the recommendations made by various human rights monitoring bodies of the 
United Nations, including the specific recommendations made by the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Guatemala. It further indicated that the 
responsibility for the follow-up will be exercised by the Presidential Human Rights Commission 
(COPREDEH), with the support of the High Level Commission and other relevant government </p>

institutions. With the support of OHCHR in Guatemala, COPREDEH was currently defining a 
methodology to be discussed with relevant institutions. Once an agreement in that regard had been 
reached, it will proceed with its implementation.  
</p>
<p>5. Actions are already being undertaken in many of the areas highlighted in the 
recommendations and Guatemala will thus seek to reinforce its efforts, including through additional 
actions to ensure more effective results. 
</p>
<p>6. Furthermore some good practices were identified in the interactive dialogue. Guatemala 
indicated that it hopes it will be able to share additional good practices in the next UPR dialogue.  
</p>
<p>7. Guatemala appealed to States that have gone through the UPR process to, in the near future, 
exchange good practices with respect to national mechanisms being set up to monitor and 
implement the UPR recommendations, in particular countries of the region.  
</p>
<p>8. Guatemala reiterated its request to OHCHR, in particular the OHCHR Office in Guatemala, to 
accompany and support its national efforts in the process. It also appealed to the friendly countries 
to continue their cooperation, support and technical assistance, so as to comply with the 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>9. Guatemala thanked the member countries of the troika, the Working Group and the 
Secretariat for their support, as well as the States that participated in the interactive dialogue, noting 
that their participation reflected their concern and solidarity with the people of Guatemala.   
</p>
<p> 
<b>Final remarks 
</b></p>
<p>10. Guatemala reiterated its appreciation for the statements made on 6 May and the 
recommendations resulting from that session, as well as for the issues raised at the present meeting. 
It further reiterated the commitment of Guatemala to promoting and protecting human rights. As 
noted earlier, some of the recommendations had already been envisaged as part of public policies 
and the implementation of recommendations made by treaty bodies, visiting special procedures and 
as a result of  contacts with the Inter-American human rights system.
