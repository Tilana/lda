<p><b>HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE  
THE COUNCIL&#8217;S ATTENTION

<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in  
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Vitit Muntarbhorn</b>*<b>

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to include the most recent 
information. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The miasma ensuing from the broad range of egregious human rights violations in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea requires urgent attention at all levels, from national to 
international. Of particular concern are the pervasive transgressions in relation to the right to 
food and other basic necessities, personal security, fundamental freedoms, and asylum and 
migration issues. Specific groups face great vulnerability. The tragedy of the country is that 
those at the top seek to survive at the expense and to the detriment of the majority of the 
population, and are behind the environment leading to these transgressions, with entrenched 
impunity. It is thus important that the challenge of human rights in the country be addressed 
more from the angle of how to prevent violations, protect human rights more effectively, ensure 
more efficacious provision of assistance, and enable more people&#8217;s participation in relation to an 
omnipotent State and those who personify it. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur advocates for, in particular, short- and long-term measures, with 
regard to both the country concerned and the international community. Of special importance for 
the country, in the short term, is the need to ensure effective provision of and access to food and 
other basic necessities for those in need of assistance, and to enable people to undertake 
economic activities to satisfy their basic needs and supplement their livelihood without State 
interference; to end the punishment of those who seek asylum abroad and who are sent back to 
their country; to terminate public executions and abuses against the security of the person, and 
other violations of fundamental rights and freedoms; to cooperate effectively to resolve the issue 
of foreigners abducted by the country; and to respond constructively to the recommendations of 
the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p> In the longer term, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea should seek to modernize 
its national system by instituting reforms to ensure greater participation of the people in the 
process and compliance with international human rights standards; institute equitable 
development measures based upon a &#8220;people first&#8221; policy and reallocate national budgets, 
including military budgets, to the social sector; take more extensive food security-related 
measures; and guarantee personal security and freedoms by dismantling the pervasive 
surveillance and intelligence system, reforming the justice and prison system, and abiding by the 
rule of law. 
</p>
<p> The international community is invited to take more proactive measures in relation to the 
above and to adopt an integrated approach to impel more protection for the inhabitants, with due 
regard for the responsibility of State authorities and their accountability for the widespread and 
systematic violence and violations that have led to the interminable sufferings of millions of 
innocent people. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur was established by the Commission on Human 
Rights in 2004. It has since been renewed annually, and the Special Rapporteur currently submits 
two reports per annum: one to the Human Rights Council, the other to the General Assembly. 
The Special Rapporteur warmly thanks Governments, members of civil society, United Nations 
agencies and other entities that helped to provide information for the present report. It is 
regrettable that the authorities of the country in question have declined to cooperate with this 
mandate, despite efforts by the Special Rapporteur to engage with the country in a constructive 
manner. The report covers 2008 through to the beginning of 2009.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has a population of some 23 million people 
living under a non-democratic system of government.<b>1</b> In recent years, the authorities of the 
country have opened the door slightly to engage with the international community. It is party to 
four human rights treaties: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. Its relationship with the monitoring bodies and related reporting obligations is noted 
in the table annexed to the report. It is due to appear before the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child to review its latest report in 2009.  
</p>
<p>3. Since the devastating floods of 2006 and 2007, the country has become more accessible to 
international aid and has cooperated relatively well with the relevant United Nations agencies 
delivering aid (see section B below). In addition, it has undertaken some law reforms which may 
have been influenced by its relationship with the above-mentioned treaties. For example, in the 
period 2004-2007, it reformed the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. Furthermore, it 
has re-engaged with certain non-governmental organizations from outside the country to enable 
them to provide assistance for pressing matters, such as food aid, health and sanitation facilities, 
disaster relief and preparedness, and reform of institutions housing persons with disabilities, 
despite having forced some of these organizations to leave the country several years ago. It has 
opened the door to some seminar-related activities with European Union support.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. The overall picture of human rights implementation in the country is nonetheless grim, and 
the situation remains dire and desperate. The country is under one-party rule, premised on the 
ideology of <i>juche</i> - nominally based on self-reliance, which is in reality a form of ruler-based 
nationalism, driven by a relentless propaganda machine. At the pinnacle there is an oppressive 
regime, bent on personal survival, under which the ordinary people of the land undergo 
intolerable and interminable suffering. People live in fear and are pressed to inform on each 
other. The State practises extensive surveillance of its inhabitants. Even officials, including 
diplomats, live daily with apprehension, since they are encouraged to &#8220;whistle-blow&#8221; on 
colleagues. Over the years, the authorities have bred a culture of pervasive mistrust and 
multilayered divide and rule, creating great insecurity for the general population. 
</p>
<p>5. Matters have been made more complicated by the fact that the regime posits a <i>songan 
</i>(military first) policy and has armed itself with nuclear weapons. The six-party talks involving 
the United States of America, China, the Russian Federation, Japan and the Republic of Korea 
have endeavoured to pressure the country to denuclearize in return for aid. In 2008, some 
constructive steps were made to disable the nuclear facilities at Yongbyong, including the 
demolition of the cooling tower there. However, at the end of 2008, these steps were suspended 
over the question of how the disablement process was to be verified. It is hoped that these talks 
will proceed in future, given that a positive atmosphere on that front might also offer space for 
the improvement of human rights in the country.  
</p>
<p>6. A number of issues deserving great attention are described in the paragraphs below. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Food and basic necessities 
</b></p>
<p>7. Food grants based on rations provided by the State to its people have been practised since 
the early days of the regime, through a public distribution system, as a means of State control 
over its inhabitants. The system failed drastically in the mid-1990s, when a critical food shortage 
led to rampant malnutrition and other tragedies, brought about by a combination of natural 
disasters, environmental degradation and mismanagement by the authorities. The regime then 
started to accept foreign food aid to alleviate the chronic situation. In 2005 and 2006, it tried to 
reduce that aid and the presence of international agencies working on the issue in an attempt to 
curb outside influence, but this was overtaken by other events, particularly the devastating floods 
of 2006 and 2007. These disasters pressured the authorities to reopen the country to outside aid. 
In 2006, the main United Nations agency dealing with the issue, the World Food Programme 
(WFP), began its two-year Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation, designed to provide food 
aid to 1.9 million people. 
</p>
<p>8. In 2008, a new agreement was reached between the authorities and WFP to assist 
some 6.5 million people. Both WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) carried out an important food security assessment in June 2008. The 
initial findings revealed very disquieting indicators of a serious decline in food availability, 
accessibility and consumption. Particularly worrying was the finding that the number of children 
affected by diarrhoea had increased markedly, namely, nearly twice the number recorded in the 
previous Government/United Nations nutritional survey conducted in 2005. Child malnutrition 
and illnesses have thus been on the rise. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. WFP highlighted three groups as particularly food insecure: the socially vulnerable 
(children in child institutions, the elderly, and children in paediatric wards); the physiologically 
vulnerable (pregnant and lactating women, children under 5 years old and adolescents); and the 
geographically vulnerable (particularly in the north-eastern and southern parts of the country). 
Immediate food needs are closely related to the shortage of fertilizers and fuel. The overall 
situation of schools and hospitals has also been deteriorating owing to a lack of basic necessities, 
including food, textbooks, electricity and medicines. 
</p>
<p>10. A joint WFP/FAO report of 8 December 2008 revealed that, despite better climatic 
conditions in 2008, there would still be a severe food shortage, and the country would need 
international assistance. It is estimated that the total food production for the period 2008-09 will 
be 4.21 million tons, with a cereal deficit of 836,000 tons, despite possible commercial imports 
of 500,000 tons. Particularly at risk are the urban poor and remote food-deficit areas in the north-
east. The needed food assistance is thus calculated to be some 800,000 tons until the next harvest 
in October 2009. The report indicated that agricultural growth has not been able to benefit from 
the favourable weather in 2008 owing to other factors, such as lack of fertilizers and fuel. Some 
8.7 million people are food insecure and thus need help. Given these conditions, there is also a 
need for consistent nutritional assessment of the people at risk. 
</p>
<p>11. WFP is also targeting more extensive emergency operations for the period 
September 2008-November 2009.<b>2</b> They encompass 131 counties in 8 provinces, up from 
50 counties supported under the Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation, to provide aid 
to 6,237,000 beneficiaries. The groups covered are mainly lactating women, primary school 
children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, complemented by food for work-related 
community development activities. However, at the beginning of 2009, only 1.8 million 
people were receiving food assistance because of severe resourcing shortfalls. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that, based upon the principle of &#8220;no access, no 
food&#8221; - namely that food would not be given unless there was access to the targeted recipients - 
the monitoring of food distribution would be improved, with more random sampling for 
monitoring food distribution and prospected use of United Nations staff who are Korean 
speakers, rather than the previous practice of using Korean speakers seconded by the authorities 
to the operations. United Nations agencies are also moving beyond food aid to more food 
security-oriented activities, such as food for community development programmes, which cover 
elements such as disaster preparedness and sustainable agriculture.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Despite the above-mentioned initiatives, there have been some unconscionable 
developments with regard to the negative attitude of the authorities towards the general 
population. Firstly, it might be recalled that, in 2002, the Government took various measures to 
open the door to quasi-market activities, thus enabling the population to engage in the market 
system at a limited level, to produce, buy and sell their goods. The public distribution system 
was seen as non-functional, and people were given additional wages to fend for themselves. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See &#8220;Emergency Assistance to Population Groups Affected by Floods and Rising Food and 
</p>
<p>Fuel Prices&#8221;, available on the WFP website (www.wfp.org). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>In 2005, for fear of losing their grip on the population, the authorities started to impose the 
system again on the population and to prohibit market activities, despite the fact that the system 
was unable to respond effectively to the needs of the population.  
</p>
<p>14. Secondly, economic initiatives, particularly by women, were severely curtailed in the 
period 2007-2008, when the authorities prohibited women under 40 years of age from trading; 
the age was subsequently raised to 49. Thirdly, it was reported in 2008 that army personnel were 
forcing farmers to provide them with food, to the detriment of the latter&#8217;s livelihood. The 
authorities were also reportedly subjecting markets to greater scrutiny and punishing traders in 
the pursuit of State control over the population. 
</p>
<p>15. Fourthly, at the end of 2008, the authorities planned to reduce the frequency of trade at 
open markets to once a month.<b>3</b> This was all the more unjust in the light of two unprecedented 
mass protests by female traders in March 2008 against the crackdown on the market place and 
the negative impact on their livelihood, in Chungjin and North Hamgyong Province. Fifthly, it 
was reported that small-lot and small-patch farming would be prohibited in 2009.<b>4</b> This &#8220;kitchen 
farming&#8221; has been very important for the survival of the general population, which lacks 
adequate food and undertakes this farming to supplement its food supply and intake. The 
authorities are also beginning to register such plots with a view to their curtailment.  
</p>
<p>16. Sixthly, at the end of 2008, the authorities were closing general markets and transforming 
them into farmers&#8217; markets, with a ban on rice sales. According to the directives issued, food 
would only be sold at local grain enterprises and manufactured goods would be exclusively sold 
in State-run stores.<b>5</b> The sad irony is that the ruling elite still seeks to make the population 
dependent on the State, even in the face of increasing deprivations. Even the cost of making 
<i>kimchi</i>, the pickled cabbage which helps to sustain people throughout the year given the lack of 
meat and other staples, is now rising, threatening an essential nutrient of the local diet.<b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>17. On another front, the authorities were cooperating with the United Nations on a 
long-overdue national census.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Personal security 
</b></p>
<p>18. Some law reforms have been made to bring national security standards more into line with 
international ones. In 2004, reforms of the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, for 
example, introduced more detailed categorization of crimes on the basis of <i>nullum crimen</i> <i>sine 
</i></p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>lege</i> (the principle that conduct does not constitute an offence unless declared to be so by a 
previously existing law) and related safeguards.<b>7</b> Legislative progress includes shortened periods 
of detention pending trial and prohibition of night-time interrogation.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>19. The reform made in 2007 related to those who are sent to public education, particularly 
adolescents. A person subjected to this measure is considered to be innocent.<b>9</b> Various 
discrepancies have however arisen in its implementation (see section E below). 
</p>
<p>20. In reality, there is a large gap between the more salutary nature of criminal law and the 
aberrations in its implementation process, which result in grave human rights violations. There is 
a plethora of crimes listed in the criminal law which help to bolster the regime and prolong the 
constraints imposed on ordinary people.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>21. The situation is aggravated by the discrimination practised by the regime in controlling its 
population. Although less explicit than in the past, the authorities divide the population into three 
groups: those close to the top; the middle level (usually the mass base of the urban and rural 
population); and those classified as hostile to the regime, such as political dissidents, those out of 
favour with the regime, and those with various links to the Republic of Korea and Japan. 
Collective punishments are also used against people; recent information confirms the practice of 
whole families being persecuted and sent into detention when a member falls foul of the 
authorities.<b>11</b>   
</p>
<p>22. Public executions continue to take place, particularly in recent years, for people involved 
in human trafficking. A recent case that came to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention is that of 
seven people caught for human trafficking, four of whom were sent to re-education centres, and 
three (university students) executed in public.<b>12</b> Another case was that of five women reportedly 
publicly executed for human trafficking in late 2008.<b>13</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>23. Many punishments are totally unreasonable and abusive; for instance, students are reported 
to have been sent to labour training (re-education and forced labour) for watching South Korean 
dramas.<b>14</b> Citizens who fail to turn up for work allocated to them by the State are sent to labour 
camps. There is a wide variety of detention facilities ranging from political detention camps 
(<i>kwanliso</i>) for political crimes to correctional labour punishment in labour camps (<i>kyohwaso</i>) for 
other crimes. There are reports of public executions and secret executions in political detention 
camps.<b>10</b> In 2004, a new type of punishment was introduced in the form of labour training, with 
sentencing ranging from six months to two years. This has been used particularly for those 
caught leaving the country illegally. 
</p>
<p>24. Although torture is prohibited by law, it is extensively practised. Meanwhile, the abhorrent 
prison conditions, including lack of food, poor hygiene, freezing conditions in winter, forced 
labour and corporal punishment, result in a myriad of abuses and deprivations, ensuring that 
many prisons are a death trap for inmates, whose plight is sometimes mitigated by bribery.   
</p>
<p>25. The justice system leaves much to be desired; it lacks an independent judiciary, lawyers 
acting genuinely on behalf of accused persons, and juries, which would provide the checks and 
balances to deliver justice. Even though all three elements exist in the system, they are 
subservient to the State and do not uphold the internationally recognized notion of the rule of 
law. In fact, judges are appointed by the State and operate under the direction of the Supreme 
People&#8217;s Assembly. The jury system is based on two people who work with the courts (usually 
one judge at first instance) - not to ensure that the rights of the accused are upheld but to confirm 
the list of crimes presented at the trials and to confirm the conviction of the alleged wrongdoer. 
Anomalously, lawyers protect the State rather than their defendants. On-site open trials are also 
held, ostensibly to educate the public; in reality, they are an instrument to intimidate the public, 
without any regard for the defendant&#8217;s right to a fair trial and the right to privacy.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>26. On another front, the authorities have been involved in kidnapping a number of foreign 
nationals, usually with the aim of either using them to train others for espionage purposes or of 
stealing their identity with a view to later infiltrating the countries of origin. A number of cases 
concerning Japanese nationals abducted by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea remain 
unsolved and require an effective response from the latter to ensure transparency and 
accountability. The six-party talks have offered some room to address this issue at the bilateral 
level, but the talks are currently stalled. Over 10 countries have been affected by the conduct of 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, which has perpetrated these crimes 
extraterritorially - evidence of the pernicious range of its human rights violations with 
transnational implications.<b>15</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>27. Basic freedoms associated with human rights and democracy, such as the freedom to 
choose one&#8217;s Government, freedom of association, freedom of expression, freedom of 
information, privacy and freedom of religion are infringed on a daily basis by the nature and 
practices of the regime.  
</p>
<p>28. Political dissent is heavily punished and has an intergenerational impact; where the parents 
are seen as antithetical to the regime, the child and the rest of the family are also discriminated 
against in their access to school, hospitals and other necessities. There are no genuine trade 
unions, apart from those that prop up the regime.     
</p>
<p>29. On a related front, the media are heavily controlled and censored, forming the backbone of 
a gigantuan propaganda machine. Books from China and the Republic of Korea are also 
prohibited; indeed, the reading of books from the latter country is punishable as a crime of 
espionage.<b>10</b> There is extensive wiretapping of telephones; according to information received 
in 2008, the authorities have imposed restrictions on long-distance calls to block the spreading of 
news concerning the current food shortage. 
</p>
<p>30. Unless one belongs to the elite, it is forbidden to own computers and mobile phones, to use 
the Internet without official permission, and to watch foreign videos. Information received 
suggests that the authorities try to limit the use of fibre-optic cable telephones.<b>10</b> There are 
reports of official clamp-downs on mobile phones and CDs, and there are surveillance teams of 
inspectors who raid homes to see whether families are illegally watching or listening to foreign 
films and radio or television programmes. These raids are particularly intense near the border 
with neighbouring countries. Radios and television sets are pretuned to Government channels 
and there are punishments against those who disobey, although leniency may come from the 
inspectors at a price; bribery and corruption is rife in the country. 
</p>
<p>31. Although punishments for disobedience are severe,<b>10</b> an increasing number of people 
reportedly watch foreign programmes and have mobile phones. There is also a spread of USB 
and mobile hard disk technology, suggesting that there is clandestine access to computers. The 
rigidity imposed by the regime in the pursuit of social proscriptions versus individual 
self-expression is seen at its extreme in the ban on the wearing of jeans. 
32. Given the extensive intelligence and informant system in the country, the right to privacy 
is continually infringed by the State apparatus. Neighbourhood groups are also used as an 
instrument of social control and surveillance, creating a system of fear and mistrust, with 
multiple layers of surveillance.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>33. There appear to be outward signs of religious practice, such as construction of church 
buildings. The following sites have been reported: 2,500 Christian family service sites; 
12 Catholic assembly sites; 60 Buddhist temples; and 80 Chundokyo secret prayer sites.<b>10</b> Some 
religious ceremonies seem to be allowed. The claim by authorities that freedom of religion is 
enjoyed in the country is contradicted by the evidence available. It has been reported that 
religious sites are limited to Pyongyang, and local citizens are still barred from using the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>facilities available. There are indications that practising religion gives rise to persecution.<b>10</b> The 
regime lauds people who give up their lives to save portraits of the country&#8217;s leader.<b>10</b> Recent 
reports indicate that security agents from the National Security Agency (<i>bowibu</i>) and the public 
security agency (<i>anjeobu</i>) have stepped up their surveillance and infiltration at borders in order 
to halt religious activities,<b>16</b> even posing as pastors or setting up fake prayer meetings to entrap 
new converts. Those who seek refuge in other countries and who contact missionaries are liable 
to be punished severely if sent back. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Asylum and migration 
</b></p>
<p>34. Since its inception, the regime has followed a policy of strict control over the movement of 
its citizens. Internally, travel permits are required if people wish to travel across the country. For 
external travel, an exit visa is required.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>35. The situation however, is even more complex.<b>17</b> For years there has been a constant flow of 
people persecuted by the authorities fleeing the country clandestinely, without travel permits. 
The food crisis of the mid-1990s and thereafter has led to increased migration of people in search 
of food and other necessities across the border. There has thus been a persistent flow of people 
into neighbouring countries at times in search of food, employment and livelihood, at times 
escaping from persecution and oppression, at times for both reasons. 
</p>
<p>36. There has been much discussion internationally on whether these flows amount to forced 
migration and the search for asylum, which would give rise to refugee status, coupled with the 
application of the international law principle of non-refoulement, the right of the refugee not to 
be pushed back to areas of danger. The Special Rapporteur has dealt extensively with this issue 
in previous reports, bearing in mind that the international definition of &#8220;refugee&#8221; is a person who 
leaves his or her country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of persecution.<b>18</b> This fear factor 
may arise before the person actually leaves the country, and or after the person leaves the 
country, becoming in the latter case a refugee <i>sur place</i>.   
</p>
<p>37. The main United Nations agency with a mandate to deal with asylum-seekers, the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, must be supported so that it can reach those 
who seek asylum and provide assistance and protection to those falling into the category of 
refugees. Bilateral links with and support from possible destination countries may also help to 
loosen the strictures of first-asylum countries. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. Over the past year, the situation facing asylum-seekers has become more stringent owing 
to the above-mentioned factors. More restrictions have been imposed on departures from the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and entry into neighbouring countries. There are reports 
of more severe sanctions imposed on those who seek to leave the country and also those who are 
forcibly returned to it, despite indications of a more lenient attitude on the part of the authorities 
several years ago. Some sources report a &#8220;shoot on sight&#8221; policy with regard to those who seek 
to leave the country clandestinely, and violence used against pregnant women forcibly returned 
to the country. Instead of the previous practice of imposing fines, prison sentences are now being 
applied.   
</p>
<p>39. Recent movements have been facilitated by human smugglers and traffickers, who often 
prey on asylum-seekers, who are predominantly women. The background of those on the move 
and the ensuing complications may also be different: on the one hand, there are those who stay 
for a long period in a neighbouring country and other first-asylum countries before moving to the 
Republic of Korea as the final destination; on the other, there are those who transit only briefly 
in first-asylum countries before reaching the final destination country. From information 
received, the former group is often more traumatized than the latter, as they have to endure a 
myriad of abuses for a long time before reaching the destination country, and may thus need 
long-term support. More consideration should also be given to the possibility of family reunions. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Specific groups 
</b></p>
<p>40. While women who belong to the elite are well provided for, the others are subjected to 
untold suffering owing to the stifling nature of the regime. While the Constitution guarantees 
equal rights for men and women, women&#8217;s access to key decision-making positions lags behind 
that of men. It was recently reported that women hold only 4.5 per cent of key positions in the 
Central Committee of the ruling party.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>41. Women constitute a large proportion of those involved in the economic sector, particularly 
in commercial and informal activities. They have been particularly affected by the State&#8217;s 
reassertion of control over its population in the economic sphere, such as prohibition of women 
under a certain age from trading and the closure of markets. 
</p>
<p>42. Violence, neglect, abuse and exploitation pose a continuing concern for women at home, 
outside the home, within the country and across borders. The issue of sexual violence at home 
has not been dealt with adequately, while women who are on the move are often abused and 
exploited for many purposes. There is rampant human smuggling and trafficking where women 
and other groups seek to leave the country. A high proportion uses the services of intermediaries 
to leave the country, with the promise of payment to the intermediaries upon arrival in the final 
asylum country. Some fall prey to human trafficking and end up in forced labour, prostitution 
and forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>43. Currently women constitute the majority of asylum-seekers. They are at times 
accompanied by children, and many seek to reunite with spouses and families in the final asylum 
country. Over the past year, in various South-East Asian countries, some were threatened with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>detention and deportation, in breach of their rights and the principle of non-refoulement. The 
Special Rapporteur calls for improved measures from asylum countries, especially first-asylum 
countries, to offer shelter to these groups in adequate welfare centres, eschew detention in 
principle and in practice, abide by the principle of non-refoulement and expedite processes to 
enable these groups to resettle in the final destination country. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to the implementation of children&#8217;s rights, 2009 is a key year since the country 
is due to appear before the Committee on the Rights of the Child as part of its obligations under 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has 
already submitted its report on the implementation of the rights of the child in the country 
(CRC/C/PRK/4), on which the Special Rapporteur commented in his reports submitted to the 
United Nations in 2008. Suffice it to note that the State report is decidedly thin on special 
protection measures for children in difficulty. 
</p>
<p>45. A detailed report on this issue has also been submitted by civil society, based on interviews 
with children, and there are various elements deserving attention and analysis.<b>19</b> The first of 
many concerns raised by the report is the fate of children left behind by those who exit the 
country in search of refuge elsewhere. According to the report, these children are likely to be 
kept under constant surveillance and discriminated as a consequence of the acts of others. The 
second is the fate of children who have left the country without permission and are subsequently 
sent back to the country. Third, there is the issue of children whose parents are charged with 
political crimes and/or sent to prison. Fourth, the challenge of children deprived of a family 
environment, who regrettably risk ending up in a substandard State institution. 
</p>
<p>46. The report also highlights various shortcomings in the national 11-year compulsory 
education system, such as lack of books and hidden school fees. The use of children in activities 
which are tantamount to forced labour deserves serious attention. The report notes that children 
are mobilized to cultivate and harvest opium poppy. Children between 14 and 16 have to 
undergo military training in the Red Young Guards, combined with ideological studies.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Another area of concern is linked with the above-mentioned reforms of the criminal law, 
particularly the introduction of &#8220;public education&#8221; in order to rehabilitate those who have 
committed minor crimes. In this way, local authorities, such as schools, have leeway to 
&#8220;educate&#8221; the children concerned to improve their behaviour, but has also reportedly led to 
abuses committed by those same authorities. 
</p>
<p>48. With regard to people with disabilities, one constructive development was the adoption of 
a new law in recent years, reforming the antiquated system and the former practice of 
incarcerating people with disabilities. The Special Rapporteur is adamant that the damage caused 
</p>
<p>

Rights, Seoul, 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>by past State practices needs to be rectified. Those who were victims of inhumane conditions 
need to be assisted to recover and be reintegrated fully into society. Some abhorrent past 
practices requiring redress include the reported &#8220;neutering&#8221; of people with dwarfism to prevent 
them from reproducing.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>49. With regard to the elderly, one clear negative impact of the food crisis has been the rise in 
the deprivation suffered. United Nations agencies are increasingly aware of this, and are 
targeting food aid and allocations to this group. Basic needs requiring attention include access to 
medical and other care. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PREVENTION, PROTECTION, PROVISION AND PARTICIPATION 
</b></p>
<p>50. The above analysis offers a bleak picture of the state of human rights in the country 
concerned. There are widespread, systematic and reprehensible human rights violations of a 
long-standing and insidious nature, which demand attention and commitments nationally and 
internationally to improve the situation. Often the actions needed have been too little, or come 
too late. 
</p>
<p>51. The issues raised above should be addressed more from the angle of effective prevention, 
protection, provision and participation. The preventive approach - to prevent human rights 
violations in this context - is inevitably interwoven with the cloistered and self-centred regime, 
which refuses to abide by international human rights standards in real terms and is geared to 
perpetuating its power at any cost. Genuine prevention thus requires a more people-centred 
approach, with less emphasis on the &#8220;military first&#8221; policy and without the budgetary distortions 
caused by the nuclearization process practised to date and closely linked to the survival of the 
regime. Prevention with regard to the food situation would dictate that more attention should be 
paid to food security, beyond the traditional food aid provided to date. 
</p>
<p>52. With regard to personal security, it is evident that one key challenge is to prevent the 
abuses inflicted by the regime in the exercise of its overpowering control and manipulation of the 
population. The justice and prison system is in desperate need of revamping, despite the various 
legislative reforms of recent years. Opening the door to freedoms, such as the freedom to choose 
a Government or freedom of expression and association, invites reflection on ways to institute 
more democratization in the country, to ensure genuine self-determination. Meanwhile, the 
various refugee- and migration-related outflows call for more prevention by addressing the 
environment that forces people to leave, particularly the political, social, economic and cultural 
set-up in the country of origin which creates incessant insecurity. 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to protection, many violations have taken place over the years precisely 
because the authorities have had scant regard for any genuine implementation of human rights, 
since their priority has been to protect the interests of the regime and the elite surrounding it. 
Indeed, the protection of human rights requires responsive laws, policies, programmes, practices, 
mechanisms and personnel, resources, education, monitoring and related reforms based on 
international standards. The fact that the country is party to four human rights conventions 
requires the corresponding political will to meet the standards set by those treaties and effective 
follow-up on the recommendations from the various treaty bodies to improve human rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>implementation at the local level. Another issue needing a response is that of accountability and 
responsibility with regard to the impunity which has been enjoyed for so long by those at the top 
and related officialdom. 
</p>
<p>54. Of note is that non-governmental organizations have repeatedly advocated for more action, 
especially at the highest level from the General Assembly and the Security Council, to ensure the 
responsibility of the State and its power base. A recent report underlines the State&#8217;s 
responsibility to protect its citizens, and calls on the United Nations to establish a group of 
experts to investigate into whether the egregious violations in the country are tantamount to a 
violation of the &#8220;responsibility to protect&#8221; doctrine.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The protection element can also be looked at from the angle of the need for a variety of 
checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. In the past, there have also been calls from 
outside the country for the setting up of a national human rights commission. Indeed, an array of 
mechanisms and processes are required to uphold international rule of law, and inevitably to 
democratize and ensure more people&#8217;s voices and action in protecting their own rights. 
</p>
<p>56. With regard to food and other basic necessities from the perspective of protection, there are 
special concerns in relation to the vulnerability facing various groups, such as lactating women, 
children and the elderly. The plight of the urban poor also needs highlighting, as they are distant 
from the possibility of farming, which would otherwise supplement their income and food 
supplies. An important component of the right to life and the right to work that needs to be 
protected is the ability to undertake economic activities of one&#8217;s own choice. Current 
developments preclude such an option. 
</p>
<p>57. As regards the issue of personal security and related freedoms, there is a clear call to undo 
the damage created by the culture of fear imposed on the population, such as through 
surveillance of people&#8217;s conduct, the intimidating national security machinery and the extensive 
network of informants and related infiltration. In addition, there should be a reform of the 
national system of intelligence agencies, law enforcement and the justice/prison system. State 
policies and instructions must be clear to law enforcers, that they put an end to public executions 
and the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Protection of 
such basic rights as the freedoms of association, expression, religion and privacy demands the 
reform of practices that impede their realization, and this is closely linked with the need to 
overcome the repressive nature of the power base. 
</p>
<p>58. As part of the protection framework, the country should accede to the full range of human 
rights treaties. Of particular relevance are the two optional protocols to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities. The gamut of implementation measures needed requires actions to nurture a 
knowledge base, attitude, skills and behaviour conducive to respect for human rights. The

 <p> 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review process instituted by the Human Rights Council, under which the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea will be reviewed on its human rights performance, can 
also be a way to address these issues and to encourage the State to revamp its national system 
and overcome past excesses, bearing in mind the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. From the perspective of the provision of help and assistance, it is evident that the State has 
been failing to provide basic necessities for its people, particularly with regard to freedom from 
want and freedom from fear. To remedy the food situation, full access to needy groups and 
adequate monitoring are required, including periodic assessment of nutrition and other elements 
of personal welfare to ensure that adequate provisions are available and accessible to those in 
need. 
</p>
<p>60. Given that the State is unable to provide adequately for its people, it should not clamp 
down on people&#8217;s activities which help to provide for their own basic needs. Furthermore, 
allocations from the national budget should be directed away from militarization to a more 
people-oriented policy. 
</p>
<p>61. Finally, one clear challenge is how to ensure greater participation of people so that they 
may enjoy the basics of life and respect for human rights. This pertains to the power base from 
top to bottom and bottom to top, and is interwoven with the call to democratize. Unless steps are 
taken for greater participation in the development process, the inhabitants of the country will 
continue to suffer because of the ailing state of affairs and the failing affairs of the State. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  COMMUNICATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, addressed a 
joint communication to the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on 
20 March 2008 concerning the alleged public executions of 15 nationals. The 13 women 
and 2 men were reportedly accused of planning to cross into a neighbouring country to receive 
economic assistance with the help of relatives living abroad. The Government did not reply to 
the communication. 
</p>
<p>63. The Government also failed to reply to a communication, sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on 7 April 2008, requesting clarification on the whereabouts and safety of 22 nationals. The 
group, comprising 14 women and 8 men, including 3 teenagers, were returned to the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea after they reportedly drifted by accident to southern waters in the 
western sea near Yongpyong Island. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  COUNTRY VISITS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur paid an official visit to the Republic of Korea from 27 
to 31 October 2008. The purpose of the visit was to assess the impact of the human rights 
situation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on the Republic of Korea. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. Of particular interest at the national level is the policy of the current administration of the 
Republic of Korea towards the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The authorities of the 
Republic of Korea propound a policy of &#8220;mutual benefits and common prosperity&#8221;, the 
humanitarian component of which relates to various human rights concerns with regard to the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic. The policy aims to resolve the issue of families separated 
between the two States during the Korean war (1950-53); to address the question of prisoners of 
war of the Republic of Korea held by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic and missing persons and 
abductees; to approach the issue of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
as a matter of universal value and to press for substantial improvements there; and to provide 
humanitarian aid to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic in a spirit of humanitarianism. Other 
issues deserving attention include the possibility of family reunions between those who have 
arrived in the Republic of Korea and those left behind in other countries, and the need to address 
the plight of children of nationals of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea married to 
nationals of other countries, who live in hiding and are, in effect, stateless. 
</p>
<p>66. In past administrations, some issues, such as the question of family reunions and the 
consequences of the war, were dealt with through inter-Korean ministerial dialogues and the 
cooperation of the Red Cross. Currently, in practical terms, relations between the two States are 
in a transitional period. Interestingly, at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the Republic 
of Korea, military talks between the two States at the technical level were being held with a view 
to improving communications between them. 
</p>
<p>67. With regard to humanitarian aid, 50,000 tons of corn have been offered by the Republic of 
Korea to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea is waiting for the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to respond to the former&#8217;s request for dialogue on the 
matter. 
</p>
<p>68. Since the 1990s, the Republic of Korea has offered shelter to nearly 15,000 people from 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In 2007 alone, some 2,500 people arrived in the 
Republic of Korea. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited Hanawon, a 
Government-supported facility near Seoul that houses such people. The facility helps settlers 
from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea adapt to their new environment. He also 
interviewed a number of new arrivals to learn of their experiences in their country of origin, the 
harsh conditions there and their precarious journey to the Republic of Korea. The majority of 
current arrivals are women, most of whom were smuggled out of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea or other countries by &#8220;brokers&#8221; as part of the cross-border process that 
ultimately leads them to the final country of settlement. 
</p>
<p>69. A number of the above-mentioned people are victims of multiple abuses, including torture 
and other forms of violence. Their psychological scars, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, are 
deep. For this reason, they need long-term support for social recovery and reintegration. On a 
welcome note, Hanawon now provides the services of psychologists and psychiatrists to help 
those in need. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Hangyoreh middle high school near Hanawon, a 
school for adolescents from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including a number of 
young persons in difficulties, such as those arriving in the Republic of Korea without their 
parents. He was particularly impressed with the open and flexible nature of the school, which </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>allows the students to receive education suited to their needs in an individualized manner, 
attuned to the culture and the educational system of the Republic of Korea. The school is like a 
home for these young people, with teachers and students living in a friendly, family-like 
environment. 
</p>
<p>71. As lessons learned from the visit, the Special Rapporteur:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Emphasizes the need for constructive dialogue between the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to promote an amicable atmosphere conducive to 
resolving outstanding issues, such as the consequences of the Korean war, including the question 
of family reunions and missing persons, on the basis of international law; 
</p>
<p> (b) Welcomes the possibility, from the Republic of Korea and other countries, of 
humanitarian aid, including food aid, medical aid and other aid, such as fertilizers, to the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on the basis of &#8220;no access, no aid&#8221;, with adequate 
monitoring to ensure transparency and accountability; 
</p>
<p> (c) Underscores the need to encourage more measures to help prevent, prepare for and 
mitigate natural disasters and food-related deprivations by means of actions to promote food 
security through sustainable agriculture and environmental protection, with the broad-based 
participation of the people; 
</p>
<p> (d) Invites support from all countries to assist and protect those who seek refuge from 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, with due respect for the international law principle 
of non-refoulement and humane treatment of all who seek refuge, bearing in mind the need to 
address their psychological and other needs by means of providing effective support systems, 
complemented by constructive interactions with local communities, to enable asylum-seekers to 
adapt to the new social setting; 
</p>
<p> (e) Notes that the universal periodic review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea will be held by the Human Rights Council in 2009 and invites stakeholders and other 
concerned entities to engage with that process by providing credible and balanced information, 
bearing in mind the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> (f) Calls upon the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to implement effectively the 
human rights obligations under the treaties to which it is a party, and encourages the State to 
cooperate with the Special Rapporteur, including by allowing him to enter the country, assess the 
human rights situation and provide advice for needed improvements. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Japan 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur paid an official visit to Japan from 23 to 28 January 2009. The aim 
of his visit was to assess the impact of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea&#8217;s human 
rights situation on Japan. 
</p>
<p>73. Key concerns remain with regard to the State&#8217;s relations with Japan, particularly its 
denuclearization and accountability for abductions committed. A key entry point for this process 
has been the six-party talks, aimed at achieving verifiable denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula. While the talks are currently stalled over the concrete framework of verification of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>nuclear programmes, it is hoped that more concrete progress will be made in the near future, 
as positive developments on this front can pave the way to improvements in human rights. 
</p>
<p>74. With regard to abductions, while the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has already 
admitted to committing a number of these crimes, some cases remain unsolved. Currently, there 
are 17 persons listed officially as abducted by the State. While five returned to Japan following 
the summit between the two States in 2002, other cases await an effective commitment from the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to clarify and settle the matter satisfactorily. The six-
party talks have provided some space for dialogue on these matters, while bilateral tracks have 
complemented this avenue. Significantly, working-level consultations were held between the two 
States in August 2008, where both agreed on the concrete modality and related measures to 
ensure a comprehensive investigation of the abductions issue, to be conducted by the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including that State&#8217;s need to establish an investigation committee 
to undertake and conclude investigations effectively and expeditiously, and to cooperate with 
Japan so that the latter will be able to directly confirm the results of the investigation with 
relevant sources of information. 
</p>
<p>75. It should be recalled that despite various United Nations resolutions, the international 
community remains highly dissatisfied with the response of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea to the abductions issue. There is a need for the State to honour its commitments and to 
settle matters genuinely, transparently and credibly. Internationally, it is increasingly recognized 
that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea is also responsible for the abduction of nationals 
of other countries, thus globalizing the issue extensively. 
</p>
<p>76. Japan has taken a range of measures to influence the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea to be more responsible in its actions, including prohibition of visits of vessels from the 
country, and various embargoes and restrictions on trade and exchanges. In 2006, an important 
law was adopted in Japan to address the issue of human rights violations, with amendments in 
2007 to strengthen international cooperation on this front. The law provides for a number of 
measures, including awareness-raising activities for the Japanese public. The law also provides 
for the measures to protect and support defectors from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, including the Japanese spouses of Koreans who migrated to Japan, Korean residents from 
Japan who later settled in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic but now wish to return to Japan, and 
nationals from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic seeking asylum in Japan. A welcome 
development is that Japan is now increasingly offering protection to a number of people in such 
categories, and is expected to be expanded by means of educational, occupational and 
psychological support systems. On humanitarian grounds, channels should be explored to enable 
those who have returned to Japan to reunite with the families left behind in their country of 
origin. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur paid a visit to the Niigata Prefecture, where a number of 
abductions had taken place, particularly in the 1970s, and consulted the authorities on the 
underlying circumstances. Geographically, Niigata faces the coastal area of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, whose agents landed clandestinely to commit the above-mentioned 
crimes. Interestingly, a number of governors of prefectures came together in late 2008 to adopt a 
common position advocating for a prompt resolution of the problem, including measures to 
invite their sister cities in other countries to support efforts in this respect. </p>

</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to take 
action efficaciously based on the following, and invites international solidarity to impel the 
country to take effective measures in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (a) <b>Investigate</b>. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea should, as it agreed, 
establish a credible committee to investigate the abductions issue. The investigation should be of 
a comprehensive nature, with the aim of taking concrete action to settle the issue satisfactorily, 
namely to find survivors and return them to Japan; 
</p>
<p> (b) <b>Identify</b>. The above-mentioned investigation should cover the victims identified by 
the Government of Japan as well as other abductees; 
</p>
<p> (c) <b>Inform</b>. The State should inform Japan consistently of progress made and undertake 
discussions with Japan in a cooperative manner; 
</p>
<p> (d) <b>Initiate</b>. The State&#8217;s authorities should initiate actions at home to ensure 
transparency and accountability, particularly to follow up the requests submitted by Japan to 
resolve the remaining cases; 
</p>
<p> (e) <b>Implement</b>. Genuine implementation of commitments, particularly those made by 
the State, is required, especially on the basis of and in the spirit of the Pyongyang Declaration of 
2002, which opened the way for the peaceful settling of disputes between the two States, pending 
steps towards the normalization of relations between them; 
</p>
<p> (f) <b>Intensify</b>. The State&#8217;s authorities should intensify measures to demonstrate genuine 
and substantive progress to address the crimes committed and to ensure the accountability of 
those who committed them; 
</p>
<p> (g) <b>Invigorate</b>. By means of effective measures to settle the above-mentioned issues, the 
two States will be able to invigorate relations, overcome impediments and chart the course 
towards confluence based on mutual respect, peaceful neighbourly relations and compliance with 
universal human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The predicament ensuing from the broad range of systematic and widespread human 
rights violations in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea requires urgent attention at 
all levels, from national to international. Of particular concern are the pervasive 
transgressions in relation to food and other basic necessities, personal security, freedoms, 
asylum and migration, and specific groups, such as women and children.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea should take the following measures:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Immediately (short-term): 
(i) Ensure effective provision of and access to food and other basic necessities 
</b></p>
<p><b>for those in need of assistance, cooperate constructively with 
United Nations agencies and other humanitarian actors on the issue, and 
allow people to undertake economic activities to satisfy their basic needs 
and supplement their livelihood without State interference; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(ii) End the punishment of those who seek asylum abroad and who are sent 
back to the country, and instruct officials clearly to avoid detention and 
inhumane treatment of such persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Put an end to public executions and abuses against the security of the 
person, and other violations of rights and freedoms, by means of law 
reforms and implementation measures, clearer instructions to law 
enforcers to respect human rights, related capacity-building and 
monitoring of their work to ensure accountability; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Cooperate effectively to resolve the issue of abducted foreigners; 
(v) Respond constructively to the recommendations of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur, reply effectively to his communications, and invite the Special 
Rapporteur to visit the country to take stock of the situation and 
recommend needed actions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Progressively (longer-term): 
(i) Modernize the national system by instituting reforms to ensure greater 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of the people in the process and compliance with 
international human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Institute equitable development measures based upon a &#8220;people first&#8221; 
policy, and reallocate national budgets, including military budgets, to the 
social sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Introduce more extensive food security-related measures, such as sound 
agricultural practices, environment conservation, disaster preparedness 
and people&#8217;s participation and mobilization in planning , programming 
and benefit-sharing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Guarantee personal security and freedoms by dismantling the pervasive 
surveillance and informant/intelligence system, reforming the 
justice/prison system and abiding by the rule of law, with safeguards for 
accused persons, fair trials, the development of an independent judiciary, 
and checks and balances against abuses of power; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Become a party to core human rights treaties and take measures to 
implement them effectively; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Address the vulnerability facing specific groups, such as women, children, 
persons with disabilities and the elderly, by eliminating discrimination and 
highlighting human rights protection against neglect, abuse, exploitation 
and violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) Address the root causes of refugee outflows; criminalize those who exploit 
them through human smuggling and trafficking, while not criminalizing 
the victims; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(viii) Act against the impunity of those responsible for violence and violations 
by permitting means of effective redress at the national and local levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ix) Engage with the Human Rights Council and its universal periodic review 
to ensure transparency and reforms, and request technical assistance from 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
help promote and protect human rights comprehensively; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Initiate constructive dialogue with the treaty bodies that monitor the 
conventions to which the country is a party, and cooperate with all 
United Nations mechanisms, including the special procedures, to ensure 
effective follow-up of their recommendations and access to the country. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the international community:</b> 
</p>
<p> (<b>a) To emphasize the need for an integrated approach that includes the prevention 
of violations, effective protection of human rights, the provision of care and assistance in an 
accessible and accountable manner, participation of people in the enjoyment of their rights 
and freedoms and ensuring the country&#8217;s development in a democratic setting; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To advocate for the need for a &#8220;people first&#8221; rather than the current &#8220;military 
first&#8221; policy, complemented by an equitable development process, food aid and food 
security, with due respect for the principle of &#8220;no access, no food&#8221;, coupled with adequate 
monitoring; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To respect the rights of refugees, particularly the principle of non-refoulement, 
and the human rights of migrants, and to mitigate the strictures of national immigration 
laws that might otherwise lead to the detention or forced return of refugees or 
asylum-seekers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To maximize dialogue with the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea to enlarge the space for human rights discourse and action, offering 
relevant incentives and graduated measures, and to use the State&#8217;s refusal to cooperate 
with the Special Rapporteur as a key indicator or benchmark for the forthcoming 
universal periodic review of its human rights record; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To address impunity from different viewpoints, whether in terms of State 
responsibility and/or individual criminal responsibility, and enable the totality of the 
United Nations system, especially the Security Council, to take measures to prevent 
egregious violations, protect people from victimization and provide them with effective 
redress, with due regard for the call for broad-based participation of people in governance 
and government. </b></p>
