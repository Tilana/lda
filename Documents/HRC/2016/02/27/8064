<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration of complementary international standards 
submits the present report pursuant to Human Rights Council decisions 3/103 and 10/30 
and resolution 6/21. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session  
</b></p>
<p>2. The Ad Hoc Committee held its fourth session from 10 to 20 April 2012. During the 
session, the Ad Hoc Committee held 16 meetings. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. The session was attended by representatives of Member States, non-Member States 
represented by observers, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>4. The first meeting of the fourth session of the Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration 
of complementary standards was opened on 10 April 2012 by Yury Boychenko, Chief of 
the Anti-Discrimination Section, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR). He welcomed the delegates, noting that it was hoped that the current session 
would be as productive as the previous one. He indicated the need to elect the Chairperson-
Rapporteur for the Ad Hoc Committee in order to proceed with the substantive work of the 
fourth session.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>5. During the first meeting, the Ad Hoc Committee elected Abdul Samad Minty, 
Permanent Representative of the Republic of South Africa, to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva as its Chairperson-Rapporteur, by acclamation. In his brief introductory remarks, 
Mr. Minty thanked the Ad Hoc Committee for the confidence placed in him.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>6. During the 1st meeting of the session, the Ad-Hoc Committee adopted the agenda 
for the fourth session (A/HRC/AC.1/4/1). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Chairperson-Rapporteur introduced the draft programme of work contained in 
the agenda at the 1st meeting. He announced that a meeting of regional coordinators would 
take place prior to the resumption of the session that afternoon, in order to allow for 
additional consultations on the programme of work.  
</p>
<p>8. The revised programme of work was adopted, as amended at the 2nd meeting of the 
Ad Hoc Committee. </p>


<p>9. The Chairperson-Rapporteur made an introductory statement at the 2nd meeting. He 
thanked participants for their understanding and cooperation and offered apologies on 
behalf of the former Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Ad Hoc Committee, Jerry Mathews 
Matjila, who had been unable to be present to chair the Ad Hoc Committee due to his 
reassignment as Director General of the Department of International Relations and 
Cooperation of the South African Government.  He also regretted that in its capacity as 
Chair, South Africa had not been able to fulfil its pledge to consult with participants of the 
Ad hoc Committee on the identified topics prior to the session.  
</p>
<p>10. The Chairperson-Rapporteur noted that South Africa would still urge that a 
permanent Chairperson-Rapporteur for the Ad Hoc Committee be elected, whilst its work 
continued, since the country was inundated with other responsibilities elsewhere, and 
notwithstanding that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance were 
important issues for South Africa. 
</p>
<p>11. The fourth session promised to be challenging and exciting in view of the experts 
and presenters participating.  He thanked States and the Secretariat for their efforts to 
prepare the session. He hoped that the contributions and discussions of presenters would 
provide the Ad Hoc Committee with an opportunity to reflect on and understand the issues 
raised in the previous reports, together with the link between the Ad Hoc Committee&#8216;s 
mandate and paragraph 199 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.   
</p>
<p>12. He stated that South Africa had taken the responsibility, on behalf of the African 
Group, to chair the Ad Hoc Committee with the objective of ensuring that as partners, the 
Ad Hoc Committee worked together to address issues of concern.  His objective was to 
ensure that the Ad Hoc Committee continued working on the three topics, with the 
understanding that the other topics would still be discussed in the future. He looked forward 
to working with participants during the forthcoming two weeks.   
</p>
<p>13. During the 2nd meeting, and following the adoption of the programme of work, 
Cuba, in its national capacity, expressed its obligation to make public reference to the 
atmosphere surrounding the preparation and adoption of the programme of work, referring 
to efforts by certain regional groups and delegations to &#8213;boycott and lengthen&#8214; the work of 
the Ad Hoc Committee.  
</p>
<p>14. The European Union stated that the delay was attributable to &#8213;ill preparation and 
lack of transparency&#8214; and the fact that the draft programme of work, in its view, did not 
reflect the understandings reached at the resumed third session.  It reaffirmed its 
commitment to the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and, noting that it was the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide 
in Rwanda, suggested that a minute&#8216;s silence be observed by the Ad Hoc Committee. 
</p>
<p>15. Switzerland (on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Republic of 
Korea and Uruguay) underscored its flexibility on topics to be discussed and noted its 
satisfaction with the programme of work of the session, which had been adopted by 
consensus. It stated that these delegations had always supported substantive input to the Ad 
Hoc Committee, in the form of experts and presenters, research and data, as this was the 
best approach for carrying out its work. It regretted the &#8213;bad preparation&#8214; of the session and 
that the former Chair&#8216;s proposals and promises had not been met, particularly since the 
dates of the session had been postponed from November to the present.  
</p>
<p>16. Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, renewed its Group&#8216;s commitment to 
participate in the Ad Hoc Committee, stating that the programme of work had been 
adopted, despite the delay imposed by other regional groups. It looked forward to 
commencing the work of the Ad Hoc Committee, as set out in Human Rights Council 
decision 3/103, especially since the meeting was taking place in the year following the tenth </p>


<p>anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action as well as 
the International Year for People of African Descent. 
</p>
<p>17. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, noted that new 
trends in and manifestations of racism were a threat to peaceful societies around the world. 
The delegate stated that Muslims were stigmatized and vilified in public and in private in 
many societies. There were xenophobic attitudes, he said, requiring adequate protection 
measures, both legal and constitutional.  
</p>
<p>18. The Chairperson-Rapporteur called for a moment of silence in respect for the 
International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in Rwanda and in solidarity for all victims 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and genocide. The 
participants of the Ad Hoc Committee duly observed a moment of silence. 
</p>
<p><b> III. </b>Discussion on the topic of &#8220;<b>Xenophobia</b>&#8221;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>19. From 10 to 13 April, in accordance with its programme of work, the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the elaboration of complementary standards heard presentations from several 
experts on the topic of &#8213;Xenophobia&#8214;. At the 2nd meeting, on 10 April, Nozipho January-
Bardill gave a presentation on the recent experiences of South Africa with xenophobia and 
its institutional responses. At the 3rd meeting, on 11 April, Patrick Thornberry, a member 
of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, gave a presentation on 
&#8213;Xenophobia &#8211; with particular reference to the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&#8214;. At its 4th meeting, on the same day, Orest 
Nowosad, Chief of the Civil and Political Rights Section of the Special Procedures Branch 
at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, gave an overview of the work of 
special procedures mandate holders in relation to the issue of xenophobia. At the 5th 
meeting, on 12 April, Duncan Breen, Senior Associate at the NGO Human Rights First, 
gave a presentation entitled &#8213;Combating xenophobic violence&#8214;.  Fanny Dufvenmark and 
Christine Aghazarm from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) gave 
presentations at the 6th meeting, on international migration issues, later that afternoon. On 
13 April, Miguel Hilario-Man&#235;nima of UNICEF gave a presentation at the 7th meeting of 
the session entitled &#8213;Going beyond window dressing: Xenophobia in Latin America: It&#8216;s 
time to count the people of colour&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>20. Due to the word limit for this report, the summaries of these presentations and the 
respective discussions with the meeting participants which followed them are reflected in 
annex II to the present report. 
</p>
<p>21. For the second part of the 7th meeting, the Chairperson-Rapporteur invited the 
participants to commence a general discussion on xenophobia by referring to what had been 
addressed or not addressed thus far that week. He noted that, with the exception of the last 
presenter, a victim-oriented approach seemed to be somewhat lacking from the discussions.  
</p>
<p>22. He commented on the need to perhaps focus on parliamentarians and political 
leaders; and specific other groups such as children, refugees and IDPs and other situations 
such as conflict and post-conflict situations; and the role of class and poverty. He queried 
about historical factors such as those which existed in South Africa, asking which factors 
influence what has been inherited and what was the basis of collective historical 
experience. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegate of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterated the need for 
complementary standards to address manifestations of xenophobia and underlined the need 
to have a definition with a view to strengthening the fight against discrimination. It should 
be in keeping with the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, which should focus on the </p>


<p>elaboration of complementary standards, in accordance with Human Rights Council 
decision 3/103. 
</p>
<p>24. The European Union pointed out that the various presentations illustrated that 
xenophobia was multifaceted and must accordingly be dealt with through various means &#8211; 
legislation, mechanisms and other means. It was stated that none of the presenters had 
stated that there were obvious gaps and none had been able to suggest a legal definition. 
The definition of IOM was not necessarily helpful or operational with respect to the work 
of the Ad Hoc Committee. The representative also highlighted that, throughout the 
presentations, it was noted that xenophobia was a multifaceted phenomenon. The delegate 
stated that xenophobia can be combated through different anti-discrimination measures 
with regard to various grounds.  
</p>
<p>25. The delegate of Norway stated that the session had provided her delegation an 
opportunity for reflection on what had been transpiring in the national context. She 
expressed concern with regard to working on a definition because it would likely be too 
broad or too narrow. The delegate emphasized that xenophobia was a danger to individuals 
and a challenge to democracy, in grave cases leading to racial discrimination, crimes 
against humanity and genocide, etc. The attacks in Norway in 2011 were traumatic for the 
whole Norwegian population. She noted that the attacks were politically fuelled by hate and 
highlighted the importance of intensifying efforts for more openness, democracy, and 
inclusiveness. Norway was committed to unconditional respect for human dignity for 
everyone at all times. With regard to practical issues, she noted that legal protection was not 
always enough to ensure equality and that combined efforts were required. Norway 
considered that there was a solid legal basis to fight racism and xenophobia but it was open 
to take the debate further. The approach should be factual, consensual, and based on real 
needs and clear manifestations, and demonstrate that progress has been hindered or slowed 
down by gaps in the legal regime.  
</p>
<p>26. Japan, on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Switzerland and 
Uruguay, stated that the experts&#8216; presentations were useful and informative, providing a 
clearer and more accurate overview. They highlighted the multifaceted dimension and 
cross-cutting nature of xenophobia and the presentations showed a practical approach to the 
issue. The delegate noted that it could not be concluded that there was an explicit need for 
complementary standards at the international level in the field of xenophobia. Pointing out 
that the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination did not appear 
handicapped by the lack of a definition, Japan recommended that the Committee be invited 
to present an official opinion on the issue, with the aim of clarifying how provisions in the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination could 
be interpreted in relation to xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>27. The delegate of China noted that xenophobia and economic and cultural conflicts 
had been increasing. It was emphasized that the current international instruments were 
somewhat behind the times. Some measures had been undertaken, but they were not 
sufficient and more international cooperation was needed. The issue of xenophobia needed 
to be discussed from the international legal perspective with the purpose of eliminating 
xenophobia and protecting people&#8216;s rights. She highlighted that what had taken place was 
only the initial step towards the issue.  
</p>
<p>28. The United States of America pointed out that while there were many different 
views expressed by the multiple experts, there was a fair amount of coherence in the 
concrete policy recommendations made by them. It would be useful if the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) could go through the experts&#8216; 
presentations and compile a simple matrix, containing recommendations on data 
disaggregation, educational campaigns and other policy recommendations. </p>


<p>29. Egypt stated that while it agreed that there was no conclusive definition of 
xenophobia emanating from the presentations, all presenters confirmed that it was the role 
of the Member States to undertake a definitional exercise. It was not the case that experts 
had noted gaps; rather, they were reluctant to state whether international standards should 
be drawn up. He asked why, if there was no need for complementary standards, xenophobia 
was on the rise? The general comments of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination were not sufficient as they concerned existing international law, not new 
phenomena such as xenophobia. The delegate welcomed the preparation of a matrix 
containing the different definitions of xenophobia as presented by the experts, and as 
contained in relevant paragraphs of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
the Durban Review Conference outcome document. 
</p>
<p>30. Senegal, speaking on behalf of the African Group, emphasized that Human Rights 
Council decision 3/103 was clear about the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, that the re-
opening of the discussion was not valid and that legal instruments should be based on the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. He highlighted the need for definitions from 
a legal point of view&#8212;in this regard he noted that the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action recommended the strengthening of the Convention, which did not contain a 
reference to xenophobia; therefore there was a need for definition to know what xenophobia 
was and to ensure consistency. In this way there would be transparency and legal stability 
for the benefit of the victims. Combating impunity and a victim-centred approach was the 
only path to be adopted. The Ad Hoc Committee should seek national prevention and 
punishment, ensuring access to justice by victims; strengthening the mechanisms or 
equivalent bodies against xenophobia; and organizing awareness-raising campaigns. 
</p>
<p>31. The delegate of Austria stated that xenophobia was a worldwide problem. He also 
noted the need for a victim-centred approach. In this regard it was important to know what 
the needs of the victims were and how they could be assisted in reality. The delegate 
emphasized that there was a lack of implementation of the existing mechanisms. There 
were so many recommendations by the special rapporteurs and the question was how to 
enhance implementation. He was in favour of a broader definition of xenophobia which 
included other grounds of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>32. The delegate of Brazil commended the approach used for this session of the Ad Hoc 
Committee, with experts&#8216; presentations, and invited the Chairperson-Rapporteur to use the 
same approach in future sessions. She outlined some conclusions to serve as the basis for 
future discussions on xenophobia: a victim-oriented approach was key&#894; governments should 
be encouraged to ratify international instruments&#894; and use should be made of the 2007 study 
by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on procedural gaps.  
</p>
<p>33. The delegate of Liechtenstein pointed out the growing consensus within the Ad Hoc 
Committee on adoption of a victim-centred approach&#894; therefore, it should be ensured that 
the Committee did not weaken what already existed. He noted a clear risk to the existing 
framework of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, which might be weakened since the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination had addressed xenophobia and the respective States had been 
accepting these recommendations. These recommendations could be undermined by a 
possible new international definition of xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>34. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, emphasized that the 
Ad Hoc Committee should acknowledge that xenophobic speech and acts were an affront to 
victims and prompt action by the international community was required. He also asked why 
xenophobia had been increasing, if there were in fact, no gaps. He pointed out that legal and 
administrative measures would resolve the problem with greater efficiency. The absence of 
a definition hampered coordinated efforts at the international level and meant that a series </p>


<p>of interpretations were being used. He stated that there was a need to have a common 
understanding of xenophobia, in accordance with the grounds in the Convention, the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference. He stressed that nationality should not be confused with xenophobia 
since even nationals of the same country were attacked. The delegate noted the need to 
address negative stereotyping and xenophobic speech. He emphasized the need to elaborate 
complementary standards on xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>35. The delegate of South Africa stated that there was a need for legal measures to 
address behaviour and protect victims. It was clear and known from the very beginning that 
there was no definition of xenophobia but that it was practised. She noted the positive role 
of the media and suggested that the role of the media be explored, perhaps in collaboration 
with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations. She noted that the adopted optional 
protocols to some of the United Nations instruments, introducing complaints mechanisms, 
did not serve to undermine the mechanism or the protection offered.  
</p>
<p>36. The delegate of France stated that paragraph 199 of the Durban Programme of 
Action, which recommended that the former Commission on Human Rights prepare 
complementary international standards to strengthen and update international instruments 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in all their aspects 
was the ground for engagement by his Government. He stated that France had adopted a 
narrow definition of fear or hatred against non-citizens and non-nationals, which was used 
in order to have a stronger criminal law. This approach complied perfectly with the 
provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. He pointed out that in some cases the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination had used both the narrow and wide definitions. He questioned the 
need for such a definition, if articles 2, 4 and 6 of the Convention stated that victims were 
protected by law. He reiterated that none of the experts had stated that there was a gap in 
the international framework, but that improved implementation was needed.  
</p>
<p>37. The delegate of Switzerland pointed out the need to consider whether a definition 
would be useful or counterproductive for the victims. She said that the matrix on experts&#8216; 
</p>
<p>definitions suggested by the delegate of Egypt might be useful, but it would only prove how 
difficult it was to find a definition. 
</p>
<p>38. The Chairperson-Rapporteur noted that there was a difference of opinion on the 
issues of gaps and definitions and he highlighted the need to look empirically into 
information, and to examine objectively the various issues involved. He noted that even 
after that was done, differing views could still remain.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discussion on the topic of </b>&#8220;<b>Establishment, designation or 
maintaining of national mechanisms with competences to 
protect against and prevent all forms and manifestations of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance</b>&#8221;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>39. On 16 and 17 April, in accordance with its programme of work, the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the elaboration of complementary standards heard presentations from experts 
on the topic of &#8213;Establishment, designation or maintaining of national mechanisms with 
competences to protect against and prevent all forms and manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8214;. At its 8th meeting, on 13 April, the Ad 
Hoc Committee heard two presentations on the topic of &#8213;Establishment, designation or 
maintaining of national mechanisms with competences to protect against and prevent all </p>


<p>forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance&#8214; by Vladlen Stefanov, Chief of the National Institutions and Regional 
Mechanisms Section at OHCHR and Zanofer Ismalebbe, Human Rights Adviser with the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Geneva, respectively.  
</p>
<p>40. At the 9th meeting, on 16 April, Patrick Charlier of the Belgian Centre for Equal 
Opportunities and Opposition to Racism discussed how to choose a national mechanism, 
the status of mechanisms and the remit of mechanisms.  At the 10th meeting later that day, 
Jozef DeWitte, Chair of the European Network of Equality Bodies (Equinet) gave his 
presentation to the Ad Hoc Committee explaining the mandate, role and functions of the 
Belgian Centre.  He also outlined the Network&#8216;s mandate and work.  
</p>
<p>41. At the 11th meeting, on 17 April, Bucio Mujica, President of the Mexican National 
Council for Prevention of Discrimination (CONAPRED), gave a presentation on national 
mechanisms against discrimination, with particular emphasis on his own organization. 
Andr&#233; Castella, Director of the Office for Integration of Foreigners of the Canton of 
Geneva, addressed participants of the Ad Hoc Committee at its 12th meeting. 
</p>
<p>42. Due to the word limit for this report, the summaries of all the above presentations 
and the respective discussions with the meeting participants which followed them are 
reflected in annex II to the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> V. </b>Discussion on the topic of &#8220;Procedural gaps with regard to 
<b>the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>43. At the 13th meeting, on 18 April, Alexey Avtonomov, Chairperson of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, gave a presentation titled 
&#8213;Procedural gaps preventing full and adequate implementation of ICERD&#8214;. He said that, at 
present, the Committee believed that the substantive provisions of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination were sufficient for 
combating racial discrimination in contemporary conditions. The Committee was of the 
view that in the near future it would be able to address problems without amending the 
Convention. Nevertheless, the Committee considered that the establishment of certain new 
procedures might enhance the effectiveness of the Committee&#8216;s activities as a monitoring 
body. The lack of certain procedures was considered by the Committee to constitute the 
procedural gaps in the Convention. The Committee paid great attention to issues related to 
xenophobia, noting that there were many different aspects covered by the definition of 
racial discrimination in the Convention.  He cautioned that any other definition might 
restrict the current one. He said that in the future new wording might be needed for the 
definition, but this was currently not the case.  He said that if there was to be an optional 
protocol to the Convention, it should focus on additional procedures concerning 
investigations, inquiries, procedures to evaluate situations or country visits. 
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Avtonomov explained that as it could sometimes take years before it could act, 
the Committee was suggesting a standing procedure whereby experts could visit the 
country of concern and investigate the situation more promptly. For instance one or two 
experts could visit, collect first-hand information and brief the Committee. In this regard, 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had asked that consideration be 
given to an optional protocol. The suggested wording for the additional procedures varied: 
some experts suggested calling it an evaluation visit; others referred to it as an investigation 
or inquiry procedure. He stated that the Committee was aware that any country visits would 
require additional financial resources; however some treaty monitoring bodies already had </p>


<p>such procedures in place. This proposal was also in line with the ongoing process for 
harmonization of treaty monitoring bodies.  
</p>
<p>45. Mr. Avtonomov stated that a second procedure called evaluation visits/follow-up 
visits would be very helpful both with regard to concluding observations that had already 
been made but also in a case where a periodic report was lacking. An expert from the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, who would be the country 
rapporteur for the State in question, could be charged with carrying out the suggested 
follow-up visit, which would also be helpful to the preparation of periodic reports.  
</p>
<p>46. The delegate of Senegal, on behalf of the African group, said that Mr. Thornberry 
had also stated that there were no shortcomings in the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which was contrary to the opinion of 
the African Group. He emphasized again the issue of legal insecurity and the fact that 
xenophobia was not within the Convention, and suggested that perhaps the phenomenon of 
migration of people was not well known at the time of the adoption of the Convention. He 
emphasized that many years had passed since the adoption of the Convention and it was 
worth reconsidering. The phenomenon of xenophobia was much more visible today. He 
asked for a more substantive explanation of the suggested inquiry procedure, stating that 
early warning and urgent procedures already existed. He noted the role of the Security 
Council with regard to peacekeeping and security and also highlighted the competencies of 
the International Criminal Court. In this regard he queried whether there was a possible 
duplication of efforts.  
</p>
<p>47. The representative of the United States of America highlighted that it was not only 
unnecessary to change the definition of racial discrimination in the Convention but it was 
also dangerous to do so, as understood from Mr. Avtonomov&#8216;s presentation. He pointed out 
that it had been said several times that xenophobia was a new phenomenon, which was not 
correct &#8211; xenophobia might be a new word to describe an old problem, but it had been 
present for a long time. With regard to the suggested new procedures he asked how the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination would avoid duplication of 
activities carried out by the Human Rights Council or OHCHR. He also asked about the 
costs associated with the proposed new procedures.  
</p>
<p>48. The delegate of the European Union emphasized that it was extremely important to 
implement the existing standards and procedures. With regard to procedures, the delegate 
highlighted the need to make optimal use of those existing, in terms of compliance with 
reporting procedures and follow-up to the concluding observations/recommendations of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The delegate asked for Mr. 
Avtonomov&#8216;s view on how this could be done. The delegate also asked about what criteria 
could trigger the suggested evaluation visit: would this be decided by the Committee or 
carried out at the request of the country?  
</p>
<p>49. With regard to the value added of the proposed inquiry procedure, Mr. Avtonomov 
noted that in this way the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination would be 
able to make preventive recommendations. The country visits were to collect information. 
The fact that an enquiry was taking place meant that there was a possibility for violation. 
There was no duplication with the work of the Security Council or the International 
Criminal Court. He explained that there were a limited number of individual complaints 
submitted to the Committee. He suggested that more awareness-raising on this proposal 
was needed.  
</p>
<p>50. Brazil asked how gaps could be addressed in the context of the ongoing process for 
enhancement of treaty monitoring bodies.  
</p>
<p>51. The delegate of Cuba emphasized that his Government could not agree with the 
suggested procedures and comments made, noting that many of these proposals were not </p>


<p>new and had not been formulated by Member States, but by academic experts, investigators 
etc. Cuba could not agree with proposals intended to increase the monitoring of States and 
also questioned the availability of resources for such new procedures.  
</p>
<p>52. The delegate of the Russian Federation asked what kind of stakeholders would be 
involved in the proposed evaluation visits: would they be limited to State authorities or 
would there be interaction with other stakeholders such as NGOs and victims? The same 
question was raised about the proposed follow-up visits. He asked if this would change the 
procedure whereby States were required to answer requests within one year.  
</p>
<p>53. With regard to country visits, Mr. Avtonomov stated that they could not be similar 
to the individual complaints procedure as they were different in nature. The country visits 
might be akin to fact-finding missions to collect information and for this purpose the 
meetings should be held with a variety of stakeholders including State authorities, NGOs 
and victims. The follow-up visits would be based on the recommendations of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and therefore the focus would be 
on State institutions, as they were charged with implementation. However, there might also 
be the possibility of meetings with some NGOs.  
</p>
<p>54. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, emphasized the need 
for a definition of xenophobia, as State parties had a series of interpretations. The 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination would also have a problem taking a 
universal and consistent approach as it might take into consideration xenophobia for one 
periodic report but not for another one.  
</p>
<p>55. The delegate of South Africa inquired about how the suggested follow-up visits 
might build the capacities of States to produce periodic reports. She asked whether the 
proposed inquiry procedure would replace the reporting obligation, about complementarity 
with special procedures, and about the criteria for such visits.  
</p>
<p>56. Italy said that the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was extremely important. He questioned the 
envisaged six-month time period and also asked for clarification on whether the summary 
account from the State Party would be included in the report to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>57. In response to a question from Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic 
Cooperation, Mr. Avtonomov said that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination had been addressing the issues of profiling and stereotyping &#8211; often 
condemning both of these in the concluding observations. If the definitions of xenophobia, 
profiling, stereotyping were included in the Convention, the Committee would work with 
these definitions and respond to new challenges. In his opinion, the members of the 
Committee were not absolutely against the introduction of a new definition; but rather, 
considered that the focus should be on procedural gaps to strengthen their work. He added 
that he could not recall a case of xenophobia which had not been addressed by the 
Committee, as it always included one or more grounds under article 1 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>58. At the 14th meeting, on 18 April, the Chairperson-Rapporteur invited the 
participants to commence a general discussion and exchange of views on the topic of 
&#8213;Establishment, designation or maintaining of national mechanisms with competences to 
protect against and prevent all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>59. The European Union stated that national mechanisms were important in ensuring a 
victim-centred approach and in focusing on remedies as well as on prevention of 
discrimination. National mechanisms could help ensure effective protection and remedies to 
victims of discrimination by providing legal assistance to victims during judicial 
proceedings, and where they were vested with quasi-judicial functions they could </p>


<p>complement the at times lengthy, inaccessible and expensive court proceedings. It added 
that providing remedies was a necessary but not sufficient means of combating 
discrimination. It was of equal importance that national mechanisms prevent discrimination 
by conducting awareness-raising campaigns, educational activities, training of journalists, 
etc.  
</p>
<p>60. The choice or combination of mechanism(s) should depend on the local context. It 
also welcomed cooperation and exchange of good practices between different national 
mechanisms and between national mechanisms and United Nations agencies. There was a 
need to further explore the potential of national mechanisms to improve implementation of 
existing international standards &#8211; thereby ensuring their effectiveness. It could be useful for 
the Committee at a later session to look further into guidelines for setting up national 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>61. On behalf of the African Group, Senegal urged the establishment of national 
mechanisms where countries had yet to establish them. These mechanisms should include 
issues of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in their 
mandates. They should be victim-centred in approach and the access of victims to the 
mechanisms should be assured. Where there were national institutions and a specialized 
body, there should be coordination to ensure greater efficiency. Senegal added that 
OHCHR should provide appropriate technical assistance to enable States to establish 
national human rights institutions.  
</p>
<p>62. France noted that conciliation at the national level and networking at the regional 
level were effective ways to support direct impacts for victims on the ground.    
</p>
<p>63. The Chairperson-Rapporteur agreed that mechanisms should take account of local 
context and added that the Committee may wish to consider at some point the role, nature 
and benefits of regional mechanisms in addressing racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance as well as how national mechanisms assist in 
developing a regional approach to issues. He gave the African Peer Review Mechanism and 
its success on common governance issues as an example and also highlighted the role of 
religious faith organizations. 
</p>
<p>64. The United States of America appreciated the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s 
intervention with respect to regional mechanisms, noting that the Organization of American 
States and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were also examples of 
regional initiatives which, via country assessments, were mechanisms for individual 
complaints and initiatives concerning discrimination on the basis of religion and belief. 
These regional approaches merited future consideration by the Committee.   
</p>
<p>65. Egypt stated that it would be useful to have presentations on regional standards in 
future sessions. It reiterated the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, stating that while steps 
should be taken on the ground at domestic level, this must be rooted in international 
standards and mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>66. Cuba emphasized that while national mechanisms were important they must be 
linked to the sovereign and individual culture and characteristics of a given country. A 
sharing of best practices and information was very much needed.  
</p>
<p>67. Liechtenstein stated that national mechanisms were closest to victims and were well-
placed to address issues of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
at the domestic level. The delegate noted that reference to the obligation of States Parties to 
establish national mechanisms could be included in any work addressing the procedural 
gaps in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination.  </p>


<p>68. The delegate of the United States of America added that the Committee had yet to 
hear a concrete case or situation where the lack of a definition limited the capacity response 
of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to consider the issue or 
where a national mechanism had been unable to address an issue due to a substantive gap in 
international law. 
</p>
<p>69. South Africa stressed that the topic of national mechanisms was cross-cutting and 
noted their importance in enforcing implementation at the national level. The delegate 
recalled that while these mechanisms were national, the Paris Principles had been 
elaborated and endorsed at the level of the General Assembly. With regard to the &#8213;narrow&#8214; 
and &#8213;wide&#8214; interpretations of xenophobia, there was indeed an inconsistency which 
suggested that methodologically it would be important to rule out what xenophobia was 
not.  
</p>
<p>70. Tunisia underscored the importance of political leaders and highlighted a role to be 
played by the International Parliamentary Union (IPU).  The delegate noted that the great 
number of States&#8216; reservations to article 4 of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was a significant obstacle to effective 
implementation.  
</p>
<p>71. During this meeting, there was also a general discussion and exchange of views on 
the topic of &#8213;Procedural Gaps with regard to the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>72. The delegate of Switzerland (on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Mexico, 
Republic of Korea and Uruguay) underscored the continued relevance of the Convention 
and its monitoring procedures, adding that Mr. Avtonomov had demonstrated the concrete 
impact of addressing its procedural gaps. With respect to the topic of xenophobia, it stated 
that further discussion and consideration were required.  
</p>
<p>73. Liechtenstein commented on the proposal to establish an inquiry and an on-site 
evaluation procedure, emphasizing that they were purely intended as procedural 
instruments and that no new substantive ground or rights would be created. It was 
worthwhile considering an evaluation procedure which allowed the Committee&#8216;s expert to 
look at the national situation.  
</p>
<p>74. Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, stated that with regard to the evaluation 
(submission of reports) procedure, it would be useful to consider the reason for the delay in 
the submission of States reports and the value-added of the follow-up visits would also 
have to be considered given that there were other relevant missions, including those of 
mandate-holders.   
</p>
<p>75. Cuba stated that the mandate of the Committee was to elaborate complementary 
standards, not procedures. It stated that the Committee&#8216;s mechanisms and procedures were 
sufficient and that the Committee had difficulty managing its current workload. 
</p>
<p>76. South Africa disagreed with the argument of some delegations that focusing on a 
narrow or wide interpretation of xenophobia was counterproductive and with the contention 
that such a consideration might undermine the Committee&#8216;s decisions and gains already 
made. A new definition did not pose a risk, since it was counterintuitive for Member States 
to agree to a standard which would undermine previous decisions or standards. Egypt 
agreed with South Africa and with the intervention of Senegal on behalf of the African 
Group, that the Committee was tasked to look at substantive gaps and stated that a 
discussion of procedural gaps was out of context.   
</p>
<p>77. France stated that the topic of national mechanisms should still be on the table for 
future discussion, acknowledging that there were different interpretations amongst 
Committee members.  The delegate recalled that paragraph 199 of the Durban Declaration </p>


<p>and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference 
did not limit the issue to procedural or substantive gaps.  The importance of strengthening 
treaty bodies was noted and it appreciated the proposals put forward by the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to address procedural gaps.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Adoption of the report  
</b></p>
<p>78. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the 15th meeting, on 20 April, and announced 
that the draft of the report of the session had been circulated to participants. He invited 
them to consider the draft with a view to ensuring the accuracy of the session report and to 
make solely factual or technical revisions to it.  
</p>
<p>79. He also informed the meeting that, under his own responsibility, he had undertaken 
to prepare a Chair&#8216;s conclusions and recommendations, which he had shared with regional 
coordinators the evening before and which he would introduce to the Committee as a 
whole. After this oral intervention on the document, copies would be made available to the 
meeting. The meeting was adjourned by the Chair, further to the request of delegations, to 
allow for continued consultations amongst them on an agreed concluding document for the 
session. 
</p>
<p>80. At the resumption of the 15th meeting, the Chairperson-Rapporteur read out his 
Chair&#8216;s conclusions and recommendations, entitled &#8213;Summary by the Chairperson-
Rapporteur: H.E. Mr. Minty, Permanent Representative of the Republic of South Africa&#8214; 
(see annex I of this report).  
</p>
<p>81. Liechtenstein pointed out that the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s summary of the session 
was his responsibility and at his prerogative. The delegate stated that his understanding of 
the summary of the debates differed.  He formally expressed his disagreement with 
paragraph 15 of the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s summary, pointing out that the statement 
contained therein undermined the protection provided for victims of xenophobia under the 
framework of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>82. The European Union also reiterated that the summary was that of the Chairperson-
Rapporteur and not that of the Ad Hoc Committee. The European Union disagreed with 
some of the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s summary, particularly with regard to the existence of 
gaps. It emphasized that it had not been established in the session that there were 
substantive gaps in the Convention, in particular in relation to xenophobia, which required 
filling. It understood that the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s document would be annexed to the 
report of the fourth session.   
</p>
<p>83. Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, took the floor and suggested a number of 
precisions and redrafting proposals to for the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s summary. Pakistan, 
on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, supported the intervention of the 
Africa Group and expressed appreciation to the Chairperson-Rapporteur for sharing his 
thoughts, noting that the summary required further study.   
</p>
<p>84. The United States of America did not make detailed comments on the Chairperson-
Rapporteur&#8216;s summary but stated that it understood that the document contained the 
personal observations of the Chairperson-Rapporteur. The delegate then made some general 
observations, reiterating that efforts or proposals to arrive at new definitions to replace or 
supplement those in the Convention were not only unnecessary, but dangerous. He recalled 
that with regard to violence and discrimination based on religion or belief, the United States 
had proposed international action in previous Ad Hoc Committee sessions and was 
supportive of moving ahead with the implementation of Human Rights Council resolution </p>


<p>16/18.  The delegate noted bipartisan support in the United States for freedom of expression 
and opinion, and that the United States reservation to article 4 of the Convention was based 
on principle, not politics. 
</p>
<p>85. Switzerland (on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Republic of 
Korea and Uruguay) also stated that it understood the document represented the personal 
views of the Chairperson-Rapporteur. It underscored the importance of inter-sessional 
preparations in order to properly prepare the fifth session.  
</p>
<p>86. Cuba expressed support for the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8216;s summary, particularly 
since it noted that developing norms and standards to address xenophobia was both a need 
and a priority.   
</p>
<p>87. China thanked the Chairperson-Rapporteur for his summary and expressed its full 
support, stating that he had mapped out the right direction in which to build further 
momentum.    
</p>
<p>88. The Chairperson-Rapporteur replied that his summary was solely a Chair&#8216;s 
conclusions and recommendations and its contents would be reflected in the annex of the 
final report of the fourth session. It was not a negotiated text, therefore no suggestions or 
amendments to it would be considered. It was drawn up in a very general manner. 
Nevertheless, it was now the property of the Ad Hoc Committee to utilize or not, as it saw 
fit. He looked forward to the session&#8216;s conclusions on the way forward.  
</p>
<p>89. At the 16th meeting, the report of the fourth session was adopted ad referendum, 
with the understanding that delegations would receive a revised version of the draft report 
by 4 May 2012, with regard to which they would forward technical corrections to their 
interventions, in writing, to the Secretariat by 18 May 2012. 
</p>
<p>90. At this meeting, the delegation of Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, also 
presented an agreed text entitled &#8213;Draft Conclusions of the Ad Hoc Committee on the 
</p>
<p>elaboration of complementary standards on its fourth session&#8214;.  Following oral technical 
corrections by the European Union and Egypt, the text was adopted by consensus, as 
follows: 
</p>
<p> &#8213;The Ad Hoc Committee with the objective to fulfill its mandate, decided to 
invite the Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee to hold informal consultations, within 
existing resources, with regional and political coordinators during the inter-sessional 
period between the fourth and fifth sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, with the aim 
to prepare the fifth session and collect concrete proposals for discussion on the 
topics of xenophobia; establishment, designation or maintaining of national 
mechanisms with competences to protect against and prevent all forms and 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
and procedural gaps with regard to the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in accordance with its mandate. 
</p>
<p> Request OHCHR to send out a questionnaire, within existing resources, to 
gather information regarding the three topics discussed during the fourth session of 
the Ad Hoc Committee and in its report (xenophobia, national mechanisms and 
procedural gaps), including legal and judicial frameworks and practices, substantive 
and procedural measures in line with the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, and 
possible recommendations.  
</p>
<p> Invite OHCHR to post the responses to the questionnaire on its website and, 
in consultation with the Chair, prepare a summary of responses to the questionnaire 
received during the inter-sessional period for discussion during the fifth session.  </p>


<p> Recommend that the fifth session of the Ad Hoc Committee discuss new 
topic(s) as contained in the report (A/HRC/18/36) of the third session of the Ad Hoc 
Committee or additional topic(s) submitted during the inter-sessional period.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>91. A number of delegations (European Union; Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation 
of Islamic Cooperation; Senegal, on behalf of the African Group; South Africa; United 
States of America; Cuba, on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group 
(GRULAC); and Switzerland, on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Mexixo, 
Republic of Korea and Uruguay) took the floor to express their appreciation, in particular to 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur, of the manner in which he had conducted the session.  
</p>
<p>92. In closing the meeting, the Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked all participants for their 
valuable efforts, noting with satisfaction that the fourth session had adopted its programme 
of work and session conclusions by consensus. While there was still work to be done, the 
Ad Hoc Committee had succeeded in charting some kind of course for its future.  </p>


<p><b>Annexes 
</b></p>
<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the Chairperson-Rapporteur: H.E. Abdul 
Samad Minty, Permanent Representative of the Republic of 
South Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory/opening remarks 
</b></p>
<p>1. The meeting was opened by the Chairperson-Rapporteur in which he expressed an 
apology for being unable to fulfil the pledge to consult on the two topics before the 
Committee, and for being unable to avail South Africa&#8216;s input on the issue of Xenophobia 
in a timely manner, where after he submitted a programme of work. 
</p>
<p>2. In the meeting, concerns were expressed by some delegations about the failure to 
meet commitments undertaken during the Third Session of the Ad Hoc Committee, and the 
resulting inadequate preparations for the 4th Session, including the lack of transparency in 
preparing the programme of work, which in their view, was unbalanced.  
</p>
<p>3. Other delegations expressed concern at the manner in which agreement on the 
programme of work was delayed, which according to them also included threats to delay 
the proceedings in the Ad Hoc Committee. 
</p>
<p>4. The Chairperson-Rapporteur reminded the Committee that South Africa had 
accepted to chair the Ad Hoc Committee on an interim basis as indicated in the report of the 
Third Session, and urged that a permanent chair be found as South Africa is inundated with 
other responsibilities elsewhere. He also informed that Ambassador January-Bardill would 
be presenting a paper on the South African experience on Xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, the Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked Member States and the UN 
Secretariat for ensuring that panellists were available for the current session, which would 
afford the Committee an opportunity to reflect on and understand the issues raised in 
previous reports, as well as the link between the mandate of the Committee and paragraph 
199 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The Chairperson-Rapporteur also 
reminded that other topics would still be considered by the Committee. 
</p>
<p>6. On the substantive issues, it was already apparent that there were divergent views on 
the need to elaborate Complementary Standards to address the emerging/contemporary 
forms/manifestations of racism and racial discrimination such as xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>7. There was a perspective that argued for the need to focus on addressing 
contemporary forms and manifestations of racism, such as xenophobia, which have not 
been provided for in existing international human rights law instruments, in particular, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(ICERD). In this regard, a need to elaborate an international legal and conceptual 
framework was expressed. 
</p>
<p>8. There was also, a contrasting perspective that sought proof of the ineffectiveness of 
the non-discrimination provisions within the existing international human rights 
instruments, as a basis to determine the need to elaborate Complementary International </p>


<p>Standards to address the contemporary forms and manifestation of racism and racial 
discrimination such as Xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>9. The third perspective maintained that the ICERD was sufficient to address the 
existing gaps. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues emanating from the thematic discussion on xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p>10. It was apparent that in the case of racism and racial discrimination, these pertain to 
discrimination expressed against settled groups of persons who live in the same country and 
constitute a racial group, a community of Indigenous people, minorities and others who 
over a considerable period of time, have become settled communities subjected to 
discrimination emanating from established structures, systems and patterns of treatment that 
becomes virtually self-perpetuating in many forms, including structural discrimination. 
These groups fall squarely within the categories of the victims as outlined in the DDPA. 
</p>
<p>11. There is no normative definition of xenophobia in international human rights 
instruments. However, Xenophobia is manifested as hostility, aggressiveness and even 
hatred that is mainly directed at strangers and non-citizens who are usually newcomers and 
who experience/are subjected to severe discrimination which arises from a latent or active 
predisposition to racism which becomes a much harsher expression of attitudes and 
behaviour, and even violence. It does have some factors or components that if not common 
to, have features of racism but involve greater hostility, while some acts amount to virtual 
intimidation with a message that those persons are not wanted in the host community and 
that they should leave or face greater hostility and hatred. Thus in some of the acts they 
actually convey a strong message of deep threat which is reinforced by actual actions 
including violence. This amounts to a total behaviour pattern that emphasises the virtual 
exclusion of those persons, who are subjected to abuse, discrimination and hatred targeted 
at a specific group, including violence. 
</p>
<p>12. It also emerged that there are underlying socio-economic factors, especially 
conditions where there is relative deprivation, extreme poverty and unemployment, which 
usually accompany the manifestation of Xenophobia, resulting in the violation of human 
rights, in particular, the right to non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>13. There are various views about the definition of Xenophobia and some were of the 
view that it required definition in order to allow for legal remedies for the victims, while 
others were of the view that it should be dealt with within the broader context of racial 
discrimination given its multifaceted nature, which requires a comprehensive response.  
</p>
<p>14. There was agreement that whilst there is no definition of Xenophobia, the practice 
by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) was to interpret 
Xenophobia in both its narrow and wider meanings. It also emerged that while there were 
different views on the definition of Xenophobia, the existence of the concept was generally 
understood, and there is recognition that Xenophobia is on the increase and needed to be 
counteracted with firm and effective measures, given its pervasiveness across the national, 
regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, there was agreement that while the CERD may elaborate a General 
Recommendation on Xenophobia, States Parties are under no obligation to implement such 
a General Recommendation.   
</p>
<p>16. The ICERD has also, not provided for permanent residents who do not or cannot 
assume nationality (for example, States not allowing dual nationality), who continue to be 
victims of Xenophobia while for all other purposes have assumed the same obligations as 
nationals. </p>


<p>17. Given the different ways in which Xenophobia manifests itself, it is important that a 
more holistic approach which is also multi-dimensional be adopted to prevent and combat 
it, including legislative and administrative measures, public policies, educational 
campaigns, particularly those promoting understanding of diverse cultures as well as 
tolerance, at the national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>18. Migrants and other foreigners contribute to the economies of countries in which they 
are resident, yet they are often characterised as wrong doers and even criminals. There is a 
need to involve them in addressing xenophobia, and to consult with the communities within 
which they are resident. 
</p>
<p>19. The Ad Hoc Committee took note of the upcoming 80th Session of the CERD, which 
will address the issue of incitement to hatred, which will enrich deliberations in the 
Committee 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional responses to xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p>20. Recommendations for institutional responses to Xenophobia included the following: 
</p>
<p><b>  International legal mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Some delegations argued that the current International Human Rights 
Instruments such as ICERD, among others, do not cover the contemporary manifestations 
of racism such as xenophobia. They argued for and recommended the need to elaborate an 
international legal, conceptual framework to address the emerging tendencies that violate 
human rights.  
</p>
<p> (b) Xenophobia is seen as a global phenomenon that needs to be addressed at the 
international level. Similar to other phenomenon that needed international action to defeat, 
such as colonization, slavery, racism, apartheid, etc. so does xenophobia and its 
manifestations. Similar to these scourges, xenophobia manifests itself including through 
criminal acts, aggressive attitudes and behavior. 
</p>
<p><b>  National legal mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>(a) Some argued that there is a need to support and strengthen existing 
international and) national mechanisms. They stated that xenophobia should be treated in 
the same way as other grounds of non-discrimination (thus criminalizing the act, not the 
attitude). To this end, the existence of national legislation is seen as sufficient, what is 
required is its implementation or enforcement. 
</p>
<p>(b) Most importantly, effective national mechanisms are critical to prevent, 
monitor and combat xenophobia, as well as to provide assistance and support, including 
access to justice.  
</p>
<p><b>  Political leadership 
</b></p>
<p>The issue of political leadership was highlighted as an important element to address 
the issue of xenophobia. Furthermore, it was emphasized that political will is critical in 
addressing acts of xenophobia, and to influence the issue in a positive manner, particularly 
from the highest ranking political leaders at the national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p><b>  Media and civil society 
</b></p>
<p>(a) The media and civil society were seen as important players in shaping public 
opinion and attitudes. Equally, their role could be critical in complementing the work of 
public officials around issues of negative stereotypes about foreign nationals and their </p>


<p>contribution to host countries. In this regard media needs to be engaged to be more 
balanced, and to contribute to educational campaigns promoting understanding and 
tolerance for diversity, including culture and religion. 
</p>
<p>(b) Other stakeholders such as Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), 
community and religious leaders need to be engaged to promote tolerance and 
understanding with a view to preventing the occurrence of xenophobic acts and/or violence, 
to facilitate support and assist the victims. 
</p>
<p><b>  Education 
</b></p>
<p>Education was considered an important tool in the fight against Xenophobia. 
Education of the society, through various programmes that target host communities, law 
enforcement agencies, children, etc. was also crucial in changing people&#8216;s attitudes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Data and/matrix of xenophobia globally 
</b></p>
<p>The issue of data, in particular disaggregated data, or even mapping/developing a 
matrix on reported xenophobic incidents, was seen as important evidence of the 
manifestation of Xenophobia as a global phenomenon. It is worth noting that a number of 
countries where xenophobic attacks and/or incidents had arisen were highlighted, with a 
view to demonstrating the virulence of xenophobia across all sectors and globally. 
</p>
<p><b>  Social inclusion 
</b></p>
<p>(a) It was highlighted that social exclusion, poverty, inequalities, power 
relations, history of violence (colonization, slavery, prohibition, racist laws, etc.) and other 
factors contribute to the rise and prevalence of xenophobia. An appeal was made that 
efforts should be directed at ensuring social inclusion of foreign nationals into the receiving 
communities. 
</p>
<p>(b) Strategies to address xenophobia need to include effective communication 
and coordination mechanisms to facilitate a rapid response given the increasing xenophobic 
incidents, as well as training of the police/law enforcement agencies on human rights 
standards and on evidence collection to prevent re-victimization of victims. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Recommendations: Xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p>21. The work undertaken in the Ad Hoc Committee needs to continue its focus on the 
plight of victims, to ensure unconditional respect for human dignity. In this regard I 
consider that it would be useful to explore possibilities of an international regulatory 
framework for xenophobia given the more aggressive manifestations of xenophobia, which 
need stronger measures. 
</p>
<p>22. While there is no normative definition of Xenophobia, there is a need to distinguish 
it from ethnocentrism. It may be recalled that Xenophobia is a new form and manifestation 
of racism and racial discrimination, which emanated from a global white power system and 
a legacy of the past which we have all inherited. There is huge evidence in this regard, of 
the importance of dealing with this scourge, irrespective of the availability of legal 
instruments.  
</p>
<p>23. I wish to recall that in the case of my own country South Africa, notwithstanding 
that the ICERD provided for the criminalization and combating of racial discrimination, a 
phenomenon which occurred in a specific part of the world, there was determination and 
worldwide condemnation including through United Nations resolutions, and recognition by 
the international community that Apartheid was a specific manifestation of racial </p>


<p>discrimination that required special measures and an international legal framework to 
address it, and hence a crime against humanity. That collective determination de-
legitimised Apartheid. In 1993 on the eve of the demise of Apartheid as well as during the 
World Conference on Human Rights there was a clear recognition that Xenophobia 
constituted a danger. Within that context, there was recognition that Xenophobia was a 
specific manifestation, hence the focus on it during the World Conference against Racism, 
Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, despite the absence of a 
definition of Xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>24. While there has been a general approach in dealing with Xenophobia and its 
manifestation worldwide, it is based on the recognition that it is on the rise and endangers 
peaceful co-existence in society. 
</p>
<p>25. I recognize that there are divergent points of view on the need to address 
Xenophobia specifically, and wish to recall that we have been able to address similar 
challenges in the past.  The pertinent examples in this regard are numerous violations of 
human rights covered in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 
where we recognized the need to elaborate specific conventions dealing with them, such as 
torture, the rights of the child, and in the case of non-discrimination, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the 
Convention on the rights of migrant workers and members of their families. 
</p>
<p>26. Given the foregoing, I recommend that the Ad Hoc Committee adopts a gradual step 
by step approach and explore possibilities of benefiting from the additional contribution of 
experts in this regard, to provide more clarity with a view to strengthen the international 
human rights law protection regime for the victims. In particular, I consider that it may be 
useful for the Ad Hoc Committee to: 
</p>
<p>27. Benefit from more information and analysis, in particular on how Xenophobia 
impacts on victims of Xenophobia as outlined in the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action; and  
</p>
<p>28. To benefit from a study on the intersectionality between class and poverty and the 
manifestation of xenophobia needs to be considered by the Committee, including the 
broader global historical context of racism, colonialism, slavery and apartheid among 
others.  
</p>
<p>29. I therefore recommend that a comprehensive and objective study be undertaken to 
inform discussions in the Committee, including the intersectionality between Xenophobia 
and race, gender, religion and nationality. 
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, I recommend that the Ad Hoc Committee should address a request to 
the Human Rights Council, for it to convene a seminar for media practitioners, to deliberate 
on how best to contribute to a culture of understanding and tolerance for diversity, with a 
view to eliminate stereotypes and hate crimes related to racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>31. Finally, it is recommended that the Ad Hoc Committee should continue the 
consideration of the issue of xenophobia in its future sessions. In this regard, I will develop 
a framework which encompasses the elements discussed during this session on xenophobia 
and national mechanisms. </p>


<p><b> E. Issues emanating from the discussion on the establishment, designation 
</b></p>
<p><b>or maintaining of national mechanisms with competencies to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>against and prevent all forms and manifestation of racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>32. It emerged that National Human Rights Institutions, in particular those who comply 
with the Paris Principles as contained in United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) 
resolution 48/134 0f 20 December 1993, are key partners in monitoring, promotion and 
protection of human rights. Additionally, it was highlighted that the National human rights 
institutions (NHRIs) are a mechanism for ensuring conformity of legislation with 
international obligations, including the implementation of the ICERD and the DDPA. 
</p>
<p>33. It was also highlighted that these NHRI are independent from Government even 
though they may be funded through Government resources, however they should be 
accountable, including to Parliament, civil society and the victims. 
</p>
<p>34. It was agreed that there is no single ideal model of a national mechanism to promote 
and protect human rights. In this regard, it was also agreed that Specialised Institutions 
could be established to promote and protect human rights, taking into consideration the 
specificities and the national context. 
</p>
<p>35. It also recognised that these NHRIs or Specialised Institutions should have a broad 
mandate to cover various categories of victims of racism, xenophobia and incitement, 
among others and reflect the diversity of society and be accessible to the victims of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>36. It was also emphasised that these NHRIs and Specialised Institutions should be 
adequately funded in order to execute their mandate effectively, which could also entail the 
consideration of individual complaints. 
</p>
<p>37. The mechanisms must also be able to produce proposals and recommendations with 
a view to contributing to the improvement of legislation. They should also be able to 
evaluate their activities. Evaluation could also be undertaken nationally, regionally or 
internationally. 
</p>
<p>38. It was also acknowledged that the effectiveness or success of these institutions 
cannot be verified, save to say that they are at a &#8213;sensitization stage&#8214;. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Recommendations: Establishment, designation or maintaining of 
</b></p>
<p><b>national mechanisms with competencies to protect against and prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>all forms and manifestation of racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>39. I recommend a study on the impact of the National Human Rights Institutions and 
Specialised Institutions as appropriate, on the monitoring, promotion and respect of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>40. I recommend the exchange of good practices among National Human Rights 
Institutions and Specialised Institutions as appropriate, on a national and regional level with 
a view to contributing to the effectiveness of these institutions. 
</p>
<p>41. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner should assist National Human 
Rights Institutions in developing countries to strengthen their capacity to monitor, promote 
and protect human rights. </p>


<p><b> G. Procedural gaps preventing full and adequate implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>42. A representative of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD) presented a proposal for an additional protocol that would establish a procedure 
providing for evaluation visits, in addition to the presentation of national reports.  
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, the representative of the CERD also proposed follow-up visits with a 
view to contributing to the full and effective implementation of the ICERD. 
</p>
<p>44. Various views were expressed in this regard, including that the existing mechanisms 
should be used more effectively, while others were of the view that the issue of procedural 
gaps should be pursued within the context of the work of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>45. The issue of the role of politics as expressed in the many reservations on Article 4 
was highlighted in that States in their sovereign right enter reservations on the ICERD 
which exempt them from implementation thereof. This challenge will remain. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Procedural gaps preventing full and adequate implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>46. I recommend that further discussions be pursued on the issue of procedural gaps 
during future sessions of the Committee 
</p>
<p><b> I. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>47. I wish to express my appreciation to all of you, the Secretariat as well as panellists 
who contributed to and enriched our discussion. Most importantly, I wish to express my 
appreciation for the spirit in which these discussions were undertaken. I hope that we will 
continue to build on it as we continue our work. 
</p>
<p>48. To focus on Xenophobia and how to effectively counteract it in no way undermines 
the support for more effective national and other mechanisms. Once cannot fight 
Xenophobia in the absence of appropriate machinery. At the same time, the focus on 
effective machinery does not mean that one should not focus on the specific need to address 
Xenophobia as a serious crime. Both are complementary. 
</p>
<p>49. I hope that what I have proposed will be considered duly, and look forward to your 
comments and proposals going forward. </p>


<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the expert presentations and initial discussions 
</b>on the topics of &#8220;Xenophobia&#8221; and &#8220;Establishment, 
<b>designation or maintaining of national mechanisms with 
competences to protect against and prevent all forms and 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related i</b>ntolerance&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Expert presentations and initial discussion on </b>&#8220;<b>Xenophobia</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the 2nd meeting, on 10 April, the Chairperson-Rapporteur welcomed H.E. 
Nozipho January-Bardill to make a presentation on South Africa&#8216;s recent experiences with 
xenophobia and its institutional responses. 
</p>
<p>2. She explained how specific national historical, political economic and social 
circumstances in South Africa have developed into a situation where violent xenophobia is 
integral to the nation building project that South Africa embarked on in 1994, ironically to 
transform the nation and advance the African Renaissance.    
</p>
<p>3. Xenophobic tendencies against foreign nationals and more specifically African 
migrants had been documented only since 1994 and the trend is that there has been a steady 
increase of migrants over the years.  She added that the violence which had characterised 
South African xenophobia was peculiar in that it had been aimed at other African nationals 
and not against foreigners in general.  The violence has been confined to the urban informal 
settlements in South Africa&#8216;s major cities characterised by high levels poverty, relative 
</p>
<p>deprivation, and unemployment and housing shortages. 
</p>
<p>4. She went on to explain briefly that the possible reasons and explanations were 
rooted in the past and in the present, including apartheid&#8216;s &#8213;foreign natives&#8214; and inferior 
aliens policies&#894; negative and exclusionary social attitudes&#894; historically discriminatory 
</p>
<p>immigration policies&#894; and poor service delivery. The rapid rate at which xenophobia has 
</p>
<p>spread among South Africans in the past decade as well as its violent expression against the 
African population has much to do with aspects of the nation building project and the 
limitations of the new state in fulfilling the promises made to its struggling citizens. 
</p>
<p>5. A number of institutional responses to xenophobia were outlined during Ms. 
January-Bardill&#8216;s presentation. The role of the local media in using stereotypes of migrants 
and foreign nationals as inferior and inherently criminal was presented. Criminalization and 
discrimination against foreign nationals by political, immigration and law enforcement 
agencies&#894; the need for government interventions, especially those which condemned all 
</p>
<p>threats of xenophobia at the highest level were explored.  Other responses included 
awareness-raising and education, prevention strategies, crisis management, conflict 
resolution and prevention strategies, access to justice for victims of xenophobic violence, 
disaster management during humanitarian crisis and internal displacement&#894; Recourse to 
</p>
<p>justice in the form of more robust laws to promote and protect the rights of migrants was 
imperative&#894; as well as robust regional development and reparations for past suffering.     
</p>
<p>6. Ms. January-Bardill concluded that non-citizens enjoyed relatively extensive formal 
rights under the 1996 Constitution and its Bill of Rights. Only the Government could </p>


<p>address the practical challenges of claiming these rights by creating an enabling 
environment for people in South Africa to challenge the status quo and by fostering a more 
inclusive nation-building project. She added that she had made no reference to the issue of 
complementary standards as it was to be considered by Committee participants in the 
coming days. 
</p>
<p>7. Several delegations took the floor to comment and ask questions about the 
presentation. Greece noted that it appeared that all phobias could be cured; however, 
xenophobia appeared to be exempt. He added that while the presentation focussed on 
containing the violent impact of xenophobia, the interventions suggested included 
awareness/raising and education and begged the question of whether a person was capable 
of reform. Ms. January-Bardill noted the power of ideology, acknowledging that a &#8213;cure&#8214; 
for social ills was difficult. It was possible to change ideas and that in South Africa this was 
an on-going exercise; nevertheless, justice for victims was possible.  
</p>
<p>8. The European Union (EU) noted that the presentation seemed to adopt a narrow 
definition of xenophobia in respect of &#8213;nationality&#8214; and &#8213;citizenship&#8214;. The delegate queried 
the emphasis on prevention and asked whether xenophobia was in fact a new or old 
phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>9. Senegal on behalf of the African Group stated that South Africa was attempting to 
criminalize the acts that flowed from xenophobia as distinct from others and asked Ms. 
January-Bardill how international interventions could affect those at the domestic level. 
</p>
<p>10. Ms. January-Bardill responded that definitions were difficult to crystallize and that 
perhaps the focus should be on what xenophobia was not rather that what it was. She 
continued that the more interesting question was why not what and that there was a need to 
continue working on these definitions. With regard to gaps, she mentioned that she hoped 
that CERD would one day look into the issue, adding that racism often changed in shape 
and form and that it was key to &#8213;keep an eye&#8214; on the instruments to ensure that they still fit 
or whether there was a need to make room for phenomena. She noted a need to discuss 
issues of xenophobia in the future with her CERD colleagues.  
</p>
<p>11. Paraguay questioned whether in defining xenophobia identity or value was truly at 
the centre and cautioned about placing &#8213;nationality&#8214; necessarily at the centre of the 
definition and analysis.  
</p>
<p>12. Ms. January-Bardill replied that it was true that laws often required amendment, but 
that it was premature to make such an assessment as it would be important to consider all 
the issues, including attitudinal factors. She encouraged an &#8213;open-mindedness&#8214; by all on 
these complex issues.  
</p>
<p>13. At the 3rd meeting, on 11 April, Mr. Thornberry, a member of CERD, gave a 
presentation on &#8213;Xenophobia &#8211; with particular reference to the International Conventional 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&#8214; noting that the views expressed 
</p>
<p>in his brief analytical paper were personal and not those of the Committee.  
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Thornberry noted that ICERD does not include the term xenophobia but 
nevertheless the terms &#8213;xenophobia&#8214; and &#8213;xenophobic&#8214; are used with regularity by the 
</p>
<p>Committee. Mr. Thornberry pointed out that it was possible to discern wider and narrower 
meanings grouped under &#8213;xenophobia&#8214;. The wider meaning would follow that of the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism in 1994 and amount to a generalized 
fear of &#8213;the Other&#8214; the &#8213;heterophobia&#8214; or fear of strangers. The narrower meaning related to 
foreigners, people from countries other than one&#8216;s own. In CERD jargon, the second might 
</p>
<p>be reduced to hatred of the &#8213;non-citizen&#8214; or of &#8213;aliens&#8214;. On the other hand, &#8213;non-
citizenship&#8214;, on the face of it, might seem to be an unlikely target for hatred. Mr. 
Thornberry stated that while in a conceptual sense the wide meaning may be more </p>


<p>compelling and closer to ordinary usage, addressing xenophobia in the narrow sense might 
resonate better with legal definitions in ICERD and the practice of CERD. He also added 
that it might be possible to distinguish xenophobia from ethnocentrism, or other identity-
defending strategies or attitudes. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to ICERD, Mr. Thornberry recalled that xenophobia does not expressly 
figure in its text, which is also the case for the term &#8213;racism&#8214;. The notion of &#8215;hatred&#8216; 
</p>
<p>appeared in the Convention as hate propaganda and ideas based on racial superiority or 
hatred, as did discrimination, incitement, and &#8211; more positively - the promotion of inter-
ethnic toleration to combat hatred. The emphasis in the Convention was on discriminatory 
actions and hate speech. He pointed out that the grounds of discrimination have been 
applied in practice to minorities of many kinds: indigenous peoples, caste groups, descent 
groups including Afro-descendants, non-citizens, as well as those caught in the 
&#8215;intersection&#8216; between ethnic identity and other identities &#8211; notably gender and religion. 
Regarding non-citizens &#8211; targets of xenophobia whether a wide or a narrow definition was 
employed - the provisions of article 1(2) may be recalled whereby the Convention &#8215;shall not 
apply to distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences made by a State party to this 
Convention between citizens and non-citizens.&#8216; In his view, the Committee has not allowed 
the ostensibly restrictive provisions of article 1(2) to deflect its work on the protection of 
non-citizens. The Committee adopted the extensive General Recommendation 30 in 2004 
which provides that 1(2) &quot;must be construed so as to avoid undermining the basic 
prohibition of discrimination&quot;, and &quot;should not be interpreted to detract in any way from the 
rights and freedoms enunciated in particular in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; 
and the Covenants. Further, paragraph 11 of the Recommendation requests that steps be 
taken by States parties &quot;to address xenophobic attitudes and behaviour towards non-
citizens, in particular hate speech and racial violence, and to promote a better understanding 
of the principle of non-discrimination in respect of non-citizens.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>16. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Thornberry noted that while xenophobia was not 
referred to in the text of ICERD, this has not prevented CERD from addressing it by name. 
CERD had also addressed other phobias such as Islamophobia. He said that xenophobia 
may figure as an element underlying racial discrimination and may lead to it and pointed 
out that general anti-foreigner sentiments may not attract an obligation under ICERD.  
</p>
<p>17. He pointed out that the Committee&#8216;s practice recognised a wide view of xenophobia 
implicating a range of groups, though the paradigm case of non-citizens &#8211; or, de minimis, 
persons of foreign origin or &#8215;&#8213;visible minorities&#8214; - appeared to attract the most frequent 
references. The Convention was primarily concerned with manifestations of hatred and not 
simply emotions and sentiments. &#8213;Xenophobia&#8214; might be too general to target a particular 
race, colour, etc.; if it did not, it would not be caught by the Convention.  
</p>
<p>18. Mr Thornberry informed the participants that the CERD would have a thematic 
discussion on racist hate speech at its August 2012 session which would consider article 4, 
but also the elements in ICERD as a whole that were capable of addressing xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>19. The European Union also highlighted the dilemma between adopting a wide versus a 
narrow definition of xenophobia and pointed out the need to make a clear distinction 
between feelings of fear or rejection versus speech and expression, and welcomed the 
August CERD discussion. The delegate asked whether acts of xenophobia could be 
reprimanded on other grounds of discrimination and about the occurrence and references to 
xenophobic &#8213;hate&#8214; speech and acts in State reports submitted to the CERD.  
</p>
<p>20. Brazil also referred to the notion of broad versus narrow definition of xenophobia 
and asked Mr. Thornberry whether an international definition of xenophobia was necessary, 
asking if so, what would be the benefit to victims. </p>


<p>21. Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, commented that the presentation did not 
offer any new analysis concerning the definition of xenophobia and hoped that the approach 
would have been more audacious so as to discern the meaning of xenophobia. The added 
value would be found in a legal definition or approach concerning access to justice for 
victims and remedies, and impunity. He suggested a discussion on the alleged authors and 
perpetrators of xenophobia, the trends, incidents and regions affected. He noted that 
autonomy and legal status for xenophobia were required. 
</p>
<p>22. Liechtenstein stated that Mr. Thornberry&#8216;s analysis illustrated that a lack of 
definition did not hinder the Committee in carrying out its role as the monitoring body for 
the implementation of the ICERD. Austria agreed that the lack of definition was not always 
a problem, in that minority rights had not been defined in the Declaration on the rights 
belonging to persons of minorities either. He noted that it was not always a question of laws 
and regulations and that it was necessary to look at societal aspects too. 
</p>
<p>23. Mr. Thornberry stated that a proliferation of definitions was not necessarily a 
desirable outcome and that the question for the Committee was whether it was missing 
something in not having a definition. The CERD resolutely insisted that legislation 
countering hate speech be enacted and maintained that racial discrimination was ubiquitous, 
despite some States claiming no domestic racial discrimination at all. 
</p>
<p>24. South Africa queried what happened when States excluded non-nationals from a full 
spectrum of rights, and asked what protection was available for non-citizens where States 
had made a reservation under article 4.  
</p>
<p>25. The delegate of France spoke about multiple discrimination and the intersection of 
motives for discrimination, asking Mr. Thornberry to provide additional details. The 
delegate of the United States of America asked whether CERD had a list of best 
practices/standards or indices to be applied by States Parties. 
</p>
<p>26. The delegate of Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, emphasized the lack of 
legal definition deprived individuals of their rights and access to justice. He noted that there 
were optional protocols to ICCPR on capital punishment and to CRC on the sale of children 
and prostitution which allowed for greater definition in order to protect victims. The 
African Group was only partially satisfied in that there would be a thematic discussion on 
racist speech and a likely general recommendation on the issue, but he underscored that 
general recommendations were not legally binding.  
</p>
<p>27. Mr. Thornberry said that the Committee&#8216;s main concern was the applicability of the 
ICERD at the national level, including the coverage of the national law and how this 
affected the proper implementation of the Convention. He replied that the Committee did 
not compile an archive of good practices as such, rather it tried to reflect its general 
comments in the recommendations to States. He added that CERD would like to be more 
systematic in its follow-up and that in a future paper it might try to note a few areas in 
which CERD had expressed particular satisfaction. He noted that CERD was becoming 
more attentive to intersectionality in its work. 
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Thornberry noted that if CERD were to receive the report of the fourth session 
of the Ad Hoc Committee, it might consider the issue of xenophobia and take some of these 
issues on board in case of a general recommendation on racist speech in August. In reply to 
a comment from Japan, he stated that it was unlikely that a separate general 
recommendation on xenophobia would be considered by the CERD.  
</p>
<p>29. At its 4th meeting, Mr. Orest Nowosad Chief, Civil and Political Rights Section of 
the Special Procedures Branch at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
gave an overview of the work of special procedures mandate holders in relation to the issue 
of xenophobia. </p>


<p>30. Xenophobia had been addressed from various aspects by several mandate holders 
whether in the framework of their thematic and country visits reports, communications sent 
to Governments or conferences. He referred to the work of Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#894; 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants&#894; the Independent Expert on 
minority issues&#894; the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief&#894; the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the right to education&#894; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism&#894; the 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing&#894; and, the Working Group on arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>31. In this context the mandate-holders have highlighted important concerns with regard 
to the manifestations of xenophobia, in particular on some specific groups of individuals. 
There appeared to be a convergence of views on these issues by the various mandate-
holders. 
</p>
<p>32. Mr. Nowosad concluded by illustrating a few of the key recommendations made by 
mandate holders, including that States, inter alia: firmly condemn any racist or xenophobic 
action or discourse, including by political parties&#894; introduce in their criminal law a 
</p>
<p>provision according to which committing an offence with racist or xenophobic motivations 
or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance allowing for enhanced penalties&#894; collect 
ethnically disaggregated data on racist and xenophobic crimes and improve the quality of 
such data-collection systems&#894; and establish appropriate institutions and adopt legislation to 
punish those who discriminated, incited or perpetrated acts of violence against foreigners or 
members of minorities.  
</p>
<p>33. The overview of the work of special procedures mandates holders in relation to 
xenophobic acts demonstrated that there has yet to be a comprehensive, clear overview of 
that which had arisen in relation to xenophobia and also positive measures taken to combat 
it. 
</p>
<p>34. The European Union remarked that there was no definition of xenophobia in the 
overview of mandate-holders work, and queried why the mandate holders had focussed on 
prevention.  
</p>
<p>35. The delegate of Greece noted that each mandate holder had a different perspective 
and approach and that there appeared to be several overlapping concentric conceptual 
circles with regard to xenophobia including intolerance, hate speech, racism and racial 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>36. Senegal, on behalf of the African Group, noted the variety of mandate-holders 
addressing xenophobia - albeit some of them doing so only tangentially - and queried why 
the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent was not included in the 
overview. With regard to mandate-holders recommendation on legislation addressing 
racist/xenophobic discourse, he questioned how this could be undertaken given that there 
was no definition of xenophobia. He also asked about any evaluation of the work and 
impact of the mandate-holders on issues of xenophobia and follow-up actions. Senegal 
added that it would be worthwhile to undertake an assessment of special procedures and 
treaty bodies with regard to xenophobia and how they might work together.  
</p>
<p>37. Mr Nowosad stated that the mandate-holders appeared to deal with issues of 
xenophobia in reference to violations of individual rights in international law. He noted the 
preventive focus of their work and asked whether norms and standards were sufficient. He 
noted the question on the protective gap and he highlighted the critical role played by 
national institutions in fighting xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>38. The delegate from the United States of America noted that focussing on violations of 
the rights of individuals avoided the difficult issue of proving psychological harm and </p>


<p>motivation. He added that in December 2011 in Washington had been a follow-up meeting 
to Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 and that the issue of training exercises for law 
enforcement officials, including in the context of combating terrorism had been addressed. 
He noted that good law enforcement and good human rights were not mutually exclusive.  
</p>
<p>39. The delegate from Egypt stated that the current legal regime was not sufficient for 
contemporary challenges such as xenophobia. He underlined that the phenomena still 
persisted despite the comprehensive overview regarding mandate-holders actions regarding 
xenophobia highlighted by Mr. Nowosad. He stated that the mandate-holders 
recommendation on national laws implied the need for a protocol or complementary 
international standard. 
</p>
<p>40. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, questioned how a 
mapping exercise by special procedures and mandate-holder would be of assistance if there 
was no definition of xenophobia and why other mandates including especially the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action was not reflected in the presentation.  South Africa 
agreed that information on the work of the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
Descent was relevant for consideration, especially with regard to inter-sectionality of 
people of African descent and xenophobic violence.   
</p>
<p>41. Mr. Nowosad replied that the concentric or overlapping nature of the issues might 
signify that greater follow-up work and coordination amongst mandates was required. He 
agreed that his paper and presentation were not exhaustive with respect to all the mandates 
and that a future version could certainly be made so. He noted that the question of gaps was 
an intergovernmental issue&#894; but that as practitioners the mandates appeared to be doing well 
</p>
<p>with what they had at their disposal.  He agreed that a proper &#8213;mapping&#8214; on all the 
mandate-holders and xenophobia could be brought into one updated document.  
</p>
<p>42. At the 5th meeting, on 12 April, Mr. Duncan Breen, Senior Associate at the non-
governmental organization Human Rights First, gave a presentation entitled &#8213;Combating 
Xenophobic Violence&#8214;. He stated that violence that specifically targets people in whole or 
</p>
<p>part because of their actual or perceived &#8213;foreign-ness&#8214; is commonly referred to as 
xenophobic violence. Although xenophobic violence most commonly targets refugees, 
stateless persons and migrants, it can also target citizens who are seen as being &#8213;foreign&#8214; to 
</p>
<p>the area or are perceived to be from another country.  
</p>
<p>43. Xenophobic violence is one common form of bias-motivated violence, also known 
as a &#8213;hate crime&#8214; that could be difficult to distinguish from, and sometimes overlaps with, 
other forms. For example, some cases of xenophobic violence may also be related to other 
forms of discrimination such as racism, religious intolerance or persecution on the basis of 
sexual orientation or gender identity.  
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Breen highlighted that the causes of xenophobic violence could be complex in 
that they could often be closely related to other social, economic and political challenges 
within a country. For example, xenophobic violence is likely to take place in a context 
where there is a general negative attitude towards foreign nationals, but it should be noted 
that negative attitudes towards foreign nationals do not always result in violence. 
</p>
<p>45. With regard to shortcomings in State responses he noted that xenophobic violence, 
like other forms of bias-motivated violence, tended to be under-reported as very often 
victims were afraid or unwilling to approach police or other government officials for help. 
Lengthy and costly procedures also contributed to under-reporting and as a result, 
perpetrators developed a sense of impunity. Most States had yet to develop monitoring 
mechanisms. Non-governmental organizations and NHRIs could also play an important role 
in data collection.  </p>


<p>46. He noted that although holistic efforts were necessary to address xenophobia more 
broadly, there are a number of specific steps that States can take to tackle xenophobic 
violence. In this regard, Human Rights First has developed the Ten-Point Plan for 
Combating Hate Crimes which includes the following: 1) senior leaders should speak out 
against xenophobic violence and should condemn xenophobic attacks; 2) Governments 
should consider developing domestic laws that either establish offences or provide 
enhanced penalties for xenophobic and other forms of bias-motivated crimes; 3) 
Governments should strengthen police and justice responses to xenophobic violence; 4) 
States should develop effective mechanisms to monitor and report on xenophobic violence; 
and, 5) Government should reach out and build links with communities affected by 
xenophobic violence.  
</p>
<p>47. The delegate of Greece stated that in the additional background paper of Human 
Rights First entitled &#8213;Combating Xenophobic Violence: a Framework for Action&#8214; there 
</p>
<p>appeared to be a &#8213;creeping tendency&#8214; to categorize States as &#8213;xenophobic&#8214; on the basis of 
general comments, individual cases and incidents. It was a worrisome trend to profile 
countries as xenophobic and that there is xenophobic violence there, especially since Mr. 
Breen stated that it was difficult to disentangle xenophobia from other biases. He noted that 
the term &#8213;bias-motivated&#8214; violence was not used at the international level.  
</p>
<p>48. The European Union noted the emphasis on the issue of monitoring mechanisms and 
data collection, emphasizing that a country with the very existence of a monitoring system 
or an improved monitoring system would appear more xenophobic compared to those 
which did not have such a system, making it difficult to assess country situations 
objectively. She asked whether existing laws were sufficient to combat xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>49. Senegal on behalf of the African Group stressed that the framework for action paper 
included references to concepts which are not defined and agreed to at the international 
level, raising controversy. A great number of paragraphs in the document were not linked to 
the issue of xenophobia and that the focus should remain on xenophobia as mandated to the 
Ad Hoc Committee in Human Rights Council decision 3/103.  
</p>
<p>50. In his replies, Mr. Breen explained that the information about countries included in 
Appendix I of the Framework for Action paper provided examples and was not intended to 
be an exhaustive list. With regard to legislation, he noted that it was better to use the 
existing legal standards and focus efforts on implementation&#894; however, he recommended a 
</p>
<p>more holistic approach.  
</p>
<p>51. Ireland stated that it concurred with the comprehensive approach suggested by Mr. 
Breen, adding that police training could positively impact xenophobic violence. He asked 
how such practices could be shared, in particular with regard to police trainings.  
</p>
<p>52. Egypt stated that both the presentation and the framework for action background 
paper were not in accordance with the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee and what had 
been agreed at the third session. He noted that new terms had been included and there was 
no reference to international standards, emphasizing that good practices were not 
substitutes for the lack of legal standards. He pointed out the selectivity and accuracy of 
country examples in Appendix I of the Framework for Action paper. He underlined that the 
statement that Egypt does not have official data collection on several issues, was incorrect. 
He pointed out that there was strong cooperation with the UN Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking, in particular with regard to data collection.  
</p>
<p>53. The delegate from Italy said that the divergence of opinion in the room signified the 
complex nature of xenophobia. With regard to the Framework for Action paper, he urged 
caution with respect to the annex of countries as there was a risk of oversimplifying the 
situation.  It was also very important to include information on responses by political 
leadership which should come at the highest political level. He added that generally, a </p>


<p>xenophobic atmosphere often resulted from sudden changes in the social fabric of 
countries: for example, a country of net emigration suddenly becoming one of significant 
immigration.  
</p>
<p>54. Morocco noted that victims of discrimination and xenophobia felt a lack of justice 
and it was important to provide support to them. He noted the need to singularly condemn 
xenophobia as it was truly an international phenomenon. He underscored the primary roles 
to be played by leaders such as the heads of State and senior public officials and 
personalities. Morocco also informed that in July 2011, a new constitution was adopted by 
referendum, containing provisions protecting human rights and several articles against 
discrimination. The provisions in the constitution hold everyone responsible and any 
Government will be obligated to implement it. He said the Government &#8213;anticipated&#8214; the 
</p>
<p>recommendation about monitoring mechanisms by envisaging such in article 19 of the 
constitution. Moreover article 23 of the constitution forbids incitement to hatred and 
violence, which is a punishable crime.  
</p>
<p>55. Senegal, on behalf the African Group, welcomed the comments of Morocco and the 
information it shared about its new constitution. He also agreed with some of the comments 
of the Italian delegate. He noted difficulty in finding the term xenophobia in Mr. Breen&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>text, which also did not tackle the definitional issue. He reiterated that access to justice was 
linked to the problem of legal definition, and was needed in order for victims to have access 
to reparations.  
</p>
<p>56. The delegate of South Africa noted that the verification of sources of information 
used for the countries in Appendix of the Framework for Action paper underlay many of 
the concerns expressed. She pointed out that sometimes victims and affected communities 
were unsure whom to turn to as they felt that the police had the same sentiments as the 
perpetrators. In this regard, she inquired about the role of civil society and human rights 
defenders.  
</p>
<p>57. The United States of America explained that disaggregated crime data in the United 
States were useful in assessing progress&#894; however, he noted the more open and transparent a 
</p>
<p>country was the more problematic its domestic situation might appear as there would be no 
information from countries that are closed and highly controlled and do not report such 
information. He asked how reporting could be presented in a way to give incentive to 
countries to report.  
</p>
<p>58. The European Union aligned itself with the previous statement of Liechtenstein 
agreeing with the need for a comprehensive approach, including measures for social 
inclusion and for combating intolerance. The focus on xenophobic violence was shared by 
the EU, where it was addressed along with other forms of bias motivated violence. The 
delegate said that multiple forms of discrimination could also be addressed by the holistic 
approach. The EU supported Morocco&#8216;s intervention with regard to the important role 
played by political as well as religious and community leaders.   
</p>
<p>59. The delegate of Switzerland said that Mr. Breen was the only expert to recommend 
the development of legislation and underlined the need to have a coherent approach to all 
types of violence and not to be selective. She asked about suggestions with regard to the 
nature of the legislation that needs to be adopted: with respect to punishment of crimes, 
implications for third parties, and the classification of hate speech. The delegate noted that 
no society was immune to discriminatory messages and discourse concerning foreigners, 
migrants and refugees by political leaders. It was important for society to remain vigilant 
about these &#8213;myths&#8214; created about foreigners and the issues of immigration, employment 
and criminality.  
</p>
<p>60. Pakistan, on behalf of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, pointed out that 
xenophobic violence was a global phenomenon requiring a corresponding international </p>


<p>action, whereas the paper of Human Rights First focused on the national level. It was 
uncertain whether these national measures suffice the magnitude of the phenomenon. He 
supported the role of political and religious leaders, but this should be complementary to 
legal and administrative procedures.  
</p>
<p>61. Egypt appreciated the practical approach&#894; however, if xenophobia encompassed 
several types of crimes it would be unclear adding that that there was no agreed definition 
of a bias-based crime. He said that xenophobia was against a foreign individual and not 
groups and that the minimum agreed definition refers to foreigners.  
</p>
<p>62. Ms. Fanny Dufvenmark and Ms. Christine Aghazarm from IOM made presentations 
at the 6th meeting, on international migration issues, later that day. With respect to 
xenophobia and migrants, Ms. Dufvenmark stated that as a starting point, it was important 
to understand that, although they often overlap, racism and xenophobia are two distinct 
phenomena. There is no international definition of what constitutes xenophobia; however, 
IOM had chosen to use a definition describing the phenomenon as: &#8213;(&#8230;) attitudes, 
prejudices and behaviour that reject, exclude and often vilify persons, based on the 
perception that they are outsiders or foreigners to the community, society or national 
identity.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>63. All forms of discrimination could not be classified as xenophobia, but it was 
apparent that migrants often are directly and indirectly discriminated against because of 
xenophobic attitudes and as a result they may not be able enjoy and exercise their human 
rights. They stated that xenophobic attitudes against migrants were becoming more 
prevalent and all States are affected by this negative trend to varying degrees. Xenophobic 
attitudes were often based on misperceptions about migrants and migration. Dispelling 
several common myths/misunderstandings about migrants and migration is one step in 
combating negative perception and xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>64. International migration law extended over various branches of international law and 
most of migrants&#8216; fundamental rights are protected therein. However, the protection of 
rights for certain groups may require more attention as demonstrated by the implementation 
of additional human rights treaties such as: Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (1979); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989); 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006). The rights provided 
by these instruments apply to migrants regardless of migratory status. The International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families which entered into force in 2003 provided a comprehensive legal framework for 
the protection of human right for migrants. It does not create any new rights for migrants, 
but it ensured that the already existing human rights applied to migrants as well and it 
protected regular and irregular migrants from xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>65. Ms. Aghazarm explained that IOM worked directly with its partners to address the 
challenges posed by xenophobia in four major ways: policy dialogue such as the 
International Dialogue on Migration (IDM), on the ground programmes, media engagement 
and engaging directly with migrants. The activities were based on the premise of fostering 
an informed debate on migration and the challenges of cultural diversity as well as 
enhancing the knowledge base on migration issues more broadly.  
</p>
<p>66. On the ground, IOM had been programming, informing and educating policymakers 
and the wider public about migration and was also facilitating the integration of migrants &#8211; 
both key in combating xenophobia. One good practice example was that through directly 
working within the educational system in countries of destination on toolkits, teacher 
trainer manuals inter religious dialogues, trainings and curriculum materials. IOM also 
directly engaged with the media to promote balanced reporting and analysis on migration to 
combating misperceptions of migrants and xenophobic attitudes. It was also a significant </p>


<p>way to modify the role of migrants in public discussions; giving a voice to migrants to learn 
from their perspective so that they are not just the subject of debate but active participants 
in the debate.  IOM cooperated with UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) on a yearly 
award, Plural +, given to young migrants who produce videos sharing their integration and 
identity experiences as migrants in their host societies.  
</p>
<p>67. Senegal on behalf of the African Group asked for more information on migrant 
contributions to host societies. The delegate noted that the concept and definition of 
xenophobia needed further refining and that the IOM version had no legal weight. He 
agreed that the Migrant Workers Convention should be ratified and questioned the added 
value of the MWC in the context of fighting xenophobia. He asked how IOM was 
coordinating its activities with other international organizations, such as OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>68. Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, agreed with 
Senegal&#8216;s intervention that the IOM definition had no legal effect and queried how it was 
used for practical purposes. He asked about a monitoring mechanism to monitor 
xenophobia and whether IOM had any evidence concerning which part of world the 
situation of migrants was more serious. 
</p>
<p>69. Egypt questioned whether attitude was the crime or problem or whether it was acts 
of xenophobia as noted by previous speakers.  He asked whether through their work 
xenophobia affected the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p>70. Ms. Dufvenmark agreed that the IOM definition was a working definition which 
offered more of a guidance tool in order to understand what was being encountered and 
how it could be separated from discrimination and racism. It was not prescriptive and more 
of a legal definition was required. She agreed with an earlier EU intervention that at issue 
was not only the protection of migrants from State and nationals but between groups of 
migrants as well. She reiterated the human rights based approach and noted the apparent 
effects of xenophobia on migrants in respect of access to services such as housing and 
health care in that it had a limiting effect on migrants even where it was not an open, 
hostile, or direct case of xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>71. Ms. Aghazarm noted the economic and development features of migration and the 
significant remittances transferred to home countries. She indicated that IOM worked with 
HCR, OHCHR, UNAOC and NGOs on the many issues affecting migrants and as to 
measuring impact, she noted that the replication of IOM projects in other contexts 
illustrated their relevance. She stated that there was no global monitoring mechanism on the 
issue of xenophobia and migrants.  
</p>
<p>72. The United States of America welcomed the rights based approach to migrant issues 
taken by the presenters; noted that media and political leadership were absolutely vital 
players; and, that speaking out to counter xenophobia was useful. He asked whether IOM 
found their work hampered by any perceived gaps in the legal framework.  
</p>
<p>73. Ms. Dufvenmark stated that with respect to gaps, it was difficult to attribute the 
problem to a lack of instruments or to a lack of implementation&#894; however, IOM was 
working within the present framework available. With respect to the question from the 
United States of America concerning whether more speech and advertising the benefits of 
migration was preferable to definitions or a code of conduct, she explained that IOM had no 
particular view on this but that it sought a more balanced view of migration. The issues 
should not be about scapegoating migrants but about the economy, health care, housing or 
whatever the real domestic issue or problem might be.    
</p>
<p>74. Mr. Miguel Hilario-Man&#235;nima of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) 
gave a presentation at the 7th meeting of the session on 13 April entitled &#8213;Going beyond 
window dressing &#8211; Xenophobia in Latin America: It&#8216;s time to count the people of colour&#8214;. </p>


<p>He stated that he defined xenophobia as a societal cancer that emanates from the core of the 
individual being (mind and emotions) which was fed in the families, manifested in societal 
relations, cultural views, economic policies and political power relations. He also noted that 
xenophobia concerned conscious and subconscious attitudes and rejection of &#8213;the other&#8214; 
</p>
<p>that perpetuates all types of violence, inequality, exclusion and poverty. He stressed that the 
sociological reality of xenophobia warranted the need to have a mechanism towards 
preventing, protecting and eliminating it from the core, which would take a long 
transformational process.  
</p>
<p>75. With regard to the effects and implications of xenophobia in Latin America, Mr. 
Hilario-Man&#235;nima pointed out that there was a lack of political will to thoroughly count 
indigenous and Afro-descendants in statistics or measurements of social development. 
There was very little disaggregated information on their socio-economic conditions and 
official statistics make them invisible.  
</p>
<p>76. He emphasized that xenophobia affected social, economic issues and policies. Policy 
makers locally, regionally and nationally, in many cases, based on their dislike of the 
&#8213;other&#8214; ignored them in budget allocations, the most vulnerable coincidently&#8212;were 
persons of colour.  It was argued that multicultural and inter-cultural transformation must 
be carried out through the whole educational process. There was also a need for leadership 
development opportunities for indigenous and Afro descendent communities at both 
professional and educational levels. He pointed out that no international or national law 
would eliminate xenophobia since it was ingrained in the being. Change began inside of 
people by unmasking their fears and talking about them, in the families where new values 
and appreciation of the other are instilled, and in communities where collectively people 
embrace and celebrate cultural differences. This process would complement legislation and 
mechanisms established to prevent and protect people from xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>77. The representative of the EU pointed out that there was no reference to the issue of 
nationality in Mr. Hilario-Man&#235;nima&#8216;s presentation and that his approach was based on the 
&#8213;foreignness&#8214; and &#8213;otherness&#8214;. The delegate noted that his emphasis on elements that 
</p>
<p>would promote tolerance, social inclusion, more understanding was consistent with the 
comprehensive approach of the EU. She asked how he viewed the respective role of 
legislation and public policies for the promotion of social inclusion.  
</p>
<p>78. The delegate of Liechtenstein asked if it could be helpful to have specialized 
mechanisms at national and regional levels to initiate the work on education and data 
collection, and whether there was a need to improve the international framework in respect 
of protecting children from xenophobia, for example through the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. 
</p>
<p>79. With regard to Mr. Hilario-Man&#235;nima&#8216;s point that xenophobia spreads like an 
epidemic, the representative of Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, asked how this epidemic 
could be addressed by governments and the civil society. He noted that nationals of their 
own countries were targeted and the psychological targeting resulted in exclusion. The 
delegate asked how the issue of xenophobia was addressed in international law and if there 
were gaps, how they should be addressed.  
</p>
<p>80. In his reply, Mr. Hilario-Man&#235;nima stated that legislation alone would not eliminate 
and curb xenophobia. He noted that having an international framework was the first step to 
bridge the gap; there was a need to strengthen the international law and complement it with 
national mechanisms. Implementation at local, national level and regional level was also 
important. With regard to education and data gathering he pointed out that there was a need 
for legal framework and mechanisms, such as national statistical centres in order to 
understand groups of people and their numbers, in order to design public policies.  </p>


<p>81. With regard to the assessment of gaps at international level, Mr. Hilario-Man&#235;nima 
pointed out the importance of creating incentives for government to eliminate xenophobia 
at national and local levels. He stated that many states in Latin America had remarkable 
anti-discrimination legislation but they were yet to be enforced. Member States should 
collect data on xenophobic incidents at various levels, which would provide information on 
progress made.  
</p>
<p>82. The United States of America commended his point on the importance of 
disaggregated data. He also noted that ICERD contained a very clear definition of racial 
discrimination and it was pointed out that the laws in the Americas region were also very 
clear; however, those laws are not implemented by some States. Moreover, a few 
authorities gathered the data, which was necessary to make changes at the policy level and 
to determine whether the policies had the desired effect or an unintended effect.   
</p>
<p>83. On the question of affirmative action asked by Senegal on behalf of the African 
Group, he noted that different groups of people should have the same educational 
opportunities in order to access the same university and job opportunities. Equal 
educational opportunities and equal access to healthcare services contributed to dignified 
equal competition. He noted that changes also occurred when there was an interest from 
delegates and commitments to talk to the respective government in order to tackle these 
issues collectively.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Expert presentations and initial discussion on the topic of 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Establishment, <b>designation or maintaining of national mechanisms 
with competences to protect against and prevent all forms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance</b>&#8221;<b>   
</b></p>
<p>84. At its 8th meeting, on 13 April, the Ad Hoc Committee heard two presentations on 
the topic of &#8213;Establishment, designation or maintaining of national mechanisms with 
competences to protect against and prevent all forms and manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8214; by Mr. Vladlen Stefanov, Chief of the 
National Institutions Section at OHCHR and Mr. Zanofer Ismalebbe, Human Rights 
Adviser with UNDP Geneva, respectively.  
</p>
<p>85. Mr. Ismalebbe gave a presentation on the process and contents of the published 
UNDP-OHCHR toolkit for collaboration with National Human Rights Institutions which 
was a guidance publication prepared in order to give guidance to UN and UNDP staff 
around the world.  
</p>
<p>86. The European Union noted the very good collaboration between the UNDP and 
OHCHR and asked about the role of national mechanisms and national institutions in 
implementing the ICERD and the DDPA. The delegate asked about human rights strategy 
and diversity and composition in staffing, and with reference to the thematic fact sheets 
asked whether there was one on non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>87. Mr. Ismalebbe noted that the toolkit enabled staff to adapt the sample and tools to 
the local context. The terms of reference in the toolkit were to be used to build capacity and 
help foster staff diversity at the country level through the employment of sample and tools.  
He explained that there was no specific fact sheet on non-discrimination and equality since 
it was deemed a cross-cutting issue during the preparation of the toolkit and was therefore 
integrated throughout the document. </p>


<p>88. Austria also supported this example of collaboration between UN partners and 
inquired about links to the Universal Periodic Review and asked whether there was any 
evaluation of the toolkit and feedback as of yet, as to how it could be improved.  
</p>
<p>89. Mr. Ismalebbe replied that regional trainings were being carried out with UNDP and 
OHCHR staff with an outcome to strengthening support to national human rights 
institutions so that they can more effectively participate in the Universal Periodic Review 
process. He stated that little feedback had been received so far signifying the effectiveness 
of the toolkit. There were on-going discussions to provide trainings to UN staff on the 
toolkit itself.  
</p>
<p>90. On behalf of the African Group, Senegal asked two questions: (i) whether national 
institutions took up cases on their own or whether there was a referral process, and (ii) what 
was the added value and competence of national institutions compared to a traditional 
court. Mr. Ismalebbe explained that the competency of the national institution with respect 
to cases depended on the nature of the initial mandate granted to it. 
</p>
<p>91. Mr. Stefanov gave a presentation on the nature, mandate, and functions of national 
human rights institutions, as governed by the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>92. In response to a competence question asked by Senegal on behalf of the African 
Group, he explained that using a national institution could be more beneficial than a 
domestic court in the sense that to the victim they were likely more accessible, less costly 
and time-consuming. The national institutions process was faster and a remedy could be 
received sooner.  There was often a complementarity and not a contradiction in the 
processes. 
</p>
<p>93. The delegate of the European Union referred to the 2007 CERD study as a starting 
point and asked whether separate entities and mechanisms, different from or within existing 
national human rights institutions were required to cover the issues of non-discrimination. 
There was a question about how national institutions could assist in implementing 
recommendations and how they handled complaints.  
</p>
<p>94. France supported the statement of the European Union and recalled that the DDPA 
specifically mentioned in paragraphs 90 and 91 that all States are called upon to strengthen 
national institutions with regard to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. The delegate also recalled that the CERD in its General Observation 17 spoke 
of national institutions as mechanisms which could assist ICERD implementation. The 
delegate asked whether there were specific guidelines to national institutions of how to 
fight discrimination and establish specialized bodies.  
</p>
<p>95. Mr. Stefanov stated that specialized bodies and national human rights institutions 
were not incompatible and could be very complementary. He added that there was no one 
template and that the decision to have a general or specialized body on discrimination was a 
reflection of the priorities and needs of a country. He explained that national institutions 
have quite great access in international fora and are heard by treaty bodies such as the 
CERD. They could submit reports which could affect the concluding observations. He 
added that complaints handing was an important source of information.  
</p>
<p>96. South Africa questioned the level of effectiveness of national human rights 
institutions especially regarding remedial action to victims. Mr. Stefanov noted that some 
national institutions such as the South African Human Rights Commission were quite 
active in this area.   
</p>
<p>97. The Chairperson-Rapporteur echoed the earlier inquiry of the European Union about 
the global coverage of national institutions, adding that it would be informative to receive a 
listing or matrix of institutions referenced with their accreditation criteria, type and number </p>


<p>of complaints, cases settled remedies, timeframes, and cooperation with UN etc. He stated 
that this idea could be followed up at some point.    
</p>
<p>98. At the 9th meeting, on 16 April, the Secretariat announced that Mr. Michel Forst of 
the French National Consultative Commission had informed that he would not be able to 
attend the meeting as planned, due to unforeseen circumstances. Mr. Patrick Charlier, of the 
Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism gave a presentation in 
which he discussed how to choose a mechanism, the status of mechanisms and the remit of 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>99. National mechanisms are independent bodies to promote human rights established 
by the State. Mechanisms could focus on combating discrimination or have a wider 
mandate. He noted that the outcome of the mechanism rather that its structure should guide 
decision-makers, adding that each country should make its own choice based on domestic 
particularities and local specificities such as language, culture, federal structure, and legal 
tradition. There was an on-going debate between broad thematic mechanisms versus 
specialized mechanisms. The more general structures had mandates to protect, promote and 
monitor. This could be advantageous because that one body had a greater capacity to 
address a broad spectrum of issues and allowed for cross-fertilization with other bodies and 
structures in government. As a reporting body, this national body could also prove more 
effective. There were also budgetary issues and economies of scale. 
</p>
<p>100. Specialized bodies allowed for greater attention to the needs of a specific category or 
group with specific needs, be they migrants, refugees, etc. A specialized mechanism should 
ensure diversity in its membership, reflecting the ethnic, linguistic and cultural facets of the 
country. These types of mechanisms also have a specific expertise and focus and are 
perhaps more inclined to follow the relevant legislation or process such as the ICERD, UPR 
and DDPA. Mr. Charlier noted that the CERD, European Commission against Racism and 
Intolerance (ECRI), Council of Europe and the DDPA specifically call for this type of 
mechanism.  
</p>
<p>101. The status of the mechanism was another consideration. It was advisable that 
mechanisms have so-called &#8213;360 degree&#8214; independence in that they are able to make 
recommendations regarding the rules and regulations of the State. It must also be 
independent from civil society since the mechanism is not a super-NGO either. It was 
imperative that the organ had its own right to speak. It must be accessible physically and in 
terms of lodging complaints and it should also have symbolic and cultural proximity to the 
population. 
</p>
<p>102. A third consideration was the mandate and the body or mechanism. Both groups and 
victims of discrimination as well as phenomena should fall under the mandate of the body. 
He noted that it was very important to publicize the competence and the authority of the 
body or mechanism to all sectors and all areas of activity where the body might act. A 
broad mandate was recommended in that the mechanism should have the capacity to 
protect, promote and monitor. The promotional activities should be taken in the media, 
through public relations and on international days. Its protection mandate should be 
complementary to that of national courts.  The mechanisms should publicly disseminate its 
finding, conclusions, studies etc as well as all its annual activities especially in the form of 
an official annual report. The mechanism can submit amicus curiae briefs, should it wish 
and take part in strategic litigation and class action lawsuits, where possible. A broad 
protection mandate would allow the mechanism to follow the situation of certain groups 
and also receive individual complaints.  
</p>
<p>103. The monitoring function of the mechanism ensured conformity with international 
regulations and obligations&#894; allowed for an assessment of the real state of affairs of 
minorities and groups in the country and their ability to take part in society (opportunities </p>


<p>and chances)&#894; and it also allowed for the production of opinions and recommendations in 
</p>
<p>respect of its own opinions, domestic laws and legalisation and general comments opinions 
and issues.  
</p>
<p>104. The delegate of the European Union stated that it would be very useful to have a 
map of listing of Status A accredited national human rights commissions as well as 
specialized bodies or mechanisms and inquired whether there was a list of specific 
recommendations which allowed for the tackling issues at hand. She asked about a regional 
review of actions undertaken by specialized bodies in respect of racial discrimination and 
asked whether the pursuit of international networking by these mechanisms would be useful 
in order to ensure coverage and exchange best practices.    
</p>
<p>105. Senegal on behalf of the African Group asked about the effectiveness of these bodies 
and whether procedures were in place to ensure that cases were in fact taken up and 
followed through since it was results that counted. He asked about the timeframe for these 
cases and whether there was limitation on timeframes. He also questioned the legal status of 
these institutions and how they maintained their legal integrity and independence from the 
Government and the court system.  
</p>
<p>106. Mr. Charlier replied that it was not a simple task to suggest basic guidelines for all 
countries in the world. Regarding evaluation, this depended to a great extent on to whom 
the body is ultimately accountable. In principle, these bodies should be answerable to 
parliaments and their committees and not a government or executive branch. Thus far, most 
evaluation had been rather informal and the test was the level of credibility of the 
mechanism, in the eyes of the special procedures, the international coordinating committee 
for national institutions, regional bodies and the general population.    
</p>
<p>107. Denmark stated that according to a study by the European Fundamental Human 
Rights Agency, national legislation and procedures to address and combat discrimination 
are not adequately known by members of racial minorities. The delegate how best to ensure 
that information about these mechanisms were disseminated to the whole society including 
to minorities, groups etc.  
</p>
<p>108. The delegate from Cuba agreed that there was no single model to address racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance since these must be based on 
national characteristics, culture and the values of the given country. While generally in 
support of guidelines, it is the country which must select the model most appropriate to its 
national context.  
</p>
<p>109. Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation asked how national 
mechanisms could support victims who may be temporarily in a region and fall victim to 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>110. South Africa inquired about how mechanisms could practically ensure access and 
remedies to victims and asked what happened in a case where the national mechanism is 
found in a State which is not a party to the ICERD or has made reservations to the ICERD 
and does recognize its competency, especially in light of practicalities on the ground. 
</p>
<p>111. The United States of America asked Mr. Charlier if he was aware of an evaluation or 
study on which mechanisms or combination of mechanisms were performing well. In 
reference to the comment about ICERD not covering gaps, the delegate inquired whether he 
had encountered any practical gaps in his work.  
</p>
<p>112. China asked how it was possible to guarantee the impartiality of national 
mechanisms. In addition, from a legal point of view, how could migrants from other 
countries be protected in the host country?  Due to economic regions and discrimination, 
how could mechanisms entirely comprised of the local population be free from the political 
atmosphere in a country and provide protection to foreigners or &#8213;aliens&#8214;?   </p>


<p>113. Mr. Charlier replied that with respect to assessment and appraisal, OHCHR had 
issued a publication on &#8213;assessing the effectiveness of national institutions&#8214;. No single 
mechanism could meet all aspects of the national reality. What was most important was to 
place victims at the centre because this would end discrimination and ensure the proper 
outcomes. With reference to gaps, he explained that he did not have enough information in 
this regard. He stated that it was important to protect the rights of individuals even if that 
State asserted that racism did not exist in the country. 
</p>
<p>114. Morocco asked about mediation and ombudspersons and the extent to which they 
were an alternative to a court process. The delegate also referred to acts of racism and 
related phenomenon and asked to what extent national mechanisms could tackle these 
issues without a specific complaint. Mr. Charlier replied that there were two types of 
ombudspersons &#8211; those that mediated or facilitated the relationship between an individual 
and the State, and those which stressed conciliation and mediation. 
</p>
<p>115. At the 10th meeting that afternoon, Mr. Jozef DeWitte, Chair of the Equinet - the 
European Network of Equality Bodies gave a presentation to the Committee. He described 
the Belgian Centre which was established in 1993, noting that it was one of the last of the 
European equality bodies to be set up. It was established by Parliament which gives its 
mission and mandates but has full independence to fulfil that mandate in collaboration with 
States and civil society. The mandate is broad mandate and looks at issues such as racism, 
religion and belief, equality, age, disability, sexual orientation but not gender which is 
assigned to another body and language for cultural reasons specific to the Belgian context.  
</p>
<p>116. He explained that in Belgium, the anti-discrimination mandate included the fight to 
promote equality. In addition, migration was a phenomenon very relevant there and it was 
important to understand its trends now and in the future. The fundamental rights of 
foreigners were guaranteed in Belgium even where one was not a citizen because they are 
fundamental human rights. He also noted that the fight against trafficking and sexual and 
economic exploitation was very present in all sectors of the economy. 
</p>
<p>117. He noted three main tasks of the Centre: the first concerned assistance with 
individual cases. He noted that about 5185 cases came forward of which 4000 concerned 
discrimination and about 1000 concerned fundamental rights. They focussed on reaching 
settlements as it was quicker and fully respected the rights of the victim. In 2011, 16 legal 
cases were initiated on hate crimes because these are non-negotiable. The second task was a 
proactive role in information-sharing and sensitization and training about how to deal with 
a multicultural society. The third was the forward-looking task of formulating 
recommendations to improve regulations. He explained that the Belgian Centre had B status 
accreditation because its statute was not broad enough and it was perceived to be not 
independent enough from the State.  
</p>
<p>118. Mr. DeWitte then described the European Network of Equality Bodies &#8211; Equinet. 
Following an EU directive, it was established in 2008 as the secretariat to help Equinet 
members fulfil EU directives. It has 37 member mechanisms and they work together in a 
non-hierarchical way to achieve their full potential at the national level. The mandate from 
the EU directive provides that equality bodies should: give independent assistance to 
victims of racism&#894; conduct surveys concerning discrimination&#894; provide independent service&#894; 
prepare and publish reports on discrimination&#894; it forms recommendations on key issues&#894; and 
</p>
<p>it exchanges information between them and with the Fundamental Rights Agency and the 
European Court of Justice. It also carries out awareness raising campaigns and promotes 
good practices. It has a fairly high level of competence on issues concerning race, religion 
and belief, gender, disability and sexual orientation.   
</p>
<p>119. Equinet&#8216;s activities include equality laws, policy formulation, publications and a 
number of trainings. Mr. Dewitte reiterated that standards for equality bodies were not &#8213;one </p>


<p>size fits all&#8214; as the standards, practices and functions have very specific cultural and 
historical context. In response to questions: How fast should we respond? What tools do we 
have? How independent should we be? Each mechanism or body must learn from the 
standards to set their very own.   
</p>
<p>120. Greece asked whether the structure or type of institution impacted on the outcomes. 
The EU asked what in his view worked in terms of standards and referred to the usefulness 
of regional networking. 
</p>
<p>121. Mr. DeWitte replied to questions that there were many different names, structures 
and types of equality bodies and explained that States should take into account what existed 
in the their local context. The Paris Principles gave some indications as to independence 
and the issue of checks and balances. With respect to a question from Senegal about when 
negotiation was feasible or advisable, he identified five elements which must be satisfied: 
(i) the facts must be acknowledged&#894; (ii) the blame or responsibility must be accepted&#894; (iii) 
</p>
<p>an apology must be given&#894; (iv) a future occurrence must be precluded&#894; and, (v) the 
appropriate redress must be given.  
</p>
<p>122. The 11th meeting was opened on 17 April by the Chairperson- Rapporteur who 
offered his apologies and announced that he would not be able to chair that morning&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>session due to pressing commitments. Following his welcome and introduction of Mr. 
Bucio-Mujicia, President of the Mexican National Council for Prevention of Discrimination 
(CONAPRED), he informed that Mr. Yannick Minsier of the Permanent Mission of 
Belgium had kindly agreed to chair the meeting in his absence. Mr. Minsier then invited 
Mr. Bucio-Mujica to make his presentation on national mechanisms against discrimination, 
with particular emphasis on his organization CONAPRED. 
</p>
<p>123. Mr. Bucio-Mujica stated that, established in 2003, CONAPRED was a specialized 
agency pursuant to the federal law on the prevention and elimination of discrimination and 
it was mandated to combat and prevent any distinction or exclusion based on ethnic or 
national origin, sex, age, disability and a wide range of other grounds, and to ensure to 
equal opportunities for people. He noted that there was also a National Commission on 
Human Rights which had been created prior to CONAPRED, which was also an 
autonomous commission. 
</p>
<p>124. He elaborated on CONAPRED&#8216;s eight principal functions:  (1) to design tools and 
prepare studies in order to measure discrimination, understand its characteristics and 
impact; (2) to measure and suggest programmes and activities for the prevention of 
discrimination in public and private institutions; (3) to undertake legal studies at the 
national level to promote the adoption or harmonization of legislation, in accordance with 
international treaties; (4) to disseminate content to prevent discrimination in the media; (5) 
to defend individual cases of discrimination committed by individuals or federal authorities 
(the defence model); (6) to work in coordination with public, federal, local and municipal 
institutions, as well as with social and private individuals and organizations; (7) to 
disseminate the commitments undertaken by the Mexican government at the international 
level and promote compliance with them; and (8) to promote international cooperation in 
the fight against discrimination, including through networks and international coordination 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>125. He then outlined some of the advantages of institutions like CONAPRED including: 
the fact that its coverage of multi-dimensional issues strengthened its capacity to act in 
terms of its broader approach and the interdependence of rights. There was also a better 
capacity to defend individual cases of discrimination and there was more credibility and 
public legitimacy attached to its work. Some disadvantages included the fact that the 
institutions could not impose public sanctions and provide redress, budgetary restrictions, </p>


<p>and CONAPRED&#8216;s very broad mandate and geographic coverage which involved a 
</p>
<p>tremendous amount of work.  
</p>
<p>126. Greece asked about the methodology employed to decide which vulnerable groups 
would be involved in the CONAPRED survey/study. The delegate of the European Union 
inquired about how complementarity between the CONAPRED and the National 
Commission on Human Rights was ensured. She was also interested in more details 
concerning the individual cases and the &#8213;defence model.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>127. Ukraine asked about best practices and interesting examples of legislation and 
policies with regard to preventing discrimination and also requested further details about 
the &#8213;defence model&#8214; and its efficiency. 
</p>
<p>128. Mr. Bucio-Mujica replied that population groups were included in the study based 
on a previous study commissioned in 2002 with regard to discrimination in Mexico 
including women, migrants, disabled, elderly, young boys and girls, domestic workers, 
sexual orientation, religion and others. From 2005 when the CONAPRED&#8216;s study was 
issued to 2011, when the second study of the Council was finalized, the study was referred 
to on a daily basis in the media. In fact, CERD had called for the development of a national 
policy based on this very study.  
</p>
<p>129. He elaborated on the &#8213;defence model&#8214; explaining that anyone anywhere in Mexico 
had access by phone, internet or in person directly at their offices to get advice and initiate 
a formal proceeding. There was a clear mechanism in place: catalogue, inventory of the 
different ways to file complaints of different cases of discrimination&#894; however, greater 
clarity was needed about what constituted discriminatory behaviour. There was a need to be 
clear about discrimination and non-discriminatory practices. In this context it would be 
advantageous to broaden the ICERD definition to include xenophobia. The defence model 
also involved a conciliation procedure, remedies were considered and measures were 
suggested in order to avoid the recurrence of the discriminatory practices. He highlighted 
two cases concerning de facto discrimination in schools in Chiapas region and 
discrimination against female domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>130. Mexico pointed out the need to share information between authorities and to have 
principles and standards. Delegates asked for more information about the mentioned inter-
American network and specialized bodies.  
</p>
<p>131. Austria emphasized that anti-discrimination laws were important but not sufficient 
to promote cultural change noting that awareness-raising might be a more practical way. He 
noted with interest the prizes established for intercultural reporting by journalists since a 
similar award was offered in Austria.  
</p>
<p>132. The United States of America raised a question with regard to the suggested 
broadening of the definition of ICERD in order to include xenophobia. In this regard he 
asked whether a complaint of xenophobia had been brought to CONAPRED and it was 
unable to assist or was constrained due to the fact that there was no ICERD definition. Mr. 
Bucio Mujica emphasized that ICERD is much more limited than the UN Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which had a broader scope, details are greater, yet 
there are much more direct references to rights of people and it contains references to direct 
mechanisms. ICERD had a general definition; it was not detailed, making it difficult to 
prove cases of xenophobia and racism.  
</p>
<p>133. Mr. Bucio-Mujica also pointed out that the majority of rulings on the individual 
cases were not binding therefore requiring acceptance on behalf of the person responsible 
for the act and very often the person did not accept a commission of an act of xenophobia. 
Moreover, in Mexican law there were many distinctions between citizens: being naturalized 
Mexicans or Mexican by birth. According to CONAPRED some of these distinctions were </p>


<p>illegal and xenophobic; therefore, it was suggesting an amendment to the constitution, 
looking at the barriers which might be xenophobic in nature, and having an impact on 
redress for victims. He noted that international instruments have a very direct impact in 
Mexico as they had immediate application and constitutional effect upon ratification. He 
invited delegates to continue this process to consider which additional standards are needed 
to combat discrimination, emphasizing that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee was 
essential for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>134. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the 12th meeting of the session that afternoon, 
and invited Mr. Andre Castella, Director of the Office for the Integration of Foreigners of 
the Canton of Geneva to address participants. Mr. Castella commenced by stating that 
racism was not an opinion but an offence which was unacceptable and reprehensible under 
Swiss law.  
</p>
<p>135. In 2010 the Federal Office for Migration created a new mandate in that as of 2014, 
all 26 cantons would be required to demonstrate what activities they were undertaking at 
the local level to combat discrimination. He explained that in terms of legislation, Article 8 
of the Swiss Constitution prohibits discrimination and that Article 261 of the Penal Code 
prohibits racism.  
</p>
<p>136. He underlined the federal nature of Switzerland noting that anti-discrimination 
policy and action followed a local model specific to the Canton of Geneva. He generally 
highlighted the situation of discrimination in Switzerland following the examination by 
international mechanisms such as CERD and European Commission against Racism and 
Intolerance (ECRI), the United Nations Special Rapporteur against all forms of racism and 
the Council of Europe. They generally concluded that there were acts of racism, anti-
Semitism and discrimination in Switzerland and that it was necessary to take actions 
(preventative, penal etc.) to address them. In response, the Canton had taken three principal 
actions: (i) creation of an advice centre to aid victims of racism (orientation, assistance and 
defence assistance to help people lodge complaints and navigate the court process, if 
necessary); (ii) awareness-raising of the population (campaigns, debates, exhibitions and 
education); and, (iii) training of public officials, cantonal authorities and administrators in 
order to ensure universal access to public services (education, medical assistance and 
education). 
</p>
<p>137. In the Canton of Geneva, the advice centre was an independent government body 
established to &#8213;hear, help and accompany victims of racism&#8214; and was staffed by a lawyer 
and social assistant. It was a neutral body dealing with all forms of discrimination brought 
to its attention. Mr. Castella highlighted the inaugural &#8213;Week of actions against racism&#8214; 
which for the first time issued a simultaneous media publicity campaign in all francophone 
and italophone cantons. Sensitizing the population was fundamental to educating different 
cultures and religions about each other. He noted that it was reassuring that Geneva Canton 
had rejected the federal initiative some years ago on banning minarets (which was 
ultimately successful) and that their efforts were now focussed on education of school 
children and training of law enforcement officials and police. In the future his Office hoped 
to considerably increase its efforts because discrimination and racism were scourges and it 
was the fundamental role of government to combat it. 
</p>
<p>138. Senegal on behalf of the African Group, in reference to Article 261 of the Penal 
Code of Switzerland, asked how xenophobia was tackled in the Canton of Geneva. He also 
inquired about a recent initiative whereby people of North African descent were offered 
four thousand francs to voluntarily repatriate.  
</p>
<p>139. On behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Pakistan agreed that racism 
was a scourge and welcomed Mr. Castella&#8216;s ongoing efforts in this regard. He asked how in 
the future efforts will be better coordinated to defeat federal initiatives such as that banning </p>


<p>minarets? He asked Mr. Castella how &#8213;foreigners&#8214; and &#8213;integration&#8214; were defined by the 
Office for Integration of Foreigners. He inquired about the conceptual challenges to 
fighting racism.  
</p>
<p>140. The United States of America in reference to the observatory, asked whether it could 
be determined if policy measures were having an effect or not.  
</p>
<p>141. Mr. Castella replied that in Geneva there was evidence of tensions including anti-
border xenophobia directed at <i>frontaliers,</i> representing the rejection of &#8213;the other&#8214;. He 
noted that racism had many forms and that a proper evaluation of current actions against it 
would be measurable only in the future. Regarding the voluntary repatriation, he explained 
that it was a pragmatic Council of State solution featuring a &#8213;readmission agreement&#8214; for 
those North Africans without nationality and where there was no agreement with the 
country of return. He stated that Government must tirelessly combat racism and that it even 
had a duty to enter political processes and confront racist parties. In the past it had been too 
reticent, but in his opinion, the issues must be addressed head on.     
</p>
<p>142. Germany asked about what experience or advice could be offered regarding 
improving accessibility to public services and also how to reach groups which may have 
challenges in accessing traditional media. The European Union queried which awareness-
raising projects were most successful and why. Noting that, as Mr. Castella stated, Geneva 
was comprised of about 40% foreigners, how could they be engaged in consultation and 
awareness-raising? 
</p>
<p>143. Mr. Castella answered that Article 261 of the Penal Code was rarely invoked since 
victims did not often receive satisfaction under it. The burden of proof made victims and 
claimants hesitant. He reiterated that it was too early to comment on effectiveness, however 
there were long term plans to replicate, expand programmes to other audiences and sectors. 
He agreed that it was necessary to involve foreigners living long-term in Geneva in 
initiatives against racism.   
</p>
<p>144. Indonesia remarked upon the historical openness of the city and Canton of Geneva 
as the seat of international organizations and businesses. While some efforts were 
appreciated, there was a higher expectation of a more integrated and coordinated approach 
to combating racism.   
</p>
<p>145. The representative of the NGO Citizens of the World commented on the 
observatory, highlighted specific cases of discrimination in the Canton and outlined a 
number of issues and situations regarding foreigners in Switzerland. She asked what Mr. 
Castella&#8216;s office could do about family reunification. 
</p>
<p>146. Mr. Castella agreed that recent disturbing media campaigns were unworthy of 
Geneva&#8216;s historical reputation for openness and a threat to that very openness. He noted 
</p>
<p>that there were different histories of cantons in Switzerland and that there was much more 
to do to combat racism throughout the country. He took good note of the issues and 
comments raised by the NGO.  
</p>
<p>147. The United States of America shared an overview of interventions taken following 9 
September 2001 to deal with &#8213;discriminatory backlash&#8214; at the national level, noting the 
success of these measures and mechanisms. </p>
