</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited Angola from 17 to 27 September 2007 
at the invitation of the Government. The Working Group travelled to Luanda, Cabinda 
(Cabinda Province) and Dundo (Lunda Norte Province), where it held meetings with 
Government authorities, civil society representatives, the diplomatic community and 
representatives of United Nations agencies. It visited nine detention facilities, including prisons, 
police stations, the holding cells of the Directorate of National and of Provincial Criminal 
Investigation, as well as two transit centres for immigrants. The Working Group could not visit 
the military prison in Cabinda Province and Viana Immigration Detention Centre near Luanda, 
since the Military Commander and the Director had not received the required authorization by 
the Ministry of Defence and of the Interior. The Working Group conducted private interviews 
with around 400 detainees. 
</p>
<p> The present report describes the institutional and legal framework in the context of 
deprivation of liberty and human rights against the background of Angola&#8217;s colonial history and 
of 27 years of civil war since independence in 1975. To a certain extent, this history explains the 
shortcomings observed by the Working Group. The institutions governing deprivation of liberty 
are dominated by the Ministry of the Interior, under whose authority the National Police, the 
Gendarmerie, the National Directorate of Prison Services and the Service for Migration and 
Foreigners operate. 
</p>
<p> Although the legacy of civil war is still visible and poses tremendous challenges to the 
country, the Government has embarked on a process of comprehensive judicial reform, which is 
partly implemented with the assistance of United Nations agencies and has already produced 
positive results. The Working Group would like to welcome the efforts undertaken by the 
Government and its commitment to cooperation with international human rights mechanisms, as 
also evidenced by its invitation to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p> The legal reforms are accompanied by institutional changes. A National Human Rights 
Institution, the Office of the Ombudsman, an internal Police Oversight Service and also 
Provincial Human Rights Committees, albeit not yet fully operational, have been established. 
The Government is also making considerable efforts to increase the number of prosecutors and 
of the current 14 municipal courts in the country&#8217;s 165 municipalities to 48. In order to check the 
legality and duration of detention, the Attorney General has decided to place State Attorneys in 
every prison. An increasing number of law students obtain their degree each year and civil 
society organizations are allowed to visit police detention facilities. New prisons have been built 
or are currently under construction. 
</p>
<p> Despite all efforts undertaken by the Government, the Working Group notes the necessity 
of further legal and institutional reform in Angola to ensure that an effective system of 
administration of justice is put in place. The Working Group is concerned about the weak role 
judges play in the current system, which is dominated by the Ministry of the Interior and the 
prosecution. Judges are not involved in verifying the lawfulness of detention during the criminal 
investigation. The decision to legalize detention after arrest is taken by a magistrate of public 
prosecution, whose orders can only be quashed by the Attorney General. In addition, the 
habeas corpus procedure before the Supreme Court entrenched in the Constitution is 
cumbersome and ineffective. The Working Group concludes in the present report that there is no </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>genuine right to challenge detention orders which would satisfy the requirements of article 9 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. During its visit, however, the Working 
Group received encouraging indications from the Government that it is considering broadening 
the role of judges and bringing the situation into conformity with article 9 of the Covenant. 
 The Working Group further expresses concerns that the rule according to which a person 
arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence must be presented before the magistrate of 
public prosecution generally on the same day, in any event no later than five days after the arrest, 
is virtually never adhered to. In spite of the legal requirement that the first interrogation be 
conducted by a public prosecutor, it is a common phenomenon that police investigators are the 
first to interrogate the suspect. Pretrial detainees often remain in detention after the expiration of 
the authorized time limit. 
</p>
<p> The police operate in an environment where no defence counsel is available to most 
detainees, which also has a negative impact on the quality of the work done by prosecutors, who 
in practice often tend to ex post facto legalize police misconduct such as unlawful interrogation 
and incriminations based on confessions taken only by a police investigator. In this context, and 
because of the shortage of lawyers, the right to access to a lawyer and a corresponding legal aid 
system as guaranteed by the Constitution exists only in theory. 
</p>
<p> In the prevailing criminal appeal procedure, convicts who were in pretrial detention are 
dissuaded from appealing since they are obliged to remain in detention even if they have 
received a suspended sentence of imprisonment or fully served a prison term pending the appeal. 
Even if acquitted by the court of first instance, the accused have to remain in preventive 
detention in the event of an appeal by the prosecution. No public hearing is conducted in 
criminal appeals before the Supreme Court. Only the prosecutor, but not the accused, his defence 
lawyer or the victim of the crime is present. The Working Group considers this situation amounts 
to an infringement of the principle of equality of arms. In view of long-running trials, insufficient 
legal control exercised by prosecutors and an overly powerful police force, which also adds to 
the prevailing situation of overcrowded prisons, the Working Group concludes that, despite the 
efforts undertaken by the Government, no effective system is in place which can prevent 
arbitrary detention from occurring. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group is particularly concerned about the situation of minors in conflict with 
the law in the country. Although not criminally liable, minors below the age of 16 could be sent 
to prison at the instigation of judges and the prosecution. In case of doubt, the ultimate burden of 
proof regarding their age lies with the minors. With the exception of a maximum sentence of 
imprisonment, there is no special juvenile justice system applicable to minors between the age 
of 16 to 18 or 18 to 21 years. They are detained together with adults irrespective of their age and 
face the same harsh conditions in detention, making them susceptible to sexual abuses as was 
reported to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p> The deficient institutional and legal framework also entails a lack of complaint procedures 
to obtain an effective remedy. The continuation of detention after finishing the term of 
imprisonment is a pressing problem. The Working Group is specifically concerned by credible 
allegations received and its own observations made about torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
to extract confessions during the crucial early stage of the proceedings. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> Although the military does not enjoy any jurisdiction to arrest, detain, prosecute or 
sentence civilians, the Working Group has received credible information that civilians are at 
times detained incommunicado at military institutions and are not produced before a judge. 
Military court rulings are not subject to the control of the civilian Supreme Court and no 
mechanism has been established to resolve conflicts of competence between civil and military 
courts. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Working Group further expresses its concern that the new 
Immigration Act makes detention mandatory prior to expulsion for a significant part of illegal 
immigrants. 
</p>
<p> Conditions of detention, affecting the right to a proper defence, are alarming in the holding 
cells of the Directorate of National Criminal Investigation and at Cacuaco Prison in Luanda as 
well as in the Provincial Prison in Condueji in the Province of Lunda Norte, all of which the 
Working Group has visited. Prison riots occurred in the latter in September and October 2007, 
respectively. The Working Group deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained, and 
welcomes the fact that measures were taken promptly by the Government to address the situation 
and to prevent it from occurring in the future. A Commission of Inquiry was established 
immediately after the riots and rapidly presented its findings and recommendations. The 
Working Group expresses its hope that the recommendations will be implemented and that the 
remedies for the concerned will be effective. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of its findings and in order to help prevent arbitrary detention from occurring, 
the Working Group makes a number of recommendations to the Government in the field of 
inspection and control of prisons and other detention facilities, with respect to the situation of 
minors in detention, regarding the legal framework governing pretrial detention and the 
inefficient habeas corpus procedure, with respect to the establishment of guidelines and criteria 
concerning the eligibility of non-judicial public authorities to sit on the bench of criminal courts, 
as to the prison administration and the preferable subjection of military court decisions to the 
civil Supreme Court with respect to the exercise of military jurisdiction. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was assumed by the 
Human Rights Council by its decision 1/102 and extended for three years by resolution 6/4 
of 28 September 2007, visited Angola from 17 to 27 September 2007 at the invitation of the 
Government. The Working Group&#8217;s delegation was headed by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group, Ms. Le&#239;la Zerrougui (Algeria), and composed of its member, 
Mr. Seyed Mohammad Hashemi (Islamic Republic of Iran), members of the Working Group&#8217;s 
secretariat and the country desk officer for Angola from the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in Geneva, and two interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. During its visit, the Working Group enjoyed the cooperation of the Government to which it 
would like to express its gratitude. It would also like to express its thanks to the United Nations 
Human Rights Office in Angola for facilitating the visit of the Working Group. Finally, it wishes 
to thank the civil society representatives for their assistance to the Working Group&#8217;s visit and 
fact-finding efforts. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Working Group visited the capital, Luanda, and the cities of Cabinda 
(Cabinda Province) and Dundo (Lunda Norte Province). As is standard practice, the Working 
Group also visited various detention facilities where persons are deprived of their liberty, 
including Viana Prison, Cacuaco Central Prison, and the holding cells of the Directorate of 
National Criminal Investigation (DNIC) in Luanda. In Cabinda, the Working Group visited the 
holding cells of the Directorate of Provincial Criminal Investigation (DPIC) and of a police 
station, the transit centre for immigrants run by the Service for Migration and Foreigners (SME), 
and Cadeia Provincial Prison in Yabi and the Central Prison in Cabinda. In Dundo, it visited the 
Provincial Prison at Condueji, the detention centre of DPIC, and a transit centre for immigrants. 
The Working Group conducted private interviews with around 400 detainees. 
</p>
<p>4. During its mission, the Working Group held meetings with the following authorities in 
Luanda: the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Vice-Minister of the Interior, the 
Vice-Minister of Justice, the Attorney General, the President of the Supreme Court, the Angolan 
Ombudsman, Prison Directors and other representatives of the National Directorate of Prison 
Services, the Provincial Police Commander and the Director of DNIC, and other authorities. In 
the Provinces of Cabinda and Lunda Norte, the Working Group was able to meet with the 
Provincial Governors, the Presidents and judges of the Provincial Courts, Public Prosecutors, the 
Provincial Delegates of the Ministry of the Interior, the Directors of the DPICs, the Directors of 
the SME, and other authorities. In addition, the Working Group met with the Provincial Delegate 
of the Ministry of Justice, the Provincial Military Commander, the Military Prosecutor, the 
Director of the Military Judicial Police and the Director of the Provincial Prison in Cabinda. The 
Working Group further met with the President of the Angolan Bar Association, with 
representatives of the civil society in the three cities, the diplomatic community and 
representatives of United Nations agencies in Luanda. </p>

</p>
<p>5. The Working Group could visit all detention facilities it had requested, with two notable 
exceptions, namely the military prison in Cabinda Province, and Viana Immigration Detention 
Centre, since the Military Commander and the Director had not received the necessary 
authorization to grant access by the Ministry of Defence and of the Interior, respectively. 
</p>
<p>6. Apart from these two incidents, the Working Group was granted access to the other 
detainees it had chosen at random and could conduct private interviews with them. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>7. Angola has found its peace only in 2002 after 27 years of civil war since independence 
from colonial rule in 1975 which was preceded by yet another 14 years of guerrilla war against 
the Portuguese.  
</p>
<p>8. A peace agreement for the Province of Cabinda was reached later on 1 August 2006.  
</p>
<p>9. It is against this background of colonial legacy and civil war that the institutional and legal 
framework, which is still in the process of reform and development, has to be seen in a 
democratic society in transition. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Political system 
</b></p>
<p>10. According to the Preamble of Revision Law 23/92,<b>1</b> amending the Constitutional Law 
of 1991 after the September 1992 elections, the Republic of Angola &#8220;is a democratic State based 
on the rule of law &#8230;.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>11. The President is Head of State and Government (the Council of Ministers), which is 
politically responsible to the President and the National Assembly. Parliament consists of a 
unicameral National Assembly, whose 223 members are elected by universal, equal, direct, 
secret and periodic suffrage, according to a system of proportional representation at the national 
and provincial levels. 
</p>
<p>12. In September 2008, Angola will be holding its first parliamentary elections in 16 years. 
Although dates have not been officially announced yet, there are strong indications that 
presidential elections will follow in 2009. These will only be the second round of elections ever 
to be held in the country following the 1992 elections, after which Angola plunged back into 
civil war. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Constitutional Law of Angola, Law 12/91 of March 1991 (&#8220;the Constitution&#8221;), was 
</p>
<p>revised by Law No. 23/92 of 16 September 1992, which consists of a proviso with 14 articles 
(&#8220;Revision Law 23/92&#8221;). </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>13. Article 125 of the Constitution foresees the existence of the Supreme Court, Provincial 
Courts and Municipal Courts. Parliament has also made use of its constitutional competence to 
establish Military Courts. Articles 134 and 135 of the Constitution regulate the scope of 
competence and the composition of a Constitutional Court, which has not yet been created, so 
that the Supreme Court assumes the powers and functions of a Constitutional Court, in 
accordance with article 6 of Revision Law 23/92. 
</p>
<p>14. The court structure is regulated in more detail by the Law on a Unified Justice System.<b>2</b> 
The Supreme Court enjoys national competence in criminal, civil and administrative matters, in 
habeas corpus procedures as court of first and last instance, and also functions as an electoral 
court. In criminal matters, it functions as an appeal and review court and deals with appeals from 
the Provincial and Municipal Courts. 
</p>
<p>15. Currently, there are 19 Provincial Courts in the 18 Angolan Provinces. They have generic 
competences in all civil, administrative and criminal matters and jurisdiction within the territory 
of each Province. The competence between Provincial and Municipal Courts, both courts of first 
instance in criminal matters, is delimitated according to the gravity of the crime and cost of civil 
cause. 
</p>
<p>16. Out of 165 municipalities, only 14 have a functioning court, with jurisdiction usually 
confined to the boundaries of the municipality. Most of their judges are laypersons. Until the 
establishment of a Municipal Court, Provincial Courts assume their jurisdiction within the 
territory of the respective municipalities, unless it has been provided for by law to transitionally 
extend the jurisdiction of a Municipal Court to other municipalities. 
</p><p>17. According to article 132 of the Constitution, the High Council of the Judicial Bench is the 
highest body supervising and disciplining the judicial bench. The Law on a Unified Justice 
System provides that judges are accountable for their jurisdictional activity at the end of each 
year. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Ministry of the Interior 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Angolan National Police, including the Rapid Intervention Police, the Gendarmerie, 
the National Directorate of Prison Services, as well as the Service for Migration and Foreigners 
(SME), are subject to the authority of the Ministry of the Interior. That means that all civilian 
detention facilities are under the overall supervision of this Ministry.  
</p>
<p>19. The National Police is tasked with prevention and investigation of crimes. Criminal police 
investigators are discharging their duties at the DNIC and the DPICs.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  <i>Lei do Sistema Unificado de Justi&#231;a</i>: Laws 18/88, Law 20/88 of 31 December and 
</p>
<p>Decree 27/90 of 3 September 1990. As at April 2003 there were 0.7 judges per 100,000 persons. 
According to the information received from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the number 
of judges in the whole country is about 200. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>20. Police stations and the DNIC and DPICs have holding cells where arrested persons can be 
detained.  
</p>
<p>21. The constitutional supervision of the Angolan National Directorate of Prison Services was 
conducted by the Ministry of Justice until 1988, when this competence was transferred to the 
Ministry of the Interior for reasons related to the civil war.  
</p>
<p>22. The national legal framework for the penitentiary system has largely been inherited from 
Portuguese colonial times. New penitentiary legislation and regulations, drafted with the 
technical assistance of Spanish experts, are presently under scrutiny of the Legal Office of the 
Ministry of the Interior. The draft laws are inspired by the United Nations Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and aimed at ensuring a higher degree of compliance with 
international obligations.  
</p>
<p>23. According to Government information, the total number of detainees in Angola is 
about 13,000. Detainees on remand and convicted prisoners are held together in prison, as are 
adults and juveniles, men and women.  
</p><p>24. Official prison visits are conducted by the Office of the Attorney General after prior 
announcement to the prison authorities. There have also been prison visits by the President of the 
Supreme Court accompanied by the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>25. Illegal immigrants liable for expulsion can either be detained at police stations pending 
their deportation, transferred to Luanda to Viana Immigration Detention Centre, or are taken for 
a short period of time to an open facility. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Office of the Attorney General and Prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>26. Article 135, paragraph 2, of the Angolan Constitution establishes the Office of the 
Attorney General as an independent State organ. The Attorney General may order investigations 
into police misconduct. His Office is hierarchically structured and comprises 242 prosecutors 
nationwide, 45 of which are provincial prosecutors in the 18 Provinces and the remainder acting 
on municipal levels. Prosecutors, also when performing the functions of magistrates legalizing 
an arrested person&#8217;s pretrial detention, are answerable to the Attorney General and the 
High Council of the Ministry of Justice Bench (rather than the High Council of the Judicial 
Bench as Angola&#8217;s judges are). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>27. Military prosecutors under the Directorate of Military Investigation and military tribunals 
prosecute and try military crimes. The Supreme Military Court was created by Law 5/94 
of 11 February 1994. Before the adoption of a Constitution in 1992, there was a military 
chamber within the Supreme Court composed of military judges and prosecutors which enjoyed 
competence over crimes against the security of the State and military offences committed by 
military personnel. The Angolan Armed Forces also operate detention facilities on military 
compounds.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>28. According to Angolan military laws, particularly the Military Justice Penal Code and the 
Military Penal Code, only military and paramilitary personnel, including the police, can be 
indicted before military courts. Civilians cannot commit military crimes and common law crimes 
committed by military personnel are also exclusively tried in civilian courts. No civilian may be 
detained in military detention facilities; they may be arrested by military personnel if caught in 
the commission of a crime <i>in flagranti</i>, however, have to be handed over to civilian authorities as 
soon as possible and must under no circumstances be detained at military detention facilities. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Ombudsman 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Office of the Ombudsman was established in April 2005 and is currently headed by a 
former Minister of Justice. His functions were previously performed by the Attorney General.  
</p>
<p>30. The Office of the Ombudsman is an independent public body with the purpose of 
defending the rights, freedoms and guarantees of citizens and of ensuring by informal means the 
justice and legality of public administration.  
</p><p>31. The Ombudsman cannot take mandatory decisions. His competences comprise visits to 
prisons and ascertainment of prisoners&#8217; human rights conditions. He submits reports to the 
National Assembly biannually. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legal framework of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  International human rights treaty obligations 
</b></p>
<p>32. Article 15 of the Constitution establishes that Angola respects and applies, inter alia the 
principles of the United Nations Charter. The State&#8217;s commitment to international norms is 
reflected in article 21 of the Constitution. It stipulates: &#8220;1. The fundamental rights provided for in 
the present Law shall not exclude others stemming from the laws and applicable rules of 
international law. 2. Constitutional and legal norms related to fundamental rights shall be 
interpreted and integrated harmoniously with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and other international instruments to which 
Angola is a Party. 3. In the assessment of disputes by Angolan courts, those international 
instruments shall apply even where not invoked by the parties.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>33. Angola has ratified four of the seven principal international human rights instruments,<b>3</b>

<p>and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols. Amongst the 
Conventions not signed and ratified is the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p>34. In its voluntary pledges and commitments submitted to the President of the 
General Assembly when presenting its candidature to the Human Rights Council for the 
term 2007 till 2010, the Angolan Government has, however, pledged to accelerate the 
process of ratifying the three outstanding principal Conventions. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Constitution contains a number of pertinent safeguards in its Bill of Rights. Article 23 
contains a prohibition of torture, while article 36 guarantees that no citizen may be arrested or 
put on trial except in accordance with the law, and that all accused enjoy the right to defence and 
to legal aid and counsel.  
</p>
<p>36. Articles 37 and 38 require that preventive (or pretrial) detention be regulated by law, which 
establishes time limits. Any preventive detainee must be taken before a competent magistrate of 
public prosecution to legalize the detention and be tried within the period provided for by law or 
released.  
</p>
<p>37. Article 39 stipulates that no citizen may be arrested without being informed of the charge 
at the time of arrest. Article 40 guarantees the right to access to family and article 41 the right to 
appeal. To prevent any abuse of power through imprisonment or illegal detention, a writ of 
habeas corpus may be presented to the competent legal court by the person concerned or any 
other citizen in accordance with article 42, paragraph 1. Paragraph 2 of this same article foresees 
the regulation of the right to habeas corpus by law. According to article 43, citizens have the 
right to contest and take legal action against any acts that violate their constitutional or other 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Substantive criminal law  
</b></p>
<p>38. The Angolan Penal Code is currently under consideration by the Council of Ministers. This 
undertaking forms part of the ongoing reform of the judicial sector in Angola, which began 
in 2003. 
</p>
<p>39. According to the present Penal Code, time spent in pretrial detention has to be accounted 
for in the event of a sentence of imprisonment; in case of failure to pay a fine imposed in a 
criminal sentence, the daily rate for such fines is converted into two days&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Criminal procedure 
</b></p>
<p>40. As part of the administration of justice reform, the Government has also launched a 
process leading to the revision of the Angolan Criminal Procedure Code. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>41. Pretrial detention regarding criminal investigations in Angola is regulated by Law 18/A/92 
of 17 July 1992<b>4</b> and the Criminal Procedure Code. Magistrates of public prosecution legalize 
arrests and detention during the criminal investigation.  
</p>
<p>42. Arrested persons suspected of having committed a crime must be transferred to a prison or 
to the holding cells of DNIC or of the DPICs and presented before the magistrate of public 
prosecution, as a rule, on the same day, in any event no later than five days after the arrest. In 
exceptional circumstances, for example in the event that a magistrate of public prosecution is not 
readily available, the suspect may be held for up to five days before presented before such 
magistrate. The police investigators may conduct the first interrogation of the suspect alone if he 
was caught <i>in flagranti</i> of committing a crime. Otherwise, the first interrogation is only lawful if 
conducted by a prosecutor. The presence of a lawyer is only mandatory if the suspect has 
appointed one.  
</p>
<p>43. For certain types of crime, the ordering of pretrial detention by the magistrate of public 
prosecution and its renewal or extension is mandatory, for suspects of ordinary crimes carrying a 
punishment of imprisonment between one and two years, if they are &#8220;relapsing criminals or 
vagrants or the like&#8221;, in all other cases of more than two years, or always in the event of crimes 
against the security of the State. In all other cases, the magistrate of public prosecution may 
resort to pretrial detention with limited discretion on sufficient grounds. The Working Group has 
been informed that persons involved in a traffic accident are customarily taken into pretrial 
detention. During the period of pretrial detention, the prosecution must finish the investigation 
and indict the accused, if it sees sufficient grounds, failing which the detainee must be released. 
</p>
<p>44.  The period of pretrial detention differs in the respective cases. It may be renewed not more 
than twice. The following table provides information on the applicable periods: 
</p>
<p> Initial period of 
pretrial detention 
</p>
<p>Period of extension 
(possible twice) 
</p>
<p>Maximum period of 
pretrial detention 
</p>
<p>Alternative 1 30 days 45 days 120 days 
Alternative 2 45 days 45 days 135 days 
Alternative 3 90 days 45 days 180 days 
</p>
<p>45. The law does not provide for the involvement of a judge until the commencement of the 
trial. If the time limit set for detention on remand has expired, the prosecutor is obliged to inform 
the Attorney General, the only State organ competent to instruct the release of the person 
concerned, and is obliged to do so accordingly. The defence lawyer of the detainee is able to 
apply to the Attorney General for release. The law also provides that if the National Directorate 
of Prison Services authorities do not honour the release order, they may be subject to disciplinary 
and criminal sanctions under section 291 of the Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>46. Criminal sentences can be appealed by the convict or the prosecutor. The Attorney General 
can instruct the prosecutor to appeal.

</p>
<p>47. All criminal appeals reach the Supreme Court directly, except for appeals to municipal 
court sentences of more than one year of imprisonment or 40,000 Kwanzas, which go to the 
Provincial Courts.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>48. Defence lawyers must file written briefs within eight days after notification of appeal. The 
prosecution, as the rule, is not obliged to file a brief, but to present oral arguments.  
</p>
<p>49. Prisoners are not automatically released by prison authorities once they have finished their 
sentences. A judge has to order the release.  
</p><p>50. Prisoners in Angola are eligible for early release after having served half of their sentence. 
If the penitentiary services consider that an early release on parole is warranted, they submit the 
case to the Prison Commission, which examines all circumstances and provides the competent 
prosecutor with a recommendation. A judge takes the final decision. In practice, there are only 
very few cases of prisoners who are released on parole. According to information received from 
the Ministry of Justice, it is the intention of the Government to improve the situation with the 
adoption of the new Penal Code. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Access to legal counsel and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Legal Aid Act requires the State to appoint a defence counsel ex officio and to bear all 
costs for all accused who have not chosen any or are not able to cover the fees. No one can be 
tried without defence, failing which the verdict is null and void. 
</p>
<p>52. Defence lawyers appointed by the court are obliged to appear in court and conduct the 
defence. Due to the lack of a proper budget, they often receive compensation by the State, which 
has been characterized as symbolic by judges the Working Group met. There is a shortage of 
lawyers throughout the country in general with five lawyers per 100,000 persons, of whom 
about 90 per cent are based in Luanda. In most provinces there are no lawyers at all. With the 
help of civil society, two lawyers have recently started practising in each of the Provinces of 
Cabinda and Lunda Norte. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Juvenile justice 
</b>53. Minors are criminally liable from the age of 16 and can be deprived of their liberty under 
section 69 of the Penal Code. Only in Luanda is there a special juvenile court for minors below 
the age of 16. In the context of the current reform of the Criminal Procedure Code, it was 
proposed to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 14. The Working Group was informed by 
government representatives during its visit that no final decision had been taken on this 
controversial proposal. 
</p>
<p>54. Minors below 16 in conflict with the law are presented by a prosecutor before the President 
of a Provincial Court and interrogated. Since there are no special rehabilitation centres for 
juveniles in Angola, they are usually handed over into the custody of their parents or guardians 
</p>

</p>
<p>after interrogation by the President of the court. When juveniles under this age are suspected of 
having committed a serious crime, they can nevertheless be detained, as was evidenced by 
two examples the Working Group was confronted with. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Detention of foreign citizens 
</b></p>
<p>55. A new Immigration Act came into force on 30 October 2007, replacing the former 
immigration laws dating back to 1994. 
</p>
<p>56. The Immigration Act differentiates between judicial and administrative expulsion. It makes 
the detention of foreign citizens at the Immigration Detention Centre compulsory, if they are 
subject to judicial expulsion, according to a non-exhaustive catalogue of grounds. Certain groups 
of foreigners can only be expelled by judicial decision. 
</p><p>57. Detention prior to administrative expulsion from the country is mandatory, if foreign 
citizens do not have the necessary stay or residence permit for their designated areas of stay. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  POSITIVE ASPECTS 
</b></p>
<p>58. Drawing on its long-standing experience, the Working Group has been able to identify 
three main root causes that could lead to arbitrary detention: the general context of a country 
with its specific problems and achievements, the legislative and institutional framework 
governing deprivation of liberty, and the lack of efficient remedies and impunity. 
</p>
<p>59. The legacy of 27 years of civil war in Angola is still visible, posing tremendous challenges. 
Pressing social needs on all levels of society and the required rebuilding of the infrastructure in 
the country compete with the need to reform the system of administration of justice. However, 
thanks to the natural resources in the country, the Angolan Government has sufficient financial 
means to implement legal and institutional reform, including capacity-building. Development 
goes hand in hand with human rights protection and promotion. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Commencement of judicial reform 
</b>60. The Working Group was informed that the Angolan Government has initiated a process of 
comprehensive justice reform, which shows a commitment to improve the situation concerning 
deprivation of liberty. Such institutional reforms were already envisaged in the amended 
Constitution of 1992. The reforms, however, were put on hold when Angola descended into civil 
war again. 
</p>
<p>61. The situation is different nowadays. The Feijo&#8217; Commission, created in 2003, identified 
short-, medium- and long-term reform goals for the justice sector. In 2005, an intersectorial 
Commission coordinated by the Ministry of Justice has begun implementing the action plan. 
The Working Group welcomes the signing of a memorandum on the Joint Project on Support to 
the Judicial Sector Reform and Modernization in September 2006 between the Government of 
Angola, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations 
Development Programme and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund. Project implementation is 
scheduled to last three years and comprises four components, namely, general support to the 
ongoing reform process, modernization of judicial institutions, support to the National Training </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>Institute for Magistrates, and legislative reform, in particular with a view to the preparation of 
draft laws, including a new Law on the Unified Justice System and on the Office of the 
Prosecution. 
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group considers that the Government&#8217;s current commitment to reform is 
visible as it has already produced results and further reform projects have been put on track. The 
Government&#8217;s commitment is also reflected by its invitation extended to the Working Group and 
other Special Procedures mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council. However, the Working 
Group would like to stress that in order for the ongoing reform to be effective, the legislative 
process must be transparent so that interested circles can participate and the stakeholders 
concerned are involved. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Activities in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>63. Angola was elected on 17 May 2007 to a three-year term on the Human Rights Council. 
Its willingness to cooperate with international mechanisms is also evidenced by the voluntary 
pledges undertaken by the Angolan Government when submitting its candidature for 
membership, including the acceleration of ratification of the Convention against Torture and 
other United Nations Conventions on human rights and its plans to ratify others. Its voluntary 
pledges also envisage the promotion of the rule of law, access to justice and reconciliation and 
the promotion of legislative measures in order to better harmonize the domestic legal order with 
Angola&#8217;s international legal obligations in the field of human rights. The Vice-Minister of 
Foreign Affairs explained during a meeting with the Working Group that the Government would 
like to see Angola become a State which fully respects, promotes and implements human rights 
but that there are still structural obstacles. 
</p>
<p>64. The Government has established a National Human Rights Institution and the Office of the 
Ombudsman. The Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Justice has created Provincial 
Human Rights Committees nationwide. These Committees, coordinated by Provincial Delegates 
of the Ministry of Justice, are entrusted with decentralized responsibility for human rights 
promotion and protection, but are not yet fully operational, as the Working Group has been 
informed. The Working Group would like to encourage the Government to further strengthen 
them. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has a country office in Angola, 
whose technical cooperation programme also includes a contribution to the judicial reform 
process. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Improving the institutional framework of administration of justice 
</b>65. The Government is endeavouring to put 48 functioning municipal courts into place and to 
increase the number of prosecutors throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>66. Institutional reform has also resulted in the creation of the Office of the Ombudsman. 
After his visit, still in his capacity as former Minister of Justice, to Cacuaco Prison in Luanda 
together with the President of the Supreme Court, the former Minister secured the release of 
some 200 prisoners who had been illegally detained. The visit programmes to police stations 
conducted by the Angolan Bar Association and to prisons by the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights (9th Commission) of the National Assembly could also be important means of 
preventing arbitrary detention, if the Government were to strengthen these institutions by </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>providing the necessary structure. Another positive aspect the Working Group would like to 
highlight is the training programmes for the police on respect for human rights and the rule of 
law carried out in cooperation with the United Nations and several civil society organizations 
and the creation of the Police Oversight Service in 2005, which conducts visits to police stations. 
</p>
<p>67. The Government has also taken steps to address the serious shortage of lawyers in Angola 
in general, especially those specializing in criminal law. About 100 to 150 law students at public 
universities and 50 to 80 at private ones obtain their law degrees every year and have been 
nominated to serve as interns in the various institutions. The Working Group encourages the 
Government to continue and step up its efforts. 
</p>
<p>68. In order to verify the legality of detention and its duration, the Attorney General has also 
decided to place a State Attorney in every prison. So far, this decision has only been 
implemented at Viana Prison in Luanda; however, the Working Group was informed by many 
prisoners that they are not aware of the existence and role of this official. In the provinces, State 
Attorneys are still attached to the courts and DPICs. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  New detention centres and improving prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Government has further started to address the sometimes appalling conditions of 
detention. Viana Prison outside Luanda with a capacity of 1,221 detainees and Cadeia Provincial 
Prison in Yabi, Cabinda Province have been built. DNIC in Luanda will receive new premises 
and a new prison in Dundo is currently under construction. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Civil society involvement 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Working Group, finally, notes with appreciation that the Bar Association is organizing 
the provision of legal aid at the DNIC in Luanda. Representatives of non-governmental 
organizations are permitted to visit detention facilities of the police, such as the Association for 
Justice, Peace and Democracy (AJPD) subject to an oral agreement. The organization is, 
however, not authorized to access Cacuaco Prison. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Access to detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Working Group wishes to express its dissatisfaction with regard to the two detention 
facilities forming part of the mission programme (the military prison in Cabinda and Viana 
Immigration Detention Centre), which it was unable to visit because the Military Commander 
and the Director had not received the necessary authorization from the Ministry of Defence and 
of the Interior, respectively. It would like to stress that during the preliminary consultations with 
the Angolan Permanent Mission in Geneva and with a delegation representing almost all the 
authorities involved in administrative and judicial deprivation of liberty, it informed them on the 
Working Group&#8217;s terms of reference, the places it would like to visit and the authorities it wished 
to meet, and handed over a list of detention facilities including military prisons. The Working </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>Group received assurances prior to the mission that it would be granted unrestricted access to all 
places it would like to visit and to all persons it would like to meet. Furthermore, the Working 
Group was accompanied during the entire mission by government officials from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>72. With respect to the visit to Viana Immigration Detention Centre, the Working Group 
would like to highlight that during the meeting with the Vice-Minister of the Interior the day 
before the visit, it received assurances that there would be no obstacles. The Working Group 
could observe through the fence that detainees wanted to talk to the delegation, a request that 
was denied. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Necessity of further legal and institutional reform 
</b></p>
<p>73. Despite all efforts, the present institutional and legal framework governing the aspect of 
deprivation of liberty is still flawed. Strong institutions are necessary for an effective system of 
administration of justice to function. Their competences must be clearly defined, their powers 
delimitated from and balanced against each other and the independence of the judiciary 
guaranteed. A legal framework has to be in place that makes these institutions accessible and 
their functioning transparent. To this end, the State also has to provide appropriate financial 
means. In the Angolan context, these goals are far from having been achieved. Legislation and 
institutions are inherited from colonial times. They are not always in compliance with the 
requirements of international human rights instruments the Republic of Angola has subscribed to 
or even with the Angolan Constitution. 
</p>
<p>74. The current system of criminal justice is dominated by the Ministry of the Interior, which 
has the police, the Gendarmerie, the National Directorate of Prison Services, as well as the 
Service for Migration and Foreigners (SME) under its authority. In this system, where basically 
all powers related to the administration of justice are concentrated in a single Ministry, judges 
play a weak role, since they are not involved in verifying the lawfulness of detention or any other 
measures taken during the criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Strengthening the role of the judiciary in criminal proceedings 
and reforming the habeas corpus procedure 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Working Group stresses that under international human rights law deprivation of 
liberty is subject to certain conditions and, even if initially lawful, becomes arbitrary if its 
legality cannot be contested in court in proceedings affording fundamental due process rights, so 
that persons arbitrarily arrested and detained are able to obtain an effective remedy. The 
experience made by the Working Group shows that this is not the case in Angola. 
</p>
<p>76. The decision to legalize detention after arrest or to extend the period of pretrial detention 
is taken not by a judge but by the magistrate of public prosecution, who is subject to the 
hierarchical order of the High Council of the Ministry of Justice Bench rather than the 
High Council of the Judicial Bench as Angola&#8217;s judges. Pretrial detention is sometimes 
legalized even without the physical appearance of the suspect. The Working Group is 
particularly concerned by the fact that the detention order of the magistrate of public prosecution 
and its extension cannot be challenged in court during the whole investigation phase. Because 
judges are involved at a very late stage of the proceedings when the trial commences, only the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>Attorney General is competent to quash the detention order of the magistrate of public 
prosecution. However, because of his role in the trial, the Attorney General lacks the requisite 
requirements of impartiality as required by article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights to which Angola is a party. Since the prosecution has an interest in keeping the 
accused in custody, decisions to that effect are rarely overturned; moreover, because the 
lawfulness of the detention is not assessed by the court, even the time limit prescribed by law is 
often not respected. The Working Group received encouraging signs from the Vice-Minister of 
Justice during its mission that the Government was discussing during the ongoing reform of the 
justice sector the possibility of having a judge rather than a magistrate of public prosecution 
legalize detention, and supports the Government in its efforts to bring the procedure into 
conformity with article 9 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>77. The habeas corpus procedure before the Supreme Court, which could provide an effective 
remedy for the persons concerned to challenge the legality of their detention, is cumbersome and 
ineffective. As far as is apparent, it has been used only twice since the independence of Angola 
and no decision on the merits was taken. The provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code dealing 
with habeas corpus stem from colonial times and have been subject to contradictory 
interpretation. They do not provide an effective remedy for applicants. The Working Group 
concludes that there is no genuine right to challenge detention orders which would satisfy the 
requirements of article 9 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Adherence to legal rules governing and control of 
authorities conducting criminal investigations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Working Group has received information that the rule according to which a person 
arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence must be presented to a magistrate of public 
prosecution on the same day of the arrest, save for exceptional cases is virtually never adhered 
to. The Working Group also took note of the fact that it is a common practice that police 
investigators are the first to interrogate the suspect in the absence of a prosecutor at variance 
with legal requirements. The majority of municipalities do not even have prosecutors or lawyers, 
as a result of which the police bears sole responsibility for the criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group has observed many instances of excessive pretrial detention beyond 
the time limits provided for by law. Detainees are often remanded for months and sometimes 
years. 
</p>
<p>80. The police have unsatisfactory working conditions. Given the legacy of wartime, some 
officers do not have enough experience in the administration of justice and are not fully aware 
of their present constitutional role in a relatively novel democratic society. The Government 
has identified the problem as is apparent from its voluntary pledges for membership in the 
Human Rights Council, where the training of police officers in human rights is mentioned. 
</p>
<p>81. The police operate in an environment where no defence counsel is available to most 
detainees. This also has a negative impact on the quality of the work of prosecutors, who in 
practice often tend to ex post facto legalize police misconduct such as unlawful interrogation and 
incriminations based on confessions obtained only by a police investigator. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Guaranteeing access to defence counsel and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>82. The right of access to a lawyer and a corresponding legal aid system, as guaranteed by the 
Constitution, exists only in theory. Legal assistance is only available during the trial stage and 
sometimes the accused do not enjoy the benefit of defence counsel at all. Due to a serious 
shortage of qualified defence lawyers, especially in the provinces, tribunals appoint court clerks, 
civil servants and even prison officers or policemen as public defenders. In the view of the 
Working Group, the majority of these persons are not able to act in the interests of the accused. It 
would like to stress that this situation needs to be urgently addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Establishing a functioning court system 
</b></p>
<p>83. Only 14 out of 165 municipalities have municipal courts and there is still a shortage of 
qualified judges in the country. As a consequence, the administration of justice at the provincial 
level is largely carried out by traditional authorities. Their customary jurisdiction is, however, 
limited and they are not competent to order detention, a factor which adds to a large backlog of 
criminal cases. In such circumstances, it is difficult to ensure a fair trial and compliance with the 
prescribed time limits when the defendant is in detention. 
</p>
<p>84. The Working Group has further received reliable information that police officers 
frequently sit on the bench as assessors. This amounts to a serious violation of the right to a fair 
trial. The Working Group understands that the Angolan Constitution requires that criminal trials 
be conducted by three judges and that it is difficult to ensure the presence of a judge in every 
Angolan municipality. The Working Group considers, however, that it would be preferable that 
only one judge conduct the trial if this is the only way to avoid having authorities who obviously 
lack the necessary independence and impartiality (or the necessary qualifications) round out the 
composition of a criminal court. 
</p>
<p>85. In criminal appeals before the Supreme Court, no public hearing is conducted. Only the 
prosecutor, but not the accused, his defence lawyer or the victim of the crime is present. The 
defence counsel has to submit his arguments in a written brief within eight days. While the 
Working Group acknowledges different legal traditions throughout the world and considers that 
article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant does not require several instances in judicial proceedings 
in criminal matters or a second full trial or hearing, it is of the opinion that if a State provides for 
several instances, the convicted person must have effective access to each of them. The principle 
of equality of arms then requires that the accused and his defence counsel must be able to 
participate in the hearing if the law provides for the presence of the prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>86. The Working Group is particularly concerned about a further perceived shortcoming of the 
appeal proceedings. Convicts who were in preventive detention are discouraged to appeal since 
they are obliged to remain in detention pending the appeal decision even if they have received a </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>suspended sentence of imprisonment or fully served their prison term pending the appeal.<b>6</b> The 
accused even have to remain in pretrial detention if they have been acquitted by the court of first 
instance in the event of an appeal by the prosecution. 
</p>
<p>87. Due to the general lack of resources and infrastructure combined with other structural 
problems such as the shortage of trained magistrates as well as other judicial personnel, the 
system is unable to respond to the number of conflicts and violations generated within a society 
affected by years of violence. Long-running trials combined with insufficient legal control by 
prosecutors and an overly powerful police force have a dramatic impact on the overcrowding of 
prisons. The Working Group concludes that, despite the efforts of the Government, there is still 
no effective system in place which can prevent instances of arbitrary detention from occurring. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Minors in detention 
</b></p>
<p>88. Another issue of concern is the situation of minors who are regularly detained together 
with adults at police stations and prisons. The Working Group further received credible 
information that, although not criminally liable, minors below the age of 16 could be subjected to 
the same procedure and end up in jail at the instigation of judges and the prosecution, when they 
are suspected of having committed a serious crime. Such practice amounts to arbitrary detention 
without legal basis according to the categories applicable to the consideration of cases of 
arbitrary detention by the Working Group. It notes that the situation is currently under discussion 
in the Council of Ministers in connection with the reform of the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>89. Public authorities confirmed that errors in the determination of the age of a minor might 
occur since many Angolan citizens have neither an identity document nor a birth certificate. The 
Working Group was informed of one case in which a minor below the age of 16 was taken into 
custody despite producing a birth certificate proving his status as a minor. In case of doubt, 
prosecutors refer cases of minors to a Commission comprised of psychologists and doctors with 
a view to the determination of their age. According to the information received, it would appear 
that the Commission is not independent, since it works for the prosecution, and rarely determines 
the age of the minor to be below 16. If that is the case, the burden of proof lies with the minors 
not with the State. 
</p>
<p>90. Furthermore, the Working Group is concerned that there is no special juvenile justice 
system and not even a special regime applicable to minors from the age of 16 with the 
exception that the maximum sentence of imprisonment is eight years for the 16-18 age bracket 
and 12 years for the 18-21 age bracket. The regime concerning prison term sentence and pretrial 
detention for minors is the same as for adults, and they are kept in the same detention facilities as 
adults, facing the same harsh conditions in detention. Because of their vulnerability, this 
situation leads to worse consequences, which are even aggravated, considering that the Working 
Group met a large number of juveniles under the age of 16 in detention mixed in with adults, 
some of whom reported sexual abuses by fellow inmates. The Working Group has observed that

</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  The Working Group has been informed by credible sources of one case in which the accused 
</p>
<p>had pleaded innocent, but did not appeal his sentence because he would have had to stay in 
prison. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>authorities at times confuse criminal liability and the fact that minors still require special 
treatment in criminal proceedings, including using pretrial detention and sanctions of 
imprisonment as a last resort and the necessity of separating minors from adults in detention 
facilities. The Working Group reminds the Government of Angola that it has undertaken 
obligations by ratifying the Covenant on the Rights of the Child, which defines a juvenile as a 
person under the age of 18 (not 16). 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Prevention of abuses and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>91. Even within this already deficient institutional and legal framework, abuses occur, and 
those who are affected by them have no complaint procedures available to obtain an effective 
remedy. For example, the Working Group has been informed by authorities that the continuation 
of detention after finishing the respective term of imprisonment is a pressing problem in Angola. 
</p>
<p>92. The Working Group is concerned by allegations it received about torture and other forms 
of ill-treatment to extract confessions during the crucial early stage of the proceedings. A number 
of detainees at Cacuaco Prison and also at Viana Prison reported about beatings used as a 
punishment for and a deterrent against filing complaints regarding prison conditions or showed 
visible signs of torture. Some authorities the Working Group confronted with its observances 
categorically denied that ill-treatment was the cause of injuries and offered alternative 
explanations. 
</p>
<p>93. The Working Group considers the information on ill-treatment in detention received from 
various sources, including photos, medical certificates and testimonies, before, during and after 
its visit<b>7</b> to be credible, and is concerned by the denial of any such problems existing in the 
country by some government authorities, including the police. The Working Group expresses its 
further concerns that allegations of ill-treatment are hardly ever investigated and that perpetrators 
largely go unpunished. The police in Luanda was not able to provide statistics on police 
misconduct and the number of investigation procedures initiated and police officers having 
committed acts of ill-treatment or other human rights violations brought to justice. 
94. The Working Group has received allegations of corruption within the administration of 
justice system. It has been informed that the release of persons wrongfully detained and the 
prompt handling of investigation proceedings, particularly in police stations and at the DNIC in 
Luanda, can depend on bribes rather than the observance of legal procedure. Such conduct is 
facilitated by improper detention registries that do not contain all information required for a swift 
and effective control of arrival, transfer or release of inmates, and the occupancy of the detention 
facility. In practice, there is no clear separation among the police, DPIC and DNIC authorities as 
to the powers to arrest, and it was reported that arrests without warrant occur and are not 
reported to the overseeing or legalizing authorities.

</b>  The Working Group heard testimony from victims, family members of victims and was able to 
</p>
<p>verify during its mission allegations submitted by civil society organizations prior to the visit. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  Military jurisdiction 
</b>95. The Working Group is concerned that the Government did not enable it to access military 
detention facilities it asked to visit. Despite the fact that the Angolan armed forces do not enjoy 
any competence to arrest and detain civilians and contrary to assurances received from military 
authorities met during its visit, the Working Group has received credible allegations in Cabinda 
that civilians were detained incommunicado at military institutions and were not produced before 
a judge. Pedro Muela, Domingos Pedro Muela, Jos&#233; Pedro Muela and Pascoal Domingos, were 
detained on 31 August 2007 by the armed forces at military barracks in Cabinda, but had been 
released prior to the arrival of the Working Group&#8217;s delegation to the province, according to the 
information received. The Working Group would like to stress that secret detention puts the 
persons concerned at risk of ill-treatment, disappearance and other serious human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>96. The Working Group was informed by the President of the Supreme Court that a civilian 
has no remedy available if he is wrongfully sent for trial before a military court that retains its 
competence, despite the strict legal prohibition on jurisdiction of military courts over civilian 
matters. Military court rulings are not subject to review by the civil Supreme Court. No 
mechanism or tribunal has been established to resolve conflicts of competence between civil and 
military courts. 
</p>
<p><b>J.  Detention of foreign citizens 
</b></p>
<p>97. The Working Group expresses its concern that the new Immigration Act makes detention 
mandatory for a significant part of illegal immigrants. Although it appears from the Immigration 
Act that the expulsion of foreign citizens must be enforced within 8 days for non-resident 
citizens and within 15 days for residents, which would indicate that the time limit for detention is 
the same, the Working Group observed that illegal immigrants are being detained for much 
longer periods of time, sometimes for months, even years, hence for potentially indefinite 
periods. It has to be recalled that detention of illegal immigrants must be the exception, not the 
rule, and indefinite detention is clearly in violation of applicable international human rights 
instruments governing deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p><b>K.  Prison conditions and prison riots 
</b></p>
<p>98. Prisoners face harsh conditions in prisons and other detention facilities. The Working 
Group considers that such conditions sometimes impair a proper defence of pretrail detainees 
and thus violate the right to fair trial, as entrenched in article 14 of the Covenant. Detainees stay 
in overcrowded cells for most of the day without engaging in activities. Food and water supply is 
a serious problem because prison authorities suffer from budgetary constraints. The conditions in 
the holdings cells of DNIC, at Cacuaco Prison in Luanda and in the Provincial Prison in 
Condueji in the Province of Lunda Norte are alarming. 
</p><p>99. The Provincial Prison in Condueji is an old warehouse which was transformed into a 
prison and is unsuitable for detention. About three times as many detainees have to share 
one overheated cell with 48 sleeping places, and the Working Group observed obvious signs of 
starvation amongst the most vulnerable group of prisoners. One detainee was obviously in need 
of psychiatric treatment, which cannot be provided at the Prison. Still during its stay in Angola, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>the Working Group was informed that on 25 September 2007, detainees at this Prison had staged 
a riot over lack of access to health treatment. Three prisoners initially managed to escape. One 
prisoner was caught and another successfully absconded. Tragically, a third prisoner was shot to 
death by police officers. 
</p>
<p>100. The Working Group was later informed that another prison riot occurred at the Central 
Prison in Luanda (Cacuaco), starting on 1 October 2007. The Ministry of the Interior issued a 
communiqu&#233; on 2 October 2007 alleging that prisoners were trying to escape, two guards were 
taken hostage, one of whom was seriously injured, and that the reaction of prison security forces 
resulted in the death of two inmates and the wounding of five others. 
</p>
<p>101. The inquiry commission set up by the Ministry of the Interior to investigate the riots at 
the Central Prison, made public its results on 27 October 2007. The Commission noted that, 
with 3,356 inmates in a detention facility built around 80 years ago with a capacity of 500 
to 600 detainees, the prison was seriously overcrowded, which could be confirmed by the 
Working Group&#8217;s delegation during its visit. 
</p>
<p>102. According to the findings of the Commission, the riots started spontaneously without 
premeditation. Two inmates died and seven were injured. The report recommends transferring 
part of the inmates to other prisons and the implementation of minor renovations to improve 
accommodation conditions in terms of food, water and medical care. The Commission report 
concluded that the Minister of the Interior will also adopt measures to discipline and eventually 
punish guards who maltreat detainees. 
</p>
<p>103. The Working Group deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries. It welcomes the fact that 
measures were taken promptly by the Government to address the situations and to prevent them 
from occurring in the future, particularly the rapidness with which the Commission was 
established and presented its findings and the indication of the Minister to adopt measures to 
limit abuses in prisons and to punish those officials who are responsible for them. It expresses 
the hope that the recommendations of the Commission will be implemented and the remedies for 
the concerned will be effective. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>On the basis of its findings the Working Group would like to make the following 
conclusions and recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Working Group would like to receive from the Government information on 
the measures taken following the inspection visit of Viana Immigration Detention Centre 
conducted on 27 November 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief. It would also like to receive a comprehensive report by the Government on the 
outcome of the investigation of the Commission of Inquiry and on the implementation of 
the Commission&#8217;s recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Working Group recommends that the Angolan Government take 
immediate measures to prevent instances of arbitrary detention from occurring, which 
would as a side effect also redress the current situation of overcrowded prisons, by 
considering: </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>(i) To take into account more frequently the eligibility of prisoners for 
early release on parole; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) To make provision in order to guarantee that the time limits for 
pretrial detention are observed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) To make use of detention on remand less frequently, for example for 
persons involved in traffic accidents; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) To change the laws, which require convicts having received a 
suspended sentence or accomplished their prison term, or persons 
acquitted by the court of first instance in the event of an appeal 
lodged by the prosecution, to remain in pretrial detention pending the 
outcome of the appeal to the sentence of the court of first instance. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Working Group encourages the Government to increase the frequency of 
inspection and control visits of State organs to prisons and other detention facilities. The 
Government is further invited to consider the possibility of empowering judges to conduct 
regular prison and detention facilities visits. It urges the Government to extend the 
permission of such visits to non-governmental organizations which are active in the field of 
promotion and protection of human rights, if they so wish and for which there have 
already been examples in the past. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Working Group invites the Government to pay particular attention to the 
situation of children in conflict with the law and encourages it to make, as part of its 
reform of the Criminal Procedure Code, provision for the introduction of a special justice 
system for minors and bring its legislation and practice as regards the arrest and detention 
of minors fully into conformity with articles 37, 39 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, to which Angola is a party, and other appropriate international standards: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The practice of holding minors in custody and in prisons together 
with adults should be urgently dealt with and avoided; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) The regime in detention applied to minors should be adapted to suit 
their character and age wherever possible; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Immediate action is required to ensure that minors below the age 
of 16 are not being detained. In case of doubt, the onus of proof 
regarding their age should be shifted to the State. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Working Group further recommends to the Government that it reconsider 
the legal framework relating to pretrial detention in order to ensure that the right to 
challenge the legality of detention is effectively protected by a petition of habeas corpus. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Working Group requests that the Government establish guidelines and 
criteria to prevent non-judicial public authorities, who lack the necessary independence 
and impartiality, from sitting as assessors on the bench of criminal courts or performing 
the tasks of public defenders. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.4 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p><b> (g) The Working Group recommends separating the different agencies which have 
an interest in a criminal investigation from those in charge of supervision of prisons. The 
Working Group recommends that the prison administration be placed under the authority 
of the Ministry of Justice, as was the case prior to 1988. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The Working Group would like the Government to consider establishing a 
mechanism ensuring that military court decisions are subject to the control of the civil 
Supreme Court with respect to the proper exercise of military jurisdiction and other 
possible conflicts of competence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Working Group invites the Government of Angola to consider ratifying the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and its Optional Protocol, as they provide for effective tools to prevent torture 
and other forms of ill-treatment.
