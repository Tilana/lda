<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Armenia was held at the 8th meeting on 22 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Armenia was headed by Ashot Hovakimian, Deputy 
</p>
<p>Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 14th meeting, held on 27 January 2015, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on Armenia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Armenia: El Salvador, Indonesia and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Armenia: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/ARM/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/ARM/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/ARM/3 and A/HRC/WG.6/21/ARM/3/Corr.1).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Azerbaijan, Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Armenia through the troika. The 
</p>
<p>questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation affirmed the support of Armenia for the UPR process and 
</p>
<p>underlined the importance of sharing best practices. He thanked all the Governments that 
</p>
<p>had submitted written questions, which his delegation would address during the review. 
</p>
<p>6. The national report of Armenia outlined the key areas of reform related to human 
</p>
<p>rights and the main challenges and obstacles in their implementation. The recommendations 
</p>
<p>from the first cycle had received the Government&#8217;s close attention. Legislative and practical 
</p>
<p>measures had been adopted to implement them. Armenia had submitted a mid-term report 
</p>
<p>on their implementation and was among the countries that had accepted the highest number 
</p>
<p>of recommendations in the first cycle. It appreciated and stressed the interest of civil society 
</p>
<p>in the process and believed that a stronger human rights system could result only from 
</p>
<p>increased synergies between the State and civil society. Civil society development had 
</p>
<p>commenced from the first days of independence in Armenia and it had been particularly 
</p>
<p>active in the past decade. Many organizations were contributing in specialist fields and 
</p>
<p>carrying out studies. 
</p>
<p>7. He described the main achievements of Armenia since the first UPR, commencing 
</p>
<p>with the 2012&#8211;2016 Strategic Programme for Legal and Judicial Reforms. Its wide-ranging 
</p>
<p>activities related to judicial, penitentiary and criminal legislation; the decriminalization of </p>


<p>some acts and reducing sentences for others; the introduction of a probation system; and 
</p>
<p>reducing trial lengths.  
</p>
<p>8. Having highlighted the 2012 National Strategy on Human Rights Protection, he said 
</p>
<p>that, in 2014, a related plan of action had been approved and a working group had been 
</p>
<p>established to coordinate its implementation. Thematic plans had been approved in many 
</p>
<p>fields. 
</p>
<p>9. The Commission on Constitutional Reforms of Armenia had been formed in 2013 
</p>
<p>and the Council on Women&#8217;s Issues had been reorganized into a national mechanism for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the gender equality policy in 2014. The Law on ensuring equal rights 
</p>
<p>for women and men had been adopted in 2013 and the development of the relevant policy 
</p>
<p>for its monitoring and effective implementation was in process.  
</p>
<p>10. The Office of the Ombudsman in Armenia had been confirmed as having &#8220;A&#8221; status 
</p>
<p>in 2013 and the Government had increased its budget every year, thus guaranteeing the 
</p>
<p>operation of its Rapid Response Service and regional offices. Armenia had signed or 
</p>
<p>ratified a number of international instruments during the review period, including the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) and 
</p>
<p>the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
</p>
<p>Members of Their Families (ICRMW). Ratification of the Rome Statute of the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court (ICC) might be possible when the relevant issues had been addressed in the 
</p>
<p>constitutional reform process. 
</p>
<p>11. The Armenian Ombudsman had been assigned the task of setting up the national 
</p>
<p>preventive mechanism in compliance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT). 
</p>
<p>Since 2012, civil society representatives had been also been involved in the Council for the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Torture, and collaboration with the police had resolved some specific issues. 
</p>
<p>Amendments to the Criminal Code had been submitted for approval to bring national 
</p>
<p>legislation criminalizing torture into conformity with article 1 of the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture. 
</p>
<p>12. The Law on public service had been adopted in 2011. The quality of democracy was 
</p>
<p>predicated on the scale of women&#8217;s civic and political participation and their involvement 
</p>
<p>in decision-making. Article 108.2 of the Electoral Code represented an improvement to 
</p>
<p>gender balance requirements, in particular as it established quotas for women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>participation, unlike previous legislation. A working group had been established, which had 
</p>
<p>studied and offered a comprehensive action plan for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations presented by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe following the 2012 Parliamentary 
</p>
<p>and 2013 Presidential elections. 
</p>
<p>13. Combating corruption was one of the priorities of the Government of Armenia. A 
</p>
<p>number of relevant measures had been taken, including the establishment of the Anti-
</p>
<p>Corruption Strategy and action plan, and cooperation with the Organization for Economic 
</p>
<p>Cooperation and Development and the Council of Europe Group of States against 
</p>
<p>Corruption, which had concluded that Armenia had fulfilled the 19 recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in its 2014 report. State policy also included the active participation of civil 
</p>
<p>society and individuals in anti-corruption programmes. 
</p>
<p>14. The number of children in detention had fallen steadily in recent years. Armenia 
</p>
<p>currently had one of the lowest numbers of detained children in the region. A strategic 
</p>
<p>programme for the protection of the rights of the child for 2013&#8211;2016 and a timetable for 
</p>
<p>the related measures had been approved in December 2012. The measures included drawing 
</p>
<p>up strategies to combat violence against children. </p>


<p>15. The Government of Armenia had paid particular attention to ensuring the freedom, 
</p>
<p>independence and pluralism of the media throughout the legislative reforms that had been 
</p>
<p>conducted since independence, cooperating with regional organizations in the field. The 
</p>
<p>development of the Internet had become one of its strategic priorities, along with legislation 
</p>
<p>aimed at protecting the interests of users of electronic communications services. According 
</p>
<p>to international watchdogs, Armenia was a country with a free Internet. The Criminal Code 
</p>
<p>had been amended in 2010 in order to decriminalize defamation. 
</p>
<p>16. The activities of Armenia to combat trafficking in persons included public 
</p>
<p>awareness campaigns and a new law adopted in 2014. Governmental, non-governmental 
</p>
<p>and international organizations comprised an inter-agency working group on the issue and 
</p>
<p>Armenia was active in the relevant activities of the Council of Europe.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>based violence, including the strategic programme 2011                      &#8210;2015. It also noted that Armenia

</p>
<p>38. Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the establishment of a national human rights

</p>
<p>groups.  
</p>

</p>
<p>added that systemic problems persisted in respect of the right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>43. Armenia responded to questions relating to the justice system. The draft criminal 
</p>
<p>procedure code contained a separate chapter regulating juvenile justice. Recent changes to 
</p>
<p>the legislation included ensuring that the participation of a representative for a minor would 
</p>
<p>be mandatory from the moment of arrest. Further details were provided on the conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention of juveniles and the applicable monitoring mechanisms, which involved both the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Defender and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
</p>
<p>44. The amendments to the Criminal Code of Armenia relating to torture ensured that all 
</p>
<p>public officials who engaged in torture would be charged accordingly, with possible 
</p>
<p>penalties of eight years&#8217; imprisonment and exclusion from public office or the practice of 
</p>
<p>certain activities for up to three years. Armenia also mentioned the specialized Torture 
</p>
<p>Investigation Department within the Special Investigation Service and an order from the 
</p>
<p>Head of the Police on applying the standards of the European Committee for the Prevention 
</p>
<p>of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>45. Armenia referred to the construction and future expansion in 2015 of the Armavir 
</p>
<p>penitentiary in order to improve conditions and solve overcrowding in places of detention. 
</p>
<p>In 2011, a government decision had established a timetable for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>measures to improve medical services in penitentiaries. 
</p>
<p>46. Armenia had amended the Law on &#8220;Alternative Service&#8221; in 2013. The new 
</p>
<p>provisions distinguished between &#8220;alternative military&#8221; and &#8220;alternative civilian&#8221; services, 
</p>
<p>allowing those whose beliefs prevented them from carrying arms to undertake military 
</p>
<p>service without doing so, or not to undertake military service at all. Measures had been 
</p>
<p>taken to remedy the situation for conscientious objectors who had been prosecuted before 
</p>
<p>the entry into force of that law. 
</p>
<p>47. Armenia noted that the draft criminal procedure code contained measures to define 
</p>
<p>detention as an exceptional measure of restraint in addressing excessive periods of pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention. 
</p>
<p>48. Armenia provided details of deaths recorded in the armed forces in 2013 and 2014 
</p>
<p>and stated that the recorded increase could be attributed to more ceasefire violations. 
</p>
<p>However, there had been a reduction in the number of suicides. The Prosecutor General had 
</p>
<p>been taking steps to inform the public about cases and investigations in that area and had 
</p>
<p>organized discussions on the issue. 
</p>
<p>49. In relation to criminal investigations following demonstrations after the 2008 
</p>
<p>Presidential elections, Armenia agreed that, while the investigations might have seemed 
</p>
<p>slow, that was not surprising, given the volume and scale of the cases and the situation. In </p>


<p>2014, the Prosecutor General had instructed that the case of each person who had died in 
</p>
<p>the wake of the demonstrations should constitute a separate criminal case. 
</p>
<p>50. Armenia noted that decisions on extradition could not be made before completion of 
</p>
<p>the procedure for granting refugee status. 
</p>
<p>51. Armenia noted that there had been many cases in which high-ranking officials had 
</p>
<p>been convicted in the courts. It also noted that the acquittal rate had been increasing and, at 
</p>
<p>3.6 per cent in 2014, it was within the normal range for most States. 
</p>
<p>52. The delegation provided more details of the measures that had been taken by the 
</p>
<p>police to prevent torture, including the installation of video cameras in many police 
</p>
<p>stations. Police skills were being enhanced and no allegations of ill-treatment had been 
</p>
<p>received in recent years in relation to custody staff in police detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>53. The police in Armenia had always worked in such a way as to allow people to enjoy 
</p>
<p>their right to peaceful assembly while also ensuring public safety and protecting the rights 
</p>
<p>and freedoms of others. In some cases, the use of force had been necessary, but it had been 
</p>
<p>used in strict compliance with the law. Training had been organized for police officers in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with international organizations on the application of legislation relating to 
</p>
<p>freedom of assembly, and guidelines had been drawn up on the use of force. One of the 
</p>
<p>main reforms in that regard had been the introduction of community policing. 
</p>
<p>54. Switzerland was concerned about violations of the human rights of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, journalists and civil society representatives. It welcomed the adoption of the law 
</p>
<p>on gender equality, in accordance with the recommendation it had made in 2010. 
</p>
<p>55. Tajikistan noted the achievements of the Government of Armenia in terms of human 
</p>
<p>rights protection and welcomed the adoption of the National Strategy for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. It further noted the efforts of Armenia to combat trafficking in human 
</p>
<p>beings. 
</p>
<p>56. Thailand welcomed the new legislation adopted to combat human trafficking and on 
</p>
<p>the employment of persons with disabilities. However, it expressed concern about domestic 
</p>
<p>violence. It encouraged Armenia to invest more to improve its educational system. 
</p>
<p>57. Turkey was concerned about restrictions on freedom of expression on the issue of 
</p>
<p>genocide and considered that the events of 1915 constituted a legitimate subject of debate. 
</p>
<p>It clarified that the allegations of a blockade mentioned in the national report of Armenia 
</p>
<p>were baseless.  
</p>
<p>58. The United Arab Emirates welcomed the recent measures taken to reform the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, which had improved the constitutional human rights mechanisms. It asked 
</p>
<p>Armenia to provide further information about Decree NH-207-N on constitutional reforms. 
</p>
<p>59. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the progress 
</p>
<p>Armenia had made since the last review, and the road map provided by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Strategy and Action Plan. It noted the concerns raised in a report of the Organization for 
</p>
<p>Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on the 2013 Presidential elections. 
</p>
<p>60. The United States of America commended Armenia for the improvement in 
</p>
<p>respecting freedom of expression manifested in the Human Rights Defender&#8217;s 2013 report, 
</p>
<p>but noted that more needed to be done. It was seriously concerned about systemic 
</p>
<p>corruption and the absence of an independent judiciary. 
</p>
<p>61. Uruguay underlined the efforts of Armenia to guarantee equal opportunities and 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination, including steps to increase women&#8217;s representation in the legislative 
</p>
<p>branch, and the adoption of the National Plan for the Protection of the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>2013&#8210;2016. </p>


<p>62. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomed the ratification of ICPPED and 
</p>
<p>CRPD, and the launch of the National Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights in 2012 
</p>
<p>followed by the Plan of Action in 2014. 
</p>
<p>63. While appreciating the support given to the Human Rights Defender and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the National Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights, Albania 
</p>
<p>encouraged Armenia to increase the resources allocated to all its mechanisms for the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>64. Algeria welcomed the adoption of the Human Rights Action Plan and the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of the legal framework in the area of human rights. It encouraged Armenia to 
</p>
<p>pursue the measures taken to promote the enjoyment of education and culture by national 
</p>
<p>minorities. 
</p>
<p>65. Angola commended Armenia for the establishment of the 2012&#8210;2016 Strategic 
</p>
<p>Programme for Legal and Judicial Reforms and welcomed the initiatives undertaken to 
</p>
<p>ensure gender equality, including the drafting of the Gender Policy Strategic Programme 
</p>
<p>and Action Plan. 
</p>
<p>66. Argentina welcomed the ratification of ICPPED and CRPD and noted the progress 
</p>
<p>made under the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Protection of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>However, it noted that discrimination against women and LGBT persons persisted. 
</p>
<p>67. Australia requested a written update on the implementation of the National Strategy 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of Human Rights. It welcomed the progress in implementing the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and the adoption of the law on gender equality. However, 
</p>
<p>Australia remained concerned about gender-based discrimination and the failure to protect 
</p>
<p>lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons. 
</p>
<p>68. Austria remained concerned about the persistence of gender-based discrimination 
</p>
<p>and discrimination against persons with disabilities and LGBT persons. It also expressed 
</p>
<p>concern that effective enjoyment of the right to education was still not guaranteed for all 
</p>
<p>children. 
</p>
<p>69. Azerbaijan rejected the references to &#8220;Nagorno-Karabakh&#8221; in the national report of 
</p>
<p>Armenia, emphasizing that, according to General Assembly resolution 62/243, entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan&#8221;, references to &#8220;Nagorno-Karabakh&#8221; 
</p>
<p>should read as &#8220;the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>70. Armenia stated that the Government condemned all forms of discrimination, and the 
</p>
<p>relevant national legislation included its criminalization. All the national programmes 
</p>
<p>adopted by Armenia in the field of human rights were the basic components of the national 
</p>
<p>anti-discrimination policy, the main goal of which was to ensure the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of relevant national legislation and the incorporation of relevant 
</p>
<p>international obligations in national policies. Armenia had signed or ratified most of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and regional instruments relating to equality. It provided additional details 
</p>
<p>of the plans and strategies relating to non-discrimination and highlighted relevant actions 
</p>
<p>that had been taken, including the submission of its latest periodic report to the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and the inclusion of a plan for the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a separate law on discrimination within the Plan of Action for the National 
</p>
<p>Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>71. Referring to some specific groups, Armenia noted that there were no restrictions on 
</p>
<p>access to public services for sexual minorities. Concerned by the fact that representatives of 
</p>
<p>some women&#8217;s NGOs had been intimidated on social media, the Women&#8217;s Council, which 
</p>
<p>was chaired by the Prime Minister, had advocated an end to such behaviour and urged the 
</p>
<p>law enforcement bodies to be more vigilant in the prevention and punishment of such cases. 
</p>
<p>A number of legal and institutional measures had been taken to strengthen the protection of </p>


<p>members of national minorities since the first UPR and the budget allocated to national 
</p>
<p>minorities had been doubled since 2012. 
</p>
<p>72. Armenia listed some of the measures that had been taken for members of national 
</p>
<p>minorities that lacked their own kin state, including the publishing and provision of free 
</p>
<p>school textbooks in their languages. The incorporation of those minorities was seen as a 
</p>
<p>cultural asset for Armenia. The preservation and development of the culture of national 
</p>
<p>minorities was a priority and all historical and architectural monuments, cultural and 
</p>
<p>religious buildings were under State protection, regardless of their ethnic or religious 
</p>
<p>associations. 
</p>
<p>73. Armenia cooperated closely with the European Commission against Racism and 
</p>
<p>Intolerance. The delegation provided details of the findings of the Commission&#8217;s latest 
</p>
<p>monitoring report. 
</p>
<p>74. A suitable legislative framework had been established to ensure the appropriate 
</p>
<p>conditions for religious diversity. As of 2014, some 66 religious organizations were 
</p>
<p>registered, of which 9 belonged to national minorities. 
</p>
<p>75. Managing migration was one of the priorities of the Government of Armenia. The 
</p>
<p>2014 action plan on migration included activities to harmonize national legislation with 
</p>
<p>international standards. The 2014 amendments to the Criminal Code had made organizing 
</p>
<p>illegal immigration a criminal offence. Under the new anti-trafficking law, victims of 
</p>
<p>human trafficking could be granted a residence permit. 
</p>
<p>76. The asylum system was fully functional and over 16,000 refugees from Syria had 
</p>
<p>arrived in recent years. A new draft law on asylum had recently been developed, with the 
</p>
<p>support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>77. Belarus noted with satisfaction the legislative measures taken by Armenia since the 
</p>
<p>first UPR. In particular, it noted legislation on gender equality<i>. </i>It welcomed the attention 
</p>
<p>given to the most vulnerable groups in the National Strategy for the Protection of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. 
</p>
<p>78. While welcoming the ratification of ICPPED and CRPD, Belgium stated that there 
</p>
<p>was still a lot to do in terms of human rights, including violence against women and 
</p>
<p>children and abuses committed by police forces. 
</p>
<p>79. Benin welcomed the efforts of Armenia towards the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first UPR and its ratification of ICPPED and CRPD. 
</p>
<p>80. Serbia applauded Armenia for the adoption of the National Strategy and Action Plan 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of Human Rights and considered that Armenia had taken decisive steps to 
</p>
<p>combat domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>81. Brazil commended Armenia for implementing its first cycle recommendations. It 
</p>
<p>was concerned about violence against women and urged Armenia to protect LGBTI 
</p>
<p>persons. It underlined the importance of aligning the definition of torture with international 
</p>
<p>standards, ensuring adequate resources for its national prevention mechanism, and 
</p>
<p>promoting awareness-raising on HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>82. Bulgaria appreciated the approval of the Strategic Programme for Legal and Judicial 
</p>
<p>Reforms and the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Protection of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>and welcomed policies and programmes on gender, gender-based violence and children. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged Armenia to identify children in vulnerable situations. 
</p>
<p>83. Canada enquired about the measures undertaken to implement its recommendations 
</p>
<p>from 2010 on freedom of opinion and expression and investigative journalism. It welcomed </p>


<p>the steps taken to address racism and xenophobia and called on Armenia to investigate the 
</p>
<p>recent attacks on political activists in Yerevan and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
</p>
<p>84. The Central African Republic noted the efforts of Armenia to follow up 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first cycle. It noted significant progress in the protection of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, freedom of assembly and equal opportunities for men and women. 
</p>
<p>85. Chad was pleased that Armenia had presented a mid-term report. It noted that 
</p>
<p>Armenia had a legislative and regulative framework in place to guarantee freedom of 
</p>
<p>assembly, judicial reforms, gender equality and equal opportunities for persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. 
</p>
<p>86. Chile thanked Armenia for its national report and welcomed the progress made in 
</p>
<p>fighting corruption and human trafficking. It urged Armenia to make greater efforts to 
</p>
<p>promote compliance with international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>87. Costa Rica noted that Armenia had ratified human rights treaties and welcomed the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Human Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the Strategic Programme for 
</p>
<p>Judicial Reforms and the efforts made towards gender equality. It was concerned by 
</p>
<p>allegations of restrictions on the freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>88. Cuba noted the measures taken to increase gender equality and improve the 
</p>
<p>protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. It also noted progress in the protection 
</p>
<p>of the rights of the child, in education and in health. 
</p>
<p>89. Cyprus commended Armenia for the measures it had taken to promote women&#8217;s and 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights, and the initiatives taken to raise awareness regarding the prevention and 
</p>
<p>punishment of the crime of genocide. 
</p>
<p>90. The Czech Republic welcomed the delegation of Armenia. It appreciated the 
</p>
<p>information provided on the implementation of previous UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Djibouti applauded the progress made in the field of economic and social rights. It 
</p>
<p>appreciated the efforts made to promote and protect the rights of women by setting quotas 
</p>
<p>to increase their representation within the legislature. 
</p>
<p>92. Egypt commended the establishment of a National Commission on constitutional 
</p>
<p>reforms, the National Strategy and Action Plan on the Protection of Human Rights, the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of the judiciary and the enhanced representation of women in parliament. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed the ratification of CRPD and the signature of ICRMW. 
</p>
<p>93. Armenia referred to reforms aimed at regulating and providing stable employment, 
</p>
<p>particularly for those who lacked competitive skills. A five-year strategy had been approved 
</p>
<p>by the Government in 2013 and a new Law on Employment had entered into force in 2014. 
</p>
<p>The new law included quotas for the employment in larger organizations of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, which would apply progressively from 2015. The minimum wage had been 
</p>
<p>increased and would be raised further in 2015. Programmes had been created to support 
</p>
<p>small businesses and women at risk of unemployment. 
</p>
<p>94. Armenia noted the submission to the National Assembly of the draft law on the 
</p>
<p>rights and social inclusion of persons with disabilities. Armenia had ratified CRPD; 
</p>
<p>consideration could be given to accession to the Optional Protocol thereto after reforms had 
</p>
<p>been implemented.  
</p>
<p>95. Violence was punishable in law regardless of the sex of the victim; that applied to 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. The draft law on domestic violence had not been enacted because major 
</p>
<p>reforms were being carried out in the legal system and legislation on domestic violence 
</p>
<p>would be enacted on the basis of those reforms. However, the definition of domestic </p>


<p>violence and provisions for support to victims had been incorporated in the Law on Social 
</p>
<p>Support adopted in December 2014. 
</p>
<p>96. Armenia detailed reforms to child protection, including early prevention measures, 
</p>
<p>which had been developed with the support of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund. 
</p>
<p>Mechanisms to improve adoption procedures were being prepared. Since 2010, the 
</p>
<p>Government had adopted programmes for the creation of social housing for disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>people, including young people who had previously lived in children&#8217;s homes.  
</p>
<p>97. Turning to health issues, Armenia outlined reforms aimed at increasing access to, 
</p>
<p>and increasing the quality of, health services, with an emphasis on prevention and early 
</p>
<p>detection of diseases. Maternal and child health were on target to meet the relevant 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals. Steps had been taken to reduce the risks of corruption and 
</p>
<p>do away with informal payments, including by raising public awareness of the right to free 
</p>
<p>health care and dismissing staff who had demanded such payments. Work had been 
</p>
<p>undertaken to address intolerance towards HIV/AIDS sufferers, including in schools.  
</p>
<p>98. Armenia disagreed with assertions that women were discriminated against in terms 
</p>
<p>of access to health care: more than 30 per cent of the health budget was allocated to 
</p>
<p>programmes supporting mothers and children. Armenia was one of the few countries where 
</p>
<p>15-year-old girls received a comprehensive assessment of their development and 
</p>
<p>reproductive health. 
</p>
<p>99. Armenia detailed the measures the Government had taken to ensure equal access to 
</p>
<p>education, especially for vulnerable groups. In 2014, the National Assembly had adopted 
</p>
<p>the new Law on General Education, under which there would be a move to completely 
</p>
<p>inclusive education by 2022. Inclusive education had been incorporated in 10 per cent of 
</p>
<p>schools. In higher education, the Government would continue to improve access for young 
</p>
<p>people from vulnerable groups. In 2014, the categories of persons eligible to receive 
</p>
<p>stipends had been extended. 
</p>
<p>100. Armenia provided details of the licences issued for digital television broadcasting. 
</p>
<p>Monitoring of the general elections in 2012 and municipal elections in 2013 had shown that 
</p>
<p>opposition parties had received most air-time in practically all transmissions. In relation to 
</p>
<p>the case of A1+ Television, Armenia had fulfilled all of the demands of the European Court 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights and A1+ had returned to broadcast in 2012 in a new form. 
</p>
<p>101. Equatorial Guinea commended Armenia for its voluntary commitments. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed strategies and plans of action to protect and enhance human rights, and 
</p>
<p>mentioned the measures taken for persons with disabilities and to preserve and protect the 
</p>
<p>popular traditions of minorities. 
</p>
<p>102. Estonia welcomed the ratification of CRPD and commended the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>National Strategy and Action Plan for the Protection of Human Rights. It invited Armenia 
</p>
<p>to pay attention to violence against women. It highlighted its development cooperation with 
</p>
<p>Armenia. 
</p>
<p>103. Finland commended Armenia for increasing the budget of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Defender and was pleased to note that the increased budget had resulted in the continued 
</p>
<p>operation of its rapid response service and some of its local offices. 
</p>
<p>104. France welcomed the progress made since the first cycle. It welcomed the adoption 
</p>
<p>of a comprehensive programme for judicial reform for the period 2012&#8210;2016 and enquired 
</p>
<p>about the status of the programme. 
</p>
<p>105. Germany commended Armenia for its progress in some areas, particularly 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons. It noted that the administration of the 2012 Parliamentary and 2013 </p>


<p>Presidential elections had, on the whole, been better than in previous elections, although a 
</p>
<p>number of irregularities had still been observed. 
</p>
<p>106. Greece highlighted progress in different areas, in particular in the promotion of 
</p>
<p>gender equality, the fight against human trafficking and the protection of children. 
</p>
<p>107. Indonesia welcomed the development of the National Strategy and Action Plan for 
</p>
<p>the Protection of Human Rights and the decision to sign ICRMW. 
</p>
<p>108. The Islamic Republic of Iran was convinced that the efforts made to address the 
</p>
<p>scourges of human trafficking and domestic violence would result in better protection of the 
</p>
<p>rights of women and children. It also commended Armenia for the special attention paid to 
</p>
<p>the improvement of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>109. Ireland was pleased that a number of special procedures mandate holders had been 
</p>
<p>invited to Armenia and that the national human rights institution had retained its &#8220;A&#8221; status. 
</p>
<p>It noted that concerns had been expressed at the hindrances to the exercise of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of assembly and expression. 
</p>
<p>110. Italy welcomed the ratification of numerous human rights instruments and the 
</p>
<p>measures taken to promote women&#8217;s rights and gender equality. It encouraged Armenia to 
</p>
<p>ensure that civil society organizations were consulted effectively on reform proposals that 
</p>
<p>might affect their activities. 
</p>
<p>111. Kazakhstan welcomed the ratification of ICPPED and CRPD and noted with 
</p>
<p>satisfaction the progress achieved in the fight against human trafficking and measures taken 
</p>
<p>towards better gender equality.  
</p>
<p>112. Noting the efforts undertaken in the fields of education and the fight against human 
</p>
<p>trafficking, Kuwait called on Armenia to continue its efforts in those areas. It also 
</p>
<p>welcomed the ratification of ICPPED and CRPD. 
</p>
<p>113. China appreciated the efforts of Armenia to combat violence against women and 
</p>
<p>human trafficking, to protect the rights of people with disabilities, to develop education and 
</p>
<p>culture for minorities, to ensure children&#8217;s welfare and to realize the right to education for 
</p>
<p>children with special needs. 
</p>
<p>114. In his closing remarks, the Head of the Delegation of Armenia highlighted the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s priority in protecting the rights of racial, religious, ethnic and national minorities. 
</p>
<p>Most essential was the right to life of those groups, as protected in the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Resolute, timely acknowledgement, 
</p>
<p>absolute rejection and condemnation, assessment and monitoring could prevent genocide. 
</p>
<p>Therefore the issue of the prevention of genocide had specific importance for Armenia. 
</p>
<p>Armenia had initiated resolutions related to the Convention for the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The most recent, resolution 22/22, had been adopted 
</p>
<p>by consensus at the twenty-second session of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>115. Armenia considered that the duty of memory and remembrance empowered by the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to the truth was an important dimension of genocide prevention. 
</p>
<p>Armenia underlined that denying, trivializing, condoning or justifying past genocides 
</p>
<p>infringed upon the human rights of victims of genocide. He regretted the fact that the 
</p>
<p>Turkish delegation had used the opportunity for dialogue with Armenia to reaffirm its 
</p>
<p>policy of denial.  
</p>
<p>116. Armenia disagreed with the approach of establishing equivalence between the victim 
</p>
<p>and the perpetrator and called upon Turkey to face its own history, thus relieving the next 
</p>
<p>generations of the heavy burden of the past. </p>


<p>117. Armenia valued the protection and promotion of political, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>Armenia outlined the value it attached to the United Nations human rights instruments and 
</p>
<p>the empowerment of people with the right to self-determination. The violent suppression of 
</p>
<p>that right had been the cause of many conflicts and its realization was essential for conflict 
</p>
<p>resolution. Armenia has been supporting the right of peoples to self-determination, 
</p>
<p>particularly in cases in which peoples&#8217; physical survival was at stake. It would continue that 
</p>
<p>support, including in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the Co-Chairs of 
</p>
<p>the OSCE Minsk Group, recalling that all OSCE members had accepted that the right of 
</p>
<p>peoples to self-determination should be among the key principles of conflict resolution in 
</p>
<p>the OSCE 2009 Ministerial Council statement. 
</p>
<p>118. Armenia had always believed that the UPR could strengthen cooperation and avoid 
</p>
<p>confrontations. While it was true that, to a certain extent, conflicts could impede the 
</p>
<p>realization of certain human rights, it was also true that improvements to human rights 
</p>
<p>protection could contribute to conflict resolution. Armenia had never tried to justify 
</p>
<p>setbacks by invoking conflict situations. It recalled that it had accepted a large number of 
</p>
<p>recommendations at the first UPR from one particular neighbouring State, but that goodwill 
</p>
<p>had not been appreciated and at the second UPR, the same State had rejected its 
</p>
<p>recommendations. Armenia reminded the meeting that the national report was its own and 
</p>
<p>it naturally expressed the Government&#8217;s official position on each issue, including on 
</p>
<p>historic issues and geographical names. 
</p>
<p>119. Armenia demonstrated its readiness to engage in human rights cooperation with all 
</p>
<p>countries, highly valuing the UPR. Armenia thanked the Member States for their 
</p>
<p>encouragement, constructive and useful dialogue and recommendations. Armenia would 
</p>
<p>incorporate the outcome of the review into the systematic protection of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>country.<b>
