Strong Performance in 2004, While Positioning for Continued Growth
Highlights
•  Record earnings from operations of $1.9 billion and cash flow of $3.7 billion in 2004 
•  Met 2004 production targets despite Terra Nova difficulties in the second half of the year 
•  U.S. Rockies and Buzzard acquisitions positioned Company for future growth
Calgary — Petro-Canada announced today fourth quarter earnings from operations adjusted for one-time and unusual 
items of $450 million ($1.73 per share), up 60% from $281 million ($1.06 per share) in the same quarter of 2003.  Fourth 
quarter 2004 cash flow was $1 046 million ($4.01 per share), compared with $628 million ($2.37 per share) in the fourth 
quarter of last year.  Cash flow is before changes in non-cash working capital.
Fourth quarter net earnings in 2004 were $441 million ($1.69 per share), compared with $198 million ($0.75 per share) in 
the same period of 2003.  Net earnings include gains or losses on foreign currency translation, disposal of assets and an 
unrealized hedging loss.
“In  2004,  we  made  great  strides  to  position  Petro-Canada  for  future  growth  in  production  and  earnings.    Our  major 
development projects remained on track and we made two significant acquisitions consistent with our growth strategy,” 
said President and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Brenneman.
Earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  were  $1 890 million  ($7.14  per  share)  in  2004,  up 
22% from $1 554 million ($5.87 per share) in 2003.  Earnings were positively impacted by strong commodity prices and 
refining margins, as well as lower exploration expense and interest charges.  These factors were partially offset by lower 
upstream volumes, higher operating costs and the stronger Canadian dollar compared to 2003.
Production of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas averaged 451 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2004, in 
line with the Company’s guidance for the year of 445 000 - 460 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
“The advantage of Petro-Canada having five unique and strong businesses was evident in 2004.  Strong performance in 
some  businesses  more  than  overcame  shortfalls  in  others,  and  we  delivered  record  earnings  and  cash  flow,”  said 
Mr. Brenneman.    “With  our  strong  balance  sheet  we  can  support  our  future  business  plans,  including  funding  our 
$3.2 billion capital program in 2005 and seeking additional growth opportunities.”
Petro-Canada is one of Canada's largest oil and gas companies, operating in both the upstream and downstream sectors 
of the industry in Canada and internationally.  Its common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol PCA and on the 
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PCZ.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  set  out  in  pages  2  to  17  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with:  the  unaudited 
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2004; Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis for the three months, six months and nine months ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 
2004,  respectively;  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2003;  the  audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003; and the Company’s 2003 Annual Information 
Form dated March 4, 2004.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Cash flow, which is expressed before changes in non-cash working capital, is used by the Company to analyze operating 
performance, leverage and liquidity.  Earnings from operations, which represent net earnings excluding gains or losses on 
foreign  currency  translation,  disposal  of  assets  and  unrealized  gains  or  losses  on  the  mark-to-market  of  the  hedge 
associated with the Buzzard acquisition, are used by the Company to evaluate operating performance.  Cash flow and 
earnings  from  operations  do  not  have  a  standardized  meaning  prescribed  by  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles (“GAAP”) and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Market prices shown in the table below influence average prices realized for crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and 
petroleum products as shown in the table on page 16.
During the fourth quarter, the impact of higher U.S. dollar denominated market prices was partially offset by the impact of 
the stronger Canadian dollar on prices realized.  In the same period, Dated Brent oil prices averaged $44.00 per barrel in 
U.S.  dollars,  up  50%  from  the  average  price  of  $29.41  per  barrel  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003.    The  Canadian  dollar 
averaged $0.82 US in the fourth quarter of 2004, up 8% from $0.76 US in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The net impact of 
these two changes, along with some minor changes in overall crude oil and liquids production, increased corporate-wide 
realized Canadian dollar prices by 32% for crude oil and liquids, from $36.61 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2003 to 
$48.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $6.87 US per million British thermal units (MMBtu), 
up  50%  from  $4.58  US  MMBtu  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003.  In  the  same  period,  AECO  natural  gas  prices  averaged  
$7.39 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 27% from $5.83 per Mcf in 2003. The difference between Henry Hub gas prices 
and  AECO  gas  prices  is  the  result  of  normal  supply  and  demand  fluctuations  in  North  American  basins,  along  with 
changes in the Canadian dollar exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Petro-Canada’s realized Canadian dollar price 
for its North American Natural Gas business averaged $6.92 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2004, up 32% from $5.25 per 
Mcf in the same quarter of 2003.
An unprecedented widening in light-heavy crude price differentials both internationally and in Canada was experienced in 
the fourth quarter of 2004.  In addition to the typical seasonal downturn in asphalt demand in the Northern Hemisphere, 
increased  OPEC  and  Mexican  production  of  heavier  crude  grades  and  a  shortage  of  refining  conversion  capacity  to 
process the increased volumes were the main contributing factors to the widening of the Brent-Maya spread to $11.70 US 
per barrel from $5.08 US in the fourth quarter of 2003. In Canada, the impact of these factors was amplified by increased 
production  of  heavy  crudes,  particularly  bitumen.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient  refining  conversion  capacity  in  North 
America, these factors led to a widening of the Edmonton Light-Lloydminster Blend price spread to $23.71 per barrel, from 
$13.04 in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Foreign currency translation reflected gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt that is not associated 
with the self-sustaining international business segment and the U.S. Rockies operations included in the North American 
Natural Gas business segment.  In June 2004, as part of its acquisition of an interest in the Buzzard field in the United 
Kingdom  (UK)  North  Sea,  the  Company  hedged  half  of  its  share  of  estimated  production  for  the  first  three  and  a  half 
years.  Buzzard unrealized mark-to-market losses were recorded in the quarter because these transactions did not qualify 
for hedge accounting.
Earnings Variances
Earnings from operations excluded adjustments for the above noted items, however included a number of one-time and 
unusual  items.    For  the  years  2003  and  2004,  the  Company  recorded  net  positive  adjustments  to  future  income  taxes 
reflecting announced changes to Canadian income tax rates, insurance proceeds related to the delayed start-up of Terra 
Nova and additional depreciation and other charges related to the consolidation of Eastern Canada refinery operations 
and the closure of the Oakville refinery.  In 2003, the Company recorded a $82 million charge to earnings related to the 
original  conversion  plan  at  the  Edmonton  refinery,  a  $46 million  provision  related  to  the  impairment  of  assets  in 
Kazakhstan, and a positive adjustment of $45 million related to the clarification of production rights and a tax provision for 
a former operation.
Fourth  quarter  2004  earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  were  $450 million  ($1.73  per 
share), up 60% from comparable earnings of $281 million ($1.06 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The increase in 
fourth  quarter  earnings  from  operations  reflected  higher  realized  commodity  prices  and  refining  margins,  which  were 
partially  offset  by  a  stronger  Canadian  dollar,  lower  upstream  volumes,  and  higher  exploration  expense  and  operating 
costs.
In  2004,  earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  were  $1 890 million  ($7.14  per  share),  up  
22% from $1 554 million ($5.87 per share) in the same period of 2003.  The increase in earnings from operations was due 
to higher realized commodity prices and refining margins, and lower exploration expense and interest charges.  These 
factors were partially offset by lower upstream volumes and higher operating costs.
PETRO-CANADA 
 
In 2004, fourth quarter cash flow was $1 046 million ($4.01 per share), up from $628 million ($2.37 per share) in the same 
quarter  of  2003.    The  increase  in  cash  flow  reflected  higher  earnings  from  operations  along  with  lower  current  income 
taxes.

Cash flow in 2004 was $3 747 million ($14.16 per share), compared with $3 372 million or ($12.73 per share) in 2003.
UPSTREAM
Production
Petro-Canada converts gas to oil equivalent at a rate of 6 000 cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.  Production volumes 
disclosed are net working interest before royalties, unless otherwise specified.
In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  Petro-Canada’s  production  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas  liquids  and  natural  gas  averaged 
437 200 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), compared with 471 500 boe/d in the same period of 2003.  Increased 
production from Oil Sands and North American Natural Gas was more than offset by lower production in Syria, East Coast 
Oil and Northwest Europe.
Petro-Canada’s production of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas averaged 451 100 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day in 2004, in line with the Company’s guidance for the year of 445 000 - 460 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
North American Natural Gas
North American Natural Gas contributed fourth quarter 2004 earnings from operations adjusted for one-time and unusual 
items of $131 million, up 60% from $82 million in the  fourth quarter of 2003.  The earnings increase reflected stronger 
realized prices and higher production due to the acquisition of U.S. Rockies volumes.  These factors were partially offset 
by higher exploration expense.
Net earnings from North American Natural Gas were $131 million, up from $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Net 
earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003 included a $19 million charge due to an increase in Ontario tax rates.
Fourth quarter 2004 Western Canada realized natural gas prices averaged $6.92 per Mcf, up from $5.25 per Mcf in the 
same quarter of 2003.  U.S. Rockies realized natural gas prices converted to Canadian dollars averaged $6.41 per Mcf in 
the fourth quarter of 2004.
Western Canada delivered average fourth quarter 2004 natural gas production of 676 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d), 
compared with 694 MMcf/d in the same period last year.  Western Canada crude oil and natural gas liquids production 
averaged  15 200  barrels  per  day  (b/d),  compared  with  15 600  b/d  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003.    Production  from  the 
U.S. Rockies averaged 54 million cubic feet per day of natural gas equivalent (MMcfe/d) in the fourth quarter.
Production Outlook
In  2005,  production  from  the  North  American  Natural  Gas  business  is  expected  to  be  127 000  boe/d  (762  MMcfe/d).  
Additional  volumes  from  the  U.S.  Rockies  are  expected  to  largely  offset  the  natural  declines  of  Western  Canada 
conventional natural gas production.  It is anticipated U.S. Rockies unconventional gas equivalent production will increase 
from about 50 MMcf/d in 2005 to 100 MMcf/d by 2007.
East Coast Oil
East  Coast  Oil  contributed  fourth  quarter  2004  earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  of 
$153 million, up 13% from $136 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The positive impact of higher realized prices was 
partially offset by lower production at Terra Nova due to extended maintenance activities and operating difficulties.
Net earnings from East Coast Oil were $153 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, up from $139 million in the fourth quarter 
of  2003.    Net  earnings  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003  included  $17 million  of  insurance  proceeds  related  to  the  delayed  
start-up of Terra Nova and a $14 million charge to reflect the increase in Ontario tax rates.
Fourth quarter 2004 East Coast Oil realized crude prices averaged $50.29 per barrel, compared with $38.66 per barrel in 
the fourth quarter of 2003.
Fourth  quarter  2004  production  averaged  68 400  b/d,  compared  with  87 500  b/d  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003.    Terra 
Nova’s fourth quarter production averaged 28 500 b/d in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 48 200 b/d in the fourth
PETRO-CANADA 
 
quarter  of  2003.    Production  was  impacted  by  maintenance  activities  and  the  accidental  discharge  of  oily  water  in 
November.    In  January  2005,  Terra  Nova  returned  to  full  production  capacity.    In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  Hibernia 
delivered solid production, averaging 39 900 b/d, compared with 39 300 b/d in the same quarter of 2003.
- 6 -
Other East Coast Offshore
Construction on the White Rose development continues to progress on schedule for start up in early 2006.  Hook-up and 
pre-commissioning activities are underway on the FPSO in Marystown.
Production Outlook
East Coast Oil production is expected to average 77 000 b/d in 2005.  Production in 2005 reflects an expected four-week 
turnaround at Terra Nova and a one-week turnaround at Hibernia.  East Coast volumes are expected to increase in 2006 
as production from the White Rose development ramps up to about 25 000 b/d at plateau.
Oil Sands
Oil  Sands  contributed  fourth  quarter  2004  earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  of 
$10 million, compared with a loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Increased earnings reflected higher Syncrude 
realized prices and increased production.  These positive impacts were largely offset by the impact on bitumen prices of 
very  wide  light-heavy  differentials  in  December  2004,  as  well  as  higher  operating  costs  at  Syncrude  due  to  unplanned 
shutdowns.
Net  earnings  from  Oil  Sands  were  $10 million  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  up  from  a  loss  of  $95 million  in  the  fourth 
quarter of 2003.  Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003 included an $82 million charge related to the original refinery 
conversion plan at the Edmonton refinery and a $9 million charge due to increased Ontario tax rates.
Fourth quarter 2004 Syncrude realized prices averaged $58.58 per barrel, compared with $38.80 per barrel in the same 
period  last  year.  MacKay  River  bitumen  realized  prices  averaged  $11.41  per  barrel  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004, 
compared with $13.08 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The decrease reflected very wide light-heavy differentials 
in December 2004.
Syncrude production averaged 27 300 b/d in the fourth quarter of 2004, despite  a power interruption that resulted in a 
shutdown of the LC finer upgrading unit in December.  Syncrude production averaged 24 500 b/d in the fourth quarter of 
2003.
Fourth quarter MacKay River production averaged 19 800 b/d, up from 16 300 b/d in the same period in 2003.  Water 
treatment issues, which adversely impacted MacKay River production, were addressed.
In other Oil Sands activity, drilling activities are underway to define future oil sands development options.
Production Outlook
Oil Sands production is expected to be about 52 000 b/d in 2005.  The higher expected production outlook in 2005 is due 
to  improved  reliability  and  operating  performance  at  MacKay  River.    The  Syncrude  stage  III  expansion,  scheduled  for 
completion  in  mid-2006,  will  increase  Petro-Canada’s  share  of  production  capacity  from  28 000  b/d  in  2005  to 
approximately 42 000 b/d.  Production is expected to reach this level following a ramp up period of two to three years.
International
International  contributed  fourth  quarter  2004  earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  of 
$84 million,  up  68%  from  $50 million  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003.    The  earnings  from  operations  increase  reflected 
stronger  realized  commodity  prices,  partially  offset  by  lower  volumes,  higher  exploration  charges  and  foreign  currency 
translation losses.
Net  earnings  from  International  were  $43 million  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  which  included  the  unrealized  Buzzard 
hedging loss of $41 million. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $54 million.
International oil and liquids realized prices in the fourth quarter averaged $50.09 per barrel, compared with $37.60 per 
barrel  in  the  same  period  of  2003.    International  realized  prices  for  natural  gas  averaged  $5.57  per  Mcf  in  the  fourth 
quarter of 2004, compared with $4.68 per Mcf in the same period of 2003.
PETRO-CANADA 
 
International production for the fourth quarter averaged 184 800 boe/d, compared with 212 100 boe/d in the fourth quarter 
of 2003.  Fourth quarter 2004 production in Libya and Trinidad was unchanged compared with the same period in 2003, 
while production in Syria and Northwest Europe was lower than in the fourth quarter of 2003.
- 7 -
Northwest Europe
Fourth  quarter  daily  production  averaged  47 100  boe/d,  compared  with  53 900  boe/d  in  the  same  period  last  year.  
Production from the U.K. averaged 28 600 boe/d in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 29 100 boe/d in the same 
period  last  year.    Netherlands  production  averaged  18 500  boe/d  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  compared  with  24 800 
boe/d in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Lower production in the Netherlands was largely due to the Hanze field coming off 
plateau in the second quarter of 2004.
Progress on the Buzzard field development (60 000 b/d at plateau production) continues on schedule and on budget for 
first oil in late 2006.  Progress has also been made on the Pict development (10 000 b/d) in the UK and the De Ruyter 
development (10 000 b/d) in the Netherlands, which are due on-stream in mid 2005 and late 2006, respectively.
North Africa/Near East
In the fourth quarter of 2004, production in North Africa/Near East averaged 125 400 boe/d, down from 145 900 boe/d in 
the  same  quarter  of  2003.    Libyan  production  averaged  50 300  b/d,  compared  with  50 800  b/d  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2003.  Syrian production averaged 74 700 boe/d, down from 91 700 boe/d as a result of natural declines in the existing, 
mature fields.
Subsequent to quarter-end, discussions relating to the Syrian Middle Area Gas project were discontinued by the Syrian 
Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources.
Northern Latin America
Trinidad  offshore  gas  production  averaged  74 MMcf/d  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  unchanged  from  the  comparable 
quarter of 2003.
The extended production test to evaluate the commerciality of the La Ceiba development in Venezuela commenced in the 
fourth quarter of 2004.  If the evaluation of the production test is positive, development of the La Ceiba project could be 
on-stream in 2008.
Production Outlook
International  production  is  expected  to  be  168 000  boe/d  in  2005.    Lower  production  from  the  International  business 
reflects  natural  declines  in  Syria  and  Northwest  Europe.    The  development  of  new  growth  projects  such  as  Pict 
(10 000 b/d), De Ruyter (10 000 b/d) and Buzzard (60 000 b/d) will add production in the 2005 to 2007 period.
2005 Consolidated Production Outlook
The production information contained in this section was previously released on December 16, 2004.  In 2005, production 
from Petro-Canada’s upstream businesses is expected to decrease slightly, compared to 2004 production.  This is mainly 
due to natural declines in Syria and Northwest Europe.  Factors that may impact production during 2005 include reservoir 
performance, drilling results, facility reliability and the execution of planned turnarounds at certain gas plants, Terra Nova, 
Hibernia, Syncrude and other factors.

The  Company’s  reserves  data  and  reserves  quantities  are  determined  by  Petro-Canada’s  staff  of  qualified  reserves 
evaluators using corporate-wide policies, procedures and practices.  These reserves policies, procedures and practices 
conform  with  the  requirements  in  Canada,  as  well  as  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  the 
Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta’s Standard of Practice for the Evaluation 
of Oil and Gas Reserves for Public Disclosure.  Petro-Canada also employs independent third parties to evaluate, audit 
and/or review its reserves processes and estimates.  In 2004, 87% of North American and 78% of International proved 
reserves were assessed by independent reserves evaluators.  The independent reserves evaluators concluded that the 
Company’s year-end reserves estimates were reasonable.

1    At  year-end  2004,  68%  of  proved  reserves  were  classified  as  proved  developed  reserves.   Of  the  total  proved  undeveloped  reserves,  84%  are  associated  with  large  projects  currently
producing or under active development including Buzzard, Syncrude, Hibernia, Terra Nova, White Rose and Trinidad natural gas.
2  The year-over-year net change in proved reserves before deducting production divided by annual production during the year.  Proved reserves replacement ratio is a general indicator of the
Company’s reserves growth.  It is only one of a number of metrics, which can be used to analyze a Company’s upstream business.

replacement ratio was 73% in 2004.
5   Reserves replacement ratio and reserves life index are non-standardized measures and may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies.  They are illustrative only.
PETRO-CANADA 
 
Petro-Canada's  objective  is  to  replace  reserves  over  time  through  exploration,  development  and  acquisition.    On  a 
consolidated  basis,  Petro-Canada’s  proved  reserves  replacement  over  the  last  five  years  was  150%.    Proved  reserve 
replacement  in  2004  was  96%.    The  Company  believes  that  due  to  the  specific  nature  of  its  upstream  portfolio  and 
attributes  of  its  probable  reserves,  the  combination  of  proved  plus  probable  reserves  provides  a  better  perspective  of 
Petro-Canada’s reserves life index.   The proved plus probable reserves life index was 13.5 years at year-end 2004.
- 9 -
In North American Natural Gas, on a proved basis, Petro-Canada replaced 107% of production in 2004.  This reflected 
reserves  additions  from  the  Company’s  capital  program  and  the  acquisition  of  reserves  in  the  U.S.  Rockies.    The 
U.S. Rockies acquisition added 87 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) of proved plus probable reserves.
On the East Coast, on a proved basis, Petro-Canada replaced 90% of production in 2004.  At Hibernia, 21 million barrels 
of oil (MMbbls) net to Petro-Canada were added to proved plus probable reserves as a result of better than anticipated 
reservoir performance and development drilling.  The life of field estimate increased from 835 MMbbls (167 MMbbls net to 
Petro-Canada) at year-end 2003 to 940 MMbbls (188 MMbbls net to Petro-Canada) at year-end 2004. This increase in 
reserves will lower the depreciation, depletion and amortization charged to earnings on a unit of production basis.
In Oil Sands, on a proved basis, Petro-Canada’s reserve replacement for 2004 was impacted by the transfer of proved 
bitumen reserves to probable reserves.  The SEC prescribes the use of year-end prices and costs in determining proved 
reserves.  The combination of very wide light-heavy price differentials and high prices for synthetic crude used for blending 
contributed  to  very  low  prices  for  Canadian  bitumen  at  year-end  2004.    As  a  result,  Petro-Canada  transferred  
22 MMbbls of MacKay River proved reserves to probable reserves. This change did not have any financial impact on the 
Company, and Petro-Canada continues to consider its in situ bitumen reserves and resources to be an important part of 
its overall portfolio. At Syncrude, 116% of production was replaced through on-going development.
In  International,  on  a  proved  basis,  Petro-Canada  replaced  127%  of  production  in  2004.    In  Northwest  Europe,  the 
Buzzard  acquisition  in  the  UK  added  154  MMboe  proved  plus  probable  reserves.    A  further  16  MMboe  proved  plus 
probable reserves were added following sanction of the operated De Ruyter project in the Netherlands. These additions 
were  partly  offset  by  negative  revisions  of  29  MMboe  to  probable  reserves,  mainly  due  to  a  dry  appraisal  well  in  the  
L5b-C field in the Netherlands. In the North Africa Near East region there were negative revisions of 29 MMboe, mainly 
due to reservoir performance in Syria offset by additions in Libya from ongoing field developments.
Further detail on Petro-Canada’s reserves is provided in the Reserves Table at the end of this Management Discussion 
and Analysis (see page 15).
DOWNSTREAM
The  Downstream  contributed  fourth  quarter  earnings  from  operations  adjusted  for  one-time  and  unusual  items  of 
$102 million, up 70% from $60 million in the same quarter of 2003.  The earnings from operations increase reflected a 
$36 million  “last-in,  first-out”  (LIFO)  inventory  valuation  gain  associated  with  the  closure  of  the  Oakville  refinery,  higher 
U.S. cracking margins and a wider light/heavy crude price differential.  These factors were partially offset by the impact of 
higher crude prices on margins for all products and a stronger Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The Downstream business posted fourth quarter net earnings of $92 million, compared with net earnings of $34 million in 
the same quarter of 2003.  Fourth quarter 2004 net earnings were negatively impacted by $11 million of after-tax charges 
for  additional  depreciation  and  other  charges  related  to  the  previously  announced  consolidation  of  Eastern  Canada 
refinery  operations.  Net  earnings  in  2003  included  a  $15 million  after-tax  charge  for  additional  depreciation  and  other 
charges related to the Eastern Canada consolidation, and an $11 million charge to reflect higher Ontario tax rates.
The  increase  in  the  fourth  quarter  2004  New  York  Harbour  3-2-1  refinery  crack  spread  to  $5.50 US  per  barrel  from 
$4.97 US  per  barrel  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003  was  largely  offset  by  a  stronger  Canadian  dollar.    The  international 
light/heavy  crude  price  differential  widened  to  $11.70 US  per  barrel  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  compared  with  
$5.08 US per barrel in 2003.
Petro-Canada’s  refineries  achieved  96%  utilization  in  the  fourth  quarter,  adjusted  for  the  partial  closure  of  the  Oakville 
refinery on November 12, 2004.  This compared with a 98% utilization rate in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The decline was 
largely due to the 35-day shutdown at the Montreal refinery related to the Eastern Canada consolidation.  As previously 
announced, the Oakville refinery will continue to operate at reduced rates in the early part of 2005.  This will permit short-
term supply flexibility during the transition period.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, total sales of refined petroleum products were down 4%, compared to the same period last 
year, largely due to lower wholesale and rack sales in Eastern Canada.
PETRO-CANADA 
 
Excluding  the  impacts  of  one-time  and  unusual  items,  refining  and  supply  contributed  fourth  quarter  2004  operating 
earnings of $88 million, compared with $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Fourth quarter earnings were increased 
by  a  $36 million  LIFO  inventory  valuation  gain  associated  with  the  phased  closure  of  the  Oakville  refinery  operations.  
These adjustments more than offset continued low asphalt and heavy fuel oil margins.
- 10 -
Marketing  contributed  fourth  quarter  2004  operating  earnings  of  $14 million,  compared  with  $10 million  in  the  same 
quarter  of  2003.    Increased  earnings  were  due  to  higher  wholesale  earnings  partially  offset  by  intense  retail  price 
competition.
Petro-Canada  continued  consolidation  of  its  Eastern  Canada  refinery  operations  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  with  the 
successful reversal and expansion of the Trans Northern Pipelines Inc. pipeline and completion of the logistics tie-ins at 
the  Montreal  refinery  to  supply  the  Ontario  market.    In  addition,  consolidation  activities  included  a  turnaround  at  the 
Montreal refinery to expand capacity and the permanent shutdown of the first of two crude trains at the Oakville refinery.
CORPORATE
Shared services recorded net earnings of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $2 million for the same 
period in 2003.  Fourth quarter 2004 net earnings included a $43 million after-tax gain on foreign currency translation on 
U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2003.
Fourth quarter 2004 interest expense was $34 million before-tax, compared with $43 million in the prior year due primarily 
to higher capitalized interest and a stronger Canadian dollar.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
Under  the  terms  of  the  normal  course  issuer  bid  (NCIB),  Petro-Canada  is  entitled  to  purchase  up  to  21 million  of  its 
common shares during the period from June 22, 2004 to June 21, 2005, subject to certain conditions.  During the fourth 
quarter, Petro-Canada purchased a total of 2 403 188 common shares at an average price of $65.82 for a total cost of 
approximately $159 million.  Since filing the NCIB in June 2004, the Company purchased a total of 6 868 082 shares at an 
average price of $65.02 per share for a total cost of approximately $447 million.  Petro-Canada’s priority uses of cash are 
to fund profitable growth and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
Accounting Changes
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted, on a retroactive basis, the new standard of the Canadian Institute of 
Chartered Accountants on accounting for asset retirement obligations.  Under the new standard, the fair values of asset 
retirement obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis when they are incurred and amounts recorded for 
the related assets are increased by the amount of these liabilities.  Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in 
their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company began accounting for certain transportation costs, third-party gas purchases and 
diluent purchases as expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings.  Previously, these costs were netted against 
revenue.    The  change  in  accounting  represents  a  reclassification  of  revenue  and  expenses,  and  has  no  effect  on  net 
earnings.  Prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Effective  January  1,  2004,  the  Company  elected  to  discontinue  hedge  accounting  for  certain  Downstream  hedging 
programs.  As a result, the realized and unrealized values of these transactions are recognized in Investment and Other 
Income. The effect of the change for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004 was a decrease in earnings of 
$3 million and an increase of earnings of $3 million, respectively.
Pension Contributions
Petro-Canada  expects  to  make  pension  contributions  of  approximately  $95 million  in  2005.    Petro-Canada’s  pension 
expense was $71 million in 2004, compared with $72 million in 2003.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At  December  31,  2004,  the  balance  of  short-term  debt  outstanding  was  $299 million,  consisting  of  $70 million US  in 
U.S. denominated commercial paper and $215 million in Canadian dollar denominated commercial paper.  The proceeds 
from issuing commercial paper were used to repay borrowings on the syndicated operating credit facility, finance a portion 
of the U.S. Rockies acquisition and purchase shares under the NCIB.
PETRO-CANADA 
 
At  the  end  of  the  quarter,  the  Company’s  syndicated  operating  credit  facilities  totalled  $1 500 million.    There  were  no 
draws on these facilities at quarter end, however these facilities provided liquidity support to the Company’s commercial 
paper program.  In addition, the Company had bilateral demand facilities totalling $445 million, of which $263 million was 
used for letters of credit and overdraft coverage.
- 11 -
The Company’s unsecured long-term debt securities are rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, BBB by Standard & 
Poor’s and A (low) by Dominion Bond Rating Service.  The Company’s long-term debt ratings remained unchanged from 
year-end 2003.
On November 3, 2004, Petro-Canada filed a shelf prospectus to provide the Company with the flexibility to issue up to 
$1 billion US of debt securities in the United States until December 2006.  This prospectus replaced the shelf prospectus 
registered in 2003.  On November 8, 2004, the Company issued $400 million US of senior notes, leaving $600 million US 
available under the shelf prospectus.  The proceeds of this issue were used to repay the $400 million US acquisition credit 
facility used to partially fund the U.S. Rockies acquisition in July 2004.
Petro-Canada’s cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2004 were $170 million, compared with $635 million as at 
December 31, 2003.
Excluding cash and cash equivalents, short-term notes payable and the current portion of long-term debt, Petro-Canada 
had an operating working capital deficiency of $777 million as at December 31, 2004, compared with an operating working 
capital deficiency of $52 million as at December 31, 2003.  The working capital deficiency increase was primarily due to 
the accounts receivable securitization program and higher accounts payable resulting from higher commodity prices and 
capital accruals.
Commitments and contingent liabilities are disclosed in Note 22 to the 2003 annual consolidated financial statements.
Contractual obligations are summarized in the Company’s 2003 annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis.  During 
the  fourth  quarter  of  2004,  total  contractual  obligations  increased  by  approximately  $1.4  billion,  relating  mainly  to  an 
obligation for the processing of future bitumen production beginning in 2009.
RISK
Hedging Activities
As part of its acquisition of an interest in the Buzzard field in the UK North Sea, the Company entered into a series of 
derivative contracts related to the future sale of Brent crude oil.  The purpose of these transactions is to ensure value-
adding returns to Petro-Canada on this investment, even in the event of a material decrease in oil prices.  These contracts 
effectively lock in an average forward price of approximately $26 US per barrel on a volume of 35 840 000 barrels.  This 
volume  represents  approximately  50%  of  the  Company’s  share  of  estimated  plateau  production  in  the  2007  to  2010 
period.  Mark-to-market unrealized losses associated with these Buzzard contracts were $41 million after-tax in the fourth 
quarter  of  2004  and  $205 million  after-tax  for  the  year-ended  2004.    As  the  Buzzard  development  is  not  sufficiently 
advanced to qualify for hedge accounting, unrealized gains or losses are reported in earnings each quarter.
Excluding the risk management activity associated with Buzzard, as described above, there was no material change in the 
Company’s risks or risk management activities since December 31, 2003.  Petro-Canada’s risk management activities are 
conducted according to policies and guidelines established by the Board of Directors, using insurance, selective hedging 
and other techniques.  Readers should refer to Petro-Canada’s 2003 Annual Information Form and the risk management 
section of the 2003 Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Outlook – Capital Expenditures
The  capital  expenditures  information  contained  in  this  section  was  previously  released  on  December  16,  2004.   
Petro-Canada  has  a  $3.2 billion  capital  program  in  2005,  up  13%  from  the  2004  capital  program.    The  2005  capital 
program  includes  rising  investment  in  all  four  upstream  business  units  and  in  the  Downstream.    The  expenditures  are 
focused  on  furthering  the  company’s  strategic  objectives  to  improve  the  profitability  of  base  businesses  and  to  deliver 
profitable growth. Growth initiatives include reserve replacement in existing core areas that deliver immediate economic 
benefit, new projects aimed at medium-term growth, and exploration and new venture activity for the long term.

LEGAL NOTICE - FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION/RESERVES ESTIMATES 
This  release  contains  forward-looking  statements.  Such  statements  are  generally  identifiable  by  the  terminology  used,  such  as  “plan”, 
“anticipate”, “intend”, “expect”, “estimate”, “budget” or other similar wording. Forward looking statements include but are not limited to references 
to  future  capital  and  other  expenditures,  drilling  plans,  construction  activities,  the  submission  of  development  plans,  seismic  activity,  refining 
margins, oil and gas production levels and the sources of growth thereof, results of exploration activities, and dates by which certain areas may 
be  developed  or  may  come  on-stream,  retail  throughputs,  pre-production  and  operating  costs,  reserves  estimates,  reserves  life,  natural  gas 
export capacity and environmental matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and 
other factors which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such 
statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: general economic, market and business conditions; industry capacity; competitive action 
by other companies; fluctuations in oil and gas prices; refining and marketing margins; the ability to produce and transport crude oil and natural 
gas to markets; the effects of weather conditions; the results of exploration and development drilling and related activities; fluctuation in interest 
rates and foreign currency exchange rates; the ability of suppliers to meet commitments; actions by governmental authorities including increases 
in  taxes;  decisions  or  approvals  of  administrative  tribunals;  changes  in  environmental  and  other  regulations;  risks  attendant  with  oil  and  gas 
operations; and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Petro-Canada. These factors are discussed in greater detail in filings 
made  by  Petro-Canada  with  the  Canadian  provincial  securities  commissions  and  the  United  States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission 
(“SEC”).
Petro-Canada’s  staff  of  qualified  reserves  evaluators  generate  the  reserves  estimates  used  by  this  corporation.  Our  reserves  staff  and 
management are not considered independent of the corporation for purposes of the Canadian provincial securities commissions. Petro-Canada 
has  obtained  an  exemption  from  certain  Canadian  reserves  disclosure  requirements  to  permit  it  to  make  disclosure  in  accordance  with  SEC 
standards in order to provide comparability with U.S. and other international issuers.  Therefore, Petro-Canada’s reserves data and other oil and 
gas formal disclosure is made in accordance with U.S. disclosure requirements and practices and may differ from Canadian domestic standards 
and practices.  Where the term boe (barrel of oil equivalent) is used in this release it may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A BOE 
conversion  ratio  of  6  Mcf:  1  bbl  is  based  on  an  energy  equivalency  conversion  method  primarily  applicable  at  the  burner  tip  and  does  not 
represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by 
actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  The 
use of terms such as “probable”, “possible”, “recoverable” or "potential” reserves and resources in this release does not meet the guidelines of 
the SEC for inclusion in documents filed with the SEC.
Readers  are  cautioned  that  the  foregoing  list  of  important  factors  affecting  forward-looking  statements  is  not  exhaustive.    Furthermore,  the 
forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  release  are  made  as  of  the  date  of  this  release,  and  Petro-Canada  does  not  undertake  any 
obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
otherwise. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(unaudited)

The note disclosure requirements for annual financial statements provide additional disclosure to that required for 
interim  financial  statements.    Accordingly,  these  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction 
with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  the  Company's  2003  annual  report.    The  interim  consolidated 
financial statements follow the accounting policies summarized in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements 
except as set out below.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted, on a retroactive basis, the new standard of the Canadian Institute 
of Chartered Accountants on accounting for asset retirement obligations.  Under the new standard, the fair values of asset 
retirement obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis when they are incurred and amounts recorded for 
the related asset are increased by the amount of these liabilities.  Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in 
their  present  value  and  the  initial  capitalized  costs  are  depreciated  over  the  useful  lives  of  the  related  assets.    Asset 
retirement obligations are not recorded for those assets which have an indeterminate useful life.  In determining the fair 
value of the asset retirement obligations, the estimated cash flows have been discounted at 6.5%.  The total undiscounted 
amount of the estimated cash flows required to settle the obligation was $2 121 million as at December 31, 2003.  The 
obligations will be settled on an ongoing basis over the useful lives of the operating assets, which extends up to 45 years in 
the future.  The change  in accounting for  asset retirement obligations  did not impact net  earnings for the three months 
ended December 31, 2004 and decreased net earnings by $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 (decrease in 
net earnings of $2 million and $19 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2003, respectively).  The 
change  also  resulted  in  increases  in  asset  retirement  obligations  of  $391  million  and  property,  plant  and  equipment  of 
$184 million and decreases in retained earnings of $133 million and future income taxes of $74 million as at December 31, 
2003.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company began accounting for certain transportation costs, third party gas purchases 
and diluent purchases as expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings.  Previously, these costs were netted against 
revenue.  Prior year comparatives have been restated.  The change in accounting has no effect on net earnings but has 
increased revenue and expenses as follows:

On  July  28,  2004  the  Company  acquired  all  of  the  common  shares  of  Prima  Energy  Corporation  for  a  total 
acquisition cost of $644 million, net of cash acquired.  The results of operations, which are self-sustaining, are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Goodwill,  which  is  not  tax  deductible,  was  assigned  to  the  Company’s  North  American  Natural  Gas  business
segment.
Funding  for  the  acquisition  was  provided  by  a  U.S.  $400  million  underwritten  credit  facility10,  cash  and  cash
equivalents and existing committed bank credit lines.

Investment and other income includes unrealized losses associated  with the Buzzard derivative contracts  8 in the 
amount  of  $66  million  ($41  million  after-tax)  and  $333  million  ($205  million  after-tax)  for  the  three  months  and  the  year 
ended December 31, 2004, respectively.
Investment and other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 also includes a net pre-tax gain on disposal of 
assets  of  $12  million  ($11  million  after-tax),  including  $8  million  ($8  million  after-tax)  relating  to  the  sale  of  assets  in 
Kazakhstan.
Investment  and  other  income  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2003  included  a  net  pre-tax  gain  of  $42  million 
($29 million after-tax) which included gains on disposals of non-core oil and gas properties partially offset by a loss on the 
disposals of Downstream retail sites.

Following a review of its Eastern Canada refining and supply operations, Petro-Canada announced in September, 
2003 it will be ceasing Oakville refining operations and expanding the existing terminalling facilities.  The total charge to 
earnings related to the shutdown, which is now expected to occur in the first half of 2005, is approximately $200 million 
after-tax.  The following expenses have been recorded in the Downstream segment:

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2003 included 
a charge, recorded in the Oil Sands business segment, of $136 million ($82 million after-tax) relating mainly to engineering 
costs incurred in finalizing the Company’s strategy for converting the Edmonton refinery to process an oilsands feedstock.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2003 included an impairment charge of 
$46 million ($46 million after-tax), recorded in the International business segment, relating to assets in Kazakhstan.  During 
the three months ended March 31, 2004, these assets were sold. 4

The provision for future income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004 has been reduced by $13 million due to 
the  reduction  in  provincial  income  tax  rates.    The  adjustment  was  allocated  to  the  business  segments  as  a  decrease 
(increase) to the tax provision as follows: North American Natural Gas - $7 million, East Coast Oil - $3 million, Oil Sands - 
$2 million, Downstream - $2 million and Shared Services – $(1) million.
The provision for future income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2003 has been increased by $51 
million  due  to  the  substantively  enacted  increase  in  provincial  income  tax  rates.  The  adjustment  was  allocated  to  the 
segments as an increase (decrease) to the tax provision as follows: North American Gas - $19 million, East Coast Oil - $14 
million, Oil Sands - $9 million, Downstream - $11 million and Shared Services - $(2) million.

The provision for future income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 has been reduced by $96 million due 
primarily  to  the  reduction  in  federal  income  tax  rates.    The  changes,  to  be  introduced  over  five  years,  will  reduce  the 
applicable  rate  on  resource  income  to  21%  from  28%,  provide  for  the  deductions  of  crown  royalties  and  eliminate  the 
deduction for resource allowance.  The adjustment was allocated to the business segments as a decrease (increase) to the 
tax provision as follows: North American Natural Gas - $29 million, East Coast Oil - $21 million, Oil Sands - $14 million, 
Downstream - $45 million and Shared Services - $(13) million.

Expenditures on property, plant and equipment and exploration for the year ended December 31, 2004 include Petro-
Canada’s purchase of a 29.9 per cent interest in the Buzzard field and nearby exploration blocks in the U.K. North Sea for 
$1 218 million (U.S. $887 million), net of cash.  Funds for the purchase were provided from cash and cash equivalents and 
from committed bank credit facilities.
In connection with the acquisition, Petro-Canada entered into a series of derivative contracts related to the future sale 
of Brent crude oil which effectively locked in an average price of U.S. $25.98 per barrel on 35,840,000 barrels of oil or half 
the  expected  production  for  the  period  July  1,  2007  to  December  31,  2010.    Mark-to-market  gains  or  losses  on  these 
contracts are currently reflected in investment and other income. 4

In June 2004, Petro-Canada entered into a securitization program, expiring in 2009, to sell an undivided interest of 
eligible accounts receivable up to $400 million to a third party, on a revolving and fully serviced basis.  The service liability 
has been estimated to be insignificant. The Company also retains an interest in the transferred accounts receivable equal to 
the required reserves amount.
Petro-Canada accounts for the securitization program as a sale, as control over the transferred accounts receivable is 
relinquished  once  proceeds  from  the  third  party  have  been  received.    Gains  or  losses  from  the  sale  are  recognized  in 
investment and other income.  The gain or loss is dependent upon the purchase discount, as well as the previous carrying 
amount of the accounts receivable transferred, allocated between the accounts receivable sold and the retained interests 
based on the relative fair values.
As at December 31, 2004, $400 million of outstanding accounts receivable had been sold under the program.

and U.S. $300 million 5.35% notes due July 15, 2033.  In anticipation of issuing this debt, the Company entered into interest 
rate derivatives which resulted in effective yields for the 10 and 30 year notes of 4.838% and 6.073%, respectively.  The 
gross proceeds aggregated $804 million which contributed to the repayment of $810 million of the credit facility related to 
the  acquisition  of  oil  and  gas  operations  of  Veba  Oil  &  Gas  GmbH.    During  June  2004  the  remaining  acquisition  credit

During the year ended December 31, 2004 the Company granted 1 836 700 stock options (year ended December 
31, 2003 - 2 446 000 stock options) to officers and certain employees to purchase common shares at an average price of 
$57.60 per share for a term of seven years (2003 - $51.39 per share for a term of ten years).  The options vest over four 
years  and  are  exercisable  at  the  market  price  when  granted.    Shareholder  approval  was  received  at  the  2004  Annual 
General Meeting on April 27, 2004 whereby holders of stock options granted in 2004 have the alternative to exercise these 
stock  options  as  a  cash  payment  alternative  (CPA).    Where  the  CPA  is  chosen,  vested  options  are  surrendered  for 
cancellation in return for a direct cash payment from the Company based on the excess of the then market price over the 
option exercise price.

Stock options granted in 2004 are accounted for based on the intrinsic value at each period end whereby a liability 
and expense are recorded over the vesting  period in the amount by  which the current  market price exceeds the option 
exercise price. Stock options granted in 2003 have been accounted for based on the fair value method at the grant date.  
The  fair  value  associated  with  the  2003  options  is  charged  to  earnings  over  the  vesting  period  with  a  corresponding 
increase in contributed surplus. For stock options issued in 2002, the Company accounts for these options based on the 
intrinsic value at the grant date, which does not result in a charge to earnings as the exercise price was equal to the market 
price at the grant date.  The following table presents the pro forma net earnings and  the pro forma  earnings  per share 
computed assuming the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for the compensation cost of stock 
options granted in 2002.

The estimated fair value of stock options granted in 2003, which are charged to earnings (see above) was $17.50 
per option.  The estimated weighted average fair value of stock options, granted in 2002, which is incorporated in the pro 
forma earnings information above, was $12.74 per option.  The fair values have been determined using the Black-Scholes 
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
Risk-free interest rate 
Expected hold period to exercise 
Expected volatility in the market price of the common shares 
Estimated annual dividend
During the year ended December 31, 2004 the Company implemented a Performance Share Unit (PSU) program 
and granted 284 880 PSUs to officers and other senior management employees.  Under the PSU program, notional share 
units are awarded and settled in cash at the end of a three year period based upon the Company’s share price at that time, 
the  value  of  notional  dividends  applied  during  the  period  and  the  Company’s  total  shareholder  return  relative  to  a  peer 
group of North American industry competitors.  The charge is accounted for over the three year-term on a mark-to-market 
basis, whereby a liability and expense are recorded based on the number of PSUs outstanding, the current market price of 
the Company’s shares and the Company’s current performance relative to the peer group.  Based on the market-to-market 
value at December 31, 2004, no compensation expense relating to the PSUs was recorded.

Commencing  June  22,  2004,  the  Company  made  a  Normal  Course  Issuer  Bid  to  repurchase  up  to  21  million 
common shares for cancellation during the period up to June 2005.  During the three months and year ended December 
31, 2004, the Company has purchased, under the program, 2 403 188 and 6 868 082 shares for a cost of $159 million and 
$447 million, respectively.  The excess of purchase price over the carrying amount of the shares purchased, which totalled 
$148 million and $414 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004, respectively, was recorded as a 
reduction of contributed surplus.
