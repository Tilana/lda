<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Guyana was held at the 13th meeting, on 11 May 2010. The delegation of 
Guyana was headed by The Honourable Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett. At its 17th meeting, 
held on 14 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Guyana. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guyana: Belgium, Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of) and Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Guyana: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GUY/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GUY/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GUY/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Guyana through the troika. Those 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Guyana stated that it was pleased to participate in the universal periodic review, 
which offered an opportunity to share experiences regarding its successes and challenges, 
and to engage in dialogue. The delegation stated that it was important to recognize that in 
1992, Guyana had accumulated a debt of $2 billion and 67 per cent of its people lived 
below the poverty line. In 2009, the debt had been reduced to approximately $800 million, 
notwithstanding the fact that Guyana had continued to borrow in order to address critical 
social and economic needs. In addition, the poverty level had been halved. Over the past 
five years, Guyana had enjoyed positive growth rates despite the global and financial crises 
and severe flooding in 2005, with losses equalling 57 per cent of its gross domestic product. 
While there remained significant challenges, Guyana had made major advancements in 
several areas, which are mentioned below.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that in 1999, the 1980 Constitution had been subjected to an 
extensive constitutional reform process coordinated by a Parliamentary Constitutional 
Reform Commission with representatives of all parliamentary political parties, the religious 
community, labour, business and civil society. The revised Constitution was based on a 
model of inclusive governance, which was unique and, inter alia, provided for the 
appointment of five rights commissions &#8211; on ethnic relations, women and gender, children, 
indigenous peoples, and human rights &#8211; whose members were appointed through a </p>


<p>parliamentary consensual mechanism, with the participation of civil society in the 
nomination process. 
</p>
<p>7. The Ethnic Relations Commission was functioning, and the members of the Women 
and Gender Equality and Rights of the Child commissions had recently elected their 
chairpersons and were expected to be fully operational by mid-July 2010.  The Indigenous 
Peoples Commission should be fully operational before the end of the year. The delegation 
described the method of appointing the members of the Human Rights Commission and 
reiterated its conviction that the rights commissions provided opportunities to receive and 
address complaints of violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation stated that Guyana had enacted a series of statutes that specifically 
promoted and protected human rights. These included the Trafficking in Persons Act of 
2005; legislation to increase the age of consent from 12 to 16 years; the Amerindian Act of 
2006; and four pieces of modern legislation dealing with children&#8217;s rights, including 
legislation providing for the establishment of the Child Care and Protection Agency, the 
Sexual Offences Bill (unanimously adopted on 22 April 2010) and the Persons with 
Disabilities Bill of 2009. Those progressive pieces of legislation had been enacted 
following extensive consultation with civil society, communities and special interest groups 
and had been subjected to additional review through the Parliamentary Select Committee 
process, a feature of the Guyanese lawmaking process for more than a decade and a half. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that in 2008, President Bharrat Jagdeo, in order to further 
strengthen and entrench this model of participatory democracy, had initiated the convening 
of National Stakeholders&#8217; Forums, comprising approximately 100 organizations from civil 
society representing all parliamentary political parties, all religious bodies, the labour 
movement, the business community, women&#8217;s groups and Amerindian organizations, as 
well as the Guyana Human Rights Association and some citizen non-governmental 
organizations. During the reporting period, 13 such engagements had been held on diverse 
issues such as domestic and sexual violence, crime and security, the Economic Partnership 
Agreement with the European Union, the food and fuel crises and relief for Haiti. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation noted that Guyana was cognizant of the threats facing it as a 
consequence of climate change. While a response to climate change must be global, 
Guyana could contribute by offering solutions to the problem. To that end, Guyana had 
developed a Low-Carbon Development Strategy calling for the provision of resources to 
small and vulnerable countries to enable them to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of 
climate change, and offered a sustainable development model, while contributing to the 
reduction in carbon emissions globally, in part through the preservation and sustainable use 
of forests. The delegation reiterated that the Strategy had been subjected to an extensive 
consultative process that had included more than 130 Amerindian communities. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that Guyana had made significant strides in relation to the 
development of its indigenous peoples, who represented some 9 per cent of its population. 
A Ministry of Amerindian Affairs had been established, and the Amerindian Act of 2006 
provided for, inter alia, land claims, resource rights, traditional rights, the governance of 
communities and the establishment of a National Toshaos Council. Access to social 
services had been significantly improved, and more indigenous children were now in school 
than in any previous period in the country&#8217;s history. Over the past five years, the ownership 
of land by indigenous communities had increased from 6.5 per cent to approximately 14 per 
cent of Guyana&#8217;s land mass, with 134 communities now having legal title to the lands that 
they used and occupied. Those legal titles were grants of State lands that were &#8220;absolute 
and forever&#8221; and allowed for their indisputable control by communities. Addressing land 
claims was a continuous process. </p>


<p>12. In response to an advance question, the delegation stated that the veto power of the 
Minister of Mines was used only in relation to large-scale mining deemed to be in the 
national interest.  Since the enactment of the legislation in 2006, there had been no such 
case. The delegation clarified that communities had veto power in relation to small- and 
medium-scale mining and that several were engaged in these. The delegation noted that, 
with regard to the rights of indigenous peoples, Guyana had come a long way in a short 
period of time.  
</p>
<p>13. In response to the advance question relating to the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Guyana was not a party, the consideration 
of these had advanced significantly. In relation to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, it 
continued to be under consideration.   
</p>
<p>14. In response to an advance question, the delegation stated that outstanding reports to 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women had been submitted on 28 April and 7 May 2010, 
respectively. The delegation indicated that the report to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child highlighted the many positive interventions for the protection of children, which 
included major legislative reform. The legislative reform process continued, with the 
consideration of a Juvenile Justice Bill, the Custody, Care, Guardianship and Maintenance 
Bill, and the Child Care Services Bill. 
</p>
<p>15. Concerning the question regarding the impact of the Child Care Protection Agency 
(established in July 2009), the delegation stated that to date, 1,500 children had received 
care. Of these, 160 had been placed in a Government-assisted centre owing to high-risk 
situations, 127 cases were with the police for further investigation, 71 were before the 
court, and 651 children and their families had been counselled. The delegation, in response 
to an advance question, stated that the dialogue on corporal punishment continued and was 
part and parcel of the consultations on the new draft Education Act agreed to by Parliament.  
</p>
<p>16. In relation to the advance questions concerning women, the delegation noted that the 
report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women described the 
status of women, including measures to reduce violence against women, such as the Sexual 
Offences Bill, and the increased participation of women at all levels of Government and 
national life. The level of domestic and sexual violence against women remained a concern 
and continued to be addressed through the national stakeholders-Government partnership.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to the advance questions concerning discrimination against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender persons, the delegation indicated that no cases involving the 
harassment of lesbian or gay persons had been received by the Government through any of 
its complaint mechanisms. There had been one case in which a person had been charged 
with cross-dressing, and the matter was still before the court. Changes to laws required 
widespread consultation and a major change in attitude on the part of the populace. The 
Government&#8217;s attempt to include the phrase &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; in the anti-discrimination 
clause of the Constitution had been met with widespread consternation and protest. 
</p>
<p>18. Similarly, the issue of capital punishment had been met with an overwhelming call 
for its retention in the law books.  No executions had taken place over the past decade, and 
any change in the status quo would have to be carried out with the involvement and 
acceptance of the people. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the advance questions concerning the security sector, the excessive 
use of force, and human rights training, the delegation stated that the Constitution protected 
citizens from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
Following a very violent crime wave from 2002 to 2008, increased budgetary and technical </p>


<p>resources had been made available to enhance the capacity of the security sector to protect 
the rights of citizens. There was also greater involvement on the part of national 
stakeholders in crime and security matters. The broad-based National Commission on Law 
and Order continued to function. The emphasis on building better police-community 
relations and trust and confidence for safer neighbourhoods had received support under the 
Enhanced Public Trust, Security and Inclusion Programme (2008-2011) of the Government 
of Guyana and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
</p>
<p>20. The Citizen&#8217;s Security Programme of the Government of Guyana and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) was focused on modernizing the Ministry of Home 
Affairs and the Guyana Police Force with a view to increased quality of service and greater 
capacity to protect public safety. Thirty police stations had been renovated and included 
improved detention areas in keeping with international standards. This process was 
continuing. A programme aimed at the installation of closed-circuit televisions in police 
stations had commenced, and it would enhance the accountability and transparency of the 
police ranks. 
</p>
<p>21. Of special significance was the new Security Sector Reform Plan, which had 
emerged after three years of consultation and was being implemented. The Constitution had 
been amended to establish a new Parliamentary Standing Committee to oversee the security 
sector, and its terms of reference had been agreed to in the National Assembly early in 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>22. In relation to questions concerning prisoners&#8217; welfare and rights and detention 
facilities, the delegation stated that Guyana had increased the budgetary support for prisons 
but that the limited availability of financial resources for the construction of new facilities 
remained a challenge. The major cause of overcrowding had been delays in the courts, 
which had led to a relatively large remand population. This was being addressed through 
the Justice Reform Sector Programme of the Government and IDB.  
</p>
<p>23. To ensure the independent monitoring of the conditions in detention and prison 
facilities, the Ministry of Home Affairs had established a visitation programme.  Prison 
Visiting Committees had also been established, comprising representatives of civil society 
who ensured justice for inmates and the protection of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>24. In response to advance questions, the delegation stated that human rights training 
was included in the curriculum of the training programmes for recruits of the Guyana 
Police Force, the Guyana Defence Force and the Guyana Prison Service. This aspect of 
training continued at the cadet level for police, army and prison staff. Representatives of the 
Guyana Human Rights Association had trained police recruits and officers in human rights. 
In 2006, through an agreement between the Government and UNDP, the Association had 
received funding for the production of a human rights training manual for the Guyana 
Police Force, based on international human rights treaties. Police instructors had been 
trained in the use of the manual, which was now included in the syllabus.  
</p>
<p>25. The delegation described the functions of the Police Complaints Authority, which 
investigated complaints against the police. The Office of Professional Responsibility of the 
Guyana Police Force and other internal mechanisms, including boards of inquiry, 
commissions and the Ministry of Home Affairs, also received and investigated complaints. 
The findings of the latter were posted on various websites. 
</p>
<p>26. In 2003 and 2004, the High-level Commission of Inquiry on the Disciplined Forces 
had held hearings to investigate allegations against the Disciplined Forces and made 164 
recommendations to Parliament. Those recommendations had been resubmitted to a 
parliamentary body, which was expected to complete its work by mid-2010. </p>


<p>27. The delegation stated that the second Commission of Inquiry investigating 
allegations of extrajudicial killings in 2004 and 2005 had vitiated the then Minister of 
Home Affairs, who had nevertheless resigned. The relevant report had included 
recommendations concerning the use of firearms and other force as well as a more 
transparent method of issuing firearms, and all of those recommendations had been 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>28. In relation to the advance questions regarding the case of Twyon Thomas in October 
2009 and the so-called Phantom Squad of 2002-2006, the delegation stated that to date, two 
police ranks had been charged and the Medical Doctor involved in the case had been 
censored by the Guyana Medical Council. Through proper leadership and supervision, 
coupled with the installation of security cameras, the police interrogation would be 
monitored, and the allegations of the Phantom Squad were currently being investigated. 
One of the cases was currently before the Court. The delegation stated that, despite severe 
challenges to and within the security sector, many interventions continued to bear fruit, and 
that Guyana remained committed to ensuring public safety and the protection of the rights 
of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>29. The delegation stated that, while Guyana remained committed to complying with all 
its treaty obligations, it did not possess sufficient human and financial resources to staff a 
department for that purpose.  It had, however, established a unit to work towards complying 
with outstanding reporting obligations by the end of 2010. 
</p>
<p>30. The delegation indicated that, as Guyana strived to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals and to carry out its Poverty Reduction Strategy, it would need to make 
critical choices with respect to where its scarce resources &#8211; especially financial resources -- 
should be directed. In that regard, the delegation stated that such choices included building 
a new school to cater for added enrolment or providing lunch for hinterland schoolchildren, 
as opposed to rehabilitating a prison. Both were issues of human rights, but those 
concerning children were of priority. 
</p>
<p>31. Guyana was also required to deal with the effects of climate change by allocating 
scarce resources to the installation of critical infrastructure to protect its coast, as well as 
the provision of assistance to farmers whose crops had been lost or who had been otherwise 
affected by adverse weather patterns. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the interactive dialogue, 32 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. Delegations 
welcomed the national report, which had been drafted as a result of national consultation 
and commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, as well as to the 
universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>33. Algeria highlighted the adoption of the Inclusive Governance Model, aimed at 
reducing violence by ensuring the participation of all stakeholders in matters affecting 
them. It noted with satisfaction efforts aimed at promoting food security and alleviating the 
impact of the global economic crisis and climate change. It added that Guyana had been 
able to move from least-developed-country status to low-middle-income status in 2006, and 
asked for further information about the programme to address violence against women, 
entitled &#8220;Stamp It Out&#8221;. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. India commended Guyana on notable efforts to reconstruct the country and 
consolidate its democracy. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Programme had contributed 
substantially to the reduction of poverty. As for education, India requested further 
information about measures being taken to address high drop-out rates.  India encouraged </p>


<p>Guyana to establish an independent national human rights institution in full compliance 
with the Paris Principles. India also encouraged Guyana to consider ratifying the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the two Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.   
</p>
<p>35. Brazil noted the establishment of commissions on ethnic relations, women and 
gender equality, the rights of the child, indigenous peoples, and human rights, as well as the 
positive measures to eliminate hunger and to promote food security, Guyana&#8217;s housing 
programme, and the country&#8217;s increased capacity to offer social services. Brazil 
commended the Government on having launched a poverty reduction strategy and a 
national development strategy. Brazil also noted challenges in areas of education, health, 
food, ill treatment and discrimination. Brazil expressed concern about reports of ill 
treatment by police forces, the lack of respect for equality between women and men, and 
discrimination against Afro-Guyanese. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Cuba congratulated Guyana on its efforts to ensure basic human rights such as 
health, education and food. It stated that cultural, religious and ethnic diversity was 
protected in the Constitution, which also provided for the rights of indigenous people. Free 
health care services had resulted notably in a drastic decrease in the infant mortality rate 
and in a high immunization rate for children. Cuba acknowledged the priority placed by 
Guyana on the right to food and highlighted measures taken to alleviate the impact of 
climate change. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. China noted that Guyana had prioritized issues such as combating poverty and 
climate change. China appreciated the progress made in promoting cultural diversity, 
fighting hunger, protecting the right to food and improving children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rights.  
China noted that Guyana had ensured free public health, asking about the experience and 
good practices in that regard.  
</p>
<p>38. Norway noted Guyana&#8217;s commitment to promoting the rights of indigenous peoples.  
Norway also welcomed legislation that provided for the statutory legitimacy of an 
independent national human rights commission and an independent national indigenous 
peoples&#8217; commission.  Norway noted the bilateral cooperation with Guyana covering 
governance, development and forest-related issues. Norway highlighted the fact that a 
constructive public discourse was an asset to policy development, and encouraged Guyana 
to benefit from the engagement and interest shown by actors in adjusting and improving the 
consultations.  Norway stated that transparency and inclusiveness were important qualities 
of any effective policy development process. Norway made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>39. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted the steps taken by Guyana to promote and 
enhance human rights in spite of difficulties and challenges such as the scarcity of the 
population and the lack of expertise. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Netherlands was concerned about reports of the excessive use of force by the 
army and police forces, asking whether measures to ensure independent investigations were 
being considered.  It welcomed the Sexual Offences Bill of 2009 as well as the introduction 
of a National Domestic Violence Policy, and requested further information about the 
implementation of the Policy.  It was concerned about violence and discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Hungary commended Guyana for efforts made in improving its democratic 
institutions, particularly its poverty reduction strategy programmes for the most vulnerable 
peoples, which had contributed to the overall well-being of its citizens.  Hungary made 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>42. Chile valued the fact that international human rights instruments had been 
incorporated into domestic law and could be invoked in courts. It emphasized the progress </p>


<p>made in building schools, hospitals and health centres. Chile echoed the concerns expressed 
by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women regarding domestic 
violence. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Slovenia welcomed Guyana&#8217;s efforts aimed at poverty reduction and access to health 
care, including HIV testing and treatment.  Slovenia also noted with satisfaction the 
resulting increase in life expectancy and the reduction in the infant, under-five and maternal 
mortality rates.  Slovenia also welcomed the Government&#8217;s efforts to further protect the 
rights of the child, requesting additional information about the draft legislation under 
preparation concerning that issue. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Nicaragua highlighted Guyana&#8217;s ongoing process of reviewing its national policies 
and its legal framework in order to strengthen democracy and its law and to guarantee the 
full enjoyment of all human rights. Nicaragua highlighted citizens&#8217; participation and 
exercise in democracy as one of the principal guarantees for the achievement of an 
egalitarian society in Guyana. Nicaragua commended the various programmes implemented 
to make progress towards development, to eradicate poverty and to consolidate its model of 
participatory democracy. Nicaragua made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. Spain highlighted the existence in Guyana of a de facto moratorium on the death 
penalty since 1997. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. France welcomed legislative measures and specific mechanisms for the processing 
of complaints by victims of police abuse, but remained concerned at reported excessive use 
of force by the police. France inquired about how Guyana intended to stop that practice and 
ensure that complaints would lead to impartial investigations and prosecutions of alleged 
offenders whenever relevant. France noted that courts were continuing to pronounce death 
sentences, although no executions had taken place since 1997. France made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Pakistan noted policies aimed at the well-being of Guyanese peoples in all spheres, 
particularly food, housing, water, social security, health, education and culture.  Pakistan 
also noted Guyana&#8217;s Low-Carbon Development Strategy, which offered a sustainable 
development model while contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions globally.  
Pakistan appreciated consultation with national stakeholders on all Government policies, an 
important feature of governance in the country aimed at maintaining visibility, accessibility, 
transparency and accountability. Pakistan asked about the status, competence and 
composition of the five human rights commissions established under the revised 
Constitution. Pakistan agreed with the principle that the exercise of each freedom comes 
with certain responsibilities, noting that the Guyanese Constitution provided for certain 
limitations on freedom of expression. Pakistan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>48. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) appreciated the participatory and inclusive model of 
governance currently promoted by the Government. It highlighted the positive measures 
adopted to eliminate hunger and promote food security while bearing in mind a sustainable 
environment. It noted the considerable efforts made to eradicate poverty, which had 
reduced maternal mortality and increased life expectancy. Bolivia inquired about Guyana&#8217;s 
experience relating to cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. Bolivia encouraged 
Guyana to recognize all rights of indigenous peoples, notably by amending the Amerindian 
Act of 2006 to include the right to land. Bolivia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Canada noted with appreciation Guyana&#8217;s efforts to reduce youth unemployment, 
such as the Single Parent Assistance Programme. However, it noted with concern reports of 
the excessive use of force by security forces and the recent documented torture of 15-year-
old Twyon Thomas by police officers. Canada also expressed concerned about alleged 
murders and extrajudicial killings allegedly committed by members of the armed forces and 
the &#8220;Phantom Squad&#8221;. Canada made recommendations. </p>


<p>50. Mexico recognized Guyana&#8217;s efforts aimed at social security, the right to health, and 
poverty reduction. While highlighting the relevance of establishing five legislative 
commissions for human rights, Mexico underscored the importance of establishing an 
independent mechanism in conformity with the Paris Principles. Mexico noted the 
difficulties concerning the effective application of international human rights standards, 
suggesting that Guyana seek technical assistance from international and regional 
organizations for adequate implementation. Mexico expressed appreciation for the 
information provided by Guyana concerning the land property rights of indigenous 
communities, requesting additional information about efforts to be made to ensure the 
participation of indigenous women in political processes. Mexico made recommendations.     
</p>
<p>51. Germany acknowledged the achievements made relating to the trafficking in human 
beings and inquired how those efforts had contributed to the protection of victims. While 
echoing what the national report had stated about the importance of the right to water, 
Germany asked about the challenges faced in developing and implementing a national 
policy and a legal and institutional framework and strategies regarding access to drinking 
water and on waste management. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. The delegation of Guyana responded to issues raised during the dialogue. It took 
note of the issues raised in relation to corporal and capital punishment, as well as the 
criminalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, and reiterated that those 
issues would take time to address and would require widespread consultation. With regard 
to the international human rights instruments that had not been ratified, many of them were 
being actively considered for ratification. Concerning health services, the delegation 
indicated that such services were free, without any distinction between nationals and non-
nationals. This would not have been possible without the assistance of Cuba, as the first 100 
Guyanese- trained doctors had arrived from Cuba, with an additional 600 students 
expected. These new doctors would transform the health services. The delegation stated 
that protecting the rights of indigenous people was of paramount importance and that those 
rights, including the right to land, were included in the Amerindian Act. The political 
representation of indigenous women was important, and, as of December 2009, three out of 
the six women in the Cabinet were indigenous women. The delegation also indicated that 
indigenous women occupied positions in the various administrative structures. In relation to 
the Low-Carbon Development Strategy, the delegation reiterated that it had been initiated 
following broad consultation. With respect to domestic violence, the delegation indicated 
that, as a result of the various measures already indicated by the Government, there was an 
increased willingness on the part of people to appear in court, but the issue required 
continued effort. As regards the media, the delegation indicated that the private sector 
controlled the television media, with only one Government-owned station. It reiterated that 
Guyana was a free-press country. In terms of radio broadcasting licences, the delegation 
provided the assurance that, as a result of an agreement with the opposition party to place a 
hold on the issuance of new licences until broadcast legislation had been adopted, the new 
Broadcast Bill, coupled with a new Telecommunications Act and Commission, was 
expected to be considered this year in the National Assembly. The delegation recalled 
measures relating to the modernization of the police force and the manner in which the 
administration of justice took place. In terms of pre-trial detention, no one could be held for 
longer than 72 hours unless an order of court was issued in that regard. With respect to 
detainees awaiting trial, the delegation recalled efforts to reduce the backlog of court cases. 
As for the appointment of independent commissions, the delegation described in detail the 
methodology for appointing the human rights commissions from among civil society, 
which would act as independent complaint mechanisms. This also applied to boards and 
commissions of inquiry investigating allegations of abuse, excessive force and torture.    
</p>
<p>53. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland believed it important

discrimination.  Australia expressed concern about allegations of police brutality and the 
incarceration and torture of minors. Australia also expressed regret at the maintenance of

</p>

violence and exploitation against vulnerable groups, particularly children; women; lesbian, </p>


<p>gay, bisexual and transgender people; and indigenous communities. The United States 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>62. Jamaica stated that Guyana enjoyed very close relations with it both bilaterally and

</p>
<p>63. Trinidad and Tobago stated that Guyana had sought to progressively address 
historical wrongs and forms of exclusion to ensure that its people could freely exercise their 
human rights. It commended Guyana for the legislation permitting the titled ownership of 
land by indigenous peoples, and measures for their better integration into Guyanese society. 
It also noted the establishment of several parliamentary commissions in relation to human 
rights. Trinidad and Tobago also appreciated the prudent approach taken to supplant 
conflict and contention with conversation and consensus; the review of the age of criminal 
responsibility; the development of comprehensive empirical studies to assess the incidence 
of prostitution within the secondary school system; and the design and implementation of 
intervention strategies to reduce and eliminate the sexual exploitation of all children.     
</p>
<p>64. Slovakia commended Guyana for the establishment of five parliamentary 
commissions dedicated to human rights. However, it commented that capital punishment 
was mandatory for the most serious crimes and that new death sentences had continued to 
be handed down even in 2009, despite a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 
</p><p>1997.  Slovakia mentioned the concerns expressed and observations made by the

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Haiti referred to the progress achieved and challenges faced in protecting human 
rights, welcoming the fact that international instruments could be invoked in courts. Haiti 
referred to the 2006 report of the Independent Expert on minorities, which indicated that 
Afro-Guyanese people could not fully participate in political life and did not fully enjoy 
equal rights in various areas. Haiti asked what measures had been taken to tackle those 
issues. Haiti made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. The delegation of Guyana responded to issues raised during the interactive dialogue. 
In relation to discrimination against the indigenous community, the delegation reiterated 
that there was a specific ministry and specific legislation to ensure that issues relating to 
indigenous communities were addressed. Some sections of society believed that too much 
was being done, and there was thus a need to strike a delicate balance. If there was any 
discrimination, it was positive discrimination to close the gap due to historical neglect. In 
relation to the employment of Afro-Guyanese persons, the delegation reiterated that there 
was no policy against any particular group and disagreed with the report of the United 
Nations Independent Expert on minorities, as adumbrated in Guyana&#8217;s response.  
</p>
<p>67. With respect to extrajudicial killings, in recent times there had been considerable 
improvement. Concerning the issue of child prostitution, the delegation indicated that 
Guyana did not have widespread child prostitution. Regarding the issue of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender persons, there was some degree of tolerance, but there remained a 
need for education and awareness, and that would take time. The delegation thanked 
Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago for their respective statements. With regard to the low 
age of criminal responsibility, the delegation noted that a draft Juvenile Justice Bill was 
being contemplated, reiterating that facilities were being completed to separate juvenile 
prisoners. In relation to the issuance of standing invitations, the delegation indicated that </p>


<p>the existing process had worked thus far and that Guyana intended to continue in that 
regard.
