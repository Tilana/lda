<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to resolution S-9/1 adopted by the Council at its ninth special 
session held on 9 and 12 January 2009, convened following the launch of Israeli military 
operations in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. This is the first periodic report by the High Commissioner mandated by Council 
resolution S-9/1, in which the Council requested the High Commissioner &#8220;to report on the 
violations of human rights of the Palestinian people by the occupying Power, Israel, by ... 
submitting periodic reports to the Council&#8221; on the implementation of the resolution (para. 11). 
The present report focuses on some of the key concerns of OHCHR in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (OPT) covering the period of the Israeli military operations in Gaza codenamed &#8220;Cast 
Lead&#8221; to 10 April 2009.  
</p>
<p>3. As mandated by paragraphs 2 and 10 of the resolution, OHCHR will focus on the impact 
of military operations on civilians and on respect for the rules of international humanitarian law 
and international human rights law by all duty bearers. This report complements the other reports 
on the Gaza operations that were mandated by resolution S-9/1;<b>1</b> it also deals with the situation 
in the West Bank (reference to which in this report includes occupied East Jerusalem).  
</p>
<p>4. During the reporting period, the OHCHR Office in the OPT developed a human rights 
monitoring framework and has commenced with its implementation. Thus, OHCHR will include 
analysis based on monitoring of selected human rights cases in the OPT in future reporting.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/HRC/10/20 and A/HRC/10/22, which have already been presented to the Council, 
</p>
<p>and a forthcoming report by the independent fact-finding mission headed by 
Justice Richard Goldstone. In addition, a summary of the report by the United Nations 
Headquarters Board of Inquiry into incidents in Gaza, mandated by the Secretary-General and 
led by Ian Martin, was shared with the President of the Security Council on 4 May 2009 
(A/63/855-S/2009/250).  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>5. Israel, as a State party to many of the core international human rights conventions,<b>2</b> 
continues to bear responsibility for implementing its human rights obligations in the OPT.<b>3</b>   
</p>
<p>6. A situation of armed conflict or occupation does not release a State from its conventional 
human rights obligations. The International Court of Justice, United Nations human rights treaty 
bodies, successive High Commissioners for Human Rights and special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights and its successor, the Human Rights Council, consistently have 
averred that international human rights law and international humanitarian law apply 
concurrently in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Notably, in its Advisory Opinion on the 
Wall, the International Court of Justice pointed out that Israel remains bound by its obligations 
under several international human rights treaties.<b>4</b> The Court also noted that Israel&#8217;s obligations 
under ICESCR include &#8220;an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in 
those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities&#8221;.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>7. The Palestinian Authority (PA), the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the 
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) have made numerous statements and undertakings through 
which they have declared themselves bound by international human rights obligations.<b>6</b> With 
respect to Hamas, it is worth recalling that non-State actors that exercise government-like 
functions and control over a territory are obliged to respect human rights norms when their 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Israel is a party to six of the nine core international human rights treaties. Israel ratified the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination on 
3 January 1979 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on 3 October 1991. 
<b>3
</b>  An examination of the concluding observations of various United Nations treaty bodies, as 
</p>
<p>well as the <i>Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory</i> (Advisory Opinion on the Wall) issued by the International 
Court of Justice on 9 July 2004, confirms this view. See A/HRC/8/17, para. 7; CAT/C/ISR/CO/4, 
para. 11; and footnote 5 below. 
<b>4
</b>  Advisory Opinion on the Wall, paras. 102-113, where the Court concluded that the protection 
</p>
<p>offered by human rights conventions do not cease in cases of armed conflict and that ICCPR, 
ICESCR and CRC are applicable in respect of individuals within the jurisdiction of a State, even 
concerning those individuals under its jurisdiction outside its own territory.

</b>  Advisory Opinion on the Wall, para. 112. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See A/HRC/8/17, para 8. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>conduct affects the human rights of the individuals under their control.<b>7</b> Hamas has also made 
public statements that it is committed to respect international human rights and humanitarian 
law.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>8. The cardinal principles of customary international humanitarian law concerning the 
protection of civilians in the conduct of hostilities - including the principles of distinction 
between civilians and combatants, between civilian objects and military objectives, 
proportionality and precautions in attack, humane treatment of those not or no longer taking part 
in hostilities but finding themselves in the power of a party to the conflict - are applicable to all 
parties of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition, rules of international humanitarian law regarding military occupation, in 
particular the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 
(Fourth Geneva Convention), must be applied by Israel, as the occupying Power, in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Though Israel has put forward arguments disputing the 
application of this convention, the situation remains one of military occupation, as recognized by 
the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.<b>9</b> In addition to the 
applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention, The Hague Regulations (annexed to the 1907 
Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land), which are accepted as customary 
international law, apply to the OPT.   
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  By way of example, in the joint report on Lebanon and Israel, a group of four special 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs concluded that &#8220;Although Hezbollah, a non-State actor, cannot become a party to 
these human rights treaties, it remains subject to the demand of the international community, first 
expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that every organ of society respect and 
promote human rights .... It is especially appropriate and feasible to call for an armed group to 
respect human rights norms when it &#8216;exercises significant control over territory and population 
and has an identifiable political structure&#8217;.&#8221; Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston; the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt; the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced persons, 
Walter K&#228;lin; and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, Miloon Kothari (A/HRC/2/7), para. 19, citing the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (E/CN.4/2005/7), para. 76.

</p>
<p><b>III. REPORTED VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN 
LAW DURING THE GAZA MILITARY OPERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 27 December 2008, Israel launched a large-scale aerial and naval offensive on the 
Gaza Strip, &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;. A ground offensive, which began on 3 January 2009, 
followed the air and naval strikes. The hostilities lasted 22 days, until Israel announced a 
unilateral ceasefire on 17 January and put it in force on 18 January. Hamas and other Palestinian 
factions and groups (except the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine), which prior to and 
during Operation Cast Lead had fired rockets and mortars into Israel,<b>10</b> also declared unilateral 
ceasefires on the same day. Israeli troops subsequently withdrew from the Gaza Strip, but, as at 
the time of the writing of this report, no lasting agreement has been reached between the two 
sides, and the situation remains volatile.  
</p>
<p>11. Estimates vary as to the exact number of Palestinian civilians killed and injured during 
the operation: according to various sources, between approximately 1,200 and 1,400 civilians 
were killed and about 5,300 were injured.<b>11</b> According to PCHR, while 236 of those killed 
were reportedly combatants, an additional 255 were members of the civilian police force 
and the remaining 926 were civilians.<b>12</b> The Government of Israel, on the other hand, has 
stated<b>13</b> that, according to the data gathered by the Research Department of IDF Intelligence, 
at least 709 were combatants, though this number reportedly includes police officers, who 
are classified as civilians under international law.<b>14</b> The Government of Israel is further

</b>  During the six-month truce between Israel and Hamas, the <i>tahdiya</i>, which started on 18 June 
</p>
<p>and ended on 19 December 2008, a total of 223 rockets and 139 mortar shells were fired at 
Israel. See Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel, &#8220;The Hamas terror war against Israel&#8221;, 
21 July 2009, at www.mfa.gov.il. During the 22 days of Operation Cast Lead, 571 rockets and 
205 mortars landed in Israel, according to the Ministry. (&#8220;Operation Cast Lead: Israel strikes 
back against Hamas terror in Gaza, 21 January 2009, ibid.).

</b></p>
<p>  Police officers may be regarded as combatants if they participate directly in hostilities. The 
information available to OHCHR indicates that most of the police officers were killed in the 
first day of air attacks, including as a result of an Israeli missile attack targeting the police 
headquarters in Gaza City during preparations for a graduation ceremony for regular civilian and 
traffic police, see e.g. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Protection of 
Civilians Weekly Report, 24-31 December 2008. </p>

<p>reported as having stated that a total of 295 Palestinian non-combatants died during the 
operation, 89 of them under the age of 16 and 49 of them women, the Army added.<b>15</b>  
</p>
<p>12. According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in the 
course of the military operation, 4 of them in &#8220;friendly fire&#8221; incidents, and 336 were wounded. In 
southern Israel, during the operation, 4 Israeli civilians were killed and 182 were injured 
(ranging from serious injuries to those attributable to shock) due to rockets and mortar shells 
fired at Israel from Gaza.<b>16</b>   
</p>
<p>13. In a letter dated 4 May 2009, the Government of Israel provided OHCHR with information 
regarding five IDF investigations that had been conducted into the conduct of Israeli forces 
during the hostilities in Gaza, in connection with a number of specific incidents. In each of the 
investigations, it was concluded that IDF had operated in accordance with international law. 
Some of the investigations recommended a revision of existing methods and/or further 
examinations. The IDF Spokesperson&#8217;s Unit has stated that there is also a central operational 
IDF investigation of the entire operation being conducted, which will be concluded by 
June 2009.<b>17</b>  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Alleged breaches of the principle of distinction and indiscriminate attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>Distinction between civilians and combatants 
</b></p>
<p>14. The reports of civilians being attacked by Israeli forces are numerous,<b>18</b> and some of these 
have been reported previously by a number of special rapporteurs.<b>19</b> The present report wishes to 
highlight, in particular, the following reported cases. 
</p>
<p>15. On 3 January, in the al Zaytoun area of Gaza City, Israeli soldiers approached a family 
house and shot the male head of the household while he had both hands in the air and his identity

<p>documents in one hand. The soldiers then proceeded to fire indiscriminately into the house until 
everyone was on the floor, injuring the mother and four of the children, one of them fatally.<b>20</b>  
16. In one of the gravest incidents during the offensive, on 4 January, Israeli soldiers ordered 
over 100 Palestinians into a single house in the al Zaytoun area of Gaza City, allegedly warning 
them to stay indoors. Approximately 24 hours later, Israeli forces reportedly shelled the house 
repeatedly, killing about 23 people. Some of those who survived the attack walked 2 kilometres 
to a busy road in Gaza City, where they were able to find transportation in civilian vehicles to 
hospital.<b>21</b>    
</p>
<p>17. On 7 January, Israeli soldiers reportedly ordered an entire family out of their home in 
eastern Jabalia, a site of frequent Israeli incursions before the latest offensive. The six-member 
family allegedly walked out of the house carrying four white flags, and were told to stand in 
front of a tank. After approximately five minutes, a soldier allegedly suddenly opened fire, 
killing two of the children and injuring two other family members. The family&#8217;s home was 
subsequently demolished.<b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to allegations of indiscriminate attacks by Palestinian militants, during the 
Israeli offensive, 571 rockets and 205 mortars landed in Israel.<b>23</b> As noted above, 4 Israeli 
civilians were killed and 182 injured due to rockets and mortar shells fired from Gaza during the 
offensive, in which no attempt was made to distinguish between military and non-military 
objects. In January 2009, as an increasing number of Palestinian rockets hit Ashkelon, Israeli 
officials reported that up to 40 per cent of the city&#8217;s 122,000 inhabitants had felt forced to move 
to other parts of Israel. Sderot and villages in the area were similarly affected.<b>24</b> Indiscriminate 
rocket attacks continue as of the finalization of this report, endangering the right to life of 
individuals living in southern Israel.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR is not yet in a position to assess, in each and every individual instance, whether 
there has been a breach of international humanitarian law. However, in the above and other 
cases, there is significant prima facie evidence of serious violations of international humanitarian

<p>law having been committed by the Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. Under international 
humanitarian law, parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and 
combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. Indiscriminate attacks are 
prohibited.  
</p>
<p><b>Distinction between civilian objects and military objectives 
</b>20. The Israeli military targeted and damaged numerous civilian administrative facilities, 
including buildings of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
Ministry of Justice, prisons and police stations, despite its obligations under international 
humanitarian law to respect such facilities.<b>26</b> In addition, the Israeli military damaged a wide 
range of civilian constructions, including an estimated 21,000 private homes<b>27</b> hospitals, schools 
(including those operated by the United Nations), universities, factories, businesses and 
mosques.<b>28</b>   
</p>
<p>21. By way of example, on 5 January 2009, Israeli forces bombed from the air the al-Raeiya 
medical centre near a large hospital in Gaza City. The centre was clearly marked as a medical 
facility, and there are no military or even governmental buildings in its vicinity.<b>29</b> The Al-Quds 
medical centre, run by the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza City, caught fire after it was 
hit, putting at risk the lives of around 100 patients and the medical staff caring for them.<b>30</b> 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15 of Gaza&#8217;s 27 hospitals suffered 
damage, among them Al-Wafa rehabilitation hospital, which is Gaza&#8217;s only rehabilitation 
hospital.<b>31</b>  
</p>
<p>22. Even facilities marked clearly as being operated by the United Nations were damaged, 
including schools run by the United Nations Relief and World Agency for Palestine Refugees in 
the Near East (UNRWA), some of which were serving as emergency shelters, and health centres. 
On 5 January 2009, the Asma Elementary School run by UNRWA was hit by Israeli shelling,

<p>resulting in the death of three persons.<b>32</b> On 6 January, another UNRWA school, the Jabalia 
Preparatory Boys School and its immediate vicinity, was hit, resulting in the death of an 
estimated 30-40 persons.<b>33</b> On 15 January, the main UNRWA compound in Gaza was hit by 
Israeli shells, resulting in the destruction of vehicles, foodstuffs and other humanitarian supplies, 
and approximately 6,500 square metres of warehouse space. Approximately 700 Palestinians 
fleeing Israeli attacks had been receiving shelter in this compound.<b>34</b> The Israeli Defence 
Minister reportedly stated that Hamas militants had opened fire at Israeli Armed Forces from 
areas adjacent to the United Nations facilities, and that the shelling was in self-defence.<b>35</b> 
Subsequently, however, he reportedly apologized for the attack, calling it a &#8220;grave mistake&#8221;.<b>36</b>   
</p>
<p>23. On 11 February 2009, the Secretary-General appointed a United Nations 
Headquarters Board of Inquiry to review and investigate nine incidents that occurred between 
27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 at United Nations premises in Gaza causing death, 
injury or damage. Of the nine incidents it investigated, the Board of Inquiry found IDF 
responsible for casualties and damages in seven incidents. In one incident it determined that the 
most serious damage was caused by a Palestinian rocket most likely fired by Hamas, and in the 
final incident it said it was unable to reach a conclusion as to which party was responsible.<b>37</b>  
</p>
<p>24. Israel has alleged that civilians and civilian infrastructure were impermissibly used by 
combatants in Gaza on a wide scale during the conflict,<b>38</b> and at least one IDF report contains a

<p>that either there was no large-scale abuse of civilians and civilian objects by combatants, or that 
civilians&#8217; deaths could not be explained as resulting from the presence of fighters in civilian 
areas.<b>40</b>    
</p>
<p>25. Any civilian object becomes a legitimate military objective only if, by its nature, location, 
purpose or use, it makes an effective contribution to military action, and if its total or partial 
destruction in the circumstances ruling at the time offers a definite military advantage. Yet, even 
if an object loses its essentially civilian character, the attacker must still refrain from any attack 
that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to 
civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage anticipated. Moreover, article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
prohibits, unless absolutely necessary by military operations, &#8220;[a]ny destruction by the 
Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private 
persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>26. Israel asserts that it took measures to warn the civilian population of Gaza of imminent 
attacks, including through the dropping of leaflets, recorded telephone calls and text messages to 
mobile phones during the conflict. The accuracy and general effectiveness of these warnings 
have been called into question.<b>41</b> In any event, the use of such warnings does not discharge Israel 
of the duty to consider the proportionality of any attack on a target which may include civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>Alleged use of white phosphorous 
</b></p>
<p>27. IDF used white phosphorous, a substance with a highly incendiary effect, in densely 
populated, built-up areas of Gaza City.<b>42</b> The use of munitions containing phosphorous is not, as 
such, prohibited under international law, in particular for marking and smokescreen purposes. 
However, the use of white phosphorus in airburst method over densely populated areas is 
inevitably indiscriminate, insofar as its wide dispersal means that it is impossible to direct it 
towards only military targets.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reported failure to protect medical personnel and to evacuate the wounded  
</b></p>
<p>28. There are reports of failures on the part of the Israeli military to meet its obligation under 
international humanitarian law to protect medical personnel and to care for and evacuate the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>wounded.<b>43</b> Following Israeli shelling in the al Zaytoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, the Israeli 
military not only refrained from assisting the wounded, but also hindered ICRC and the Palestine 
Red Crescent from doing so for several days. The ICRC considered the delay in allowing rescue 
services access unacceptable.<b>44</b> International humanitarian law is clear in that the protection of 
hospitals and medical teams shall not cease &#8220;unless they are used to commit, outside their 
humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy&#8221;.<b>45</b> ICRC made it clear during the conflict that it 
must be possible to evacuate wounded at all times.<b>46</b>   
</p>
<p><b>C.  Border closure 
</b></p>
<p>29. Apart from limited openings, including to facilitate medical evacuation of seriously injured 
persons, all borders of Gaza remained closed during the military operation, preventing any 
persons from fleeing the area. The 1.5 million people of Gaza were therefore trapped in 
360 square kilometres, caught in a major military operation with no possibility of fleeing to 
safety. Had the closure of the border not been maintained, civilian deaths may have been far 
lower. It is an established principle that civilians need to be able to flee from hostilities, 
including from indiscriminate attacks that affect civilians. Under the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to 
his country (art. 13, para. 2),<b>47</b> and everyone has the right to seek asylum (art. 14, para. 1). 
During the height of the conflict, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reminded 
neighbouring States of their obligation to respect the universal right of those fleeing war to seek 
safety in other States and asked that all borders and access routes be kept open and safe.<b>48</b> 
However, such calls were ignored, and the borders of the Gaza Strip remained closed throughout 
the conflict.

</p>
<p><b>IV. REPORTED VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IN GAZA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Blockade 
</b></p>
<p>30. During the reporting period, Israel continued its blockade<b>49</b> of the border crossings into 
Gaza, restricting severely all imports and exports. Insofar as it constitutes collective punishment 
of all persons in Gaza, including the civilian population, the blockade is itself a violation of 
international humanitarian law.<b>50</b> The military operation and the continued blockade have had 
severe cumulative effects on the realization of a wide range of economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as civil and political rights of the Gaza population.  
</p>
<p>31. Though most international attention has focused on the restrictions on imports into Gaza, it 
should be noted that the Government of Israel has also prohibited exports from Gaza. Since 
June 2007, the Government of Israel had permitted only a total of 13 truckloads of cut flowers to 
be exported from Gaza. Exports from Gaza have been banned since Hamas took power in Gaza 
in June 2007,<b>51</b> with no justification.  
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>49
</b>  In the period prior to Operation Cast Lead, imports into Gaza remained constrained to very 
</p>
<p>basic food items and limited amounts of fuel, animal feed, and medical and hygiene supplies. 
See OCHA, The Humanitarian Monitor, No. 32, December 2008, p. 4. During Operation Cast 
Lead, a daily three-hour suspension of hostilities was introduced which temporarily eased the 
situation of the civilian population but which was not sufficient (OCHA, Protection of Civilians 
Report, 1-8 January 2009 and UNICEF, &#8220;During short ceasefire, some life-saving supplies 
delivered in Gaza&#8221;, 7 January 2009).  
<b>50
</b></p>
<p>  Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that &#8220;[n]o protected person may be 
punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties ... are 
prohibited&#8221;. Article 50 of the Regulations of the Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of 
War on Land (The Hague IV) of 18 October 1907 states that &#8220;[n]o general penalty, pecuniary or 
otherwise, shall be inflicted upon the population on account of the acts of individuals for which 
they cannot be regarded as jointly and severally responsible&#8221;. When Israel imposed the blockade 
on Gaza, it justified the blockade on security grounds, stating that in the absence of security 
personnel loyal to the PA on the Gaza side of the crossings, it could not permit the opening of 
the Karni or Rafah crossings (letter from Asaf Barhel, Coordination for Government Activities in 
the Territories (IDF) to Noam Peleg of the Israeli non-governmental organization (NGO) Gisha 
in relation to the High Court Proceeding, 15 July 2007; see Gisha, &#8220;Gaza Closure Defined: 
Collective Punishment&#8221;, (December 2008). However, in September 2007 Israel&#8217;s Security 
Cabinet declared Gaza a &#8220;hostile territory&#8221;, and as a result decided that sanctions would be 
placed on the Hamas regime in order to restrict the passage of various goods to the Gaza Strip; 
reduce the supply of fuel and electricity; and restrict the movement of people to and from the 
Gaza Strip. (&#8220;Security Cabinet declares Gaza hostile territory&#8221;, 19 September 2007, available at 
www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2007/Security+Cabinet+declares+ 
Gaza+hostile+territory+19-Sep-2007.htm). 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  OCHA, Weekly Report on the Protection of Civilians, 18-24 March. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. The prohibition of exports has devastated the economy in Gaza and has prevented people 
from working to sustain their livelihoods and to realize their right to an adequate standard of 
living, as provided for in article 11 of the ICESCR. According to OCHA, 65 per cent of Gazans 
live below the poverty line, with 37 per cent living in extreme poverty.<b>52</b>   
</p>
<p>33. The nearly total prohibition of exports from Gaza continues to be accompanied by severe 
import restrictions, which prevent economic recovery and reconstruction in Gaza.<b>53</b> Among the 
many human rights negatively affected by these restrictions are the rights to adequate food, 
adequate housing, and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (articles 11 
and 12 of the ICESCR). 
</p>
<p>34. The supply of food in Gaza continues to be highly volatile, resulting in substantial price 
increases for basic necessities such as sugar, rice, poultry and cooking oil.<b>54</b> This situation is not 
an inevitable result of armed conflict; there is no shortage of humanitarian aid waiting to be 
delivered to Gaza. Rather, the situation is a direct result of the severe restrictions on the import 
of foodstuffs imposed by the Government of Israel, restrictions that have been described by 
OCHA as &#8220;unclear and often inconsistent&#8221;.<b>55</b> On 22 March, the Government of Israel announced 
that it will lift all restrictions on the entry of foodstuffs, provided that the source of the shipments 
has been approved by the Government of Israel. As of the writing of this report, it did not appear 
that this decision had been implemented. It should be stressed that the right to food is not 
primarily about the ability to receive food aid; rather, it is a requirement that persons be enabled 
to feed themselves and to sustain an adequate livelihood.  
</p>
<p>35. The realization of the right to adequate housing is continuously frustrated by the blockade 
on the Gaza Strip. The import of cement, for example, has been blocked consistently since 
November 2008, as it is feared by Israeli authorities that it could serve a &#8220;dual purpose&#8221;. 
However, cement is urgently needed in Gaza for the reconstruction of destroyed homes and 
buildings. It is also needed urgently for the reconstruction of water pipes that were destroyed 
during the Israeli offensive.  
</p>
<p>36. The right of Gazans to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health was negatively affected already before and during the Gaza military operation.<b>56</b> 
Subsequent to the hostilities, intra-Palestinian disputes between the ministries of health in 
Ramallah and Gaza resulted in a temporary halt of the Referral Abroad Department (responsible 
for processing patients who require medical treatment outside of the Gaza Strip), further 
hindering the provision of medical aid abroad. This issue has since been resolved through the

</p>
<p>establishment of a joint national referral committee.<b>57</b> The right to health of children, set out in 
article 24 of CRC, is of particular concern in Gaza. United Nations agencies, Ministry of Health 
officials and health NGOs report that rising poverty, unemployment and food insecurity, 
compounded by the conflict, have increased the threat of child malnutrition.<b>58</b> In January, 
UNICEF said that 10.3 per cent of Gazan children under 5 were stunted. 
</p>
<p>37. During Operation Cast Lead, affected individuals and NGOs filed two petitions with the 
Supreme Court of Israel.<b>59</b> The petitions sought orders for (a) IDF to be restrained from causing 
delays in evacuating the wounded in Gaza to hospitals (including through halting IDF attacks on 
ambulances and medical personnel); and (b) the blockage in the supply of electricity due to 
combat operations to be lifted to allow hospitals, clinics, the water system and the sewage system 
to function properly. The Court denied both petitions. In doing so it accepted explanations 
provided by IDF of the sufficiency of mechanisms it had recently established to facilitate 
transfers of wounded to Israel and efforts to repair electricity infrastructure and the provision of 
diesel oil. The Court concluded that: 
</p>
<p>[i]n view of the establishment and enhancement of the humanitarian mechanisms, which it 
may be assumed will prove their effectiveness, in view of the statement made to us that a 
serious effort will be made to improve the evacuation and treatment of the wounded, in 
view of the setting up of a clinic in the vicinity of the Erez crossing (and to the extent that 
the Palestinian side will also agree to the transfer of the wounded to Israel for treatment), it 
is to be hoped that the humanitarian mechanisms will operate properly in accordance with 
the obligations of the State of Israel. In these circumstances, we see no further reason to 
grant relief in the form of an order nisi at this time.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Extrajudicial executions 
</b>38. Reports indicate that the security forces of Hamas have conducted a large number of 
extrajudicial executions, beatings, torture and ill-treatment against alleged collaborators with 
Israeli forces, former PA security personnel and Fatah supporters, during and after the Israeli 
operation in Gaza. Most of the victims were reportedly abducted from their homes and later 
found dead or injured in isolated areas, or were found dead in the morgue of Gaza&#8217;s hospitals.<b>61</b> 
At least 32 Palestinians have allegedly been extrajudicially executed by the security forces of

<p><b>V. REPORTED VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IN THE WEST BANK, INCLUDING  
OCCUPIED EAST JERUSALEM 
</b></p>
<p>39. During the reporting period, the human rights situation in the West Bank continued to be 
critical, primarily as a result of reported violations committed by Israel, but also due to a rise in 
alleged violations of rights of political opponents, committed in a context of continued political 
separation between PA and Hamas.  
</p>
<p><b>A. Alleged arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial  
executions and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>40. During the reporting period, Israeli forces continued to conduct military operations in the 
West Bank, with the purpose of detaining persons suspected of involvement in activities against 
Israeli security as per an Israeli military order.<b>65</b> This military order has been criticized for its 
vagueness at different levels.<b>66</b> In the month of March alone, more than 120 operations of this 
nature took place, resulting in the arrest of more than 300 Palestinians.<b>67</b> Individuals are 
generally detained in Israel including under administrative detention orders. Administrative 
detention in Israel is conducted on the basis of an administrative order issued by a military 
commander, as opposed to a judicial decision, and there is no indictment or trial. There are often 
strict restrictions on access to counsel, and usually neither the detainees nor their counsels are 
allowed to examine the evidence against them. This being the case, it cannot be said that 
administrative detainees have a meaningful opportunity to challenge their detention.<b>68</b> Israel 
justifies administrative detention based on article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>41. In the OPT, the Israeli military order allowing administrative detention states that persons 
can be detained for up to six months, with the possibility of indefinite extension (to be decided 
by the military commander in the region) where there is a &#8220;reasonable basis for believing that the 
security of the region or public safety&#8221; so requires.<b>69</b> In a letter to an Israeli NGO dated 
21 January 2009, the Government of Israel stated that there were 546 Palestinians being detained 
under administrative detention provisions. Of those 546, 42 had been detained for more than two 
years.<b>70</b> The number of administrative detainees declined steadily throughout 2008, from 813 in 
January to the aforementioned 546 in December.<b>71</b> By 31 March 2009, there were 506 
administrative detainees in Israeli prisons, including 2 children, out of a total of 7,884 
Palestinians detained in Israel, of which 408 were children.<b>72</b>  
</p>
<p>42. The Israeli practice of administrative detention as described above is in violation of several 
provisions of article 9 of ICCPR, which prohibits arbitrary detention and states, inter alia, that 
&#8220;[a]nyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his arrest&#8221; 
and that &#8220;[a]nyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be &#8230; entitled to trial within a 
reasonable time or to release&#8221;. Although Israel has notified other States parties of its derogation 
from article 9 due to the existence of a state of emergency, the Human Rights Committee has 
expressed concern that the derogation limits the effectiveness of judicial review, thus 
endangering protection of other, non-derogable provisions of the Covenant.<b>73</b> More recently, in 
May 2009, the Committee against Torture reiterated its concern that administrative detention as 
practised by the Government of Israel does not conform to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and that it &#8220;deprives detainees of 
basic safeguards including the right to challenge the evidence which is the basis for the 
detention, warrants are not required, and the detainee may be de facto in incommunicado 
detention for an extended period, subject to renewal&#8221;.<b>74</b> The Human Rights Committee, in its

<p>  Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee on the second periodic report of 
Israel (CCPR/CO/78/ISR), para. 12. In its third periodic report to the Human Rights Committee, 
submitted in July 2008, the Government of Israel said that a state of emergency may be declared 
by the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) for a period of one year, a state which has been renewed 
annually since 1997 (CCPR/C/ISR/3, para. 157), and that the Government and the Knesset are 
working jointly to complete the needed legislative procedures required to end the state of 
emergency (ibid., para. 159).

<p>  Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture on the fourth periodic report of 
Israel (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4), para. 17.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 5 (1981) on derogations, has stated that measures taken under article 4 
should be of an &#8220;exceptional and temporary nature and may last only as long as the life of the 
nation concerned is threatened&#8221;.<b>75 </b> 
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
applies in the West Bank. Article 76 of the Convention states clearly that civilians &#8220;accused of 
offences shall be detained in the occupied country, and if convicted they shall serve their 
sentences therein&#8221;. Article 5 of the Convention also states that persons accused of offences, even 
those &#8220;engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State &#8230; shall nevertheless be treated 
with humanity, and in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial 
prescribed by the present Convention&#8221;.<b>76</b>  
</p>
<p>44. Cases of alleged torture of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons continue to be reported 
by human rights NGOs. These reports indicate that various methods of torture are used, 
including preventing access to toilet facilities, physical violence, binding in painful positions, 
and humiliation and threats. In addition, a large number of detainees are not able to receive visits 
from family members living in the West Bank and Gaza, who are refused entry into Israel.<b>77</b>  
</p>
<p>45. The PA security forces in the West Bank also reportedly continued to carry out arbitrary 
detention of persons accused of being supporters of Hamas or of collaborating with Israel.<b>78</b> 
Several senior political figures allegedly affiliated with Hamas were arrested in early March. 
According to the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), such incidents 
are increasing. Numerous cases have been documented of detainees tortured while in PA 
custody, sometimes resulting in death. ICHR reports that from December 2008 through 
February 2009, 60 complaints were received from Palestinians claiming that they were subjected 
to torture in PA detention, and that in February alone, four deaths in PA custody, apparently due 
to torture, were documented.<b>79</b> It is further worrisome that courts in Hebron and Gaza issued 
seven death sentences (five in the Gaza Strip and two in the West Bank) during the reporting 
period.<b>80</b>

<p>46. During the military offensive in Gaza, mass demonstrations took place in nearly every 
district of the West Bank, resulting in a large number of clashes with Israeli forces. On several 
occasions during the reporting period Israeli soldiers used rubber-coated metal bullets, sound 
bombs and tear gas canisters, resulting in the death of a total of five Palestinian demonstrators 
(three in December 2008 and two in January 2009) as well as the injury of numerous others. In 
another incident in March 2009, one demonstrator was reportedly critically injured after having 
sustained a head injury by one such bullet.<b>81</b> 
47. On 20 March 2009, Israeli law enforcement authorities reportedly prevented peaceful 
events marking the designation by the League of Arab States of East Jerusalem as the Capital of 
Arab Culture 2009. Israeli police officers dispersed crowds and confiscated flags, and arrested at 
least 10 persons.<b>82</b>  
</p>
<p>48. Journalists in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip perceived as being partial to the 
opposing party were reportedly subjected to various degrees of harassment, including arbitrary 
detention, according to a report released in January.<b>83</b> Several newspapers were allegedly 
prevented by PA from being printed and/or distributed in the West Bank, including two 
Gaza-based publications that had been banned by PA in 2007 on the grounds that they favoured 
Hamas.<b>84</b> In Gaza, there were several incidents in 2008 of Hamas authorities preventing several 
West Bank newspapers from being brought into the area.<b>85</b>  
</p>
<p>49. During December 2008 and January 2009, nine peaceful demonstrations organized in 
various parts of the West Bank were halted by PA (in the West Bank cities of Berzeit, Hebron 
and Ramallah). For example, on 28 December 2008, PA security forces reportedly used 
excessive force to prevent a demonstration that took place in the city of Hebron, resulting in the 
injury of several Palestinian demonstrators. On the same day, PA forces arrested 10 Palestinian 
protestors during a peaceful demonstration organized in Ramallah.<b>86</b>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Forced evictions and home demolitions 
</b></p>
<p>50. Forced evictions and building demolitions continued in the West Bank, including 
East Jerusalem and Area C.<b>87</b> From January through the end of April 2009, a total of 
72 structures were either demolished or sealed off and rendered unusable; 296 persons were 
consequently displaced and another 192 were affected in other ways, including through the loss 
of their main means of livelihood.<b>88</b>  
</p>
<p>51. East Jerusalem in particular is faced with a wave of new demolition orders.<b> </b>Since 1967, 
Israel has failed to provide Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem with adequate planning to 
meet natural population growth. While Palestinians face significant obstacles to legally build on 
the 13 per cent of East Jerusalem designated for Palestinian construction, Israeli settlements have 
flourished on the 35 per cent of land expropriated for them, in contravention of international law. 
This situation has resulted in a housing crisis for the Palestinian population characterized by a 
shortage in housing, widespread &#8220;illegal&#8221; construction in East Jerusalem and ensuing demolition 
by Israel of &#8220;illegal&#8221; Palestinian construction.<b>89</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Due to limitations of time and space this report will highlight only one of many urgent 
demolition threats, namely in the Silwan area of East Jerusalem, where the Jerusalem 
municipality has stated it wants to press forward with a plan to demolish some 90 Palestinian 
homes, reportedly to make way for an archaeological park. As a result, well over 1,000 persons 
would be forcibly displaced.<b>90</b>  
</p>
<p>53. The justification given by the Israeli authorities for home demolitions, particularly in 
East Jerusalem, is that the Palestinian residents had erected structures without building permits. 
Though neutral at first glance, there is ample evidence that the policy has a disproportionate 
effect on the Palestinian population, both in its formulation and its implementation. In its review 
of Israel&#8217;s report in 2007, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed 
concern regarding the &#8220;disproportionate targeting of Palestinians in house demolitions&#8221; and 
&#8220;[reiterated] its call for a halt to the demolition of Arab properties, particularly in East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>87
</b>  Israel controls both security matters and civil affairs, including planning and construction, in 
</p>
<p>Area C, which comprises almost 61 per cent of the West Bank. Given the interrelationship 
between Areas A and B, both of which are fragmented and surrounded by Area C, and Area C, 
the Israeli control of the latter affects not only the Palestinians whose homes are within it; it also 
affects the development prospects of every community in the West Bank and the interaction 
between these communities.

<p>and for respect for property rights irrespective of the ethnic or national origin of the owner&#8221;.<b>91</b> It 
should also be noted that the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights has stated that 
&#8220;instances of forced eviction are prima facie incompatible with the requirements of the Covenant 
and can only be justified in the most exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with relevant 
principles of international law&#8221;.<b>92</b> The Commission on Human Rights also adopted a resolution 
in 1993 in which it stated that &#8220;the practice of forced evictions constitutes a gross violation of 
human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing&#8221;.<b>93</b> 
</p>
<p>54. There are numerous other cases of threatened evictions or demolitions and OHCHR will be 
returning to this important issue in future reporting.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Settlements and settler violence 
</b></p>
<p>55. The question of forced evictions and home demolitions cannot be examined without due 
regard to the question of ongoing settlement activity.  
</p>
<p>56. On 27 January 2009, an Israeli NGO, Peace Now, released a report which confirmed that 
the number of new structures in the West Bank settlements and outposts had increased by 
69 per cent in 2008, compared to 2007.<b>94</b> According to OCHA, at the end of 2008, approximately 
around 485,000 settlers were residing in 121 settlements in the West Bank, including 195,000 
in 12 settlements in East Jerusalem.<b>95</b>  
</p>
<p>57. Settlement activity in the West Bank amounts to violations of numerous humanitarian law 
provisions. Article 55 of the Hague Regulations states that the &#8220;occupying State shall be 
regarded only as administrator and usufructuary of public buildings, real estate, forests, and 
agricultural estates&#8221;. Furthermore, article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates 
specifically that &#8220;the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies&#8221;. Israel&#8217;s continued settlement activity is in flagrant 
violation of this provision. 
</p>
<p>58. Besides the fact that settlements are in and of themselves a violation of Israel&#8217;s obligations 
under international humanitarian law, violent acts by settlers against the Palestinian population 
of the OPT continue, usually with impunity. These acts increased in 2008, with OCHA noting 
that, since 2006, a &#8220;significant majority&#8221; of such violent acts have been carried out by groups of

</p>
<p>settlers, as opposed to individuals, as had generally been the case before 2006.<b>96</b> An Israeli 
human rights organization has documented 429 cases of settler violence against Palestinians and 
their property in 2008, a 75 per cent increase over 2007.<b>97</b> Israeli settlers living in many areas 
have a special dispensation regarding the owning and carrying of firearms. 
</p>
<p>59. There have been incidents of violence where large groups of settlers, sometimes more 
than 100, have attacked Palestinian individuals in the West Bank. In some widely reported 
instances,<b>98</b> the attacks were extensive and prolonged, lasting hours. Despite this trend, Israel&#8217;s 
security forces in most cases fail to prevent such attacks and in most cases, settlers do not face 
prosecution or even investigation.  
</p>
<p>60. There are instances where settlers are prosecuted for having committed violent acts 
towards Palestinians. In December 2008, a resident of the Yitav settlement in the north-east 
West Bank was sentenced to 16 months of imprisonment after having shot and paralysed for life 
an unarmed Palestinian civilian for no apparent reason.<b>99</b> While OHCHR is not aware of any 
comprehensive statistics on settler violence-related prosecutions, such prosecutions appear, to be 
exceptions to the prevailing impunity.  
</p>
<p>61. In addition to the fact that settler violence generally takes place with impunity, OHCHR is 
concerned that there are instances where IDF acquiesce or even cooperate with settlers in 
committing violent acts against Palestinians.  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Case study: attacks on Safa village 
</b></p>
<p>62. Recent events in the village of Safa, near Hebron, are indicative of violations in the OPT 
related to settler violence and the involvement of IDF in settler violence. 
</p>
<p>63. The village of Safa, 12 kilometres north of Hebron, is bordered by the Israeli settlement of 
Bat Ayin in the north and the settlement of Gush Etzion in the north-east. On 2 April 2009, 
13-year-old Shlomo Nativ was killed and Yair Gamliel, aged 7, was injured, allegedly by a 
resident of Safa, in the centre of Bat Ayin settlement.  
</p>
<p>64. According to information gathered by OHCHR in Safa village, shortly following the 
incident in Bat Ayin, Israeli forces entered the village. Troops temporarily occupied three homes, 
declaring them military outposts, and bulldozers blocked off entrances to the village, isolating it

<p>from farmlands and neighbouring villages. A complete curfew was imposed on the residents of 
the village for 24 hours as Israeli troops raided homes, searching for the perpetrator of the 
murder. On 2 April, IDF arrested three men from Safa.  
</p>
<p>65. On Saturday, 3 April 2009, at about 10 p.m., dozens of IDF troops entered the village from 
different directions, some in military vehicles. Troops then used megaphones ordering all men in 
the village to exit their homes and come out to the street. The Abu Dayyeh family, with 
13 members in Safa, left their home as ordered. All family members were out on the street 
except Mohammad and his sister Jamila, who are both mentally disabled. The soldiers instructed 
the family members to sit down on the street in front of the house. Hatem (34 years of age) and 
Mahmoud<b> </b>(23), were taken aside by soldiers and their identity papers were checked. They were 
handcuffed, blindfolded, and forced to stand face to the wall. The troops then proceeded to beat 
Hatem on the face with their hands and on various parts of his body with the butts of their rifles. 
Mahmoud started to cry out while his eldest brother was beaten; then one soldier kicked 
Mahmoud several times and hit his head against the wall of the house. Mohammad, who exited 
the house at this point, was immediately beaten by several soldiers for several minutes, and then 
literally dragged to the spot where his other two brothers were detained (approximately 6 metres 
away from the rest of the family). 
</p>
<p>66. After questioning Hatem and Mahmoud for some minutes, the soldiers entered the family 
house and searched it, throwing family possessions to the ground and damaging furniture in the 
process. They then left the village at approximately 12.15 a.m., taking Mohammad and 
Mahmoud. Family members were reportedly able to confirm later that day that Mahmoud had 
been detained in an interrogation centre in Jerusalem while Mohammad was taken to Shikma 
prison in Israel. Mohammad was released on 7 April, with scars from apparent beatings while in 
detention. Mahmoud was released from detention on bail on 27 April. 
</p>
<p>67. On 6 April, IDF arrested two more people from Safa village, increasing the number of 
Palestinians who were arrested from Safa to seven in total. On the same day, dozens of Israeli 
settlers tried to attack the village from the northern side, at approximately 10.30 p.m.; however, 
hundreds of Palestinians from Safa as well as from the nearby town of Beit Ummar congregated 
to prevent them from entering the village, and after a brief standoff, the settlers were forced by 
IDF to return to the settlement.  
</p>
<p>68. On 8 April, settlers from both settlements, escorted by IDF troops, gathered to the north 
and east of Safa. Many of the settlers were armed, and they opened fire at Palestinian civilians 
who gathered to protect themselves and their property. The settlers and IDF used firearms, sound 
bombs and tear gas canisters against Palestinian civilians, who in response threw stones. IDF 
brought reinforcements to the area and declared it a closed military zone. These attacks 
continued for 90 minutes, and peaked when IDF broke into the village and raided houses. As a 
result of these attacks, nine Palestinian civilians were wounded by gunshots, six by shots fired by 
IDF soldiers and three who were shot by settlers. Additionally, 26 civilians suffered from tear 
gas inhalation.  
</p>
<p>69. These events raise a number of human rights concerns. As occupying Power, Israel has the 
obligation to ensure order in the OPT; specifically to ensure that Palestinians are not targeted by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Israeli settlers (or vice versa). Far from carrying out this duty, it appears that, in this instance, 
IDF were directly involved in settler violence, by escorting settlers to Safa and openly assisting 
them in attacking the village. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. In addition, IDF subjected persons to ill-treatment during their search of the village. All 
IDF operations in the West Bank must be in strict compliance with international human rights 
standards. In particular, force should be used only as a last resort, and only to the minimum 
extent necessary. It appears that these standards were not followed. It is also, as noted above, a 
violation of international humanitarian law that persons detained in the course of such operations 
are detained in Israel, and not in the West Bank. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>F.  The Wall and restrictions on the freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Wall enclosing, and in many areas encroaching into, the West Bank, remained 
throughout the reporting period. As of August 2008, the last date for which comprehensive data 
are available, approximately 57 per cent of the Wall&#8217;s planned route of 723 kilometres had been 
completed. Approximately 86 per cent of the route of the Wall is actually in the West Bank, and 
not along the Green Line (the armistice line between Israel and the Jordanian-controlled 
West Bank), and will effectively annex large parts of the West Bank to Israel. Almost 12 per cent 
of the land of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) will remain either west of the Wall or in 
enclaves created by the route. Approximately 35,000 Palestinians holding West Bank identity 
documents in 35 communities will be located between the Green Line and the Wall; 125,000 
Palestinians will be surrounded by the Wall on three sides and 26,000 on four sides. Over 
80 per cent of the Israeli settlers in the West Bank will be connected to Israel, whereas 
Palestinians will be separated from land, livelihoods and services, with access dependent on an 
extremely restrictive permit regime.<b>100</b>  
</p>
<p>72. As noted above, the Wall has been found by the International Court of Justice to be in 
contravention of Israel&#8217;s obligations under international law, insofar as it departs from the Green 
Line. In its advisory opinion, the Court stated that the construction of the Wall in the OPT should 
cease and the portions already built in occupied territory dismantled. It is of grave concern that 
as of the present time Israel has chosen not to comply with this advisory opinion. However, it 
should be stressed that the Wall is but one element of the extreme restrictions on the movement 
of Palestinians within the West Bank, including permanent checkpoints where Palestinians are 
usually subjected to checks that cause prolonged delays. As of March 2009, OCHA observed 
634 closure obstacles blocking Palestinian movement within the West Bank, including 93 staffed 
checkpoints.<b>101</b> In addition, the Army operates 39 permanent checkpoints that control travel

 <p> 
</p>
<p>between the West Bank and Israeli territory. Israel maintains that checkpoints are vital for 
security. However, most of these checkpoints are located well inside the West Bank, up to 
several kilometres from the Green Line.<b>102</b>  
</p>
<p>73. The Wall itself has, as of March 2009, 66 gates. Only half of them are open to Palestinian 
use, and then only for holders of a special permit from the Israeli forces. The gates available for 
Palestinian use are open only part of the day. In addition to staffed checkpoints, the army has 
erected hundreds of physical obstructions (dirt piles, concrete blocks, boulders, trenches, fences 
and iron gates) to block access to main roads and channel Palestinian traffic to staffed 
checkpoints. In recent years, the number of these obstructions has gradually risen.<b>103</b>  
</p>
<p>74. Travel on hundreds of kilometres of roads in the West Bank is restricted or prohibited 
outright for Palestinians, whereas Israelis are allowed to travel on them freely. As of 
March 2009, travel of all Palestinians (apart from East Jerusalem residents, who carry special 
identity papers and are entitled to purchase cars with Israeli-issued number plates) is restricted or 
prohibited outright on 430 kilometres of roads in the West Bank, while Israelis are allowed to 
travel these sections freely. On 137 of the 430 kilometres, the Army prohibits Palestinian travel 
completely; on the remainder of the forbidden roads, only Palestinians with permits are allowed 
to travel.<b>104</b> 
</p>
<p>75. In addition, about one third of the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, is 
completely prohibited to Palestinians without a special permit issued by the Israeli military. Even 
with a special permit, entering these restricted areas with a Palestinian car (i.e. a car with a 
Palestinian-issued number plate) is prohibited under all circumstances. On the occasion of 
Jewish holidays from 9 through 11 March 2009, the Government of Israel imposed a three-day 
closure on the West Bank, prohibiting Palestinians from entering Israel and occupied 
East Jerusalem. A similar ban was enforced from 6 through 18 April, again for Jewish holidays. 
</p>
<p>76. It is difficult to adequately express the wide scope of human rights violations that these 
extreme restrictions impose on the Palestinian population. These severe restrictions themselves 
amount not only to a violation of the right to freedom of movement,<b>105</b> but also result in 
situations where Palestinians are effectively prevented from exercising other rights, including the 
right to work (art. 6 of ICESCR), the right to an adequate standard of living (art. 11), the right to 
health (art. 12), and the right to education (article 13). Though comprehensive data do not exist, 
thousands of people are effectively prevented on a daily basis from accessing workplaces, 
schools and health-care facilities, from purchasing necessary goods and from visiting family

 <p> 
</p>
<p>members and friends. As noted above, the International Court of Justice has found that both 
ICCPR and ICESCR remain applicable in the West Bank, and the entire regime restricting the 
freedom of movement of the Palestinian population is in violation of Israel&#8217;s international 
obligations under these treaties.  
</p>
<p><b>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: THE NEED  
FOR ACCOUNTABILITY 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>During the reporting period, the already critical human rights situation in the OPT 
deteriorated further. The recommendations made by the United Nations Secretary-General 
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights in recent reports on the human rights 
situation106 have not been implemented. All recommendations made previously by the 
Secretary-General and the High Commissioner, addressed to all duty bearers, remain valid 
and urgently need to be implemented by the parties. In particular, the High Commissioner 
remains gravely concerned that Israel has not yet complied with the Advisory Opinion on 
the Wall of the International Court of Justice, and that the severe restrictions on movement 
of Palestinian persons in the West Bank continue.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>As reported above, significant prima facie evidence indicates that serious violations of 
international humanitarian law as well as gross human rights violations occurred during 
the military operations of 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009, which were compounded 
by the blockade that the population of Gaza endured in the months prior to Operation Cast 
Lead and which continues.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Across the OPT, reported human rights violations during the reporting period 
include arbitrary detentions; torture and ill-treatment; extrajudicial executions; forced 
evictions and home demolitions; settlement expansion and related violence; as well as 
restrictions on freedom of movement and freedom of expression. While these violations are 
of deep concern in their own right, the nearly total impunity that persists for such 
violations (regardless of the responsible duty bearer) is of grave concern, and constitutes a 
root cause for their persistence.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In this context, the High Commissioner makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The blockade of Gaza and the restrictions on the entry and exit of people and 
goods in the West Bank, as well as inside the West Bank, amount to collective 
punishment under article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The 
High Commissioner reiterates her call for the immediate easing of restrictions 
with a view to the complete lifting of the blockade and other restrictions. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>All allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights 
violations during the Gaza military operations must be investigated by credible, 
independent and transparent accountability mechanisms, taking fully into account 
international standards on due process of law. Equally crucial is upholding the

international community as a whole, should render full support and cooperation to 
all such accountability efforts. The High Commissioner stresses in particular the 
need for full cooperation with and support to the ongoing work of the independent 
fact-finding mission mandated by the Human Rights Council and headed by 
Justice Richard Goldstone.

<p>&#8226; <b>In the wider OPT context, addressing the persisting impunity for human rights 
and international humanitarian law violations committed by all parties is vital for 
preventing a further deterioration of the human rights situation. In particular, 
reported instances of arbitrary detentions, torture and ill-treatment and 
extrajudicial executions should be investigated. A key obstacle in this regard is the 
widespread recourse to military justice systems, which do not meet international 
standards of due process, by all parties. This should be curtailed.

<p>&#8226; <b>The Government of Israel must stop its expansion of settlements, which are illegal. 
It should also issue viable zoning plans and a less cumbersome process for issuing 
building permits in a non-discriminatory manner for all, in East Jerusalem and 
other places in the West Bank. Until such time, the High Commissioner calls for an 
immediate halt to evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes. The Government 
of Israel also needs to address, as a matter of urgency, the persisting impunity for 
settler violence, while providing effective protection for all, in particular the 
vulnerable groups most affected by such acts.

<p>&#8226; <b>In its efforts to promote a much-needed political solution to the over-40-year-old 
conflict, the international community should ensure that such a long-awaited 
outcome is anchored in international law, in particular international human rights 
and humanitarian law, including the advisory opinion of the International Court 
of Justice. There can be no lasting peace without respect for human rights and 
without accountability for human rights violations.
