<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles of economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in 
international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome and General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
Assembly established the Human Rights Council, all affirm that all human rights are 
universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be 
treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and 
recalling also that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never 
exempt States from the promotion and protection of the other rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> its resolutions on the question of the realization in all countries of 
economic, social and cultural rights, and<b> </b>the resolutions adopted by the Commission on 
Human Rights on the same topic, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 5 May 2013 will be a step forward in 
strengthening the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights 
worldwide, and noting with interest the fact that forty two States have signed the Optional 
Protocol and ten have ratified it since it was opened for signature on 24 September 2009, 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of
