STATEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AUSTRALASlAN CODE FOR REPORTING OF
EXPLORATION RESULTS, MlNERAL RESOURCES AND ORE RESERVES
(THE JORC can)

The information in this report that relates to Exploration Results and Mineral Resources is based on information compiled by Mr Ian Reudavey, who is a Member of

the Australian Institute of Geoscientists and a full time employee of Diatreme Resources Limited. Mr Reudavey has sufficient experience which is relevant to the

style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he has undertaken to qualify as a Competent person as defined in the 2012

Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and are Reserves', Mr Reudavey consents to the inclusion in the report of

the matters based on the information in the form and context in which it appears.

'The information in this report that relates to Ore Reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Phil McMurtrie, who is a Member of the Australasian Institute

of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr McMurtrie is a director of Tisana Pty Ltd and is a consultant to Diatreme Resources Limited. Mr McMurtrie has sufficient experience

which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he has undertaken to qualify as a Competent

Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Dre Reserves’. Mr McMurtrie consents

to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on the information in the form and context in which it appears.

Cautionary Statement

Whilst Diatreme Resources has concluded that it has a reasonable basis for providing the forward looking statements included in this presentation, Diatreme

Resources advises that given the current price of zircon and the companys current market capitalisation (compared to the capital expenditure required in connection

with the cyclone zircon Project), the production targets and forecast financial information contained in this presentation do not provide an absolute assurance of

economic development at this stage. The stated production targets and forecast financial information contained in this presentation are based on detailed prs

studies and Diatreme Resaurces‘ current expectations offuture results or events, including sourcing of project development finance within the targeted timeline

and/or attracting suitable project major financial partners and should not be relied upon by investors when making investment decisions,

DIATREME — INVESTMENT OVERVIEW

- GOLD: Tick Hill Gold Project, Old: Short-term cash flow potential from tailings
reprocessing operation, benefitting from A$1,700/oz gold price

- ZIRCON: Cyclone Zircon Project, WA: Supply shortage predicted “within 3 years” with
zircon price forecast by Beer & Co. to reach US$1.500/t; * Cyclone production eyed by 2018
with estimated NPV of $121 million, IRR 23% and payback in under 3 years

- MORE PROJECTS: Attractive project pipeline, including Cape Bedford Silica/HMS project,
located next to world’s biggest silica mine in North Qld

- EXPERIENCE: Experienced board and management with ‘skin in the game’

‘ Refer ASXReIease on 151un92016.” Note- allthe materialassumptions underpinningthe forecast financial information derived fromaproduction target in the

initial public report continue to apply and have not materially changed.

\/ Water Supply - Extensive groundwater aquifer discovered and test bore
completed close to the mine. Bore flow estimated at 40 litres/second.

\/ Native Title and Mining Agreement — Agreement executed with the Native
Title Holders on 15 November 2014

\/ Mining Lease (ML69/141) — Mining Lease (M69/141) granted on 18 November
2014.

\/ Mine Life Increased — Acquisition of Cyclone Extended has increased the mine
life to 14 years with a mining rate of 10 million tonnes per year.

V Independent Update and Evaluation — Sedgman Limited completed a Project
Enhancement and Update Study in June 2016 reducing costs and validating
robust financial results. Sedgman identified additional opportunities for
improving project economics.

\/ Environmental Approval — EPA released conditions for project approval on 8
August 2016. The WA Environment Minister is expected to finalise approval
after a two week public review and a consulting period with other Ministers.

\/ Meeting quality demands: Whiteness (a strong indicator of purity) and sizing
of silica sand meets the demands of the glass and foundry industries
\/ Large Asian market demand: Particularly in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan
\/ Proximity to existing producer: Tenement adjacent to world’s largest silica
sand exporter (Cape Flattery)
\/ Array of applications: eg. glass manufacture, foundry production, electronics,
ceramics, construction

DIATREME: DELIVERING VALUE

- Experienced management/board with ‘skin in the game'

- Highly prospective tenement portfolio in mineral sands, gold & more

- Cyclone Zircon Project: Flagship project advancing through approvals and
DFS in world-class zircon province; de-risking process virtually complete,
facilitating further investment

- Tick Hill Gold Project: Short-term cash flow opportunity from reprocessing
tailings of historically rich former mine near Mount Isa

- Cape Bedford Silica/Heavy Minerals Project: Potential for mineral sands
and large-scale silica sand deposits near world's largest silica mine

- Diatreme Resources: High potential for gains in market value as key
projects are advanced in environment of rising commodity prices
