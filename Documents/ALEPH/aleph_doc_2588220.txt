Exhibit 99.1
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
The financial information in this Form 6-K concerning TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively,
“TOTAL” or the “Group”) with respect to the second quarter of 2014 and six months ended June 30, 2014, has been
derived from TOTAL’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2014 and six months
ended June 30, 2014.
TOTAL changed the presentation currency of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the Euro to the US
Dollar, effective January 1, 2014. Comparative 2013 information has been restated (see note 11 to the Group’s
unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Exhibit 99.1 to TOTAL’s Form 6-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 2, 2014 (the “Q1 2014 6-K”), including the interpretation of IFRIC 21
“Levies” applied retrospectively (see notes 1 and 11 to the Q1 2014 6-K)). Unless otherwise noted, currency amounts
are expressed in U.S. dollars (“dollars” or “$”) or euros (“euros” or “€”).
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
and the related notes provided elsewhere in this exhibit and with the information, including the audited financial
statements and related notes, for the year ended December 31, 2013, in TOTAL’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the
year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2014.

·         SECOND QUARTER 2014 RESULTS
Ø             Sales
In the second quarter 2014, the Brent price averaged $109.7/b, an increase of 7% compared to the second quarter
2013 and 1% compared to the first quarter 2014. The Group’s European refining margin indicator (“ERMI”) averaged
$10.9/t compared to $24.1/t in the second quarter 2013 and $6.6/t in the first quarter 2014.
In this context, sales were $62,561 million in the second quarter 2014, an increase of 2% compared to $61,345 million
in the second quarter 2013.
Ø             Net income
Net income (Group share) in the second quarter 2014 decreased by 8% to $3,104 million from $3,364 million in the
second quarter 2014, mainly due to the impacts of the inventory valuation effect and special items (as described
below). The after-tax inventory valuation effect (as defined below under “Analysis of business segment results”) had a
positive impact on net income (Group share) of $80 million in the second quarter 2014 compared to a negative impact
of $525 million in the second quarter 2013. The changes in fair value of trading inventories and storage contracts (as
defined below under “Analysis of business segment results”) had a negative impact on net income (Group share) of
$29 million in the second quarter 2014 compared to a negative impact of $31 million in the
1
second quarter 2013. Special items had a negative impact on net income (Group share) of $98 million in the second
quarter 2014 compared to a positive impact of $339 million in the second quarter 2013.
On June 30, 2014, there were 2,284 million fully-diluted shares compared to 2,277 million shares on June 30, 2013.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, based on 2,281 million fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was $1.36 in the
second quarter 2014 compared to $1.48 in the second quarter 2013, a decrease of 8%.
Ø             Investments — divestments(1)
Investments in the second quarter 2014, excluding acquisitions of $1,100 million and including changes in non-current
loans of $645 million, were $7.2 billion compared to $6.4 billion in the second quarter 2013, an increase of 12%.
Acquisitions in the second quarter 2014 were $1,100 million, essentially comprised of the acquisition of an interest in
the Elk and Antelope discoveries in Papua New Guinea, the acquisition of additional Novatek(2) shares and the carry
on the Utica gas and condensate field in the United States. Acquisitions in the second quarter 2013 were $653 million.
Asset sales in the second quarter 2014 were $201 million. Asset sales in the second quarter 2013 were
$1,393 million.
Net investments in the second quarter 2014 were $8.0 billion compared to $5.7 billion in the second quarter 2013.
The sale of Usan was not completed with Sinopec. The Group is actively pursuing the sale process for this asset.
Ø             Cash flow
Cash flow from operations was $5,277 million in the second quarter 2014, an increase of 9% compared to
$4,838 million in the second quarter 2013.
The Group’s net cash flow(3) in the second quarter 2014 was negative $2,689 million compared to negative
$878 million in the second quarter 2013, reflecting essentially an increase in net investments between the two periods.
The net-debt-to-equity ratio was 27.1% on June 30, 2014, compared to 23.5% on March 31, 2014, and 27.6% on
June 30, 2013(4).
·         FIRST HALF 2014 RESULTS
Ø             Sales
In the first half 2014, the price of Brent averaged $108.9/b compared to $107.5/b in the first half 2013. The ERMI was
$8.7/t compared to $25.5/t in the first half 2013.
In this context, sales were $123,248 million in the first half 2014, a decrease of 1% compared to $124,906 million in
the first half 2013.
Ø             Net income
Net income (Group share) in the first half 2014 increased by 21% to $6,439 million from $5,312 million in the first half
2013, mainly due to the impacts of the inventory valuation effect and special items (as described below). The after-tax
inventory valuation effect (as defined below under “Analysis of business segment results”) had a negative impact on
net income (Group share) of $57 million in the first half 2014 compared to a negative impact of $593 million in the first
half 2013. The changes in fair value of trading inventories and storage contracts (as defined below under “Analysis of
business segment results”) had a negative impact on net income (Group share) of $8 million in the first half 2014
compared to a negative impact of $30 million in the first half 2013. Special items had a positive impact on net income
(Group share) of $26 million in the first half 2014, including mainly the gain on the sale (partial IPO) of an interest in
Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) partially offset by the impairment of the Shtokman project in Russia, compared to a
negative impact of $1,344 million in the first half 2013, mainly due to a loss on the sale of the Group’s interest in the
Voyageur upgrader project in Canada, which was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an Upstream asset in Italy.
Effective January 1, 2014, due to its fiscal situation in France, the Group is no longer recognizing the benefit of tax
credits related to net operating losses in France.

·            ANALYSIS OF BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The financial information for each business segment is reported on the same basis as that used internally by the chief
operating decision maker in assessing segment performance and the allocation of segment resources. Due to their
particular nature or significance, certain transactions qualified as “special items” are excluded from the business
segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent or unusual. However,
in certain instances, certain transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals, which are not considered to
be representative of the normal course of business, may be qualified as special items although they may have
occurred in prior years or are likely to recur in following years.
In accordance with IAS 2, the Group values inventories of petroleum products in the financial statements according to
the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method and other inventories using the weighted-average cost method. Under the FIFO
method, the cost of inventory is based on the historic cost of acquisition or manufacture rather than the current
replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on the reported income.
Accordingly, the adjusted results of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are presented
according to the replacement cost method in order to facilitate the comparability of the Group’s results with those of
its competitors and to help illustrate the operating performance of these segments excluding the impact of oil price
changes on the replacement of inventories. In the replacement cost method, which approximates the Last-In, First-
Out (LIFO) method, the variation of inventory values in the statement of income is, depending on the nature of the
inventory, determined using either the month-end prices differential between one period and another or the average
prices of the period. The inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results under the FIFO and
replacement cost methods.
The effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects, for trading inventories and storage
contracts, differences between internal measures of performance used by TOTAL’s management and the accounting
for these transactions under IFRS, which requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period-
end spot prices. In order to best reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions,
internal indicators used to measure performance include valuations of trading inventories recorded at their fair value
based on forward prices. Furthermore, TOTAL, in its trading activities, enters into storage contracts, the future effects
of which are recorded at fair value in the Group’s internal economic performance. IFRS, by requiring accounting for
storage contracts on an accrual basis, precludes recognition of this fair value effect.
(1)                   The Group’s interest in Novatek was 18.0% at June 30, 2014.
(2)                                     Detail shown on page 11 of this exhibit.

The adjusted business segment results (adjusted operating income and adjusted net operating income) are defined as
replacement cost results, adjusted for special items, excluding the effect of changes in fair value. For further
information on the adjustments affecting operating income on a segment-by-segment basis, and for a reconciliation of
segment figures to figures reported in TOTAL’s consolidated interim financial statements, see pages 22-28 and 30-32
of this exhibit.
The Group measures performance at the segment level on the basis of net operating income and adjusted net
operating income. Net operating income comprises operating income of the relevant segment after deducting the
amortization and the depreciation of intangible assets other than leasehold rights, translation adjustments and gains or
losses on the sale of assets, as well as all other income and expenses related to capital employed (dividends from
non-consolidated companies, income from equity affiliates and capitalized interest expenses) and after income taxes
applicable to the above. The income and expenses not included in net operating income that are included in net
income are interest expenses related to long-term liabilities net of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, after
applicable income taxes (net cost of net debt and non-controlling interests). Adjusted net operating income excludes
the effect of the adjustments (special items and the inventory valuation effect) described above.

Hydrocarbon production was 2,054 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboe/d) in the second quarter 2014, a
decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter 2013, essentially due to the following:
·            -6.5% for changes in the portfolio, essentially the expiration of the ADCO license in the United Arab Emirates;
·             -0.5% for security conditions which improved in Nigeria but deteriorated in Libya; and
·             -3% for the normal production decline and the high level of planned maintenance, partially offset by the ramp
up on new projects.
Excluding the ADCO license, which expired in January 2014, hydrocarbon production in the second quarter 2014
decreased by 4% and 5% compared to the second quarter 2013 and first quarter 2014, respectively.
In the first half 2014, hydrocarbon production was 2,116 kboe/d, a decrease of 8% compared to the first half 2013,
essentially due to the following:
·             -5.5% for changes in the portfolio, essentially the expiration of the ADCO license in the United Arab Emirates;
·             -1% for security conditions in Libya and Nigeria; and
·             -1.5% for the normal production decline and the high level of planned maintenance, partially offset by the ramp
up on new projects.
In the first half 2014, excluding the ADCO license, hydrocarbon production decreased by 3% compared to the first half
2013.

*              Detail of adjustment items shown in the business segment information starting on page 22 of this exhibit.
Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment was $3,051 million in the second quarter 2014, stable
compared to the second quarter 2013. The negative impact of the decrease in hydrocarbon production and the
increase in costs due to the high level of planned maintenance was offset mainly by the higher realized price for
liquids and the lower tax rate.
Adjusted net operating income for the Upstream segment excludes special items. The exclusion of special items had
a positive impact of $29 million on the segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2014 compared
to a negative impact of $400 million in the second quarter 2013, which consisted essentially of capital gains on the
sale of an interest in the Tempa Rossa field in Italy.
The effective tax rate(1) for the Upstream segment was 52.3% compared to 58.2% in the second quarter 2013. This
decrease is mainly due to tax allowances in the UK, notably on the Laggan field, recognized in the second quarter
2014.
Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment in the first half 2014 was $6,143 million compared to
$6,298 million in the first half 2013, a decrease of 2% reflecting essentially the lower production and higher costs due
to the high level of planned maintenance, partially offset by the lower tax rate.
The return on average capital employed (ROACE(2)) for the Upstream segment was 13% for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2014, compared to 13% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, and 14% for the full-year 2013.

Marketing & Services segment.
**     Based on distillation capacity at the beginning of the year.
In the second quarter 2014, refinery throughput decreased by 8% compared to the second quarter 2013, reflecting
essentially the turnarounds at Leuna and Vlissingen as well as voluntary shutdowns in response to weak refining
margins in Europe. Included in June are the first runs from the new Satorp refinery, where all the units are now
operational.

The ERMI averaged $10.9/t in the second quarter 2014, a decrease of 55% compared to the second quarter 2013.
Petrochemical margins remained high in the United States, but retreated in Europe and Asia.
Adjusted net operating income from the Refining & Chemicals segment was $401 million in the second quarter 2014,
compared to $518 million in the second quarter 2013, reflecting essentially the deterioration of the European refining
environment, partially offset by the ongoing implementation of synergy and efficiency plans between the two periods.
Adjusted net operating income for the Refining & Chemicals segment excludes any after-tax inventory valuation effect
and special items. The exclusion of the inventory valuation effect had a negative impact of $77 million on the
segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2014 compared to a positive impact of $460 million in
the second quarter 2013. The exclusion of special items had a positive impact of $77 million on the segment’s
adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2014 compared to a positive impact of $92 million in the second
quarter 2013.
Adjusted net operating income from the Refining & Chemicals segment for the first half 2014 was $747 million, a
decrease of 22% compared to the first half 2013, reflecting essentially the strong deterioration of the European
refining environment.
The ROACE for the Refining & Chemicals segment was 8% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, compared to
9% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, and 9% for the full-year 2013.

In the second quarter 2014, sales increased by 3% compared to the second quarter last year, mainly due to higher
network sales, particularly in Africa, Middle East and Europe, partially offset by lower sales of domestic fuels and
LPGs.
Sales volumes for the first half 2014 were stable compared to the first half 2013, due to the offsetting effects of a 4%
decrease in European sales and net growth outside of Europe, particularly in the Americas and Middle East.

*              Detail of adjustment items shown in the business segment information starting on page 22 of this exhibit.
The Marketing & Services segment’s non-Group sales were $28.2 billion in the second quarter 2014, an increase of
5% compared to $26.9 billion in the second quarter 2013.
Adjusted net operating income from the Marketing & Services segment was $372 million in the second quarter 2014, a
decrease of 17% compared to $446 million in the second quarter 2013, reflecting in particular less favorable margins
in Europe related to weather conditions.
Adjusted net operating income for the Marketing & Services segment excludes any after-tax inventory valuation effect
and special items. The exclusion of the inventory valuation effect had a positive impact of $3 million on the segment’s
adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2014 compared to a positive impact of $73 million in the second
quarter 2013. The exclusion of special items had a positive impact of $21 million on the segment’s adjusted net
operating income in the second quarter 2014 compared to no impact in the second quarter 2013.
Adjusted net operating income from the Marketing & Services segment in the first half 2014 was $633 million, a
decrease of 19% compared to $778 million in the first half 2013, essentially due to the impact of weather conditions
on sales and a less favorable trend in European margins, partially offset by a global increase in the marketing of
petroleum products in growing markets
The ROACE for the Marketing & Services segment was 14% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, compared
to 15% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, and 16% for the full-year 2013.
·                          SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
As approved by the Board of Directors on April 29, 2014, TOTAL will pay a first quarter 2014 interim dividend of
€0.61/share on September 26, 2014.
In the Upstream, before the end of this year, CLOV should reach its production plateau of 160 kb/d, and the Group
should start up Laggan-Tormore and Ofon Phase 2. In exploration, results are expected in the coming months from
high-potential wells currently drilling in Angola’s Kwanza basin, in South Africa and in Indonesia.
In the downstream, all of the units at the Satorp refinery in Saudi Arabia are operational. Since the start of the third
quarter 2014, European refining margins have improved compared to the very low levels in the first half 2014, but
remain very volatile.
Several asset sales have been announced this year, and, as they are closed, the program total will be well within the
objective of $15-20 billion for the 2012-14 period.
In addition, all of the teams are involved in the finalization of the announced cost reduction plan.

Forward-looking statements are not assurances of results or values. They involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. TOTAL’s future results and share value may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-
looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond TOTAL’s ability to
control or predict. Except for its ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by applicable
securities laws, TOTAL does not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after the
distribution of this document, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect
or misleading.
You should understand that various factors, certain of which are discussed elsewhere in this document and in the
documents referred to in, or incorporated by reference into, this document, could affect the future results of TOTAL
and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements, including:
·                  material adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the markets served by TOTAL, including
changes in the prices of oil, natural gas, refined products, petrochemical products and other chemicals;
·                  changes in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations;
·                  the success and the economic efficiency of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production
programs, including without limitation, those that are not controlled and/or operated by TOTAL;
·                  uncertainties about estimates of changes in proven and potential reserves and the capabilities of production
facilities;
·                  uncertainties about the ability to control unit costs in exploration, production, refining and marketing
(including refining margins) and chemicals;
·                  changes in the current capital expenditure plans of TOTAL;
·                  the ability of TOTAL to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and operating efficiencies;
·                  the financial resources of competitors;
·                  changes in laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and industrial safety regulations;
·                  the quality of future opportunities that may be presented to or pursued by TOTAL;
·                  the ability to generate cash flow or obtain financing to fund growth and the cost of such financing and
liquidity conditions in the capital markets generally;
·                  the ability to obtain governmental or regulatory approvals;
·                  the ability to respond to challenges in international markets, including political or economic conditions,
including international armed conflict, and trade and regulatory matters;
·                  the ability to complete and integrate appropriate acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures;
·                  changes in the political environment that adversely affect exploration, production licenses and contractual
rights or impose minimum drilling obligations, price controls, nationalization or expropriation, and regulation of refining
and marketing, chemicals and power generating activities;
·                  the possibility that other unpredictable events such as labor disputes or industrial accidents will adversely
affect the business of TOTAL; and
·                  the risk that TOTAL will inadequately hedge the price of crude oil or finished products.
For additional factors, you should read the information set forth under “Item 3. Risk Factors”, “Item 4. Information on
the Company — Other Matters”, “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and “Item 11. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in TOTAL’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2013.

*                       European Refining Margin Indicator (ERMI) is an indicator intended to represent the margin after variable
costs for a hypothetical complex refinery located around Rotterdam in Northern Europe that processes a mix of crude
oil and other inputs commonly supplied to this region to produce and market the main refined products at prevailing
prices in this region. The indicator margin may not be representative of the actual margins achieved by the Group in
any period because of the Group’s particular refinery configurations, product mix effects or other company-specific
operating conditions.
**                  $1/t = $0.136/b.
***             Consolidated subsidiaries, excluding fixed margin contracts, including hydrocarbon production
overlifting/underlifting position valued at market price.

TOTAL
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2014
(unaudited, 2013 data converted from the Euro to the US Dollar)
1) Accounting policies
The interim consolidated financial statements of TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiaries (the Group) as of June 30, 2014 are
presented in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34
“Interim Financial Reporting”.
In order to make the financial information of TOTAL more readable by better reflecting the performance of its activities
mainly carried out in U.S. dollars, TOTAL has changed, effective January 1, 2014, the presentation currency of the
Group’s consolidated financial statements from the Euro to the US Dollar. The statutory financial statements of
TOTAL S.A., the parent company of the Group, remain prepared in euro. The dividend paid remains fixed in euro.
Following this change in accounting policy, the comparative consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.
dollars.
Currency translation adjustments have been set to zero as of January 1, 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Cumulative currency translation adjustments are presented as if the Group had used the US Dollar as the presentation
currency of its consolidated financial statements since that date.
The accounting policies applied for the consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2014 do not differ
significantly from those applied for the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 which have been
prepared on the basis of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted by the European Union and
IFRS as issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standard Board). New texts or amendments which were
mandatory for the periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 did not have a material impact on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2014, with the exception of interpretation IFRIC 21:
·                  In May 2013, the IASB issued the interpretation IFRIC 21 “Levies”. This interpretation is applicable
retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The text indicates that the obligating event
for the recognition of a liability is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy.
The comparative consolidated financial statements have been restated accordingly.
The impact on shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2011, is +$46 million. The impact on the statement of income for
2011 and 2012 is not significant. Net income, Group share, for 2013 is increased by $24 million (1st quarter: -$83
million, 2nd quarter: +$48 million, 3rd quarter: +$37 million, 4th quarter: +$22 million).
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the executive management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date
of preparation of the financial statements and reported income and expenses for the period. The management reviews
these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, by reference to past experience and various other factors
considered as reasonable which form the basis for assessing the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. Actual
results may differ significantly from these estimates, if different assumptions or circumstances apply. These
judgments and estimates relate principally to the application of the successful efforts method for the oil and gas
accounting, the valuation of long-lived assets, the provisions for asset retirement obligations and environmental
remediation, the pensions and post-retirement benefits and the income tax computation. These estimates and
assumptions are described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013.
Furthermore, when the accounting treatment of a specific transaction is not addressed by any accounting standard or
interpretation, the management applies its judgment to define and apply accounting policies that provide information
consistent with the general IFRS concepts: faithful representation, relevance and materiality.

2) Changes in the Group structure, main acquisitions and divestments
Ø     Upstream
·                  TOTAL finalized in March 2014 the sale to Sonangol E&P of its interest in block 15/06 in Angola.
·                  TOTAL finalized in March 2014 the acquisition from InterOil Corporation of a 40.1% interest (before possible
entry by the State) in block PRL 15 containing the gas field Elk-Antelope in Papua New Guinea for an amount of $405
million, paid on April 2, 2014.
·                  On February 27, 2014, TOTAL floated GazTransport et Technigaz S.A. (GTT), an engineering company
specializing in the design of cryogenic membranes for the transport and storage of LNG. With this quotation on
Euronext Paris, TOTAL has reduced its interest in the equity of the company from 30.0% to 10.4%. The listing was
completed at a price of €46 per share, valuing 100% of the equity of the company on the issue date at €1.7 billion.
This sale generated a gain on disposal of $599 million after tax.
·                  TOTAL finalized during the first half of 2014 the acquisition of an additional 1.05% interest in Novatek for an
amount of $355 million, bringing TOTAL’s overall interest in Novatek to 18.0% as at June 30, 2014.
3) Adjustment items
Financial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows
internal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of TOTAL and which is reviewed
by the main operational decision-making body of the Group, namely the Executive committee.
Performance indicators excluding the adjustment items, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating
income, and adjusted net income are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance and the comparison
of income between periods.
Adjustment items include:
(i) Special items
Due to their unusual nature or particular significance, certain transactions qualified as “special items” are excluded
from the business segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent or
unusual. However, in certain instances, transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals, which are not
considered to be representative of the normal course of business, may be qualified as special items although they
may have occurred within prior years or are likely to occur again within the coming years.
(ii) Inventory valuation effect
The adjusted results of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are presented according to the
replacement cost method. This method is used to assess the segments’ performance and facilitate the comparability
of the segments’ performance with those of its competitors.
In the replacement cost method, which approximates the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) method, the variation of inventory
values in the statement of income is, depending on the nature of the inventory, determined using either the month-end
prices differential between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value.
The inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results according to the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and the
replacement cost.
(iii) Effect of changes in fair value
The effect of changes in fair value presented as adjustment item reflects for some transactions differences between
internal measure of performance used by TOTAL’s management and the accounting for these transactions under
IFRS.
IFRS requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period-end spot prices. In order to best
reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions, internal indicators used to measure
performance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices.
Furthermore, TOTAL, in its trading activities, enters into storage contracts, which future effects are recorded at fair
value in Group’s internal economic performance. IFRS precludes recognition of this fair value effect.
The adjusted results (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net income) are defined as
replacement cost results, adjusted for special items and the effect of changes in fair value.

Extensive studies have confirmed a technical scheme to develop the Shtokman field in Russia, but at a too high cost
that does not provide an acceptable profitability. The Group remains in contact with Gazprom to study other technical
schemes that enhance the economics and to define an eventual future participation in the development of the field. In
the meantime, the Group has decided to depreciate its investment of $350 million in this project.

-                    Bond 1.625% 2011-2014 (750 million USD)
-                    Bond US Libor 3 months +38 bp 2011-2014 (750 million USD)

-                    Bond 1.723% 2007-2014 (8,000 million JPY)
In the context of its active cash management, the Group may temporarily increase its current borrowings, particularly
in the form of commercial paper. The changes in current borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and current financial
assets resulting from this cash management in the quarterly financial statements are not necessarily representative of
a longer-term position.
6) Related parties
The related parties are principally equity affiliates and non-consolidated investments. There were no major changes
concerning transactions with related parties during the first six months of 2014.
35
7) Other risks and contingent liabilities
TOTAL is not currently aware of any exceptional event, dispute, risks or contingent liabilities that could have a
material impact on the assets and liabilities, results, financial position or operations of the Group.
Antitrust investigations
The principal antitrust proceedings in which the Group’s companies are involved are described below.
Refining & Chemicals segment
As part of the spin-off of Arkema1 in 2006, TOTAL S.A. and certain other Group companies agreed to grant Arkema
for a period of ten years a guarantee for potential monetary consequences related to antitrust proceedings arising from
events prior to the spin-off.
As of December 31, 2013, all public and civil proceedings covered by the guarantee were definitively resolved in
Europe and in the United States. Despite the fact that Arkema has implemented since 2001 compliance procedures
that are designed to prevent its employees from violating antitrust provisions, it is not possible to exclude the
possibility that the relevant authorities could commence additional proceedings involving Arkema regarding events
prior to the spin-off.
Marketing & Services segment
·                  Following the appeal lodged by the Group’s companies against the European Commission’s 2008 decision
fining Total Marketing Services an amount of €128.2 million, in relation to practices regarding a product line of the
Marketing & Services segment, which the company had already paid, and concerning which TOTAL S.A. was
declared jointly liable as the parent company, the relevant European court decided during the third quarter of 2013 to
reduce the fine imposed on Total Marketing Services to €125.5 million without modifying the liability of TOTAL S.A.
as parent company. Appeals have been lodged against this judgment.
·                  In the Netherlands, a civil proceeding was initiated against TOTAL S.A., Total Marketing Services and other
companies, by third parties alleging damages in connection with practices already sanctioned by the European
Commission. At this stage, the plaintiffs have not communicated the amount of their claim.
·                  Finally, in Italy, in 2013, a civil proceeding was initiated against TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiary Total
Aviazione Italia Srl before the competent Italian civil court. The plaintiff claims against TOTAL S.A., its subsidiary
and other third parties, damages that it estimates to be nearly €908 million. This procedure follows practices that had
been sanctioned by the Italian competition authority in 2006. The existence and the assessment of the alleged
damages in this procedure involving multiple defendants are strongly contested.
Whatever the evolution of the proceedings described above, the Group believes that their outcome should not have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial situation or consolidated results.
Grande Paroisse
An explosion occurred at the Grande Paroisse industrial site in the city of Toulouse in France on September 21, 2001.
Grande Paroisse, a former subsidiary of Atofina which became a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine Fertilisants on
December 31, 2004, as part of the reorganization of the Chemicals segment, was principally engaged in the
production and sale of agricultural fertilizers. The explosion, which involved a stockpile of ammonium nitrate pellets,
destroyed a portion of the site and caused the death of thirty-one people, including twenty-one workers at the site, and
injured many others. The explosion also caused significant damage to certain property in part of the city of Toulouse.
This plant has been closed and individual assistance packages have been provided for employees. The site has been
rehabilitated.
On December 14, 2006, Grande Paroisse signed, under the supervision of the city of Toulouse, a deed whereby it
donated the former site of the AZF plant to the greater agglomeration of Toulouse (CAGT) and the Caisse des dépôts
et consignations and its subsidiary ICADE. Under this deed, TOTAL S.A. guaranteed the site remediation obligations
of Grande Paroisse and granted a €10 million endowment to the InNaBioSanté research foundation as part of the
setting up of a cancer research center at the site by the city of Toulouse.
After having articulated several hypotheses, the Court-appointed experts did not maintain in their final report filed on
May 11, 2006, that the accident was caused by pouring a large quantity of a chlorine compound over ammonium
nitrate.
(1)  Arkema is used in this section to designate those companies of the Arkema group whose ultimate parent company
is Arkema S.A. Arkema became an independent company after being spun-off from TOTAL S.A. in May 2006.
36
Instead, the experts have retained a scenario where a container of chlorine compound sweepings was poured between
a layer of wet ammonium nitrate covering the floor and a quantity of dry agricultural nitrate at a location not far from
the principal storage site. This is claimed to have caused an explosion which then spread into the main storage site.
Grande Paroisse was investigated based on this new hypothesis in 2006; Grande Paroisse is contesting this
explanation, which it believes to be based on elements that are not factually accurate.
On July 9, 2007, the investigating magistrate brought charges against Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager
before the Toulouse Criminal Court. In late 2008, TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest, Chairman and CEO at the
time of the event, were summoned to appear in Court pursuant to a request by a victims association.
On November 19, 2009, the Toulouse Criminal Court acquitted both the former Plant Manager, and Grande Paroisse
due to the lack of reliable evidence for the explosion. The Court also ruled that the summonses against TOTAL S.A.
and Mr. Thierry Desmarest were inadmissible.
Due to the presumption of civil liability that applied to Grande Paroisse, the Court declared Grande Paroisse civilly
liable for the damages caused by the explosion to the victims in its capacity as custodian and operator of the plant.
The Prosecutor’s office, together with certain third parties, appealed the Toulouse Criminal Court verdict. In order to
preserve its rights, Grande Paroisse lodged a cross-appeal with respect to civil charges.
By its decision of September 24, 2012, the Court of Appeal of Toulouse (Cour d’appel de Toulouse) upheld the lower
court verdict pursuant to which the summonses against TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest were determined to
be inadmissible. This element of the decision has been appealed by certain third parties before the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation).
The Court of Appeal considered, however, that the explosion was the result of the chemical accident described by the
court-appointed experts. Accordingly, it convicted the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse. This element of the
decision has been appealed by the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse before the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has the effect of suspending their criminal sentences.
A compensation mechanism for victims was set up immediately following the explosion. €2.3 billion was paid for the
compensation of claims and related expenses amounts. A €11.6 million reserve remains booked in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2014.
Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee – Russian regions and Interneft
Blue Rapid, a Panamanian company, and the Russian Olympic Committee filed a claim for damages with the Paris
Commercial Court against Elf Aquitaine, alleging a so-called non-completion by a former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine of
a contract related to an exploration and production project in Russia negotiated in the early 1990s. Elf Aquitaine
believed this claim to be unfounded and opposed it. On January 12, 2009, the Commercial Court of Paris rejected
Blue Rapid’s claim against Elf Aquitaine and found that the Russian Olympic Committee did not have standing in the
matter. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee appealed this decision. On June 30, 2011, the Court of
Appeal of Paris dismissed as inadmissible the claim of Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee against
Elf Aquitaine, notably on the grounds of the contract having lapsed. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee
appealed this decision to the French Supreme Court.
In connection with the same facts, and fifteen years after the termination of the exploration and production contract, a
Russian company, which was held not to be the contracting party to the contract, and two regions of the Russian
Federation that were not even parties to the contract, launched an arbitration procedure against the aforementioned
former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine that was liquidated in 2005, claiming alleged damages of $22.4 billion. For the same
reasons as those successfully adjudicated by Elf Aquitaine against Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee,
the Group considers this claim to be unfounded as a matter of law and fact. The Group has lodged a criminal
complaint to denounce the fraudulent claim of which the Group believes it is a victim and, has taken and reserved its
rights to take other actions and measures to defend its interests.
Iran
In 2003, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed by the Department of Justice (DoJ)
issued a formal order directing an investigation in connection with the pursuit of business in Iran by certain oil
companies including, among others, TOTAL.
The inquiry concerned an agreement concluded by the Company with consultants concerning gas fields in Iran and
aimed at verifying whether certain payments made under this agreement would have benefited Iranian officials in
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Company’s accounting obligations.
In late May 2013, and after several years of discussions, TOTAL reached settlements with the U.S. authorities (a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DoJ and a Cease and Desist Order with the SEC). These settlements,
which put an end to these investigations,
37
were concluded without admission of guilt and in exchange for TOTAL respecting a number of obligations, including
the payment of a fine ($245.2 million) and civil compensation ($153 million) that occurred during the second quarter of
2013. The reserve of $398.2 million that was booked in the financial statements as of June 30, 2012, has been fully
released. By virtue of these settlements, TOTAL also accepted the appointment of a French independent compliance
monitor to review the Group’s compliance program and to recommend possible improvements.
With respect to the same facts, TOTAL and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who was President of the
Middle East at the time of the facts, were placed under formal investigation in France following a judicial inquiry
initiated in 2006. In late May 2013, the Prosecutor’s office recommended that the case be sent to trial. This position
was reiterated by the Prosecutor’s office in June 2014.The investigating magistrate has not yet issued his decision.
At this point, the Company considers that the resolution of these cases is not expected to have a significant impact
on the Group’s financial situation or consequences for its future planned operations.
Oil-for-Food Program
Several countries have launched investigations concerning possible violations related to the United Nations (UN) Oil-
for-Food Program in Iraq.
Pursuant to a French criminal investigation, certain current or former Group Employees were placed under formal
criminal investigation for possible charges as accessories to the misappropriation of Corporate assets and as
accessories to the corruption of foreign public agents. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
formerly President of the Group’s Exploration & Production division, was also placed under formal investigation in
October 2006. In 2007, the criminal investigation was closed and the case was transferred to the Prosecutor’s office.
In 2009, the Prosecutor’s office recommended to the investigating magistrate that the case against the Group’s
current and former employees and TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer not be pursued.
In early 2010, despite the recommendation of the Prosecutor’s office, a new investigating magistrate, having taken
over the case, decided to indict TOTAL S.A. on bribery charges as well as complicity and influence peddling. The
indictment was brought eight years after the beginning of the investigation without any new evidence being introduced.
In October 2010, the Prosecutor’s office recommended to the investigating magistrate that the case against TOTAL
S.A., the Group’s former employees and TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer not be pursued. However, by
ordinance notified in early August 2011, the investigating magistrate on the matter decided to send the case to trial.
On July 8, 2013, TOTAL S.A., the Group’s former employees and TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
were cleared of all charges by the Criminal Court, which found that none of the offenses for which they had been
prosecuted were established. On July 18, 2013, the Prosecutor’s office appealed the parts of the Criminal Court’s
decision acquitting TOTAL S.A. and certain of the Group’s former employees. TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer’s acquittal issued on July 8, 2013 is irrevocable since the Prosecutor’s office did not appeal this
part of the Criminal Court’s decision. The appeal hearing is expected to start in October 2015.
Italy
As part of an investigation led by the Prosecutor of the Republic of the Potenza Court, Total Italia and certain Group
employees were the subjects of an investigation related to certain calls for tenders that Total Italia made for the
preparation and development of an oil field.
The criminal investigation was closed in the first half of 2010.
In May 2012, the Judge of the preliminary hearing decided to dismiss the charges against some of the Group’s
employees and to refer the case for trial for a reduced number of charges. The trial started in September 2012.
Rivunion
On July 9, 2012, the Swiss Tribunal Fédéral (Switzerland’s Supreme Court) rendered a decision against Rivunion, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, confirming a tax reassessment in the amount of CHF 171 million (excluding
interest for late payment). According to the Tribunal, Rivunion was held liable as tax collector for withholding taxes
owed by the beneficiaries of taxable services. Rivunion, in liquidation since March 13, 2002, unable to recover the
amounts corresponding to the withholding taxes in order to meet its fiscal obligations, has been subject to insolvency
proceedings since November 1, 2012. On August 29, 2013, the Swiss federal tax administration lodged a claim as
part of the insolvency proceedings of Rivunion, for an amount of CHF 284 million, including CHF 171 million of
principal as well as interest for late payment.

Total Gabon
On February 14, 2014, Total Gabon received a tax re-assessment notice from the Ministère de l’Économie et de la
Prospective of the Gabonese Republic accompanied by a partial tax collection notice, following the tax audit of Total
Gabon in relation to the years 2008 to 2010. The amount referred to in the above tax re-assessment notice is $805
million. The partial tax collection procedure was suspended on March 5, 2014 further to the action that Total Gabon
engaged before the Tax Administration.
Total Gabon disputes the grounds for the re-assessment and the associated amounts. Discussions with the
competent authorities are continuing.
Kashagan
In Kazakhstan, the start-up of production of the Kashagan field, in which TOTAL holds an interest of 16.81%,
occurred on September 11, 2013. Following the detection of a gas leak from the export pipeline, production was
stopped on September 24. Production was resumed but then stopped again on October 9 after another leak was
found. Pressure tests were performed in a fully controlled environment revealing some other potential leaks/cracks.
The production of the field was stopped and a thorough investigation was launched.
Today a significant number of anomalies have been identified in the oil and gas export lines. As a consequence it has
now been decided to replace both pipelines and an action plan for remedial works is currently being finalized. Best
international oil and gas field practices under strict HSE requirements are integral at all times within the Venture to
address, mitigate and remedy all problems prior to the restart of production.
In addition, the Atyrau Region Environmental Department (“ARED”) launched against the consortium developing the
Kashagan field a procedure alleging non-compliance with environmental legislation related to gas emissions (flaring).
On March 7, 2014, ARED issued a claim for environmental damages of approximately $737 million (KZT 134 billion),
of which TOTAL’s share would be approximately $124 million (KZT 22.5 billion). The Kashagan project’s consortium
disputes these allegations.
Russia
On July 16, 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) adopted new economic
sanctions involving various Russian entities in the financial and energy sectors, including Novatek (a Russian
company listed on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange and the London Stock Exchange) and entities in which
Novatek owns an interest of 50% or more.
TOTAL is closely monitoring the situation and the sanctions imposed on Novatek. In addition, the Group is continuing
to study the possible impacts of sanctions on its activities in Russia, in particular on the Yamal LNG project.
As of June 30, 2014, the Group held through its subsidiary TOTAL E&P Arctic Russia, an 18.0% interest in the share
capital of Novatek.  Novatek holds a 60% interest in Yamal LNG alongside TOTAL (20%) and CNPC (20%).  Novatek
also holds a 51% stake in ZOA Terneftegas, which holds the development and production license in the
Termokarstovoye field, alongside TOTAL (49%).
