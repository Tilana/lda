the Rights of the Child to provide a communications 
procedure

<p><b>  Preamble 
</b></p>
<p><i>  The States parties to the present Protocol</i>, </p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the 
United Nations, the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights 
of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
world, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human 
beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that everyone is entitled to all the 
rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, 
sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth 
or other status,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that children&#8217;s special and dependent status creates real difficulties for 
them in pursuing remedies for violations of their rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Encouraging </i>States parties to develop appropriate legislative, administrative and 
other measures, in accordance with article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
to enable children and others acting on their behalf and in their best interests to have access 
to effective remedies for violations of their rights, including, where appropriate, through the 
establishment of national human rights institutions mandated to promote and safeguard the 
rights of children, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that, in order to achieve further the purposes of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (hereinafter referred to as the Convention) and the implementation of its 
provisions, it would be appropriate to enable the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
(hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out the functions provided for in the 
present Protocol. 
</p>
<p> <i>Have agreed </i>as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Competence of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to receive and consider 
communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State party to the present Protocol recognizes the competence of the Committee to 
receive and consider communications as provided for by the provisions of the present 
Protocol.  
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall exercise the functions conferred on it by the present Protocol in 
a manner that respects the rights of the child and ensures that the best interests of the child 
are a primary consideration in all actions concerning the child. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-15781

individuals, within the jurisdiction of a State party, claiming to be victims of a violation by 
that State party of any of the rights set forth in: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Convention; 
 (b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>2. A State party may, at the time of signature or ratification of the present Protocol or 
accession thereto, declare that it does not recognize the competence of the Committee 
provided for in subparagraph 1 (b) and/or (c) of the present article. 
</p><p>3. Any State party having made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 2 of the 
present article may, at any time, amend or withdraw this declaration by notification to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>4. Where a communication is submitted on behalf of an individual or group of 
individuals, this shall be with their consent unless the author can justify acting on their 
behalf without such consent. 
</p>
<p>5. Where the author of a communication is acting on behalf of a child as defined in 
article 1 of the Convention, or a group of children, the Committee shall determine whether 
it is in the best interests of the child or group of children concerned to consider the 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Collective communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. National human rights institutions and ombudsman institutions and non-
governmental organizations in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and 
Social Council with particular competence in the matters covered by the Convention and 
the Optional Protocols thereto, which have been approved for that purpose by the 
Committee, may submit collective communications alleging grave or systematic violations 
of any of the rights set forth in:  
</p>
<p> (a) The Convention; 
 (b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography;

</p>
<p>2. Each State party may, at the time of signature or ratification of the present Protocol 
or accession thereto, declare that it does not recognize the competence of the Committee 
provided for in subparagraph 1 (b) and/or (c) of the present article. 
</p><p>3. Any State party may also, at the time of ratification or accession to the present 
Protocol, or at any time thereafter, declare that it recognizes the right of any national non-
governmental organization within its jurisdiction, which has particular competence in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>matters covered by the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto, to submit collective 
communications as provided for in paragraph 1 of the present article.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Admissibility 
</b></p>
<p> The Committee shall consider a communication inadmissible when:  
</p>
<p> (a) The communication is anonymous;  
 (b) The communication constitutes an abuse of the right of submission of such 
communications or is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and/or the 
Optional Protocols thereto;  
</p>
<p> (c) The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or 
is being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement; 
</p>
<p> (d) All available domestic remedies have not been exhausted. This shall not be 
the rule where the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to 
bring effective relief. The Committee shall interpret the application of the remedies in a 
manner sensitive to the impact that delays may cause to a child&#8217;s well-being and 
development;  
</p>
<p> (e) It is manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated;  
 (f) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the 
entry into force of the present Protocol for the State party concerned, unless those facts 
continued after that date.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Interim measures 
</b></p>
<p>1. At any time after the receipt of a communication and before a determination on the 
merits has been reached, the Committee may transmit to the State party concerned for its 
urgent consideration a request that the State party take such interim measures as may be 
necessary to avoid possible irreparable damage to the victim or victims of the alleged 
violations.  
</p>
<p>2. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present 
article, this does not imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits of the 
communication.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>
<p>1. Unless the Committee considers a communication inadmissible without reference to 
the State party concerned, the Committee shall bring any communication submitted to it 
under the present Protocol confidentially to the attention of the State party concerned as 
soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>2. The identity of any individual or group of individuals concerned shall not be 
revealed to the State party or otherwise without the express consent of the individual or 
individuals concerned. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2

explanations or statements clarifying the matter and the remedy, if any, that may have been 
provided by that State party.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Friendly settlement 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall make available its good offices to the parties concerned with a 
view to reaching a friendly settlement of the matter on the basis of the respect for the 
obligations set forth in the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols thereto.  
</p>
<p>2. An agreement on a friendly settlement closes consideration of the communication 
under the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Consideration of the merits 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications 
received under the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall consider communications received under the present Protocol 
in the light of all documentation submitted to it, provided that this documentation is 
transmitted to the parties concerned.

<p>3. When examining a communication under the present Protocol, the Committee may 
consult, as appropriate, relevant documentation emanating from other United Nations 
bodies, specialized agencies, funds, programmes and mechanisms, and other bodies, 
including from regional human rights systems, and any observations or comments by the 
State party concerned. 
</p>
<p>4. After examining a communication, the Committee shall, without delay, transmit its 
views on the communication, together with its recommendations, if any, to the parties 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>5. The Committee shall develop and publish rules of procedure to be followed when 
exercising the functions conferred on it by the present Protocol. In doing so, it shall have 
regard to article 1 (2) of the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>
<p>1. The State party shall give due consideration to the views of the Committee, together 
with its recommendations, if any, and shall submit to the Committee, within  three months, 
a written response, including information on any action taken in the light of the views and 
recommendations of the Committee.  
</p>
<p>2. The Committee may invite the State party to submit further information about any 
measures the State party has taken in response to its views or recommendations, if any, 
including as deemed appropriate by the Committee, in the State party&#8217;s subsequent reports 
under article 44 of the Convention, article 12 of the Optional Protocol on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography or article 8 of the Optional Protocol on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 10 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Inquiry procedure for grave or systematic violations

<p>1. If the Committee receives reliable information indicating grave or systematic 
violations by a State party of rights set forth in the Convention, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography or the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the 
Committee shall invite the State party to cooperate in the examination of the information 
and, to this end, to submit observations without delay with regard to the information 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. Taking into account any observations that may have been submitted by the State 
party concerned, as well as any other reliable information available to it, the Committee 
may designate one or more of its members to conduct an inquiry and to report urgently to 
the Committee. Where warranted and with the consent of the State party, the inquiry may

</p>
<p>3. Such an inquiry shall be conducted confidentially and the cooperation of the State 
party shall be sought at all stages of the proceedings. 
</p>
<p>4. After examining the findings of such an inquiry, the Committee shall transmit 
without delay these findings to the State party concerned together with any comments and 
recommendations.

comments and recommendations transmitted by the Committee, submit its observations to 
the Committee. 
</p>
<p>6. After such proceedings have been completed with regard to an inquiry made in 
accordance with paragraph 2 of the present article, the Committee may, after consultations 
with the State party concerned, decide to include a summary account of the results of the 
proceedings in its report provided for in article 15 of the present Protocol. 
</p>

or accession thereto, declare that it does not recognize the competence of the Committee

article 44 of the Convention, article 12 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography or article 8 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict, as appropriate, 
details of any measures taken in response to an inquiry conducted under article 10 of the 
present Protocol. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Inter-State communications 
</b></p>

</p>
<p> (a) The Convention; 
 (b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child

</p>
<p> (c) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in

</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall not receive communications concerning a State party that has

<p> A State party shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that individuals under its

</p>
<p>2. The Committee may also bring to the attention of such bodies, with the consent of 
the State party concerned, any matter arising out of communications considered under the

</b></p>
<p><b> II. Explanatory memorandum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>1. The wording is inspired by the preambles to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities has no preamble.  
</p>
<p>2. This is the derivation of the paragraphs in the draft: 
</p>
<p>First preambular paragraph: First preambular paragraph of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the first preambular paragraph of the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</p>
<p>Second preambular paragraph: Second preambular paragraph of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(similar to the second preambular paragraph of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women); 
Third preambular paragraph: Fourth preambular paragraph of the Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</p>
<p>Fourth preambular paragraph: Inspired by the Human Rights Council resolutions on 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a 
communications procedure (fifth preambular paragraph of Council resolution 11/1 
and the fourth preambular paragraph of resolution 13/3); 
Fifth preambular paragraph: During the first session of the Open-ended Working 
Group on an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to 
provide a communications procedure in December 2009, the importance of 
encouraging the development of effective remedies for violations of children&#8217;s rights 
at the national level was raised, including through the development of national 
human rights institutions for children, children&#8217;s ombudspersons and similar 
institutions. This was also promoted in Council resolution 10/14 on the rights of the 
child, in particular in paragraphs 10 and 11; 
</p>
<p>Sixth preambular paragraph: Inspired by the first preambular paragraph of the first 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
sixth preambular paragraph of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Competence of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to receive and consider 
communications 
</b></p>
<p>3. Paragraph 1 is a standard provision, included with slight variations in the four 
existing optional protocols and also in the provisions of four conventions that provide 
communications procedures.  
</p>
<p>4. Paragraph 2 responds to discussions at the Working Group&#8217;s first session, when it 
was stressed by experts and State representatives that the communications procedure for the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-15781 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child needed to take account of the special status and 
rights of children and be &#8220;child-friendly&#8221;. Article 3 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child had been identified by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as a principle 
(the best interest principle) of cross-cutting relevance to the whole Convention. Article 10 
(5) of the present draft requires the Committee to &#8220;have regard&#8221; to article 1 (2) of the 
present draft in developing and publishing rules of procedure regarding the communications 
procedure. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Individual communications 
</b></p>
<p>5. Similar provisions arise with slight variations in the four optional protocols and the 
Convention&#8217;s provisions. The provisions of the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, and also the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination recognize that individuals and groups of individuals may submit 
communications. The first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance refer to 
&#8220;individuals&#8221; who claim to be victims, which allows for more than one applicant; also, in 
practice, communications from more than one individual have been considered under the 
first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. While the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination provisions do not refer to communications being made &#8220;on behalf of&#8221; 
individuals, in practice the relevant committees can consider such applications, and their 
rules of procedure make this clear (see the rules of the Human Rights Committee, rule 96 
(b), and the rules of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, rule 
91 (b), which for example states that:  
</p>
<p>as a general rule, the communication should be submitted by the individual himself 
or by his relatives or designated representatives; the Committee may however in 
exceptional cases accept to consider a communication submitted by others on behalf 
of an alleged victim when it appears that the victim is unable to submit the 
communication himself, and the author of the communication justifies his acting on 
the victim&#8217;s behalf). 
</p>
<p>6. Article 2 (4) of the present draft incorporates the following additional wording 
derived from the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (art. 2) and the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2): &#8220;Where a communication is 
submitted on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals, this shall be with their consent 
unless the author can justify acting on their behalf without such consent.&#8221; 
</p><p>7. During the first session of the Working Group, a number of States raised questions 
about how to ensure that victims who were children at the time of the violation but could 
not exhaust their domestic remedies before they reached the age of 18 would be able to 
submit communications. Therefore, the notion &#8220;individual&#8221; is used in article 2 (1), as it is in 
all the existing procedures, rather than &#8220;child&#8221;. To address States&#8217; concerns about possible 
manipulation of child victims by those submitting communications on their behalf, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>paragraph 5 is added to ensure that, in such cases, the Committee applies the best interest 
principle. This reflects the principle identified by the Committee in article 3 (1) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Another option could be to include this provision in 
the rules of procedure, which the Committee will develop regarding the communications 
procedure before the Protocol comes into use.  
</p>
<p>8. Extending the communications procedure to cover the provisions in the two existing 
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child is consistent with the only 
existing parallel: the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. It extends the competence of 
the Human Rights Committee to cover communications concerning its provisions (art. 5), 
unless States make a contrary statement on ratification or accession (article 5 of the second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:  
</p>
<p>With respect to the States parties to the first Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted on 16 December 1966, the 
competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider 
communications from individuals subject to its jurisdiction shall extend to the 
provisions of the present Protocol, unless the State party concerned has made a 
statement to the contrary at the moment of ratification or accession). 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Collective communications 
</b></p>
<p>9. Experts at the first session of the Working Group encouraged States to consider 
including provisions allowing &#8220;collective communications&#8221;, defined in this context as 
communications alleging grave or systematic violations of any of the rights set forth in the 
Convention and/or the Optional Protocols thereto, without the identification of individual 
victims. This was strongly advocated by experts consulted during the preparation of the 
present draft, in particular during the expert consultations in Geneva in June 2010. 
</p>
<p>10. The issue of collective communications is not totally new within the framework of 
the United Nations standard setting; it was already discussed during the negotiations on the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>11. In the present draft, it is suggested that the Committee should be able to consider 
collective communications from national human rights institutions or ombudsman 
institutions and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic 
and Social Council and from, with particular competence in the matters covered by the 
Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto, leaving it to the Committee to determine 
whether the body should be approved for this purpose. Further criteria for approval could 
be defined in the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure. 
</p>
<p>12. Regional human rights mechanisms in Europe and Africa allow for the submission 
of collective complaints. In the Council of Europe, the Additional Protocol to the European 
Social Charter providing for a system of collective complaints was opened for signature in 
1995 and came into force in 1998. It enables the European Committee of Social Rights to 
consider communications made by certain organizations approved for the purpose, alleging 
unsatisfactory application of the Charter. A State can also declare that it recognizes the 
right of national non-governmental organizations within its jurisdiction and that have 
particular competence in the matters governed by the Charter to lodge complaints against it. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-15781 
</p>
<p>13. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child mandates the African 
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child to receive communications 
&#8220;from any person, group or non-governmental organization recognized by the Organization 
of African Unity, by a Member State, or the United Nations relating to any matter covered 
by this Charter&#8221; (art. 44 (1)). The Committee&#8217;s guidelines for the consideration of 
communications provided for in article 44 state:  
</p>
<p>1. Communications may be presented by individuals, including the victimized 
child and/or his parents or legal representatives, witnesses, a group of individuals or 
non-governmental organizations recognized by the African Union, by a Member 
State or by any other institution of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>2. The Author of the communication shall specify either to have been a victim 
of violations of the rights spelt out in the Charter, or to act on behalf of a victim or 
of other eligible parties. 
</p>
<p>3. A Communication may be presented on behalf of a victim without his/her 
agreement on condition that the author is able to prove that his/her action is taken in 
the supreme interest of the child. The victimized child who is able to express his/her 
opinions shall be informed of the communications presented on his/her behalf ... . 
</p>
<p>14. International complaints procedures established by the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and under the Constitution of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) also allow for collective communications without 
identification of victims of violations. Individuals, groups of individuals and non-
governmental organizations can submit a complaint to the UNESCO Committee on 
Conventions and Recommendations if they are direct victims or if they have a sufficient 
connection to the claimed violations. The procedure is confidential. It is the Committee&#8217;s 
responsibility to decide whether the affair in question is an individual and specific &#8220;case&#8221; 
concerning violation of human rights or a question of &#8220;massive, systematic or flagrant 
violations of human rights which result either from a policy contrary to human rights 
applied de jure or de facto by a State or from an accumulation of individual cases forming a 
consistent pattern&#8221;. The ILO complaint procedure is regulated by articles 26 to 34 of the 
ILO Constitution, under which a complaint alleging that a member State is not &#8220;securing 
the effective observance&#8221; of a convention to which it is a party can be filed by another 
member State, party to the same convention; any delegate to the ILO Conference; or by the 
ILO Governing Body. When a complaint is received, the Governing Body can appoint a 
commission of inquiry, composed of three independent members, to carry out an 
examination and formulate any recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>15. Article 4 is derived from article 2 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The only distinctive feature in the text is a reference to 
a child&#8217;s well-being and development in subparagraph (d).  
</p><p>16. Before considering the merits of a communication, the Committee needs to 
determine whether it meets certain criteria applying to all communications and is therefore 
&#8220;admissible&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. The existing procedures provide a number of standard reasons for rejecting 
communications (declaring them &#8220;inadmissible&#8221;). The following provisions relate to 
admissibility: articles 3 and 5 of the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights; articles 3 and 4 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; article 3 of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; article 2 of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; article 
22 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination; article 77 of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; and article 31 of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Interim measures 
</b></p>
<p>18. This is a standard provision in the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, from which article 6 is derived, and also in the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It is provided for in the rules of 
procedure of the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (for example, see Human Rights Committee rules of 
procedure). Given the developmental status and vulnerability of children, it was strongly 
argued at the first session of the Working Group for its inclusion in the new Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>19. Further details, including a child protection policy, could be included in the 
Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure; this could be explicitly referred to in article 8 (5) of the 
present draft. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>
<p>20. The existing procedures include various provisions defining the stages of 
consideration of communications. More detailed provisions have been included in the rules 
of procedure adopted by the respective committees. In the present draft, these stages are 
defined in articles 6, 7 and 8.   
</p>
<p>21. The general rule in article 6, paragraph 1, is that the Committee must bring the 
communication confidentially to the attention of the relevant State party. Paragraph 1 is a 
standard provision, although the parallel formulations in the existing instruments vary 
slightly (for example see article 6 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, article 4 of the first Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 6 of the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or 
article 3 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities). Emphasis was placed during the first Working Group session on ensuring that 
communications concerning children, given their developmental status, are processed 
without delay. So article 6 requires the Committee on the Rights of the Child to bring the 
communication to the attention of the State &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; and includes a time limit 
of three months for the State&#8217;s response. Article 4 of the present draft requires that 
communications not be anonymous. Paragraph 2 of article 8 requires, however, that the 
identity of any individual petitioner must not be disclosed to the State party, or otherwise, 
without their consent. The provisions establishing some existing procedures together with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-15781 
</p>
<p>rules of procedure developed by treaty bodies appear to allow for the identity of 
petitioner(s) to be kept confidential from States and others. This is particularly important 
for children as vulnerable individuals (see article 14 (6) (a) of the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination). 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Friendly settlement 
</b></p>
<p>22. Article 7 is derived from agreed language in article 7 of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; also in relation to inter-
State communications, in article 10 (1) (d) of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, article 41 (1) (e) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 21 (1) (e) of the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and article 76 (1) (d) of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. This enables the Committee to play a proactive role in 
encouraging an agreed resolution of the issue raised in the communication, without a 
prolonged examination.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Consideration of the merits 
</b></p>
<p>23. Paragraph 1 is a standard provision (for example, see article 5 of the first Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 7 of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights).  
</p><p>24. Paragraph 2 is derived from agreed language in article 8 (1) of the Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>25. Paragraph 3 is derived from agreed language in article 8 (3) of the Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, allowing the 
Committee to consult a range of material from other United Nations and United Nations-
related bodies and international bodies, including, for example, relevant decisions of 
regional human rights mechanisms, in addition of course to observations and comments 
from the State concerned. Similar provisions have been included in the rules of procedure 
for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
Paragraph 3 could be deleted and instead reflected in the rules of procedure to be adopted 
by the Committee. Rule 72 (2) of the rules of procedure of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women states:  
</p>
<p>The Committee or the working group set up by it to consider a communication may, 
at any time in the course of the examination, obtain through the Secretary-General 
any documentation from organizations in the United Nations system or other bodies 
that may assist in the disposal of the communication, provided that the Committee 
shall afford each party an opportunity to comment on such documentation or 
information within fixed time limits. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, Rule 112 (2) of the rules of procedure of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment states that: &#8220;The Committee, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>the Working Group or the rapporteur may at any time in the course of the examination 
obtain any document from United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, or other sources 
that may assist in the consideration of the complaint.&#8221; See also Rule 95 (2) of the rules of 
procedure of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>26. Paragraph 4 is a standard provision, the language being derived from article 6 of the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
article 7 (2) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and from similar language found in article 5 (4) of the first 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Cultural and Political Rights, article 5 of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, article 
22 (7) of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, article 77 (7) of the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and article 31 (5) of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
but with addition of &#8220;without delay&#8221; to emphasize again the need to process 
communications concerning children as quickly as possible. 
</p>
<p>27. Paragraph 5 requires the Committee to develop and publish rules of procedure, 
augmenting its existing rules and relating to its functions under the Optional Protocol. The 
language is derived from article 7 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, with the addition of a 
reference to article 1 (2) of the present draft, requiring the Committee to exercise the 
functions conferred on it by the present Protocol in a manner that respects the rights of the 
child, including the principle that, in all actions concerning children, the best interest of the 
child should be a primary consideration. The committees for all existing communications 
procedures in force have developed and published rules of procedure.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>
<p>28. Paragraph 1 uses agreed language from article 6 of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (echoed in article 7 (4) of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women), but with a time limit of three rather than six months. Article 11 (1) of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination requires 
the State concerned to respond within three months. 
</p>
<p>29. Paragraph 2 concerns one possible method of follow-up to the Committee&#8217;s views 
and recommendations (if any) adopted on a communication, derived from agreed language 
in article 7 (5) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women and article 9 (3) of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Various methods of 
follow-up have also been developed by committees in their rules of procedure (see 
HRI/ICM/2009/7).  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 10 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Inquiry procedure for grave or systematic violations 
</b></p>
<p>30. Articles 10 and 11 of the present draft concern the competence of the Committee to 
undertake inquiries when informed of grave or systematic violations of the Convention 
and/or its optional protocols. The Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Elimination </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-15781 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
as well as articles 20 and 28 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and article 33 of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance include provisions allowing 
inquiries. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment allow a State to declare on ratification or accession 
that it does not recognize the competence of the Committee to carry out such inquiries. In 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the onus is on States to make a declaration at any time recognizing the competence 
of the Committee to undertake an inquiry.  
</p>
<p>31. The language of article 10 is identical to that in article 8 of the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
article 6 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, except that, as in other articles, to ensure a rapid procedure in the best interest 
of children, &#8220;without delay&#8221; has been added to paragraphs 1 and 4, and a time limit of three 
months, rather than six, inserted in paragraph 5. Article 10 follows article 10 of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and articles 20 and 28 of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, in that States not wishing to 
be bound by this provision must make a specific declaration in that respect.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 11 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reporting on grave or systematic violations 
</b></p>
<p>32. This follow-up procedure on inquiry is derived from agreed language in article 9 of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, article 12 of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 7 of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 12 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Inter-State communications 
</b></p>
<p>33. Provisions allowing for inter-State communications are set out in article 10 of the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
where it is an optional procedure; articles 41 to 43 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and also in article 21 of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, article 11 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, article 76 of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and article 32 of the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It appears that there have been, as yet, no 
inter-State communications under any of the instruments. The wording of the present article 
is based on article 32 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 13 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Protection measures 
</b></p>
<p>34. At the first session of the Working Group, experts and State representatives raised 
concerns about the vulnerability of child petitioners and the importance of ensuring that 
their involvement in the communications procedure did not put them at risk. The possible 
vulnerability of petitioners has been considered in the elaboration of other protocols, and 
article 13 is derived from the agreed wording in article 13 of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; article 11 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women omits the words &#8220;any form of&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 14 
</b></p>
<p><b>  International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>35. This article derives from article 14 of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which includes a unique and detailed 
procedure enabling the Committee, with the consent of the State party concerned, to inform 
United Nations agencies when communications and/or the Committee&#8217;s views and 
recommendations on them suggest a need for technical advice or assistance to States. The 
issue of international assistance in the context of the optional protocol was also raised by 
some delegations at the first session of the Working Group. The Chairperson of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child recalled that the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contained a provision to 
that effect and that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child could 
take a similar approach. 
</p>
<p>36. The Chairperson-Rapporteur will leave the issue of establishment of a special/trust 
fund (as it is the case in article 14 (2) of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) for consideration by Member States. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 15 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report to the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>37. This is a standard provision, similar to those in article 6 to the first Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 12 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and article 15 of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 16 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Publicity 
</b></p>
<p>38. It has become a standard provision to require States parties to make respective 
instruments well known and to facilitate access about the views and recommendations of 
committees (article 13 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, article 16 of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). The requirement of 
&#8220;appropriate and active means&#8221; is by analogy based on article 42 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, under which &#8220;States parties undertake to make the principles and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-15781 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and 
children alike&#8221;. The importance of making such information accessible to children by child-
friendly language was also stressed during the first session of the Working Group. Article 
17 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
should be referred to in this regard as well: &#8220;The text of the present Protocol shall be made 
available in accessible formats.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 17 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Signature, ratification and accession 
</b></p>
<p>39. Article 17 uses agreed language derived from article 8 of the Optional Protocol 
providing communications procedures to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, article 15 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and article 1 of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 18 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Entry into force 
</b></p>
<p>40. Article 18 uses agreed wording from article 9 of the Optional Protocol providing 
communications procedures to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
article 16 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, article 18 of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 13 of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 19 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reservations 
</b></p>
<p>41. Article 19 follows article 17 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in not permitting reservations 
to the Protocol. The Chairperson-Rapporteur wishes to underline the optional nature of the 
Optional Protocol, as well as the fact that its objective is not to create any new substantive 
rights; those are stipulated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the two 
existing substantive Optional Protocols to it.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 20 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Amendments 
</b></p>
<p>42. This is a standard provision used with various changes of wording in article 11 of 
the Optional Protocol providing communications procedures to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, article 18 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, article 19 of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 
15 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
Article 20 is derived from the agreed wording in the more recent Optional Protocols to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 21 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Denunciation 
</b></p>
<p>43. Paragraph 1 is a standard provision used in the Optional Protocol providing 
communications procedures to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The period after which 
denunciation takes effect varies (three for the Optional Protocol providing communications 
procedures to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; six months for the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights; one year for the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities). Article 21 follows the Optional Protocol to the

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Letter from the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Open-ended 
Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, Mr. Drahoslav &#352;tef&#225;nek, to the 
members of the Working Group 
</b> The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 13/3 of 24 March 2010, decided to 
extend the mandate of the Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure until the 
seventeenth session of the Council, and at the same time, mandated the Open-ended 
Working Group to elaborate an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child to provide a communications procedure.  
</p>
<p> In the above resolution, the Human Rights Council also requested the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Open-ended Working Group to prepare a proposal for a draft optional 
protocol to be used as a basis for the forthcoming negotiations of the Open-ended Working 
Group. According to the resolution, the proposal for a draft optional protocol should be 
circulated by September 2010 in all the official languages of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p> It was specified in the resolution that the Chairperson-Rapporteur should take into 
account the views expressed and inputs provided during the first session of the Open-ended 
Working Group (16&#8211;18 December 2009), give due regard to the views of the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child and, where appropriate, to the views of relevant United Nations 
special procedures and other experts. 
</p>
<p> Ahead of the important task conferred upon me, I elaborated a non-paper containing 
possible elements of the draft optional protocol, which was circulated by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to all the Permanent and 
Observer Missions in Geneva on 17 May 2010. The non-paper was discussed during the 
informal consultations with Member and Observer States of the United Nations and other 
stakeholders on 26 May 2010 in Geneva. I was listening carefully to comments presented at 
this meeting and received with appreciation additional ones in writing.  
</p>
<p> While preparing the proposal for a draft optional protocol, I profited also from the 
expert consultations in which I participated on 21 and 22 June 2010 in Geneva. The 
consultations on the optional protocol were organized by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in cooperation with the International Commission of 
Jurists. A number of United Nations and civil society experts on the rights of the child took 
part in the consultations, including the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p> I have prepared the proposal in the light of the importance of ensuring consistency 
and coherence within the expanding range of international human rights instruments. Thus, 
wherever possible and appropriate, the draft uses agreed language from the optional 
protocols and/or provisions of the treaties, which have created the existing communications 
procedures under the core human rights treaties. The draft also takes into account the expert 
submissions and views expressed in the discussion during the first session of the Open-
ended Working Group in December 2009. 
</p>
<p> The explanatory memorandum to the proposal for a draft optional protocol contains 
a rationale for each article of the proposal, for ease of orientation also with references to 
provisions of the existing instruments that have been used as inspiration.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-15781 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p> I hope this proposal will provide a good basis for the deliberations at the second 
session of the Open-ended Working Group in December 2010, and that its early publication 
will allow sufficient time for a careful preparation for negotiations so that we can progress 
consistently and effectively.
