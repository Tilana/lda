<p><b>  Mission to Germany</b>* **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted a country mission to 
Germany from 26 September to 5 October 2011, at the invitation of the Government. 
During the entire visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest 
cooperation of the Government. The delegation was able to visit all detention facilities and 
interview in confidence all detainees requested.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group held various meetings with federal and state authorities in 
Berlin, Hamburg, Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. It met with senior authorities from the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches of the State, as well as with representatives of German 
civil society, including representatives of churches and non-governmental organizations, 
human rights defenders, lawyers, jurists and academics. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Working Group notes a number of positive aspects with 
respect to the institutions and laws safeguarding against occurrences of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty. It commends the efforts carried out by the State, particularly through 
legislative measures, to improve the regulation and situation of deprivation of liberty in 
Germany. The Working Group considers that the State&#8217;s inter-agency approach to 
addressing the socio-economic causes of offences and offending behaviour and its impact 
to date in reducing crime is of vital importance, and one that could be disseminated and 
shared beyond Germany. The Working Group refers, in particular, to initiatives regarding

<p>collaboration between the police and education departments to respond to factors that have 
an impact on criminality. It also highlights the establishment in Hamburg of an independent 
special commission for the investigation of police officers in cases of alleged misconduct or 
alleged ill-treatment. As another best practice, the Working Group mentions the abrogation 
of the obligation of head teachers and hospital authorities to report children of migrants in 
an irregular situation receiving education or emergency medical treatment.  
</p>
<p> Notwithstanding these positive achievements, the Working Group observes with 
concern the preventive detention system, under which persons who have already served 
their sentences continue to be deprived of their liberty because they are still deemed to 
represent a danger to society. In some cases, the possibility of preventive detention was 
foreseen in their initial sentencing, but in other cases, preventive detention is ordered post-
sentencing because the prisoner is deemed to represent a danger for society for reasons that 
were unknown at the time of her or his sentencing. The Working Group raises in its report 
the issues of proportionality and retroactivity, and recommends that the mechanism 
established by the Federal Constitutional Court to address such issues be followed. 
</p>
<p> Other issues of concern are the uneven use of restraints, such as handcuffs and 
shackles, in remand hearings, with clear differences among the local courts that the 
Working Group visited, as well as new legislation on the detention of patients for 
therapeutic treatment, such as the Therapieunterbringungsgesetz, and the disproportionate 
number of foreigners and Germans of foreign origin in detention. The Working Group 
notes that the latter situation may be due to factors such as the immigration laws in the 
country, the particularly vulnerable socio-economic position of many such detainees, or a 
lack of language skills or social support. It also notes that the judicial system works against 
foreigners with respect to pretrial detention, as it is easily argued that foreigners have no 
ties to the city or country and may flee. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group raises the issue of proportionality concerning the detention of 
foreigners for not having a valid entry visa or for having an expired visa, as well as the 
detention for illegal entry to Germany or illegal border crossing, which is often coupled 
with harsh sentencing. The Working Group recommends that the Government consider the 
possibility of using alternatives to detention.  
</p>
<p> Another issue of concern mentioned in the present report is the &#8213;fast-track&#8214; airport 
procedure, particularly at Frankfurt Airport. The three-day period to appeal the rejection of 
an application for political asylum before the Administrative Court is considered by the 
Working Group not to be sufficient to allow the applicant to prepare her or his appeal. The 
Working Group recommends that an individual risk assessment be requested before 
processing forcible returns. The risk of persecution and discrimination in countries of 
origin should be conscientiously evaluated, and careful consideration should be given to 
essential economic and social rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established by the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was assumed 
by the Human Rights Council in its decision 1/102 and extended for a further three-year 
period in Council resolution 15/18, conducted a country mission to Germany from 26 
September 2010 to 5 October 2011 at the invitation of the Government. The promptness of 
the Government&#8217;s positive response to the Working Group&#8217;s request for an invitation was 
particularly appreciated. The Working Group&#8217;s Chair-Rapporteur, El Hadji Malick Sow, its 
Vice-Chair, Shaheen Sardar Ali, and member Mads Andenas express the Working Group&#8217;s 
appreciation to the Government for the full cooperation extended to the delegation during 
its mission. The three members of the Working Group were accompanied by the Secretary 
of the Working Group and a staff member of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as by local interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. Throughout the entire visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the 
fullest cooperation of the Government and of all federal and state authorities with which it 
dealt. German authorities provided the delegation with all the necessary information and 
arranged all the meetings it requested. The delegation was able to conduct visits to 
detention facilities and to interview, without the presence of witnesses and in confidence, 
69 detainees chosen at random. The detainees interviewed had previously indicated their 
full willingness to speak to the delegation.   
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group would also like to thank the representatives of German civil 
society for their support during the mission, in particular representatives of churches and 
faiths, as well as non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders, lawyers, 
academics and jurists, for the information and assistance they provided. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group held various meetings with federal and state authorities in 
Berlin, Hamburg, Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. It met with senior authorities from the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches of the State, including the Federal Government 
Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, Markus L&#246;ning, and other 
officials representing the Federal Foreign Office; Parliamentary State Secretary in the 
Federal Ministry of the Interior Ole Schr&#246;der; the State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of 
Justice, Birgit Grundmann; Eva Hugo, J&#252;rgen Mez, Frank Mengel, Jakob Sperl, Roland 
Brunger, Thomas Plank, Bernhard B&#246;hm, Hans-J&#246;rg Behrens, Christian Meiners and J&#246;rg 
Filipponi, officials representing the Ministry of Justice; representatives from the Federal 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; and representatives from the Federal Ministry for 
Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (among them, Ralf Busch). 
</p>
<p>5. In Berlin, the Working Group was also received by representatives of the Local 
Court of Berlin Tiergarten; by a judge at the Higher Regional Court; and by representatives 
of the Senate Department for the Interior and Sport. It also met with the President of the 
Federal Police Regional Office, officials from the Ministry of Defence, and staff of the 
German Institute for Human Rights, including the Director, Beate Rudolf. 
</p>
<p>6. In the State of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg, the Working Group met with judges of the 
Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, including Andreas L. Paulus, Erik Goetze, 
Andreas Stadler and Andreas Sturm. It also met with the Presiding Judge of the Federal 
Court of Justice, Justice Sost-Scheible, Ms. Haubmann and Federal Judge Sander. In </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>Stuttgart, the delegation met with the Presiding Judge of the Local Court, Justice Brigitte 
Legler, and Judge Gerhard Gauch.  
</p>
<p>7. In Hamburg, the Working Group met with the Presiding Judge of the Regional 
Superior Court, Sibylle Umlauf; the State Attorney General, Holger Lund, and Senior 
Public Prosecutor, Janhenning Kuhn; the State Secretary of the Senate Department of 
Justice and Gender Equality, Ralf Kleindiek; Senior Public Prosecutor Eva Maria 
Ogiermann and lawyer Jonas Finke; Stefan Lengefeld and other representatives of the 
Senate Department of Health, Environment and Consumer Protection; officials representing 
the Senate Department for the Interior and Sport; and police authorities Jost-Wilhelm 
Willemer, Wolfang Brand and Jens Stammer. The Working Group also held a meeting with 
representatives of the Hamburg Association of Defence Lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the institutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and institutional system 
</b></p>
<p>8. Germany is a parliamentary democracy. Its Constitution, known as the Basic Law, 
was promulgated on 23 May 1949. At the federal level, the legislative power is vested both 
in the Federal Diet or Bundestag (598 seats) and the Federal Council or Bundesrat (69 
members). The Bundestag is elected by popular vote for a four-year term under a system of 
personalized proportional representation, which combines the election of individual 
constituency candidates in a first-past-the-post mode with the election of party lists on the 
level of the states (<i>L&#228;nder</i>) by proportional representation. The Head of the Government, 
the Chancellor, is elected by the Bundestag.   
</p>
<p>9. The legal system of Germany may be considered a civil law system. The judicial 
system includes ordinary courts (local courts, regional courts, higher regional courts and the 
Federal Court of Justice) and four types of specialized courts: administrative, labour and 
social (each with three levels of jurisdiction) and fiscal (two levels of jurisdiction). The 
Federal Constitutional Court reviews laws to ensure their compatibility with the 
Constitution and adjudicates disputes between different branches of government on 
questions of competences. It also has jurisdiction to decide claims based on the 
infringement of a person&#8217;s basic constitutional rights by a public authority. Half of the 
</p>
<p>judges of the Federal Constitutional Court are elected by the Bundestag and half by the 
Bundesrat.  
</p>
<p>10. The national human rights infrastructure in Germany comprises, in addition to a 
differentiated and specialized court system, active human rights institutions and civil 
society organizations, including the German Institute for Human Rights, which serves as 
the national human rights institution, and the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency (ADS) 
created in 2006. 
</p>
<p>11. The 16 states enjoy autonomy, particularly regarding law enforcement and the 
courts. The police are organized at the state level. The jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal 
Police Office is limited to counter-terrorism, international organized crime, narcotics 
trafficking, weapons smuggling and currency counterfeiting. Most institutions for the 
incarceration of detainees are the responsibility of the states.   
</p>
<p>12. The Federal Agency for the Prevention of Torture and the Joint Commission of the 
States (L&#228;nder) for the prevention of torture make up the national preventive mechanism 
required by under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Only institutions under federal 
jurisdiction, namely, the Federal Defence Forces of Germany, the federal police and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>Customs, fall under the mandate of the Federal Agency for the Prevention of Torture. Other 
institutions, such as police stations, psychiatric hospitals and prisons, lie within the 
jurisdiction of the Joint Commission.  
</p>
<p>13. The German Institute for Human Rights was established in March 2001 as an 
independent national human rights institution and given &#8213;A&#8214; status by the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights two years later. However, the Institute does not enjoy the powers to 
investigate complaints, conduct national enquiries and formulate recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>14. Germany is a party to the core universal international human rights treaties (see 
appendix II). It has recognized the specific competences contained in article 14 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(individual complaints); in articles 8 and 9 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (inquiry procedure) and in 
articles 20, 21 and 22 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the inquiry procedure, inter-State complaints and 
individual complaints, respectively).  
</p>
<p>15. However, Germany is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>16. Concerning the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Germany has 
submitted declarations or reservations to articles 14, paragraph 3 (d); 14, paragraph 5; 15, 
paragraph 1; 19; 21 and 22 in conjunction with article 2, paragraph 1; as well as to article 5, 
paragraph 2 (a) of the first Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>17. Germany has formally acknowledged the full applicability of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to persons subjected to its jurisdiction in situations 
where its troops or police forces operate abroad.  
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group was told during its visit that German legislation and jurisdiction 
only rarely refer explicitly to international human rights norms. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Judicial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention. Article 2, paragraph 2, of the 
Constitution states that freedom of the person is inviolable. Article 104, paragraph 2, adds 
that only judges may decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Police officers 
must bring a person detained before a judge no later than the day after his or her arrest. 
They may arrest an individual only on the basis of a judicial warrant issued by a competent 
judicial authority, with the exception of cases in flagrante delicto (when the suspect is 
arrested in the act of committing an offense or when the police have strong reasons to 
believe that the individual intends to commit a crime). The court must charge the individual 
at the latest by the end of the day following the arrest.  
</p>
<p>20. The usual practice is to release detainees unless there is a clear danger of flight 
outside the country. Bail is infrequently imposed. Authorities can hold detainees for the 
duration of the investigation and subsequent trial, subject to judicial review. If a court 
acquits a defendant who was held in detention, the Government compensates the defendant 
for financial losses as well as for moral prejudice due to incarceration. Detention is 
executed by the states. Detainees have the right to challenge their detention at any time. 
They have the right to appeal before a regional Court of Appeal. If the Court of Appeal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>considers that the detention should be maintained, it is possible to file an appeal before the 
Federal High Court.  
</p>
<p>21. The Constitution provides for the right to a fair and public trial. The law entitles a 
detainee to prompt access to an attorney. The required appointment of defence counsel ex 
officio does not depend on an accused&#8217;s financial circumstances, but rather on whether the 
</p>
<p>circumstances described in section 140, paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1-8, or paragraph 2, of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung, or StPO) apply. Also taken into 
account are the circumstances described in section 140, paragraph 2, relating to the severity 
of the offence, the difficulty of the factual or legal situation, and evidence indicating that 
the accused cannot defend himself or herself. The latter is determined by the accused&#8217;s 
mental capacity, his or her health condition or other circumstances of the case, for example 
if the accused is a foreigner with comprehension difficulties that cannot be overcome 
through the use of an interpreter. Defendants and their attorneys have access to all court-
held evidence related to their cases. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and have 
a right of appeal.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Positive aspects 
</b></p>
<p>22. With regard to its findings, the Working Group would like to commend the 
Government for the positive efforts it has made, particularly through legislative reforms, to 
improve the situation of deprivation of liberty in Germany. The Working Group observed 
that all detainees with whom it met expressed they had a good relationship with detention 
facility staff. The infrastructure of detention facilities all conformed to international 
standards. In Berlin, the Working Group found laws and regulations providing for the 
protection of persons with special needs, such as disabled people, elderly persons, pregnant 
women, victims of violence, and traumatized persons.  
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group was also informed of a number of important initiatives 
regarding collaboration between the police and education departments to respond to the 
underlying factors that have an impact on criminality. This inter-agency approach to 
address the socio-economic causes of offences and offending behaviour and its impact to 
date in reducing crime is of vital importance, and one that could be disseminated and shared 
beyond Germany. The Working Group would like to seek further information in this regard 
and recommends wide replication of the approach. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group notes that human rights are protected in Germany by an 
independent and impartial court system, with assistance from active non-governmental 
organizations. Among the good practices it observed is the establishment in Hamburg of an 
independent special commission for investigation of police officers in cases of alleged 
misconduct or alleged ill-treatment. The abrogation of the obligation of head teachers and 
hospital authorities to report children of irregular immigrants receiving education or 
emergency medical treatment is also a positive change. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group was informed that out of the estimated total number of 
prisoners (69,385), 10,864 are in remand detention, including an estimated 374 juveniles 
(statistics for 2011). This is a low rate in comparative terms. Of those in remand detention, 
some 3,000 have been detained for less than six months; another 4,000 have been detained 
for less than one year. A total of 487 persons are in preventive detention (see paras. 28 to 
37 below).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Working Group notes that the Government concluded a broad modification in 
the Aliens Act, to include measures for the protection of victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>27. Notwithstanding these positive achievements, the Working Group would like to 
raise the following issues for the attention of the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Preventive detention  
</b></p>
<p>28. The term &#8213;<i>Sicherungsverwahrung</i>&#8214; describes the situation of detainees who have 
already served their sentences and are detained subsequently (preventive detention). Courts 
may foresee this measure initially during sentencing (foreseen preventive detention), or 
later, when the prisoner is deemed to represent a danger to society for reasons that were 
unknown at the time of his or her sentencing (post-sentence preventive detention). On 2 
December 2010, a new law on post-sentence preventive detention was passed by 
Parliament, taking into account the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights of 
17 December 2009 (<i>M. v. Germany</i>, application No. 19359/04). The Court stated that post-
sentence preventive detention is subject to the ban on retroactivity in a strict sense. To date, 
however, the Court has not ruled out foreseen preventive detention.   
</p>
<p>29. The European Court of Human Rights has never objected to the current detention 
regime itself, nor have other international bodies. It has restricted itself to the consideration 
that post-sentence preventive detention was to be regarded as a &#8213;penalty&#8214; in terms of the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and 
therefore subject to its ban on retroactivity. The Court did not rule out preventive detention 
in general. The ongoing reform was initiated by the Federal Constitutional Court in a ruling 
issued on 4 May 2011. The Working Group points out that compliance with international 
and European human rights standards now depends on the way in which the Federal 
Constitutional Court&#8217;s judgments are followed up, in the first instance, in legislation. It has 
</p>
<p>been explained that this depends on action by both federal and state legislators, and the 
Working Group was apprised of the work thus far, including the conclusions reached at a 
conference of the Ministers of Justice at both levels the week before the Working Group&#8217;s 
visit commenced. In order to comply with international and European human rights 
standards, the Constitutional Court&#8217;s requirements for the standards of the detention regime 
must be followed, in particular so that the conditions satisfy the proportionality 
requirements; this entails establishing a difference between preventive detention and an 
ordinary prison sentence. The Council of Europe procedures for the implementation of 
judgments, new cases before international courts and other human rights bodies, and further 
international monitoring will continue to contribute to this process. The continuing dialogue 
initiated with the Government during the visit may be of assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group&#8217;s visits to prisons in three German states have highlighted the 
challenges in making the regime or conditions of post-sentence preventive detention clearly 
different from the normal prison conditions.  
</p>
<p>31. During its visit the Working Group was able to interview several detainees subjected 
to the preventive detention regime, particularly in Hamburg Fuhlsb&#252;ttel Prison. These 
persons had already served their sentences, but continued to be deprived of their liberty 
because it was deemed that they still represented a danger to society. In some cases, the 
possibility of preventive detention had been foreseen in their initial sentencing. In other 
cases, preventive detention was subsequently established because it was considered that 
those persons constituted a danger for society for reasons that were unknown at the time of 
their sentencing. The detainees interviewed in the various prison and detention institutions 
visited showed scepticism as to the prospect of achieving a different regime.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>32. During the course of its visit, the Working Group was also provided with 
information supporting allegations that preventive detention was being used in cases of 
social disorder in which the requirements, both statutory and of the Federal Constitutional 
Court, for such detention were not met. In one instance, a woman who had completed a 
medium-length sentence was being kept in preventive detention because she was suffering 
from a social disorder. Her detention conditions were different than those of other inmates 
serving criminal sentences, and there did not seem to be any prospect of any specific 
procedures being initiated for her release. This is one example of the types of cases in 
which compliance with the constitutional and international requirements will require 
monitoring. 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group also raises the issue of retroactivity. Article 11, paragraph 2, of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that a penalty heavier than the one that 
was applicable at the time the penal offence was committed cannot be imposed. Article 15, 
paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that &#8213;no 
one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which 
did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it 
was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at 
the time when the criminal offence was committed&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>34. It is clear from the decision of 17 December 2009 of the European Court of Human 
Rights that, contrary to the long-standing domestic consensus in Germany, post-sentence 
preventive detention was to be regarded as a &#8213;penalty&#8214; in terms of the European 
Convention on Human Rights. The quoted decision was the first one ever to challenge the 
domestic consensus. German legislators reacted to that decision by introducing a law that 
was passed at the end of 2010. The issue of post-sentence preventive detention was 
recognized as highly problematic in all the meetings with government legal officials in 
federal and state ministries, prosecutors, prison officials and judges. Concerns regarding 
this issue are plentiful and well documented. The issue of retroactivity in the strict sense of 
the term was raised after the decision of the European Court of Human Rights. This is a 
fundamental rights issue that should not depend on European or international supervision to 
be set right. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group notes that the Constitutional Court has maintained that the 
German constitutional concept of punishment does not follow that of international human 
rights law as expressed by the European Court of Human Rights, a view with which the 
Working Group concurs. Namely, the latter Court&#8217;s interpretation of the European 
Convention on Human Rights gives effect to international law, according to which post-
sentence preventive detention is a penalty for which a strict ban on retroactivity applies. 
However, the Working Group recognizes the practical problems of declaring that the 
German legislation was in violation of the German ban on retroactive penalties, for instance 
with regard to the release of detainees. 
</p>
<p>36. The solution implemented by the German Constitutional Court, that is, invoking 
legitimate expectations instead of the ban on retroactivity, avoids automatic releases but 
requires a review of the terms and conditions of the individual detentions. The Working 
Group is not concerned with the interpretation of the German Constitution as such, which is 
for the Federal Constitutional Court. However, it is concerned that priority has not been 
given to international law and its ban on retroactive penalties. Instead, priority was given to 
the concept of legitimate expectations included in German law.  
</p>
<p>37. The Constitutional Court, in its May 2011 judgment, set out a mechanism for 
compliance with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights on retroactivity. This 
also has to be given effect, and the time limits set by the Constitutional Court require swift 
action.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> C. The uneven use of restraints 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Working Group visited first instance courts and interviewed magistrates, judges, 
prosecutors, defence advocates, police officials, prisoners and detainees. One issue of 
concern is the use of restraints, such as handcuffs and shackling, in remand hearings. The 
general proportionality test applied seems to be in conformity with fair trial and other 
relevant international standards. The issue of concern is the uneven application of restraints, 
with clear differences among the local courts that the Working Group visited. 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group recommends that the use of restraints be monitored. Guidelines 
may provide assistance at different levels, also for the judges who must apply the relevant 
proportionality test. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Patients detained for medical treatment 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Working Group is impressed by the active constitutional dialogue over human 
rights that takes place in the German legislative and judicial process. However, it notes that 
new legislation, such as the Therapieunterbringungsgesetz (the Act that contains provisions 
for forcibly detaining patients for therapeutic treatment), raises some concerns. The 
legislation provides for the detention of a person in a closed institution when she or he is 
considered &#8213;highly likely&#8214; (&#8213;<i>mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit</i>&#8214;) to harm life, sexual self-
determination or personal freedom or cause bodily harm, thereby &#8213;severely impacting&#8214; 
(&#8213;<i>erheblich beeintr&#228;chtigen</i>&#8214;) others. Pressure on psychiatric diagnostics, given the 
uncertainty as to what constitutes a mental disturbance in medicine and in law, and the 
questionable prospects of treatment or therapy in instances where there is no recognized 
treatment are issues that need further attention and clarity. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Foreigners in detention 
</b></p>
<p>41. Another area of interest and concern for the Working Group is the phenomenon of a 
significantly disproportionate number of detainees who are foreign or Germans of foreign 
origin. Remand detention is too easily ordered for foreigners, under the rationale of a lack 
of local connections. Foreigners and Germans of foreign origin constitute a high proportion 
of remand detainees. In Berlin, the delegation was informed that 45 per cent of detainees 
were foreigners, representing 55 different nationalities; in Stuttgart, 30 per cent of inmates 
were foreigners; in one court hearing attended, three of five juveniles were foreigners, and 
in holding cells at the court on the day, all were foreigners; in Hamburg, of 404 remand 
detainees, 249 were of non-German origin. With regard to assessing flight risk, the 
Government does not differentiate between residence in a European Union State and 
residence in other States; that is, European Union nationals are not considered to represent 
less of a flight risk within the meaning of section 112, paragraph 2, subparagraph 2, of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, as to do otherwise would represent a violation of the 
prohibition against discrimination under European law. German case law also recognizes 
that residence abroad&#8212;be it on the part of a German or a foreigner&#8212;does not ipso facto 
constitute a danger of flight.  
</p>
<p>42. The disproportionately high numbers of foreigners in detention raises a number of 
important questions from a socio-legal perspective. Causes and factors that possibly 
contribute to such a profile of the detained population, may include, inter alia, the residence 
and immigration laws in Germany; the vulnerable socio-economic position of the group; 
and/or a lack of language skills and social support.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The criteria used to determine who is to be held in pretrial detention can also have 
an adverse impact on foreigners, as one of the deciding factors is whether the detainee has 
any links, including friends and family, to hold him or her in the city or country and hence 
prevent him or her from jumping pretrial bail or release. Here the judicial system works 
against foreigners, as it is easily argued that they have no ties to the city or country and may 
flee. Hence the large numbers of foreigners in pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>44. Foreigners who unlawfully reside in Germany and who have been expelled with 
final and binding effect are subject to detention pending deportation. Not being in 
possession of a valid visa or such visa being expired are criminal offences in and of 
themselves. However, unauthorized residence alone does not necessarily lead to the 
imposition of a prison sentence. According to section 95, paragraph 1, of the Residence Act 
(Aufenthaltsgesetz), the statutory sentencing range for unauthorized residence is a prison 
sentence of up to one year or a fine. The imposition of a prison sentence is an exception, 
that is, imposed as a last resort. Authorities reported that in 2010, there were about 2,700 
convictions for unauthorized residence; only in 251 of these cases were prison sentences 
handed down, and of those, 181 were commuted to a suspended sentence. In other words, in 
only 70 of a total of 2,700 cases did the convicted person have to serve a prison sentence 
solely on the grounds that they had violated residence regulations. 
</p>
<p>45. Similarly, the Working Group notes that when a foreigner is detained for a petty 
theft or other offence the situation becomes aggravated if the foreigner is a migrant with 
irregular status. Sections 112, 112 (a) and 113 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide 
that the commission of a criminal offence is not ipso facto sufficient grounds for ordering 
remand detention. The Working Group is concerned that immigrants are more prone to 
being detained and arrested due to the very fact that they are foreign. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Foreigners awaiting deportation 
</b></p>
<p>46. Persons awaiting deportation is a further category of foreigners held in detention. On 
6 July 2011, the Committee on Internal Affairs of the German Parliament adopted a draft 
law on, inter alia, the revision of the Residence Act for the purpose of implementing 
European Union Directive 2008/115/EG on common standards and procedures in Member 
States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (the European Return 
Directive). The Directive stipulates special proportionality requirements that must be met to 
ensure the legality of the detention order. 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group was informed that there are specific statutory requirements for 
the imposition of pre-deportation detention, especially with regard to proportionality. 
Section 62 of the Residence Act stipulates that detention pending deportation of more than 
six months up to a maximum 18 months is only permissible if the person concerned is 
attempting to evade deportation. Authorities are obliged by law to do everything to carry 
out the deportation as quickly as possible. Although according to the European Union 
Directive the use of pre-deportation detention is supposed to be a last resort, the Working 
Group received information that detention pending deportation, in practice, is often 
imposed too readily and for too long. If the authorities fail to comply with their obligation 
to accelerate matters, courts may not impose detention pending deportation. The Working 
Group considers that the resort to the detention of minors for the purpose of their 
deportation seems disproportionate, especially in the case of unaccompanied minors. The 
best interests of the child should be a priority, in accordance with the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (art. 3, para. 1). 
</p>
<p>48. Germany has a population of approximately 82 million, of which about 7 million are 
foreigners. The Working Group was informed that, at the time of its visit, about 7,600 
foreigners were awaiting deportation. While an average of 7,700 foreigners have been </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>deported each year, the number has been decreasing annually. Once the detainees have 
served their prison sentences, they are held in immigration detention centres for a 
maximum of 18 months while awaiting deportation to their countries of origin. Many 
foreigners reach the 18-month detention limit, after which they have to be released with a 
&#8213;tolerated status&#8214; (<i>Duldung</i>). This tolerated status is a short-term measure, which leaves 
those beneficiaries vulnerable to be deported any time. The governmental institutions for 
law and order and justice appear to be aware of the problem. 
</p>
<p>49. Migrants and persons of non-German origin tend to live as groups in 
neighbourhoods with high migrant populations. Since these neighbourhoods normally 
constitute some of the most socio-economically vulnerable areas of towns and cities, it is 
important to try and integrate them into wider society by raising the residents&#8217; awareness of 
their rights and obligations and of the legal and judicial system, and by increasing 
opportunities for better social mobility. The delegation was informed that the police are 
working with schools and other institutions to achieve this goal. The Working Group agrees 
that good social policy is an effective method of crime prevention, and would be interested 
in receiving more information regarding these initiatives throughout the country, and any 
reviews of such programmes.  
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group was informed that 10 to 15 per cent of police officers in 
Hamburg are of non-German origin, representing 40 different nationalities.  
</p>
<p>51. With regard to punishment for illegal entry to Germany, the detention of foreigners 
for having crossed the border illegally, coupled with harsh sentencing, raises again the issue 
of proportionality and how this needs to be carefully addressed and remedied by the 
Government. These are examples of situations where alternatives to detention can be used.  
</p>
<p>52. Citizens of countries with a strong consular presence can be deported relatively 
easily. However, those nationals whose countries do not have a consulate in German cities, 
or whose Governments refuse to intervene, may stay in detention for the maximum 
allowable period (see para. 48).  
</p>
<p><b> G. </b>The &#8220;fa<b>st-</b>track&#8221; procedure at airports<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. The &#8213;fast-track&#8214; procedure is an accelerated process for asylum applicants from 
countries considered to be &#8213;safe States&#8214; of origin and asylum applicants without 
identification papers who try to enter Germany via an international airport. It is intended to 
make possible a prompt decision in simple cases, in which it is evident that the asylum 
application is manifestly unfounded and the Federal Office for Migrants and Refugees can 
determine this within two days. The Working Group is concerned about this fast-track 
procedure, particularly at Frankfurt Airport. According to information received by the 
Working Group, if the application for political asylum is rejected, the applicant has only 
three days to appeal to the Administrative Court. This period seems to be insufficient to 
allow the applicant to prepare her or his appeal. The Working Group also notes that 
according to the German Asylum Procedure Act, unaccompanied children aged 16 and 17 
may be required to undertake the asylum procedures as adults, without the assistance of a 
guardian. The authorities reported that this airport procedure is, in practice, used with 
restraint. For example, in 2011, of 772 asylum applications submitted at Frankfurt Airport, 
only 58 cases were decided using the airport procedure, that is, within two days. The 
applicants who have been denied asylum are immediately given the opportunity to contact a 
legal counsel of their choice, and they may be provided with legal advice free of charge. 
For unaccompanied minor asylum applicants, a curator is appointed by the Youth Welfare 
Office. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>54. Concerning the transfer of deportees, the Working Group considers that there needs 
to be clarity about which European Union State is responsible for asylum claims in cases of 
transfer. Often people are transferred for deportation purposes, against their will, to 
countries that may not be their country of origin. The Working Group considers that an 
individual risk assessment should be requested to process forcible returns. The risk of 
persecution and discrimination in countries of origin should also be conscientiously 
evaluated. This evaluation should include the consideration of essential economic and 
social rights, such as access to health care, education and housing. 
</p>
<p>55. The authorities pointed out that the detention in the transit area of an international 
airport during the airport procedure does not constitute imprisonment. The foreigner is only 
prevented from entering Germany, but not from continuing his or her journey on another 
plane. The Federal Constitutional Court upheld the airport procedure in its decision of 14 
May 1996, case No. 2 BvR 1516/93. The Working Group notes that immigration detainees, 
particularly in Hamburg, should be accommodated in centres specifically designated for 
that purpose and not in prisons. 
</p>
<p>56. Given that its mandate covers the protection of asylum-seekers, immigrants and 
refugees against arbitrary deprivation of liberty, the Working Group requests the 
Government to ensure that the rights of these individuals are fully protected in accordance 
with international human rights standards. It requests the Government to ensure that 
individual procedural guarantees are granted to individuals immediately upon their 
detention, and to pay particular attention to issues such as interpretation, legal counselling 
and the provision of information, such as on the right to seek asylum. Detention should also 
be used as a last resort and applied in exceptional cases, for a clearly specified reason and 
for the shortest possible duration. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Human rights are protected in Germany by an independent, solid and 
impartial court system, with the assistance of an active civil society and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations. The Working Group notes the positive efforts the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government has made, particularly through legislative reforms, to improve the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of deprivation of liberty in Germany. A number of important initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding collaboration between the police and education departments have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken to respond to factors impacting on criminality. This inter-agency approach to 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing socio-economic causes of offences and offending behaviour and its impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>to date in reducing crime should be widely disseminated. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Working Group notes a number of positive aspects with respect to the 
institutions and laws safeguarding against occurrences of arbitrary deprivation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>liberty. In this regard, the abrogation of the obligation of head teachers and hospital 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities to report children of irregular immigrants receiving education or 
</b></p>
<p><b>emergency medical treatment deserves to be mentioned. Among the good practices, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group also notes the establishment in Hamburg of an independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>special commission for the investigation of police officers in cases of alleged 
</b></p>
<p><b>misconduct or alleged ill-treatment.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Working Group has some concerns with regard to the preventive detention 
system, in which persons who have already served their sentences are held deprived of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their liberty because it is deemed that they continue to represent a danger for society. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group notes that, in some cases, the possibility of preventive detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>was foreseen in the initial sentences. However, in other cases, preventive detention has 
</b></p>
<p><b>been applied subsequently in situations in which the prisoner is deemed to represent a </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p><b>danger for society for reasons that were unknown at the time of her or his sentencing. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Post-sentence preventive detention is to be regarded as a penalty and is therefore 
</b></p>
<p><b>subject to the ban on retroactivity in a strict sense. The Federal Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements for the standards of the detention regime should be followed, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular so that the conditions satisfy the proportionality requirements by 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing a difference between post-sentence preventive detention and an ordinary 
</b></p>
<p><b>prison sentence.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Working Group would like to note that during its meetings with detainees 
(who included detainees being held in pretrial detention, detainees who had been 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentenced and detainees who had been subjected to the preventive detention regime), 
</b></p>
<p><b>it did not receive any complaint of ill-treatment against detention facility personnel or 
</b></p>
<p><b>police officials. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Working Group notes with concern the uneven use of restraints, such as 
handcuffs and shackling, in remand hearings, with clear differences among the local 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts that the Working Group visited.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>It also observes with concern the application of new legislation with regard to 
the detention of patients for medical treatment, such as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Therapieunterbringungsgesetz, in instances where there is no recognized medical 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment. This legislation provides for the detention of a person in a closed institution 
</b></p>
<p><b>when he or she is considered likely to make an attempt against his or her own life, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>against the sexual self-determination or personal freedom of others, or cause bodily 
</b></p>
<p><b>harm. The treatment provided for in the Therapieunterbringungsgesetz should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at addressing the cause of the mental disorder. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Working Group notes the disproportionate number of foreigners and 
Germans of foreign origin in detention. Remand detention seems to be too easily 
</b></p>
<p><b>ordered for foreigners under the rationale of a lack of local connections. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomenon may be due to factors such as the residence and immigration laws, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable socio-economic position of many such detainees, and/or a lack of language 
</b></p>
<p><b>skills or social support. The criteria used to determine who is to be held in pretrial 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention can also have an adverse impact on foreigners. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Foreigners who unlawfully reside in Germany and have been expelled with 
final and binding effect are subject to detention pending deportation. Migrants are 
</b></p>
<p><b>more prone to being arrested and detained due to the very fact of being foreigners in 
</b></p>
<p><b>an irregular situation. Not being in possession of a valid visa or such visa being 
</b></p>
<p><b>expired are criminal offences in and of themselves. The detention of foreigners for 
</b></p>
<p><b>having crossed the border illegally, coupled with harsh sentencing, raises the issue of 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportionality. 
</b></p>
<p>65. Concerning the &#8220;fast<b>-</b>track&#8221; airport procedure, particularly <b>at Frankfurt 
Airport, the Working Group considers that, even if foreigners are immediately given 
</b></p>
<p><b>the opportunity to contact a legal counsel of their choice, the three-day period to 
</b></p>
<p><b>appeal the rejection of a request for political asylum to the Administrative Court does 
</b></p>
<p><b>not seem to be sufficient to allow the applicant to prepare her or his appeal. Detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be used only as a last resort and applied in exceptional cases, for a clearly 
</b></p>
<p><b>specified reason and for the shortest possible duration. The risk of persecution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination in countries of origin should be conscientiously evaluated. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Working Group reiterates its thanks to the Government for the 
cooperation extended during its visit on official mission. It has been impressed by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>openness, sincerity and honesty of </b>the Government&#8217;s <b>various institutions and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner in which they gave the delegation access to persons in prisons, detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>centres, psychiatric hospitals, courts and police stations.  </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> VI.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Working Group encourages the Government to continue in its efforts to 
ensure that its institutional and legal framework regarding deprivation of liberty fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>conforms to the human rights standards enshrined in international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and in its legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes the following 
recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) All appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that deprivation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>liberty is only used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible time; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) States (L&#228;nder) should consider the model of independent special 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissions for the investigation of police officers in cases of alleged misconduct or 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged ill-treatment, such as that established in Hamburg;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Concerning the post-sentence preventive detention regime, the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group recommends that the Government give full effect to the mechanism set out by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Federal Constitutional Court in its May 2011 judgement for the compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the decision of the European Court of Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The use of restraints, such as handcuffs and shackling, in remand 
</b></p>
<p><b>hearings should be monitored; guidelines would provide assistance in the application 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the relevant proportionality test; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The use of alternatives to detention for foreigners who are not in 
</b></p>
<p><b>possession of a valid visa or whose visa is expired should always be considered; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The issue of proportionality in the detention of foreigners for illegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>entry to the country or for illegal border crossing, coupled with harsh sentencing, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be carefully addressed;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) An individual risk assessment should be requested to process forcible 
</b></p>
<p><b>returns of foreigners, particularly in the cases of foreigners requesting political 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum. The risk of persecution and discrimination in countries of origin should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluated, and essential economic and social rights should be considered;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The Government should consider extending the mandate of the German 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institute for Human Rights to structural and factual monitoring, as well as its 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultative role in the process of drafting legislation with human rights relevance. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Institute should be allocated adequate human, financial and technical resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Government should consider promulgating a binding legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulation by the Parliament establishing that the Convention on the Rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Child and its Optional Protocols have priority over alien and asylum laws.   </b></p>
