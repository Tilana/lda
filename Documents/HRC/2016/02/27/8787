<p><b>  Report of the Secretary-General on measures taken to 
implement resolution 9/8 and obstacles to its implementation, 
including recommendations for further improving the

system</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 9/8 entitled &#8220;Effective implementation of international human rights 
instruments&#8221;, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to report annually 
on measures taken to implement that resolution and on obstacles to its implementation, 
including recommendations for further improving the effectiveness of, harmonizing, and 
reforming the treaty body system. This report briefly highlights the most recent 
developments in this regard. 
</p>
<p>2. Information regarding the twenty-first meeting of the chairpersons of human rights 
treaty bodies, held in Geneva on 2 and 3 July 2009, has been submitted to the sixty-fourth 
session of the General Assembly pursuant to its resolution 57/202. This report (A/64/276) 
also includes information on the outcomes of the eighth and ninth Inter-Committee 
Meetings.  
</p>
<p>3. During 2009, human rights treaty bodies held 20 sessions amounting to 64 weeks in  
Geneva and New York (each session lasting between one and four weeks), during which 
103 State party reports were reviewed in plenary sessions and an equivalent number in 
working groups, where such groups exist. The Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women held one of its sessions in two chambers and the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination extended one of its sessions by one week to 
address the backlog of reports awaiting review. Treaty bodies received during 2009 a total 
of 150 State party reports. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities held 
its first two sessions in 2009 and commenced work on its rules of procedures and working 
methods.  
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission 
</p>

<p>4. The treaty bodies continued their work to finalize treaty-specific reporting 
guidelines to complement the guidelines for the common core document. In 2009, the 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted its treaty-specific reporting 
guidelines and the Human Rights Committee started its work in this regard. Treaty bodies 
continued to develop, improve and implement such new working methods as establishing 
the list of issues prior to reporting and refining the follow-up procedures to concluding 
observations and views on petitions. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child adopted new general comments. Treaty bodies and the Secretariat 
continued efforts to harmonize and standardize their work, including through the three-day 
ninth and tenth Inter-Committee Meetings of the Human Rights Treaty Bodies and the two-
day twenty-first meeting of the chairpersons.  
</p>
<p>5. Treaty bodies and the Secretariat examined some 9,000 items of correspondence and 
over 110 new individual complaints received by the treaty bodies were registered. The 
Human Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women examined and adopted final decisions on some 100 
communications. They issued over 30 requests for interim measures of protection in cases 
where lack of such protection might lead to irreparable harm for the petitioners. They also 
followed up on over 50 decisions in which violations of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture or the Convention on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women had been found. In 2009, the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
undertook three country visits to Cambodia, Honduras and Paraguay. 
</p>
<p>6. Four meetings of States parties took place in Geneva or New York during 2009, 
essentially to hold elections to fill seats for which mandates had terminated (the Human 
Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families). In the case of the Committee on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the membership expanded 
to 14 members following the entry into force of the Convention for the forty-first State 
party in July 2009 and its meeting of States parties thus also elected experts to fill the new 
seats. During 2009, human rights treaty bodies also had six informal meetings with States 
parties which were widely attended and provided an opportunity for States parties and 
treaty bodies to discuss the most recent developments in the work of treaty bodies, as well 
as other matters of common interest, in particular the efforts of treaty bodies to improve 
their working methods (the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
Human Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Subcommittee on 
Prevention, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families). An open-ended 
working group of the Human Rights Council on an optional protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure met from 14 to 18 
December 2009.1 
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR updated the training tool (DVD) on the work of the treaty bodies, entitled 
&#8220;Bringing human rights home&#8221;, which will also be made available in all United Nations 
official languages. The Office also conducted training workshops on treaty body reporting 
and follow-up in Burundi, Djibouti, the Maldives, Niger, Serbia and the Seychelles, as well 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The report of the working group was submitted to the thirteenth session of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>to be held in March 2010 (A/HRC/13/43). </p>


<p>as regional workshops in Mali (in cooperation with the International Organization of the 
Francophonie for 13 French-speaking West African countries) and Thailand (for the 
Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand). A regional judicial colloquium was also 
organized in Thailand (for Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand). 
</p>
<p>8. On 14 September 2009, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem 
Pillay, in her statement to the Human Rights Council, inter alia, underscored the importance 
of the treaty bodies, both through their reporting and individual complaints mechanisms, as 
well as through the universal periodic review process. She highlighted that the overall 
success of the human rights protection system, marked by the increase in the number of 
human rights instruments and corresponding monitoring bodies, together with greater 
compliance by States parties with reporting obligations, posed greater demands on the 
treaty bodies and her Office. She stated that, while that success was most welcome and 
encouraging, States parties should accede to human rights treaties and other stakeholders to 
initiate a process of reflection on how to streamline and strengthen the treaty body system 
to achieve better coordination among these mechanisms and in their interaction with special 
procedures and the universal periodic review. The High Commissioner made a similar 
appeal before the General Assembly on 21 October 2009. 
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR organized with the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in cooperation 
with other partners, the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention of the 
Rights of the Child. For the anniversary, 700 delegates, including high-level dignitaries, 
children and young people (more than 60 States and 130 non-governmental organizations 
and academic institutions were represented) deliberated on three themes &#8220;Dignity, 
Development and Dialogue&#8221; in six workshops from 8 to 9 October 2009 and came up with 
recommendations, which were adopted by the Committee at its fifty-third session in 
January 2010. Furthermore, OHCHR organized a series of events with United Nations 
Development Fund for Women and the United Nations regional commissions at national 
and regional level (Bangkok, Banjul, Buenos Aires, Geneva and Istanbul) to commemorate 
the thirtieth anniversary of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women in the context of the 15-year review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform 
for Action. These celebrations culminated in a global event held on 3 December 2009 at 
United Nations Headquarters in New York attended by the Secretary-General, the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women. The event brought together speakers from around the 
world who shared examples of how the Convention has been used to implement women&#8217;s 
human rights and achieve gender equality in their countries, including though the 
application of the Optional Protocol to the Convention, which celebrated its tenth 
anniversary in 2009. Furthermore, OHCHR also organized a three-day expert workshop for 
members of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights from 28 to 30 October 
2009 in order to support the Committee&#8217;s future work under the new Optional Protocol of 
the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The expert seminar entitled 
&#8220;Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights: future role of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights&#8221; brought together various experts from several countries, including Argentina, 
Colombia, India and South Africa, that have sustained experience in adjudicating individual 
complaints in domestic courts in the field of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>10. From 29 November to 2 December 2010, the tenth Inter-Committee Meeting of the 
Human Rights Treaty Bodies was held in Geneva. Three representatives of each treaty body 
were invited. The Inter-Committee Meeting had on its agenda two particular issues: follow-
up to concluding observations and decisions and the universal periodic review. The meeting 
mostly looked at how treaty bodies could strengthen, harmonize and develop their follow-
up procedures under the reporting process, as well as under the individual communications 
process. Currently, four committees have formally established follow-up procedures: the </p>


<p>Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 
Committee against Torture, and more recently the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women.  The meeting also discussed ways to enhance inquiries and 
visits under existing procedures established by some of the core international human rights 
treaties. As starting point for their discussions, the meeting&#8217;s participants were provided 
with two background papers by the Secretariat: an overview of follow-up procedures under 
the reporting procedure (HRI/ICM/2009/6) and one on follow-up procedures under the 
individual communications procedure (HRI/ICM/2009/7). The full report of the meeting 
will be submitted along with the forthcoming report of the eleventh Inter-Committee 
Meeting to the twenty-second meeting of chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies, that 
will convene in Geneva from 28 June to 2 July 2010 (pursuant to General Assembly 
resolution 49/178). It will contain points of agreement as suggested by the tenth Inter-
Committee Meeting.
