</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 10/17 
of 26 March 2009, in which the Council inter alia called upon  Israel, the occupying Power, 
to comply with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and 
the Human Rights Council, in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which 
the latter decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal 
effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its decision. The Human Rights 
Council also requested the Secretary-General to bring the resolution to the attention of all 
Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international and 
regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to 
disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on this matter to the Council at its 
thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/99, the Secretary-General produced a 
report on the same subject for the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.1 The report 
focused on the implementation of the resolution and was based on information collected 
during the mission of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to 
the Syrian Arab Republic between 4 and 11 July 2009. Israel, which refused to cooperate 
with any such mission made pursuant to General Assembly or Human Rights Council 
resolutions, denied the necessary visas to OHCHR staff. Therefore, the mission could not 
visit the occupied Syrian Golan. On this basis, the report focused on collecting human 
rights allegations on the ground as they affected the Syrian population in the occupied 
Syrian Golan, in particular those related to citizenship and identity, freedom of movement 
and the right to an adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p>3. On 15 October 2009, in preparation for the submission of the present report, 
OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note verbale to the Government 
of Israel referring to Human Rights Council resolution 10/17 and asking the Government of 
Israel to give any information on steps taken or to be taken concerning the implementation 
of the relevant provisions of that resolution. As in previous years, no reply had been 
received at the time of the preparation of the report. 
</p>
<p>4. On 15 October 2009, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, sent a note 
verbale to all permanent missions regarding the same resolution, drawing attention to 
paragraph 8 of the resolution, which calls upon all Member States not to recognize any of 
the legislative or administrative measures and actions taken by the Government of Israel in 
the occupied Syrian Golan. 
</p>
<p>5. On 11 December 2009, the Permanent Mission of Morocco to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva replied to the note verbale, emphasizing its support to the Syrian Arab 
Republic for the complete return of the occupied Golan to the line of 4 June 1967. Morocco 
considers that steps taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to change the legal, physical, and 
demographic characters of the occupied Arab Syrian Golan are null and void, and violates 
the international agreements, the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations, more 
specifically Security Council resolution 497 (1981),  and General Assembly resolution 
99/63 of 5 December 2008, which confirms that the Israeli resolution to annex the Arab 
Syrian Golan on 14 December 1981 is null and void and without any legal effect. 
According to Morocco, this annexation constitutes a grave violation of the resolution 497 
(1981) of the Security Council, the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p>6. On 12 January 2010, the Permanent Mission of Pakistan replied to the note verbale, 
emphasizing that Pakistan does not recognize any of the Israeli legislative or administrative 
measures mentioned in the above resolution. Pakistan advocates an equitable resolution of 
the occupied Syrian Golan issue consistent with the relevant United Nations resolutions and 
various peace initiatives, especially the Arab Peace Initiative, which calls for the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces to pre-1967 borders. Pakistan also condemns persistent human 
rights violations in the occupied Arab territories including the occupied Syrian Golan and 
urges the international community to play its due role to ease the lives of the people in the 
occupied Arab territories. 
</p>
<p>7. On 14 January 2010, the Permanent Mission of Algeria replied to the note verbale, 
emphasizing that its position on the question of the occupied Golan and its two interrelated 
manifestations, the restoration of Syrian sovereignty over the occupied Golan and the 
human rights situation, is in accordance with the principles of international law and relevant 
international standards. Algeria states that all legislative and administrative measures and 
actions taken or to be taken by Israel to change the physical character and the legal status of 
the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international 
law and the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilians in 
Time of War, and have no legal effect. Algeria recalls that it expressed in many forums and 
international meetings its condemnation of the Israeli occupation over the Arab Syrian 
Golan. It requested the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan and called for the 
restoration of the Syrian sovereignty over this occupied territory. Algeria considers that the 
resolution of the issue of the occupation over the Golan constitutes a necessary condition to 
reach a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Algeria notes that it 
will not accept less than the restoration of all occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the 
Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>8. Concerning the human rights situation in the occupied Syrian Golan, Algeria 
strongly condemns the repressive Israeli practices against Syrian citizens resisting the 
occupation and trying to preserve their Arab identity. Algeria recalls that it supported many 
resolutions of the League of Arab States which condemned Israeli practices and their 
flagrant violations of human rights, and requested the Security Council and the Human 
Rights Council to guarantee the respect by Israel of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the right to family visits in 
Syria. 
</p>
<p>9. On 15 January 2010, the Permanent Mission of Egypt to the United Nations Office 
at Geneva replied to the note verbale emphasizing that the occupation of the Syrian Golan 
is contrary to the norms of international law. Egypt stresses that it does not recognize the 
decision of Israel to annex the Golan or any other decision taken by the Israeli 
administration to impose the Israeli identity on the inhabitants of the Golan. Egypt 
condemns the policies of confiscation of lands from the Syrian citizens and the 
establishment of Israeli settlements, underlining the illegality of these settlements. Egypt 
affirms the right to freedom of movement for Syrian citizens and the right to health and 
education. It also requests the occupying Power to release Syrian detainees and prisoners 
from Israeli prisons. 
</p>
<p>10. On 22 January 2010, the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva replied to the note verbale, emphasizing that Israel 
continues to refuse to return the occupied Golan to Syria and to comply with the Security 
Council&#8217;s relevant resolutions, including resolution 497 (1981). 
</p><p>11. The Syrian Arab Republic stresses that the prohibition imposed on the population of 
the occupied Golan to visit their families in Syria reveals the most flagrant violation of 
international, human rights and international humanitarian laws committed by Israel. It 
notes that such prohibition is incompatible with the minimum obligations of the occupying </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12513 
</p>
<p>Power. Syria reaffirms the right of the 20,000 Syrians living in the occupied Golan to 
communicate with their compatriots and family members in Syria. It notes that the 
prohibition of communication leads to severe human suffering notably in the event of 
sickness or death due to the inability for the members of the same family to visit each other. 
Syria notes that, on 11 December 2007, the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent various 
messages to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Presidency of the European 
Union, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Committee of the 
Red Cross on the particular issue of family visits through the crossing of Quneitra and the 
responsibility of Israel to allow these visits. Syria renews its request for the resumption of 
family visits which used to be undertaken through the crossing of Quneitra under the 
supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and which were 
stopped by Israel in 1994.  
</p>
<p>12. The Syrian Arab Republic reminds the international community of its responsibility 
in pressing the Israeli occupying Power to respect its obligations under international law. 
Moreover, it appeals to the Human Rights Council to put pressure on Israel to allow the 
representative of the ICRC to resume family visits in a constant and regular manner through 
the crossing of Quneitra. Syria reiterates that the basic rules of international humanitarian 
law, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention confirm the 
legitimacy of these visits. Syria stresses that as an occupying Power and one of the 
contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilians 
in Time of War, Israel has to apply the provisions of this Convention which stipulates in 
articles 25, 26, 30, 142 and article 74 of the Third Protocol that the States have to authorize 
and facilitate family visits for the population of occupied territories. In the same vein, Syria 
indicates that Israel continues to prevent a number of students from the occupied Golan,2 
who were studying in Syria to return to their home place.  
</p>
<p>13. Syria indicates that the occupying authorities imposed house arrest on a two-year-
old child, Fahd Luay Shaqir, and prevented him from leaving his home in the village of 
Majdal Shams after Israel refused to register him because he was born in Damascus.  
</p><p>14. Syria points out that 7 detainees3 from the occupied Golan, charged with resistance 
against occupation, suffer from concerning conditions in Israeli detention centres. Syria 
denounces a policy of humiliation and oppression against the Syrian detainees, stating that 
international human rights organizations condemned cruel, physical and psychological 
cases of torture inflicted on Arab detainees. In addition, Syria deplores the fact that the 
families of detainees as well as international organizations, such as the ICRC, are facing 
constant difficulties to visit them in prison. 
</p>
<p>15. The Syrian Foreign Ministry sent messages to the Secretary-General, the Presidency 
of the European Union, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the 
Human Rights Council, the President of the ICRC regarding the specific case of the Syrian

<p>journalist Ataa Farahat, detained in Israel since 30 July 2007. Syria indicates that he was 
arrested while he was trying to report on Israeli abuses against the population of the 
occupied Golan. According to Syria, the trial was unfair and the sentences illegitimate. 
</p>
<p>16. Syria stresses that Israel continues to take lands by force, which does not allow the 
peace process to progress in line with the relevant United Nations resolutions. Syria 
indicates that the Government of Israel is continuing the &#8220;judaization&#8221; of more lands in the 
occupied Syrian Golan. It refers to the occupying Power&#8217;s announcement4 to sell 11 lots of 
land in the village of Ain Quniya located in the occupied Golan, with the condition that 
priority is given to those who served in the security forces and were recommended by the 
Israeli Ministry of Defense. Syria emphasized that this bid sets a dangerous precedent as it 
will change the demographic composition of the population in the occupied Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>17. Syria indicates that, on 9 December 2009, the Israeli Knesset adopted in a first 
reading a decision to hold a public referendum that must be supported by 80 per cent of 
Israeli citizens before any agreement to withdraw Israel&#8217;s presence from East Jerusalem and 
the Syrian Golan is implemented. Syria reaffirms that this decision contradicts international 
law which does not permit land  acquisition by force and is contradictory to the Security 
Council resolution 497 (1981) which considers both Israel&#8217;s resolution to annex the Golan 
and its decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Golan 
null and void. Syria reiterates that it is also contrary to the resolution adopted by the 
General Assembly on 2 December 2009 on the occupied Syrian Golan which confirms that 
annexation of lands is illegal. Syria considers that without pressure from the international 
community on Israel to implement resolution 497, Israel will continue to contravene and 
abridge the resolutions despite their international legitimacy.
