<p><b>  </b>22/&#8230;<b> Situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council,  
</i></p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 66/176 of 19 December 2011, 66/253A of 
</p>
<p>16 February 2012, 66/253B of 3 August 2012 and 67/183 of 20 December 2012, Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions S-16/1 of 29 April 2011, S-17/1 of 23 August 2011, S-18/1 of 2 
</p>
<p>December 2011, 19/1 of 1 March 2012, 19/22 of 23 March 2012, S-19/1 of 1 June 2012, 
</p>
<p>20/22 of 6 July 2012 and 21/26 of 28 September 2012, and Security Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>2042 (2012) of 14 April 2012 and 2043 (2012) of 21 April 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> all resolutions of the League of Arab States relating to the situation 
</p>
<p>in the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular its resolution 7595 of 6 March 2013, in which the 
</p>
<p>League reviewed the very serious situation in the Syrian Arab Republic due to the 
</p>
<p>escalating violence and killings in most of the Syrian territory, and the continuation of 
</p>
<p>grave violations of human rights by the Syrian regime using heavy weapons, warplanes and 
</p>
<p>Scud missiles to bomb neighbourhoods and populated areas, which has seriously increased 
</p>
<p>the number of victims, caused human displacement inside the Syrian Arab Republic and an 
</p>
<p>influx of thousands of Syrians to the neighbouring countries fleeing violence, which targets 
</p>
<p>even children and women who have been subjected to frightful massacres, threatening thus 
</p>
<p>to lead to the collapse the Syrian State, and endangers the security, peace and stability of the 
</p>
<p>region, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the outcome on the Syrian Arab Republic of the twelfth session of the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Summit Conference, held in Cairo from 2 to7 February 2013, where the 
</p>
<p>Organization of Islamic Cooperation strongly condemned the ongoing bloodshed in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, underlined the primary responsibility of the Government of the 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>Syrian Arab Republic for the continued violence and destruction of property, and expressed 
</p>
<p>grave concern over the deteriorating situation, the increasing frequency of killings, which 
</p>
<p>claim the lives of thousands of unarmed civilians, and the perpetration of massacres in 
</p>
<p>towns and villages by the Syrian authorities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> all meetings of the Group of Friends of the Syrian People, in 
</p>
<p>particular the fourth Ministerial Meeting held in Marrakech on 12 December 2012, where 
</p>
<p>the participants acknowledged the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and 
</p>
<p>Opposition Forces as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>grave concern</i> at the continuing escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic, in particular, the continued, widespread and systematic gross violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and the continued use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments by the Syrian 
</p>
<p>authorities against the Syrian population, and the failure of the Government of the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic to protect its population, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the commission of inquiry stated that the issue of accountability for 
</p>
<p>those responsible for international crimes deserves to be raised in a more robust manner to 
</p>
<p>counter the pervasive sense of impunity in the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing the need</i> to hold accountable all those responsible for the violations 
</p>
<p>and abuses committed, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>deep concern</i> at the growing number of refugees and internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons fleeing the violence, and welcoming the efforts by neighbouring countries to host 
</p>
<p>Syrian refugees while acknowledging the socioeconomic consequences of the presence of 
</p>
<p>large-scale refugee populations in these countries, and also welcoming the valuable 
</p>
<p>contribution of other countries in facing this humanitarian challenge, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and the failure to 
</p>
<p>ensure the safe and timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the 
</p>
<p>fighting, 
</p>
<p><i>Strongly</i> <i>condemning</i> the shelling as well as the shooting by the Syrian armed forces 
</p>
<p>into neighbouring countries, which led to casualties and injuries of the civilians of those 
</p>
<p>countries as well as of Syrian refugees, and underlining that such incidents violated 
</p>
<p>international law and highlighted the grave impact of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>on the security of its neighbours and on regional peace and stability, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights before the Human Rights Council and the Security Council, and by the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council that crimes against humanity are likely to 
</p>
<p>have been committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and noting the repeated encouragement 
</p>
<p>by the High Commissioner to the Security Council to refer the situation to the International 
</p>

</p>
<p>missiles, the use of heavy weapons and force against civilians, unlawful killings, 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrest and detentions, massacres, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances, widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, the use of 
</p>
<p>torture and other forms of ill-treatment, sexual violence against women, men and children, 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate shelling and aerial bombardment on civilian gatherings, and mass killings, as 
</p>
<p>well as any human rights abuses by armed opposition groups, while noting that the 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry stated in its report that abuses committed by anti-Government armed 
</p>

</p>
<p>committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict, to
