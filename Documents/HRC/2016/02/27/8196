<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The issue of foreign debt and its impact on human rights and development, 
particularly in developing countries, has preoccupied the international community for more 
than three decades and although a number of official initiatives to address it have been 
implemented over the years, these have failed to deliver an equitable and enduring solution 
in line with the political commitments reflected in various resolutions and declarations, 
notably the Millennium Declaration1 and the Monterrey Consensus of the International 
Conference on Financing for Development.2 Moreover, the debt of these countries has 
continued to grow and to constrain not only their development prospects but also to 
undermine their capacity to establish the conditions for the realization of human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>2. The total external debt of emerging and developing economies rose from 
US$2,678.4 billion in 2003 to US$5,414.6 billion in 2010 and is projected to rise to 
US$6,446.3 billion in 2012.3 Debt service payments rose from US$795.2 billion in 2003 to 
US$1,743.7 billion in 2010, and were projected to rise to US$2,010.8 billion and 
US$2,265.5 billion in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In 2003, the total external debt of the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) &#8211; those countries whose debts are deemed 
&#8220;unsustainable&#8221; by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank - was US$172 
billion. In 2010, it decreased marginally to US$147.9 billion, ostensibly due to international 
debt relief. However, it was projected to rise to US$163.3 billion in 2011 and US$178 
billion in 2012 largely as a consequence of new loans taken out to mitigate the impacts of 
the global financial crisis. Additionally, as recent events in Europe suggest, debt problems 
are not the exclusive preserve of developing countries.4 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert accepts that, depending on a variety of factors, such as 
responsible lending and borrowing, the loan terms and conditions, prudent use of loans and 
proper debt management, debt financing can contribute to countries&#8217; economic 
development and the establishment of conditions for the realization of human rights.5 
Nonetheless, empirical evidence shows that in many of the poorest countries the fulfilment 
of debt service obligations is often undertaken at the expense of social investment, 
including investment in services that contribute to the realization of human rights.6 In

<p>Spain and Portugal.

</p>
<p>implementation of the right to development, (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1), para. 52. 
 6 For example, in 2004, Ecuador&#8217;s external debt was US$16.9 billion and its debt service payments 
</p>
<p>amounted to US$3.7 billion (more than six times its expenditure on health care); in 2006, Kenya spent 
more on debt servicing than on health; in 2006, the Philippines spent over 32 per cent of its annual 
budget on servicing interest payments compared with around 14 per cent on education and 1.3 per 
cent on health. See Jubilee Debt Campaign, <i>Debt and Health, </i>Briefing (2007), available from 
www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/Debt3720and3720Health+3795.twl; Jubilee Debt Campaign, <i>Debt

Campaign, <i>Debt and Public Services,</i> Briefing (October 2007), available from

<p>addition, excessive debt service burdens and harmful conditions linked to loans and debt 
relief often limit investment in and undermine the provision of accessible public services. 
</p>
<p>4. Apart from undermining obligations on economic, social and cultural rights, 
excessive debt burdens pose major obstacles for some countries in achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals.7 In 2011, the World Bank and the IMF, while reporting 
that HIPCs have increased their poverty reducing expenditure, noted that &#8220;HIPCs have 
</p>
<p>made uneven, and in some cases, limited, progress towards achieving the Goals.&#8221;8 Only a 
quarter of completion-point HIPCs were on track to achieving Goal 1 (to eradicate extreme 
poverty and hunger), with progress toward Goal 5 (to improve maternal health) less 
certain.9 Further, only a few HIPCs were on track to meet Goal 8 (to build a global 
partnership for development).10 
</p>
<p>5. The lack of progress towards the Goals has also been noted in a recent World Health 
Organization and UNICEF report covering 68 countries where more than 95 per cent of all 
maternal and child deaths occur. The report shows that 49 of the countries surveyed are off 
track for achieving Goals 4 (reduce child mortality) and 5 (improve maternal health).11 It is 
notable that, while the report does not identify the external burden as the cause of this lack 
of progress,12 33 of the countries surveyed are HIPCs (including 27 post-completion 
HIPCs). 
</p>
<p>6. Where countries have had their foreign debt forgiven, they have been able to invest 
more in public services, such as health care, education, water and sanitation, and to abolish 
user fees for some of these services (previously introduced as part of austerity measures 
prescribed by international financial institutions) thereby enhancing the enjoyment of the 
rights to, inter alia, health, education, water and sanitation.13 
</p>
<p>7. Efforts to address the issue of foreign debt from a human rights perspective within 
the United Nations have, regrettably, evoked a profoundly divisive debate in both the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, with some States 
contending that these bodies were not those &#8220;appropriate&#8221; to address the issue and others 
calling for a holistic approach to human rights focusing on both the causes and context 
within which human rights violations occur.14 While the Independent Expert does not wish 
to reignite the debate, he wishes to draw attention to a number of issues. First, rules other 
than human rights law and other international forums (which are presumably better

<p>debt burdens of HIPCs&#8221; and for the 36 post-decision point countries, poverty reducing spending 
increased by more than three percentage points of GDP, on average, between 2001 and 2010, while 
debt service payments declined by a somewhat smaller amount.&#8221; See IDA &amp; IMF, HIPC Initiative

in favour, 14 against and 10 abstentions; Human Rights Council decision 12/119, adopted on 12 
October 2009 by a vote of 31 in favour, 13 against and 2 abstentions. </p>


<p>equipped to deal with the questions of foreign debt) have thus far failed to deliver an 
equitable and lasting solution to the sovereign debt problem in line with the various 
commitments made by the international community. In addition, these other forums do not 
have explicit mandates to promote and protect human rights and have not factored human 
rights into their policies and programmes in line with the internationally accepted human 
rights-based approach to development. Second, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action calls for a holistic approach to the promotion and protection of human rights which 
essentially entails consideration of the causes and context of human rights violations.15 
Third, in terms of article 22 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) &#8220;may bring to the attention of other 
organs of the United Nations, their subsidiary organs and specialized agencies concerned 
with furnishing technical assistance any matters arising out of the reports (submitted by the 
States Parties to the Covenant) which may assist such bodies in deciding, each within its 
field of competence, on the advisability of international measures likely to contribute to the 
effective progressive realization of the present Covenant.&#8221; According to the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights this provision includes &#8220;virtually all United Nations 
</p>
<p>organs and agencies involved in any aspect of international development cooperation.&#8221;16 It 
is therefore within the competence of the Human Rights Council to address the issue of 
foreign debt and human rights. Fourth, States&#8217; human rights obligations are clearly relevant 
in the context of their external debt arrangements. Thus, for example, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has often urged borrower States to take into account 
their obligations under the Covenant in all aspects of their negotiations with international 
financial institutions in order to ensure that economic, social and cultural rights, particularly 
of the most vulnerable sectors of society, are not undermined. It has also encouraged 
creditor countries to do all they can to ensure that the policies and decisions of the 
international financial institutions of which they are part are in conformity with the 
obligations of the States parties to the Covenant, especially the obligations of international 
assistance and cooperation.17 Fifth, the declarations, resolutions and decisions of major 
United Nations conferences and bodies as well as the concluding observations of the 
various treaty bodies have confirmed the link between debt, human rights and 
development.18 Finally, under international human rights law, States bear primary 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Paragraph 13 calls upon States to &#8220;eliminate all violations of human rights and their <i>causes</i>, as well as 
</p>
<p><i>obstacles</i> to the enjoyment of these rights&#8221; (emphasis added).

E/C.12/1/Add.77, para. 37 (Ireland); and E/C.12/1/Add.79, para. 26 (United Kingdom). It is also 
notable that the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights deem a 
human rights violation of omission &#8220;[t]he failure of a State to take into account its international legal 
obligations in the field of economic, social and cultural rights when entering into bilateral or 
multilateral agreements with other States, international organizations or multinational corporations&#8221;

<p>responsibility for ensuring all human rights to all people living in their territory and under 
their jurisdiction. Thus, States should not be placed in a situation where they are unable to 
fulfil this obligation due to excessive debt service obligations. 
</p>
<p>8. The guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights, which are presented with 
this report, represent an attempt to contribute to the quest for an equitable and durable 
solution to the debt crisis that is not only in line with the political commitments made by 
the international community but is also consistent with the human rights obligations of all 
States. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background to the principles 
</b></p>
<p>9. In resolution 2004/18, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Independent 
Expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full 
enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights to draft general 
guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international 
financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and 
structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure 
that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt would not undermine the 
obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as 
provided for in the international human rights instruments, and to present a preliminary 
draft on the matter to the Commission at its sixty-first session and a final draft at the sixty-
second session of the Commission. 
</p>
<p>10. In its decision 2/109, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene an expert 
consultation for the purpose of contributing to the process of drafting the general 
Guidelines. Following that consultation, the Independent Expert (renamed independent 
expert on the effects of economic reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of 
all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights) presented a preliminary 
draft of the guidelines to the Council at its March 2008 session. In his report to the Council 
(A/HRC/7/9), the Independent Expert noted that the guidelines required further consultation 
and work. 
</p>
<p>11.  In its resolutions 7/4 and 11/5, the Council requested the Independent Expert on the 
effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to 
</p>

<p>continue to work on the guidelines, including by seeking &#8220;the views and suggestions of 
</p>
<p>States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes [and] 
regional economic commissions&#8221;. In its decision 12/119, the Council requested OHCHR to 
assist the Independent Expert in the organization and holding of regional consultations on 
the guidelines. 
</p>
<p>12. With the support of OHCHR, the Independent Expert held four regional 
consultations between June 2010 and June 2011 (Latin America and the Caribbean in June 
2010; Africa in November 2010; Asia Pacific in February 2011; and Western Europe and 
other groups in June 2011).19 These consultations, which brought together government 
representatives, members of parliament, regional economic commissions, international 
financial institutions, civil society organizations, individual experts and other stakeholders, 
generated ideas, based on regional experiences and perspectives, on how best the guidelines 
could assist States in complying with their human rights obligations while fulfilling their 
obligations under their debt arrangements.  
</p>
<p>13. In November 2011, the Independent Expert convened an expert meeting to review a 
new draft that he had prepared based on the insights from the regional consultations. In 
February 2012, he convened a public consultation in Geneva on the updated text of the 
guiding principles that had been prepared following the aforementioned expert meeting. 
Several States and civil society organizations participated in this consultation. The text of 
the principles was also placed on the Independent Expert&#8217;s web page together with an 
invitation for public comments. Several stakeholders, including States, international 
financial institutions, regional economic commissions, civil society organizations and 
individuals provided written comments on the new draft.20 
</p>
<p>14. The final text of the guiding principles now before the Council is the outcome of the 
broad and inclusive process of consultation outlined above. The Independent Expert 
acknowledges the invaluable contributions of the broad range of stakeholders in 
contributing to the articulation of a universally applicable framework on foreign debt and 
human rights that is designed to ensure that the obligations assumed by States under debt 
and other international financial arrangements do not undermine their capacity to create the 
conditions for the realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights and the right to development. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the principles 
</b></p>
<p>15. In line with the views that emerged from the regional consultations and in keeping 
with the standards developed by other special procedures mandate holders, the Independent 
Expert has proposed that the guidelines be renamed &#8220;guiding principles on foreign debt and 
human rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. The text of the principles has an introduction and three main sections. The 
introduction draws attention to the adverse impact of excessive debt burdens on human 
rights and development and highlights the need to strike an appropriate balance between the 
obligations of States arising from their external debt arrangements and under international 
human rights law. Section I outlines the scope and purpose of the principles; section II 
</p>
<p>  
 19 The Independent Expert submitted a report on the first three regional consultations to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council in April 2011 (A/HRC/17/37). 
 20 The United Nations Secretariat was not able to provide full translation of the comments received in 
</p>
<p>other languages. Consequently, the Independent Expert had to rely on informal translations provided 
by OHCHR staff and he cannot guarantee his full knowledge of their precise content. </p>


<p>outlines the foundational principles drawn from existing international human rights and 
other standards on which the principles are based; section III contains the operational 
principles. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implementation of the principles 
</b></p>
<p>17. The guiding principles do not seek to create new rights or obligations in 
international law, nor do they supplant other mechanisms designed to address aspects of the 
sovereign debt problem. Rather, their normative contribution lies in identifying existing 
basic human rights standards applicable to sovereign debt and related policies, as well as in 
elaborating the implications of these standards. Further, the principles should be seen as a 
complement to other initiatives such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights; the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Draft 
Principles on Promoting Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing; and international 
debt relief mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert is honoured to submit these guiding principles to the 
Human Rights Council for its consideration. He urges the Council and all Member States of 
the United Nations to demonstrate their commitment to finding an equitable and durable 
solution to the debt crisis, particularly of developing countries, as expressed in, inter alia, 
the Millennium Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus, by endorsing the guiding 
principles. 
</p>
<p>19. In order to assist States and other stakeholders in implementing the principles, it has 
been suggested that a commentary on the guiding principles be developed. The Independent 
Expert is amenable to this proposal and, if the Council is agreeable, he could prepare such a 
commentary and submit it to the Council for its consideration. </p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>The Charter of the United Nations expresses a universally shared commitment &#8220;to 
achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social 
and cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or 
religion.&#8221; This commitment is also reflected in several human rights treaties and 
</p>
<p>declarations. Further, article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that 
everyone has the right to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms 
stipulated in the Declaration can be fully realized. 
</p>
<p>The full enjoyment of all human rights requires that adequate resources are allocated 
to this goal by States, which bear the primary responsibility for the protection and 
promotion of human rights. Nevertheless, the available resources are often limited and 
resource allocation undermined by a broad range of factors, including the fulfilment of 
unduly burdensome external debt service obligations. There is extensive evidence that the 
diversion of scarce national resources from fundamental public services of education, 
health, water, sanitation, housing and infrastructure to debt servicing significantly reduces 
the capacity of debtor countries, particularly poor countries, to establish the conditions for 
the realization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. In this 
regard, it is notable that the various United Nations human rights bodies have consistently 
observed that excessive debt service payments constitute an obstacle to development and 
the realization of human rights in many developing countries.1 Where debt burdens have 
been significantly reduced as a result, for example, of debt forgiveness, countries have been 
able to scale up spending on poverty reduction and social investment.  
</p>
<p>It is recognized that, depending on a variety of factors such as the loan terms and 
conditions, prudent use of loan funds and effective debt management, debt financing can 
contribute to countries&#8217; development. It is also acknowledged that multilateral debt relief

<p>initiatives have provided some fiscal space for heavily indebted poor countries to 
implement some social programmes. However, these initiatives are fraught with problems, 
including lengthy policy conditionality requirements (which not only undermine the 
poverty reduction goals of debt relief but also undermine country ownership of national 
development strategies) and exclusion of many countries that need or deserve debt relief. 
Further, they do not appear to have provided a durable solution to the debt problem as 
shown by international financial institution assessments indicating that some of the 
countries that have completed the debt relief processes are at risk of debt distress.  
</p>
<p>These challenges require a response that strikes an appropriate balance between the 
obligations of States arising from their external debt arrangements and under international 
human rights law. This balance cannot be achieved through unilateral actions alone and 
domestic policy orientations on the part of individual States but requires concerted 
international action in the spirit of international cooperation and assistance as underscored 
in the Charter of the United Nations and other instruments. Consequently, a number of 
high-level summits of world leaders have called for the formulation of a comprehensive 
solution to the external debt problem, particularly of developing countries. In this regard, 
the <i>Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action </i>(1993) &#8220;calls upon the international 
community to make all efforts to help alleviate the external debt burden of developing 
countries, in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such countries to attain 
the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their people.&#8221;2 Similarly, 
the <i>Millennium Declaration</i> (2000) from which the Millennium Development Goals are 
drawn, acknowledges the need for reform of the international financial system to make it 
open, rules-based, predictable and non-discriminatory.3 This goal specifies the need to &#8220;deal 
comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of [&#8230;] developing countries&#8221; 
through [&#8230;] national and international measures designed to make debt sustainable in the 
long term. Lastly, the <i>Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing 
for Development</i> (2002) underscores the mutual accountability of creditors and debtors for 
their decisions relating to external debt and it advocates exploration of &#8220;innovative 
mechanisms to comprehensively address debt problems of developing countries&#8221; as well as 
&#8220;consideration by all relevant stakeholders of an international debt workout mechanism, in 
</p>
<p>the appropriate forums, that will engage debtors and creditors to [&#8230;] restructure 
unsustainable debts in a timely and efficient manner.&#8221;4  
</p>
<p>In response to the foregoing challenges, on 16 April 2004, the Commission on 
Human Rights adopted resolution 2004/18 in which it requested the independent expert on 
the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of 
human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights &#8220;to draft general guidelines 
</p>
<p>to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial 
institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and structural reform 
programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance 
with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the 
realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the 
international human rights instruments.&#8221; In subsequent resolutions and decisions, the 
</p>
<p>Commission and the Human Rights Council requested the independent expert to seek the 
views and suggestions of a broad range of stakeholders, including States, international

<p>organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, regional economic 
commissions, international and regional financial institutions and non-governmental 
organizations, on the draft guidelines and to present a draft to the Council. 
</p>
<p>The present guiding principles are the outcome of an extensive and inclusive 
consultation process. The principles are based on the recognition of States&#8217; existing 
obligations to respect, protect and fulfil all human rights, the obligations of international 
financial institutions and private corporations to respect human rights, as well as the need 
for a comprehensive solution to the sovereign debt problems of developing countries that is 
anchored to a human rights-based framework.  
</p>
<p><b>  Section I </b>&#8211;<b> Scope and purpose 
</b></p>
<p>1. These guiding principles are designed to assist States and all relevant actors 
including private and public, national and international financial institutions, bilateral 
lenders and organized groups of bondholders in the conduct of their respective activities 
and pursuit of their respective interests relating to external debt.  
</p>
<p>2. The overriding aim of these principles is to balance a debtor and creditor State&#8217;s 
contractual obligations arising from external debt arrangements and both debtor and 
creditor&#8217;s international legal obligations to respect, protect and fulfil all human rights, 
</p>
<p>particularly economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>3. These principles apply to the lending and borrowing decisions of States and other 
actors such as international financial institutions and private institutions as appropriate, the 
negotiation and execution of loan agreements or other debt instruments, the utilization of 
external loan funds, debt repayments, the renegotiation and restructuring of external debt, 
the provision of debt relief when appropriate and to all policies, strategies and activities 
related thereto. The principles recognize the contingent liabilities which can arise for a 
State from external borrowing and lending between private actors. 
</p>
<p>4. For the purposes of these principles, external (or foreign debt) refers to an obligation 
(including monetary obligation) created under a contractual agreement and owed by a State 
to a non-resident lender which may either be an international financial institution, a 
bilateral or multilateral lender, a private financial institution or a bondholder, or is subject 
to foreign law. It includes: (i) loans, that is, advances of funds to the debtor by the lender on 
the basis of an undertaking that the borrower will repay the funds at some future point 
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyer&#8217;s credits); and (ii) 
</p>
<p>suppliers&#8217; credits, that is, contracts whereby the supplier allows the customer to defer 
</p>
<p>payment until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or the services are 
provided. The aggregate of a State&#8217;s outstanding external debts is referred to as its external 
</p>
<p>debt stock. 
</p>
<p>5. These principles reflect and are consistent with international human rights standards. 
They apply existing human rights standards as they pertain to problems or issues 
occasioned by the external indebtedness of States and related policies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Section II </b>&#8211;<b> Foundational principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Ensuring the primacy of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>6. All States, whether acting individually or collectively (including through 
international and regional organizations of which they are members), have the obligations 
to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. They should ensure that any and all of their 
activities concerning their lending and borrowing decisions, those of international or </p>


<p>national public or private institutions to which they belong or in which they have an 
interest, the negotiation and implementation of loan agreements or other debt instruments, 
the utilization of loan funds, debt repayments, the renegotiation and restructuring of 
external debt, and the provision of debt relief when appropriate, do not derogate from these 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>7. All States should pursue effective policies and measures aimed at creating the 
conditions for ensuring the full realization of all human rights, bearing in mind the 
indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and taking into 
account the potentially negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights of external debt 
servicing and the adoption of related economic reform policies. 
</p>
<p>8. Any foreign debt strategy must be designed not to hamper the improvement of 
conditions guaranteeing the enjoyment of human rights and must be directed, inter alia, to 
ensuring that debtor States achieve an adequate level of growth to meet their social and 
economic needs and their development requirements, as well as fulfilment of their human 
rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>9. International financial organizations and private corporations have an obligation to 
respect international human rights.5 This implies a duty to refrain from formulating, 
adopting, funding and implementing policies and programmes which directly or indirectly 
contravene the enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>10. States have an obligation to ensure all human rights to all without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status, as stipulated in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>11. States must design and implement policies and programmes to further the delivery 
of basic services essential for the enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights, in a manner that is consistent with the principle of equality and 
non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>12. States should analyse policies and programmes, including those relating to external 
debt, macroeconomic stability, structural reform and investment, with respect to their 
impact on poverty and inequality, social development and the enjoyment of human rights, 
as well as their gender implications, and adjust them as appropriate, to promote a more 
equitable and non-discriminatory distribution of the benefits of growth and services. 
</p>
<p>13. Such impact analyses should pay special attention to certain groups in society which 
may be particularly vulnerable to policies and programmes relating to external debt, 
macroeconomic stability, structural reform, trade liberalization and investment, including 
children, women, persons with disabilities, older persons, persons belonging to minorities 
and migrant workers and members of their families. 
</p>
<p>14. States should pay particular attention to the gender impact of reductions in public 
services, social security benefits, childcare facilities and public employment and to 
women&#8217;s share of increased unemployment and they should take measures to prevent 
</p>
<p>greater impoverishment of women. 
</p>

</p>
<p>issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie, 
annex: Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations 
&#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework (A/HRC/17/31). </p>


<p><b>  Progressive realization  
</b></p>
<p>15. The obligation of States to achieve progressively the full realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights requires States to move as expeditiously and effectively as 
possible towards the full realization of these rights.  
</p>
<p>16. States should ensure that their rights and obligations arising from external debt 
agreements or arrangements, particularly accepting an unreasonable or excessive obligation 
to repay external debt,6 do not hinder the progressive realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights. Non-State lenders have an obligation to ensure that debt contracts to which 
they are party or any policies related thereto fully respect human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Minimum core obligations 
</b></p>
<p>17. Every State has an obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, the 
minimum essential levels of each economic, social and cultural right. The minimum 
essential levels of each of these rights should be seen as the base level from which States 
should endeavour to improve the enjoyment of the right. 
</p>
<p>18. States should ensure that their rights and obligations arising from an external debt 
agreement or arrangement, particularly the obligation to repay external debt, do not 
derogate from their minimum core obligations with respect to these rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Non-retrogression 
</b></p>
<p>19. States have an obligation to avoid retrogressive measures, that is, any deliberate 
action which has the effect of impairing the advancement in economic, social and cultural 
rights and thus hindering the continuous realization of these rights.  
</p>
<p>20. States should ensure that their rights and obligations arising from external debt, 
particularly the obligation to repay external debt, do not lead to the deliberate adoption of 
retrogressive measures. 
</p>
<p><b>  The duty of international cooperation among States 
</b></p>
<p>21. Articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter and various human rights treaties 
and declarations reflect clear requirements for States to cooperate with and assist each other 
in order to achieve certain goals, including ensuring development and eliminating obstacles 
to development, finding solutions to international economic, social, health and related 
problems, and promoting universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>22. The duty of international assistance and cooperation enjoins States to ensure that 
their activities, and those of their residents and corporations, do not violate the human 
rights of people abroad and that States, individually or through membership of international 
institutions, do not adopt or engage in policies that undermine the enjoyment of human 
rights or further engender disparities between and within States.   
</p>
<p>  
 6 The obligation to repay external debts is emphasized here (and in sections 2.3 and 2.4) because the 
</p>
<p>amounts that a debtor State allocates for debt repayments are thus deducted from its &#8220;available 
resources&#8221; which, pursuant to article 2(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, should be optimally devoted to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. </p>


<p><b>  The shared responsibility of creditors and debtors  
</b></p>
<p>23. Creditors and debtors share responsibility for preventing and resolving unsustainable 
debt situations.7 For creditors, this includes the obligation to perform due diligence on the 
creditworthiness and ability to repay of the borrower as well as the duty to refrain from 
providing a loan in circumstances where the lender is aware that the funds will be used for 
non-public purposes or for a non-viable project. For debtor States, this entails an obligation 
to contract loans and use the loan funds in ways that serve the public interest and repay the 
debt in a timely fashion. 
</p>
<p>24. The mutual accountability of creditors and debtors for their decisions is an important 
precondition for the establishment of an equitable global financial system.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ensuring an independent process of national development 
</b></p>
<p>25. Every State has the sovereign and inalienable right to implement a process of 
national development independently and free from pressure, influence or interference from 
external actors, including other States and international financial institutions. An 
independent process of national development means that the legitimate leaders of the 
people have effective control over the direction of the country&#8217;s economic development. 
This process should be transparent, participatory, accountable and responsive. 
</p>
<p>26. The right to self-determination requires the legitimate authorities of a State to have 
independent control over the direction of a State&#8217;s economy (i.e. where it is going) and 
effective involvement in economic planning (i.e. how to get there). 
</p>
<p>27. The principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources implies the right of 
all States to possess, use, or otherwise dispose of their natural wealth and resources as they 
deem proper, free from pressure, influence or interference from external actors, including 
other States and international financial institutions. State sovereignty must be exercised in 
full compliance with and respect for human rights, paying particular attention to the most 
vulnerable groups in society. 
</p>
<p><b>  Transparency, participation and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>28. Transparency, participation and accountability are core values that should be 
observed in the lending and borrowing decisions by States, international financial 
institutions and other actors as appropriate, the negotiation and execution of loan 
agreements or other debt instruments, the utilization of loan funds, making of debt 
repayments, the renegotiation and restructuring of external debts, and implementation of 
debt relief when appropriate. 
</p>
<p>29. Transparency requires the full disclosure of all relevant information regarding loan 
agreements, debt repayments, debt management, outcomes of public debt audits and other 
related matters.  
</p>
<p>30. Participation requires effective and meaningful input from all stakeholders 
(including project beneficiaries) in loan policy and resource utilization decisions.  
</p>
<p>31. Accountability requires remedial measures that ensure decision-makers are 
answerable, if warranted, for their actions regarding external debt agreements or 
arrangement, as well as external debt policies and strategies.

</p>
<p>March 2002 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.02.II.A.7), chap. I, resolution 1, annex, para. 
47. </p>


<p>32. Transparency and participation further require oversight by the relevant 
representative bodies and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Section III </b>&#8211;<b> Operational principles  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. External debt 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>33. Borrower States should have a comprehensive legal and institutional framework that 
promotes and ensures transparency and accountability in the loan negotiation and 
contracting as well as public debt management processes. Such a framework should also 
clarify the roles of different institutions in loan negotiation, contraction, debt management 
and oversight. 
</p>
<p>34. Borrower States should set limits for international loans through appropriate 
budgetary legislation. Any changes to such ceilings should require the approval of 
Parliament or some other democratically constituted national legislative body. 
</p>
<p>35. Lender States, international financial institutions and private institutions should have 
a comprehensive legal and institutional framework that promotes and ensures transparency 
and accountability in the negotiation and contracting of loans. 
</p>
<p><b>  Decision to borrow or to lend  
</b></p>
<p>36. Every Borrower State should conduct a transparent and participatory needs 
assessment, as part of its annual debt strategy, in order to ascertain whether it has a genuine 
need to obtain new loans. It is incumbent upon each Borrower State to demonstrate that its 
decision to borrow has been given the most careful consideration and is fully compliant 
with the foundational principles identified in Section II above, particularly the need to 
ensure the primacy of human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Prior to obtaining a new loan, a Borrower State should reassess the existing 
allocation of its financial resources and should satisfy itself that its need for additional 
funds cannot be met by re-orienting existing budgetary allocation. In addition, if such 
allocation does not reflect a high priority for human development spending and enhanced 
protection for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights and freedoms, it should be 
adjusted accordingly. 
</p>
<p>38. All lenders should satisfy themselves that a Borrower State has made an informed 
decision to borrow and that the loan is to be used for a public purpose. They should conduct 
due diligence or obtain assurances from the Borrower State to ensure that the loan funds 
will not be wasted through official corruption, economic mismanagement or other 
unproductive uses in the Borrower State. If any such eventuality is reasonably foreseeable 
under the circumstances, lenders should not provide the loan or continue with the 
disbursement of the loan. 
</p>
<p>39. All lenders should conduct due diligence to ensure that the proposed loan will not 
increase the Borrower State&#8217;s external debt stock to an unsustainable level that will make 
debt repayment difficult and impede the creation of conditions for the realization of human 
rights. Lenders should satisfy themselves that, even with the new loan, the Borrower State 
is still capable of servicing its external debt without compromising its ability to perform its 
international human rights obligations as mentioned in section II.  
</p>
<p>40. Lenders should not finance activities or projects that violate, or would foreseeably 
violate, human rights in the Borrower States. To avoid this eventuality, it is incumbent upon </p>


<p>lenders intending to finance specific activities or projects in Borrower States to conduct a 
credible Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) as a prerequisite to providing a new 
loan. Alternatively, lenders may request the national human rights institution of the 
Borrower State, if any, to conduct such assessment.  
</p>
<p>41. For the purposes of these principles, a HRIA is understood as a systematic process, 
undertaken by an independent body with the full and informed participation of affected 
communities, based on the normative framework for international human rights law, which 
aims to measure the impact of an activity or project on the realization of human rights.   
</p>
<p><b>  Loan negotiation and contracting  
</b></p>
<p>42. The negotiation process should be informed by the inputs previously gathered 
through consultations with all stakeholders, including affected communities and civil 
society organizations, both by borrowers and lenders as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>43. The key terms and conditions of loan agreements should be publicly disclosed by 
both borrowers and lenders. 
</p>
<p>44. Lenders who negotiate with officials of a Borrower State should recognize that the 
latter have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their principal, namely, the 
Borrower State, which in turn represents its people in the international system. Similarly, 
borrowers should recognize that officials acting on behalf of a lender stand in a fiduciary 
relationship to the lender. The discharge of this fiduciary duty is typically governed by 
formal and substantive requirements prescribed by the law of the Borrower State. 
</p>
<p><b>  Legal authority to contract 
</b></p>
<p>45. The contracting of loans or other debt obligations should comply with the formal 
and substantive requirements which are prescribed by the applicable national laws and 
regulations of both the Borrower State and the Lender State (or, as the case may be, the 
State having jurisdiction over private lenders) or, in the case of an international financial 
institution, its articles of agreement or other similar constitutional instrument. In particular, 
any prior approval or authorization required by domestic law or regulation should be fully 
complied with. 
</p>
<p><b>  Use of loan funds  
</b></p>
<p>46. Except in the case of general-purpose borrowing, the additional funding made 
available through external loans should only be used for the activity or project for which it 
was originally contracted. 
</p>
<p>47. In addition, funds obtained through external loans should not be used to fund any 
activity or project that will contribute to or exacerbate violations of human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Debt servicing or repayment 
</b></p>
<p>48. Debtor States should ensure that their level of debt servicing is not so excessive or 
disproportionate relative to their financial capacity and other resources as to amount to a 
diversion of their resources away from the provision of social services to all persons living 
in their territory and under their jurisdiction, including those pertaining to economic, social 
and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>49. Debtor States should use their financial resources optimally in order to realize all 
human rights. Excessive or disproportionate debt servicing that takes away financial 
resources meant for the realization of human rights should be adjusted or modified </p>


<p>accordingly to reflect the primacy of human rights. Debtor States&#8217; budgetary allocations 
should reflect the priority of human rights-related expenditures. 
</p>
<p>50. Debtor States should not allow their external debt repayments to reach an excessive 
or disproportionate level at which they can no longer perform their minimum core 
obligations as referred to in section II. 
</p>
<p>51. Debtor States should avoid deliberately adopting retrogressive measures as defined 
in Section II in order to allocate more financial resources to external debt repayments.  
</p>
<p><b>  Renegotiation and restructuring  
</b></p>
<p>52. The obligation of debtor States to repay under a valid and legitimate external debt 
agreement must be honoured. However, circumstances rendering the debt unpayable (such 
as severe financial distress of the borrower and natural disasters) may warrant changes in 
the reciprocal obligations between a debtor State and its creditors.  
</p>
<p>53. Debtor States which experience difficulty in repaying their external debts should 
renegotiate these with their creditors with the aim of reaching a restructuring agreement that 
enables the debtor State to service its external debts without compromising its capacity to 
fulfil its international human rights obligations as mentioned in section II or implement its 
development goals.  
</p>
<p>54. The renegotiation and restructuring should be conducted in good faith and should 
cover all types of external debts owed to all types of external creditors, including 
international financial institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Debt relief 
</b></p>
<p>55. The alleviation of debt and debt-service burdens of heavily indebted countries, 
including through debt relief efforts (such as debt forgiveness, debt rescheduling, debt 
service reduction and interest moratorium), should take place in the context of the 
realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>56. Debt relief efforts must not compromise the provision of basic services. In 
particular, debt relief conditions that may adversely impact the realization of human rights 
or undermine development in the beneficiary State must be avoided. 
</p>
<p>57. Financing from debt relief must neither replace official development assistance nor 
be considered as such. 
</p>
<p><b>  Debt moratorium 
</b></p>
<p>58. When a change in circumstances beyond the control of the Borrower State arises, the 
parties should negotiate and agree on a moratorium on debt repayment. Such a moratorium 
should apply to the principal, interest, commission and penalties and should apply 
throughout negotiations on debt restructuring.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sale of debt on the secondary market 
</b></p>
<p>59. Loan agreements should impose clear restrictions on the sale or assignment of debts 
to third parties by creditors without the prior informed consent of the Borrower State 
concerned. Every effort must be directed towards achieving a negotiated settlement 
between the creditor and the debtor. 
</p>
<p>60. Where a debt has been sold or assigned after the failure of settlement negotiations 
between the creditor and debtor, all relevant provisions contained in the original loan 
agreement, such as interest rates and change of circumstances, should apply. </p>


<p>61. If the debtor State has been granted debt relief through an international debt relief 
mechanism (such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries&#8217; Initiative), the amount of debt 
</p>
<p>recoverable by the litigating creditor should not exceed that recovered by other creditors. 
</p>
<p>62. Creditors should not sell sovereign debt on the secondary market to creditors that 
have previously refused to participate in agreed debt restructuring.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sharing risk of the loan 
</b></p>
<p>63. In order to help balance exchange rate risk, lenders should offer the possibility of 
denominating all or part of the loan in the Borrower State&#8217;s local currency. 
</p>
<p>64. In order to help balance output or trade risk, lenders should offer the possibility of 
indexing loan repayments to rates of economic and/or export growth. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Debt sustainability 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Debt sustainability assessment 
</b></p>
<p>65. Debt sustainability assessments must not be limited to economic considerations (the 
debtor State&#8217;s economic growth prospects and ability to service their debt obligations) but 
</p>
<p>must also take into consideration the impact of debt burdens on a country&#8217;s ability to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to create the conditions for the realization 
of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>66. Such assessments must be undertaken by an independent body as contemplated in 
paragraph 82(b) of these principles.  
</p>
<p><b>  Public audits of debt and lending portfolios 
</b></p>
<p>67. Borrower States should conduct transparent and participatory periodic audits of their 
debt portfolios in accordance with national legislation designed for this purpose. The 
findings of such audits must be publicly disclosed to ensure transparency and accountability 
in the management of the State&#8217;s external debt stock and should inform future borrowing 
</p>
<p>decisions by the State as well as its debt strategy, development expenditure and human 
rights action plans. 
</p>
<p>68. Public audits of debt portfolios should assess the loan contraction process, use of 
loan funds and the impact of debt on development and the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>69. Lenders should similarly conduct periodic public audits of their lending portfolios to 
assess compliance with the objectives of their foreign development cooperation or lending 
policies, the development priorities of Borrower States and universally recognized human 
rights standards. The findings of such audits should be publicly disclosed. 
</p>
<p>70. In the case of borrower or lender States, public audits should be conducted by 
institutions or entities as may be provided for by national legislation, including national 
legislatures, national human rights institutions, debt management offices, or any other 
independent Government agency or office. 
</p>
<p><b>  Contingent liabilities 
</b></p>
<p>71. Borrower States and lenders should consider the impact that contingent liabilities 
(including debts generated by or related to export credits or foreign investments and debt 
obligations arising from public-private partnerships) have on the borrower government&#8217;s 
financial position when making borrowing or lending decisions or assessing the 
sustainability of the debts of Borrower States. </p>


<p>72. All States should monitor and regulate external lending and borrowing (as 
appropriate) within the private sector in order to prevent private debt burdens being created 
which bring financial instability and ultimately undermine the realization of human rights.   
</p>
<p><b> C. National development strategy 
</b></p>
<p>73. A national development strategy should be country-owned and should contain 
development goals that are responsive to the needs of the people who are the ultimate 
beneficiaries of development. Such goals should be agreed through a meaningful and 
participatory consultation process involving all stakeholders, especially civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>74. Country ownership of national development strategies is the foundation of 
development effectiveness. It implies that national governments should have the ability to 
freely choose the strategies which they design and implement, and take the lead in both 
policy formulation and implementation.8 
</p>
<p>75. In particular, any economic, financial or technical advice, instruction guidance or 
similar recommendation by external actors, particularly by international financial 
institutions, which are meant to address the problems occasioned by external indebtedness, 
must respect the debtor State&#8217;s independent process of national development as defined in 
</p>
<p>Section II. 
</p>
<p>76. Any such economic, financial or technical advice, instruction, guidance or similar 
recommendation should be accorded lesser weight or importance by a debtor State if it 
contravenes the main development goals prioritized and agreed during the consultation 
process referred to in section III (A). 
</p>
<p>77. Creditors should not make loans or debt relief conditional on the implementation of 
policies such as privatization, equitization, trade liberalization, investment deregulation or 
financial sector liberalization. 
</p>
<p>78. Any such economic, financial or technical advice, instruction, guidance or similar 
recommendation should be exclusively aimed towards restoring a debtor State&#8217;s economic 
viability and growth, and thus its ability to repay its external debts without sacrificing its 
ability to perform its international human rights obligations. Other objectives that are 
remotely or tangentially connected with this aim should be avoided.   
</p>
<p>79. States should ensure that the implementation of the policies mentioned in paragraph 
74 above does not impair the realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social 
and cultural rights, in debtor States. Whenever such policies are deemed necessary by a 
debtor State, adequate social security measures to mitigate the adverse impact thereof, 
especially on vulnerable or marginalized groups, must be put in place. 
</p>
<p>80. Creditor States and the international financial institutions must not take advantage of 
an economic, financial or external debt-related crisis as an opportunity to push for structural 
reforms in debtor States, however useful such reforms might be perceived to be in the long 
term. Such reforms should be initiated, formulated and implemented by the debtor States 
themselves, if they deem appropriate, in pursuance of an independent process of national 
development.  
</p>
<p>  
 8 The United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development underscores the importance of country 
</p>
<p>ownership: &#8220;States have the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international 
</p>
<p>conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development.&#8221; General Assembly resolution. 
</p>
<p>41/128, annex, art. 3(1). </p>


<p><b>  Alignment to national development goals 
</b></p>
<p>81. Loans and foreign investment agreements must be consistent with country-designed 
development strategies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p>82. International investment agreements, while ensuring the promotion and protection of 
investments, should comply with all human rights in the territories of the contracting States.   
</p>
<p>83. To the extent that international investment agreements contemplate sovereign debt 
as a type of investment  such agreements should be consistent with and interpreted in a 
manner that is consistent with these principles. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Resolution of debt-related issues 
</b></p>
<p>84. Debt repayment problems and debt-related disputes must be resolved by an 
independent mechanism. In this regard, States and all relevant actors including international 
financial institutions, bilateral or multilateral lenders and private financial institutions 
should consider the establishment of an international debt workout mechanism to 
restructure unsustainable debts and resolve debt disputes in a fair, transparent, efficient and 
timely manner. 
</p>
<p>85. The main aim of such a mechanism is to ensure that debtor States can achieve 
economic viability and growth, and restore their capacity to service their external debts 
without compromising the fulfilment of their international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>86. The establishment and operation of such a mechanism should be guided by the 
foundational principles set out in Section II, as well as the following specific 
considerations: 
</p>
<p>(a) The international debt restructuring mechanism should be independent of 
creditors and debtors; 
</p>
<p>(b) The assessment of the debtor State&#8217;s economic or financial situation should 
be made by a neutral body; 
</p>
<p>(c) The mechanism should ensure that a debtor State, during and after the 
restructuring process, should be able to fulfil its international human rights obligations, 
implement its development programme and provide basic services to all persons living in 
its territory and under its jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p>(d) The mechanism should have the mandate to rule on the alleged &#8220;odiousness&#8221; 
or &#8220;illegitimacy&#8221; of particular external debts. The criteria to be used to ascertain the 
</p>
<p>odiousness or illegitimacy of a particular external debt should be defined by national 
legislation taking into account the following elements: 
</p>
<p> (i) The absence of consent by the debtor State&#8217;s population; 
</p>
<p> (ii) The absence of benefit to the debtor State&#8217;s population; and 
</p>
<p> (iii) The creditor&#8217;s awareness of the above facts. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
