<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/166, in 
which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Assembly at its sixty-
eighth session and to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session a report on the 
latest developments, challenges and good practices in human rights in the administration of 
justice, analysing the international legal and institutional framework for the protection of all 
persons deprived of their liberty, as well as activities undertaken by the United Nations 
system as a whole.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Pursuant to the above-mentioned request, the Secretariat refers the Human Rights 
Council to the report of the Secretary-General, submitted to the General Assembly, on 
human rights in the administration of justice: analysis of the international legal and 
institutional framework for the protection of all persons deprived of their liberty 
(A/68/261). In the report, the Secretary-General analyses the applicable international legal 
and institutional framework for the protection of all persons deprived of their liberty, and 
identifies major challenges in this regard. He concludes that, while a comprehensive 
international legal and institutional framework for the protection of all persons deprived of 
their liberty exists, the main challenge lies in the implementation of relevant norms and 
standards at the national level.
