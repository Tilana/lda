</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p> <i>Having examined </i>the material relating to the human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan 
brought before it under the 1503 procedure in accordance with Economic and Social 
Council resolution 2000/3, alleging the use of excessive force against demonstrators and 
the use of arbitrary arrest and detention against protestors in order to stifle political 
opposition, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having also examined</i> the material relating to the human rights situation in 
Kyrgyzstan before it under the 1503 procedure in accordance with Economic and Social

ammunition by the police leading to deaths, as well as the harassment of human rights 
defenders and opposition politicians, in particular attacks on demonstrators on 
4 September 2002 in Jalal-Abad and arrests of members of the Kyrgyz Commission 
for Human Rights, 
</p>

Kyrgyzstan before it under the 1503 procedure in accordance with Economic and Social 
Council resolution 2000/3, concerning the rape of two women members of opposition

that they may reveal the existence of gross violations of human rights, </p>

 <p>

<p> <i>Noting </i>the replies received from the Government of Kyrgyzstan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting also </i>that the political situation in the country has changed,

timely manner;
