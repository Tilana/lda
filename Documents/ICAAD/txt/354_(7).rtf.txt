IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

Criminal Case No: HAC134 of 2010

STATE

v.

WALTER LATU

Hearing Dates: 21  22 June 2011
Judgment: 22 June 2011

Counsel: Ms T. Leweni for State
Ms N. Nawasaitoga for Accused

JUDGMENT

[1]     
The assessors have expressed unanimous opinion that the Accused is not guilty of rape as charged. The only issue is whether the complainant consented to sexual intercourse.

[2]     
In this regard, I accept the evidence of the Accused over the complainant's evidence. I observed the demeanour of the Accused when he gave evidence. He struck me as a truthful witness. I accept his evidence that the sexual intercourse that took place between him and the complainant on 5 June 2010 was with her consent.

[3]     
Having directed myself in accordance with the law and the evidence contained in my summing up, I accept the unanimous opinion of the assessors and find the Accused not guilty of rape as charged. Accordingly, the Accused is acquitted of the charge.
