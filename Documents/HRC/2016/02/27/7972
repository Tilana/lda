<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/17, the Human Rights Council decided to establish an 
</p>
<p>independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the implications of the Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>2. On 6 July 2012, the President of the Human Rights Council appointed three high-
</p>
<p>level experts as members of the fact-finding mission: Christine Chanet (Chairperson), 
</p>
<p>Asma Jahangir and Unity Dow. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Terms of reference and methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>3. The members of the mission convened for the first time in Geneva in August 2012, 
</p>
<p>and held meetings with the representatives of concerned permanent missions and other 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders. The mission adopted its terms of reference in the light of the mandate 
</p>
<p>conferred on it by the Human Rights Council, which it considered had clearly instructed it 
</p>
<p>to investigate all the human rights implications of the Israeli settlements for the Palestinians 
</p>
<p>in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The mission interpreted its mandate to require it to 
</p>
<p>conduct its investigations within the legal framework of international human rights law, 
</p>
<p>together with other relevant bodies of international law. The mission notes that the Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements also have other implications, including for the rights of those residing inside the 
</p>
<p>settlements and in Israel. 
</p>
<p>4. For the purpose of its work, the mission understands &#8213;Israeli settlements&#8214; to 
</p>
<p>encompass all physical and non-physical structures and processes that constitute, enable 
</p>
<p>and support the establishment, expansion and maintenance of Israeli residential 
</p>
<p>communities beyond the Green Line of 1949 in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see 
</p>
<p>annex I).1 The mission did not differentiate between &#8213;settlements&#8214;, &#8213;settlement blocks&#8214;, 
</p>
<p>&#8213;outposts&#8214; or any other structures that have been erected, established, expanded and/or 
</p>
<p>appropriated or any land or natural resources appropriated. 
</p>
<p>5. Guided by the principles of &#8213;do no harm&#8214;, independence, impartiality, objectivity, 
</p>
<p>discretion, transparency, confidentiality, integrity and professionalism, the mission 
</p>
<p>carefully analysed all available information that it considered relevant and credible.  
</p>
<p>6. To ensure the greatest availability of such information, the mission issued a public 
</p>
<p>call for written submissions, which it also directly shared with representatives of Israeli 
</p>
<p>settler communities. In response to the call, it received 62 submissions. The mission 
</p>
<p>analysed information received from Governments, intergovernmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>international and national non-governmental organizations, professional bodies, academics, 
</p>
<p>victims, witnesses and the media. The mission did not receive any testimony or submission 
</p>
<p>on an anonymous basis. All information received was treated with due confidentiality.  
</p>
<p>7. The mission had expected to undertake field visits to Israel and the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory in order to observe directly the situation on the ground. It addressed 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 These include, inter alia, the &#8213;wall&#8214; (denoting the physical barrier constructed by Israel since 2002); 
</p>
<p>checkpoints, closure obstacles, bypass roads, tunnels and the permit system; legal systems; 
</p>
<p>commercial and industrial infrastructure; and planning and zoning regimes. See annex II. </p>


<p>five requests for cooperation to the Government of Israel through the Permanent Mission of 
</p>
<p>Israel in Geneva. The Government did not respond to the mission&#8216;s requests. The mission 
</p>
<p>regrets the fact that the Government did not respond and that, consequently, it did not have 
</p>
<p>access to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Alternative arrangements were 
</p>
<p>made to obtain direct and first-hand information in the form of a series of meetings held 
</p>
<p>with a wide range of interlocutors from 3 to 8 November 2012 in Jordan.  
</p>
<p>8. During its visit to Jordan, the mission listened to and collected information on a 
</p>
<p>wide range of relevant issues from more than 50 people affected by the settlements and/or 
</p>
<p>working in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. It met with victims of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Jordan, officials from the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Authority, and representatives of international and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and United Nations agencies. The mission kept a record of all testimony 
</p>
<p>given. 
</p>
<p>9. The present report is the result of the mission&#8216;s consideration and analysis of all the 
</p>
<p>submissions and information it received and gathered.2 The mission points out that a 
</p>
<p>number of interlocutors requested explicitly that their identity not be disclosed. The mission 
</p>
<p>is grateful to all those who extended their cooperation to it. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>10. The international legal framework applicable to the issue before the mission is 
</p>
<p>primarily provided for in international human rights law and international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law.  
</p>
<p>11. Israel is bound to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the full range of the social, 
</p>
<p>economic, cultural, civil and political human rights of all persons within its jurisdiction as a 
</p>
<p>result of its being party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in 
</p>
<p>armed conflict, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination. Israel is also bound by relevant international human rights rules that are a 
</p>
<p>part of customary international law.  
</p>
<p>12. The rights protected by human rights treaties must be available to all individuals in 
</p>
<p>the territory of or subject to the jurisdiction of Israel, except where the State has lawfully 
</p>
<p>derogated from them. The treaty bodies of the United Nations that monitor the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the applicable human rights treaties have consistently concluded that the 
</p>
<p>treaties to which Israel is a party are applicable with regard to acts carried out by Israel in 
</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory.3 This was confirmed by the International Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice in 2004.4 Furthermore, the human rights obligations of Israel apply in both peace 
</p>
<p>and times of armed conflict. In the latter situation, they continue to apply alongside 
</p>

<p>international humanitarian law to provide complementary and mutually reinforcing 
</p>
<p>protection. 
</p>
<p>13. A situation of military occupation prevails in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. As 
</p>
<p>the occupying Power, Israel is bound under international humanitarian law by a set of 
</p>
<p>obligations which are provided for in the Hague Regulations of 1907, annexed to the 
</p>
<p>Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which are recognized 
</p>
<p>as part of customary international law, and the Geneva Convention relative to the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 (Fourth Geneva Convention), to 
</p>
<p>which Israel is a High Contracting Party. 
</p>
<p>14. The applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory was decisively established by the International Court of Justice,5 and has been 
</p>
<p>recognized and consistently reaffirmed by, inter alia, the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly.6 Under the 
</p>
<p>Fourth Geneva Convention, Palestinians living under occupation are &#8213;protected persons&#8214; 
</p>
<p>and thus the focus of the obligations of Israel under humanitarian law therein.  
</p>
<p>15. International humanitarian law establishes obligations on Israel concerning, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, humane treatment and physical integrity of the Palestinians as protected persons; 
</p>
<p>respect for their basic rights to education, a fair trial, family, health, religion, and work; 
</p>
<p>maintenance of public order and safety; respect for existing laws; respect for and protection 
</p>
<p>of real and personal property; and the management of public property, including natural 
</p>
<p>resources. 
</p>
<p>16. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also prohibits the occupying Power 
</p>
<p>from transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territory that it occupies. This 
</p>
<p>prohibition has attained the status of customary international law. The mission notes that 
</p>
<p>the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>violate this provision and are, thus, illegal under international law.7  
</p>
<p>17. The mission also considered, where necessary, other international law frameworks 
</p>
<p>and principles. In a situation of prevailing impunity, the law on State responsibility for 
</p>
<p>internationally wrongful acts, including third-State responsibility, is relevant. International 
</p>
<p>criminal law enables the pursuit of individual criminal responsibility for conduct that 
</p>
<p>amounts to international crimes. In this regard, on 3 December 2012, Palestine addressed 
</p>
<p>identical letters to the Secretary-General and the Security Council. Citing article 
</p>
<p>8(2)(b)(viii) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, it stated that &#8213;Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlement activities&#8214; constitute war crimes, and that Israel must be held accountable for 
</p>
<p>such acts.8

<p><b> III. Context</b>9<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. Israeli settlements are located beyond the Green Line of 1949 and include structures 
</p>
<p>in East Jerusalem and in Area C of the West Bank. The Oslo Accords established Area A, 
</p>
<p>comprising approximately 18 per cent of the West Bank and encompassing urban 
</p>
<p>Palestinian areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority; Area B, representing 
</p>
<p>some 22 per cent of the vast majority of Palestinian rural areas, under Palestinian civil 
</p>
<p>control, while the Israeli army has security control; and Area C, comprising an estimated 60 
</p>
<p>per cent of the territory, under full Israeli control for security, planning and construction 
</p>
<p>purposes. Settlements are generally located among the more vulnerable sections of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian society, predominantly agrarian villages.  
</p>
<p>19. The mission was informed that settlers may be divided broadly into three categories. 
</p>
<p>The first are those who have moved on quality-of-life grounds and live in settlements close 
</p>
<p>to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The second, ultra-Orthodox Jews, who constitute more than 25 
</p>
<p>per cent10 of the settler population, live in settlements largely isolated from other Israelis; 
</p>
<p>ultra-Orthodox Jews seem also to be motivated by economic incentives and cheaper 
</p>
<p>housing and are generally found in settlements closer to the Green Line. A third group 
</p>
<p>seems to be motivated by political and religious ideologies; they live in the central part of 
</p>
<p>the West Bank, often very close to Palestinian communities. 
</p>
<p>20. Since 1967, the Governments of Israel have openly led and directly participated in 
</p>
<p>the planning, construction, development, consolidation and/or encouragement of 
</p>
<p>settlements by including explicit provisions in the fundamental policy instrument (basic 
</p>
<p>policy guidelines), establishing governmental structures and implementing specific 
</p>
<p>measures. These specific measures include (a) building infrastructure; (b) encouraging 
</p>
<p>Jewish migrants to Israel to move to settlements; (c) sponsoring economic activities; (d) 
</p>
<p>supporting settlements through public services delivery and development projects; and (e) 
</p>
<p>seizing Palestinian land, some privately owned, requisitioning land for &#8213;military needs&#8214;, 
</p>
<p>declaring or registering land as &#8213;State land&#8214; and expropriating land for &#8213;public needs&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>21. Government investment in the settlements has not been made explicit in the public 
</p>
<p>budget, but allocated through hidden provisions in a process described by the former Head 
</p>
<p>of the Israeli Civil Service Commission, Itzhak Galnoor (1994-1996), as (in 2007) 
</p>
<p>&#8213;partially secretive&#8214; and (in 2011) as &#8213;a political tool&#8214;. Government investment, excluding 
</p>
<p>military expenses, has fluctuated over the years, with an estimated peak of $795.8 million 
</p>
<p>in 2005.11 Quasi-governmental organizations, funded by the Government, including the 
</p>
<p>World Zionist Organization, also provide funds to the settlements. 
</p>
<p>22. A governmental scheme of subsidies and incentives has been put in place to 
</p>
<p>encourage Jewish migrants to Israel to move to settlements and to boost their economic 
</p>
<p>development. Settlements have been defined as &#8213;national priority areas&#8214;, and benefit from 
</p>
<p>housing and education subsidies and direct incentives to the industrial, agricultural and 
</p>
<p>tourism sectors.  
</p>
<p>23. Various sources refer to settlement master plans, including the Allon Plan (1967), 
</p>
<p>the Drobles Plan (1978) &#8211; later expanded as the Sharon Plan (1981) &#8211; and the Hundred 
</p>
<p>Thousand Plan (1983). Although these plans were never officially approved, they have

<p>largely been acted upon by successive Governments of Israel. The mission notes a pattern 
</p>
<p>whereby plans developed for the settlements have been mirrored in Government policy 
</p>
<p>instruments and implemented on the ground. 
</p>
<p>24. The first settlement established was Kefar Ezyon, in September 1967. In the early 
</p>
<p>years, the establishment of settlements followed a typical pattern. The settlers had access to 
</p>
<p>the highest ranking Government officials, played on their emotional ties to the land and 
</p>
<p>encouraged these officials to lead and participate in establishing and expanding settlements 
</p>
<p>through, inter alia, the seizure of land for &#8213;military purposes&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>25. In June 1967, Israel illegally annexed 70 km
2
 of land incorporating East Jerusalem 
</p>
<p>and a number of nearby Palestinian villages into the expanded boundaries of the Jerusalem 
</p>
<p>municipality of Israel. It promptly built 12 Israeli &#8213;neighbourhoods&#8214; that enveloped nearby 
</p>
<p>Palestinian quarters and villages. An outer layer of settlements beyond the municipal 
</p>
<p>boundaries were then built, thereby severing the geographical continuity of the city from 
</p>
<p>the rest of the West Bank. Since the 1970s, the Jerusalem municipality of Israel has openly 
</p>
<p>pursued a policy of &#8213;demographic balance&#8214;, most recently seen in the city master plan also 
</p>
<p>known as &#8213;Jerusalem 2000&#8214;. The master plan calls for a 60/40 demographic balance in 
</p>
<p>favour of Jewish residents. 
</p>
<p>26. Studies on settlements commissioned by the Office of the Prime Minister in 2005 
</p>
<p>(the Sason report) and 2012 (the Levy report) document the Government&#8216;s authorization in 
</p>
<p>the establishment and expansion of settlements up to 1992, and indicate that settlements 
</p>
<p>built afterwards with no Government authorization (&#8213;outposts&#8214;) were established with the 
</p>
<p>&#8213;full knowledge of all [authorities], starting with the government ministers and prime 
</p>
<p>minister, and until the lowest enforcing agencies (&#8230;) the denial had but one goal only: to 
</p>
<p>withstand criticism by various factors, mostly international&#8214;.12 Sason concluded that 
</p>
<p>&#8213;unauthorized outposts violate[s] standard procedure, good governing rules (&#8230;) endanger 
</p>
<p>the principle of the rule of law [and thus] urgent measures must be taken to change [this] 
</p>
<p>reality&#8214;.13 In contrast, the findings of the Levy report suggested the retroactive authorization 
</p>
<p>of &#8213;outposts&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>27. In September 2005, through the &#8213;disengagement plan&#8214;, Israel dismantled 21 
</p>
<p>settlements in the Gaza Strip (and four in the West Bank), evacuated the settlers residing 
</p>
<p>there and withdrew the army, while maintaining exclusive control of the airspace of Gaza 
</p>
<p>and continued to conduct military activities in the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip. The 
</p>
<p>&#8213;disengagement plan&#8214; was presented in Israel as an essential step to preserve its control 
</p>
<p>over the settlements in the West Bank. Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been 
</p>
<p>quoted as saying &#8213;in the framework of the &#8215;disengagement plan&#8216;, Israel would strengthen its 
</p>
<p>control of those parts of the land that will constitute an inalienable part of the State of Israel 
</p>
<p>in any future agreement.&#8214;14  
</p>
<p>28. Since 1967, some 250 settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have 
</p>
<p>been established, either with or without Government authorization. The number of settlers 
</p>
<p>is estimated at 520,00015 (200,00016 in East Jerusalem and 320,000 in the rest of the West

<p>Bank). According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, over the past decade, the settler 
</p>
<p>population has grown at a much higher rate than the population in Israel itself, with a yearly 
</p>
<p>average growth of 5.3 per cent (excluding East Jerusalem), compared with 1.8 per cent in 
</p>
<p>Israel.  
</p>
<p>29. After years of court orders, the Migron and Ulpana &#8213;outposts&#8214; were evacuated in 
</p>
<p>2012. Settlers responsible for appropriating private Palestinian land without Government 
</p>
<p>authorization were, however, provided after the evacuation with new homes in nearby 
</p>
<p>settlements. The Government paid for the transfer of their property and the rental on the 
</p>
<p>new homes.  
</p>
<p>30. The Government in office since April 2009 has contributed to the consolidation and 
</p>
<p>expansion of settlements. Government spending on the settlements during 2011 was 38 per 
</p>
<p>cent more than in 2010.

<p>stated &#8213;we&#8216;ve doubled the budget for Judea and Samaria [the West Bank]. We did this in a 
</p>
<p>low-profile manner, because we didn't want parties either in Israel or abroad to thwart the 
</p>
<p>move.&#8214;18 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implications of Israeli settlements on the rights of 
Palestinians  
</b></p>
<p>31. The mission notes that the impact of settlements on the human rights of the 
</p>
<p>Palestinians is manifested in various forms and ways. These are interrelated, forming part 
</p>
<p>of an overall pattern. The structure of the report is intended to reflect this reality. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>32. The mission notes that, in its resolution 67/19, the General Assembly reaffirmed 
</p>
<p>&#8213;the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to independence in their State 
</p>
<p>of Palestine on the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>33. In a report on the issue, the Secretary-General warned that (the demographic and 
</p>
<p>territorial presence of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was put 
</p>
<p>at risk by the continued transfer by Israel, the occupying Power, of its population into the 
</p>
<p>occupied territory, observing that Israel had transferred approximately 8 per cent of its 
</p>
<p>citizens into the Occupied Palestinian Territory since the 1970s. He also recalled that the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice concluded that the construction of the wall, coupled with the 
</p>
<p>establishment of Israeli settlements, was altering the demographic composition of the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, and thus was severely impeding the exercise by the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian people of their right to self-determination.
19
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>34. The establishment of the settlements and the creation of dozens of enclaves have 
</p>
<p>also caused the fragmentation of the West Bank. The mission heard that the establishment

<p>of Ma&#8216;ale Adummim and its expansion has had a much wider significance than the local 
</p>
<p>impact of most settlements by severing territorial continuity between Palestinian 
</p>
<p>communities.20 The Wall &#8213;where it is built or planned, truncates and chops up Palestinian 
</p>
<p>space with &#8215;fingers&#8216; extending deep into the West Bank. (&#8230;) Its &#8213;route threatens to divide 
</p>
<p>the West Bank into two separate areas and cut off East Jerusalem from the rest of the West 
</p>
<p>Bank&#8214;.21 
</p>
<p>35. The Government of Israel has full security and administrative control over the 
</p>
<p>settlement areas, and effectively controls the external borders of the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory. Regional councils composed exclusively of representatives of Israeli settlers 
</p>
<p>exercise planning functions in settlement areas. Neither the Palestinian Authority nor local 
</p>
<p>Palestinian communities have any control over the governance, administration and planning 
</p>
<p>of these areas.  
</p>
<p>36. The settlements, including the associated restrictions, impede Palestinian access to 
</p>
<p>and control over their natural resources. In his report, the Secretary-General noted that 
</p>
<p>Palestinians had virtually no control over the water resources in the West Bank.22 Eighty-
</p>
<p>six per cent of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea is under the de facto jurisdiction of the 
</p>
<p>settlement regional councils. Settlements exploit mineral extraction and fertile agricultural 
</p>
<p>lands, denying Palestinians access to their natural resources. 
</p>
<p>37. In December 2012, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported 
</p>
<p>that, while the fenced areas of settlements cover only 3 per cent of the West Bank, in reality 
</p>
<p>43 per cent of the territory is allocated to local and regional settlement councils.23 There are 
</p>
<p>approximately 150,000 Palestinians living in Area C in close proximity to more than 
</p>
<p>320,000 Israeli settlers. In East Jerusalem, some 200,000 settlers have been introduced into 
</p>
<p>Palestinian areas with a Palestinian population of about 390,000. The negative impact of 
</p>
<p>Israeli settlements on the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people extends, 
</p>
<p>however, to the Palestinian people as a whole.  
</p>
<p>38. The mission considers that the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, 
</p>
<p>including the right to determine how to implement self-determination, the right to have a 
</p>
<p>demographic and territorial presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the right to 
</p>
<p>permanent sovereignty over natural resources, is clearly being violated by Israel through the 
</p>
<p>existence and ongoing expansion of the settlements. The transfer of Israeli citizens into the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, prohibited under international humanitarian law and 
</p>
<p>international criminal law, is a central feature of the practices and policies of Israel.

<p><b> B. Equality and right to non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Inequality and discrimination in the application of the law 
</b></p>
<p>39. Information presented to the mission demonstrates that distinct legal systems exist in 
</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory and are applied separately to Israeli settlers and 
</p>
<p>Palestinians. Broadly, Israelis in Area C are subject to Israeli domestic law enforced by the 
</p>
<p>police and courts in Israel. A patchwork of Israeli military orders and Ottoman, British and 
</p>
<p>Jordanian legislation is applied to Palestinians, who are also subject to a military court 
</p>
<p>system with a wide jurisdictional reach.  
</p>
<p>40. By &#8213;channelling&#8214; Israeli civil law into the territory of settlements, &#8213;legal zones&#8214; 
</p>
<p>have been established within the West Bank where Israeli laws apply to settlers in order, for 
</p>
<p>example, to regulate the status and authority of governmental institutions within 
</p>
<p>settlements. These laws do not apply to Palestinians. Other Israeli laws are applied 
</p>
<p>personally to Israelis in the West Bank, giving them preferential legal status over 
</p>
<p>Palestinians. A matrix of military orders applies personally, by law or by practice, only to 
</p>
<p>Palestinians to regulate and control most aspects of daily life, including by restricting an 
</p>
<p>extensive range of rights. Israelis and Palestinians are also treated differently by the same 
</p>
<p>laws; for instance, some military orders designate areas in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory as &#8213;closed military zones/areas&#8214;. With the exception of military training or firing 
</p>
<p>zones, only Palestinians are prohibited from entering such areas unless they have a permit, 
</p>
<p>even if the area encompasses Palestinian land, thereby denying Palestinians access to or 
</p>
<p>ownership of land. The so-called &#8213;seam zone&#8214; is closed to Palestinians, while Israelis and 
</p>
<p>foreign visitors have unrestricted access. Certain other Israeli laws expressly discriminate 
</p>
<p>against Palestinians. In 2012, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</p>
<p>reiterated its concern about the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary 
</p>
<p>Provision) that suspends, with rare exceptions, family reunification between an Israeli 
</p>
<p>citizen and a person residing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, with a severe impact on 
</p>
<p>family rights. 
</p>
<p>41. The mission again noted the extraterritorial personal application of Israeli 
</p>
<p>legislation, with the application of Israeli criminal law to Israelis in the West Bank with 
</p>
<p>respect to offences they allegedly committed there. 
</p>
<p>42. According to the Secretary-General, lack of accountability permeates all types of 
</p>
<p>acts of violence committed by Israeli settlers against property and persons.
24
</p>
<p> The situation 
</p>
<p>today closely resembles that described by the inquiry conducted in 1984 into action taken 
</p>
<p>with regard to settler violence headed by the then Israeli Deputy Attorney General, Yehudit 
</p>
<p>Karp. According to Yesh Din, an Israeli non-governmental organization that monitored 869 
</p>
<p>cases between 2005 and 2012, more than 91 per cent of all investigations concluded into 
</p>
<p>complaints of criminal offences against Palestinian persons and property in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory were closed without an indictment being served, mostly owing to 
</p>
<p>investigative failures.25 This is despite the fact that attacks and intimidation by settlers 
</p>
<p>against Palestinians are often carried out in daylight and in the presence of Israeli army or 
</p>
<p>police personnel, who frequently do not stop the violence or are ineffective. 
</p>
<p>43. The mission was informed that, when acts of violence are committed by Palestinians 
</p>
<p>against settlers, these are appropriately addressed, indicating that the lack of law 
</p>

<p>enforcement experienced by Palestinians is largely a matter of political will. Between 90 to 
</p>
<p>95 per cent of cases against Palestinians are investigated and go to court.
 
 
</p>
<p>44. The failure to conduct effective investigations and prosecutions of settler violence 
</p>
<p>impedes Palestinians&#8216; access to an effective remedy. This is compounded by the multiple 
</p>
<p>barriers presented to Palestinians by the court system, including time, cost, language and 
</p>
<p>procedural barriers coupled with inadequate notification of relevant orders and declarations. 
</p>
<p>Fear and lack of confidence in the courts also act as deterrents to seeking redress. 
</p>
<p>Palestinians are also significantly limited from seeking compensation from the State of 
</p>
<p>Israel for certain conduct by its agents pursuant to the Civil Torts (Liability of the State) 
</p>
<p>Law 2005, as amended in 2012. 
</p>
<p>45. The Supreme Court of Israel sitting as the High Court of Justice does not offer 
</p>
<p>Palestinians a clear avenue for recourse. The High Court has consistently deferred to the 
</p>
<p>Government of Israel on matters relating to the settlements, and has rendered the question 
</p>
<p>of the legality of the settlements non-justiciable. While on occasion the Court has found in 
</p>
<p>favour of Palestinian petitioners, it has both substantially limited its oversight role and 
</p>
<p>provided a legal space in which the settlements have been developed. Additionally, where 
</p>
<p>judicial rulings have favoured the Palestinian petitioners, there is a consistent lack of 
</p>
<p>enforcement of them.
 
 
</p>
<p>46. Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory endure a discriminatory 
</p>
<p>application of a military court system that does not comply with international standards of 
</p>
<p>fair trial and administration of justice.26 In testimony to the mission, a witness explained 
</p>
<p>that &#8213;two individuals in the West Bank may commit the same offence. One is investigated 
</p>
<p>by the police in the West Bank and brought before a military court, and can be detained up 
</p>
<p>to eight days without seeing a judge. The Israeli who has done the same is investigated and 
</p>
<p>brought before a civilian judge, and enjoys all the safeguards of a modern criminal process. 
</p>
<p>Both face different penalties. The prevailing legal systems in Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory translate into stark inequality before the law. 
</p>
<p>47. Palestinians are routinely subject to arbitrary arrest and detention, including 
</p>
<p>administrative detention, mass arrests and incarceration. It is estimated that more than 
</p>
<p>700,000 Palestinians, including children, have been held in Israeli military detention since 
</p>
<p>the beginning of the occupation, many in prisons located within Israel.27 In 2012, 
</p>
<p>approximately 4,100 Palestinians were in Israeli military detention, of whom 143 were aged 
</p>
<p>between 16 and 18 years, and 21 were below 16 years old.28 It is well documented that the 
</p>
<p>military court system does not ensure Palestinians basic fair trial guarantees, including 
</p>
<p>minimum standards of independence, clear evidentiary or procedural rules, the presumption 
</p>
<p>of innocence or the duty to hear witnesses or examine all material evidence. 
</p>
<p>48. Most children are arrested at friction points, such as villages near settlements or on 
</p>
<p>roads used by the army or settlers and that run by a Palestinian village. From point of arrest, 
</p>
<p>they face multiple violations of their rights to liberty and security and fair trial through 
</p>
<p>interrogation, arbitrary detention and abuse, trial and sentencing. Approximately 90 per 
</p>
<p>cent of children plead guilty and are given custodial sentences. The mission heard 
</p>
<p>testimony that &#8213;in short, pleading guilty is the quickest way out of the system, whether the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 See CCPR/CO/78/ISR, para. 12, and CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, para. 7.

<p>offence was committed or not.&#8214; Approximately 60 per cent of Palestinian children serve 
</p>
<p>their sentences inside Israel.29 
</p>
<p>49. The legal regime of segregation operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has 
</p>
<p>enabled the establishment and the consolidation of the settlements through the creation of a 
</p>
<p>privileged legal space for settlements and settlers. It results in daily violations of a 
</p>
<p>multitude of the human rights of the Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including, incontrovertibly, violating their rights to non-discrimination, equality before the 
</p>
<p>law and equal protection of the law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Settlers violence and intimidation 
</b></p>
<p>50. All spheres of Palestinian life are being significantly affected by a minority of 
</p>
<p>settlers who are engaged in violence and intimidation with the aim of forcing Palestinians 
</p>
<p>off their land. There was consistency in testimonies with regard to the following facts: 
</p>
<p>attacks and intimidation regularly take place during daylight hours; the identity of 
</p>
<p>perpetrators are well known, or perpetrators could easily be identified; the frequent 
</p>
<p>presence of police and army at the scene; the involvement and presence of settlement 
</p>
<p>security officers; the frequent existence of video and photographic footage of the incidents; 
</p>
<p>and the lack of accountability for the violence. 
</p>
<p>51. The mission heard testimonies on incidents of settler violence and intimidation 
</p>
<p>dating back to 1973. A report of the Security Council Commission established under 
</p>
<p>resolution 446 (1979)30 drew attention to settler attacks on property and acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>that restricted access to water and obstructed children&#8216;s schooling. The Commission noted 
</p>
<p>that the intent of these attacks was to pressure Palestinians to leave the land. Palestinian 
</p>
<p>deaths and injuries as a result of settler attacks have been recorded since 1980; the mission 
</p>
<p>notes the statistics compiled by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that 
</p>
<p>show that, in the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012, Israeli settlers injured 147 
</p>
<p>Palestinians, including 34 children.  
</p>
<p>52. The mission heard numerous testimonies on violent attacks by settlers, including 
</p>
<p>physical assaults, the use of knives, axes, clubs and other improvised weapons, as well as 
</p>
<p>shootings and the throwing of Molotov cocktails. The testimonies also recounted the 
</p>
<p>psychological impact of intimidation by armed settlers trespassing on Palestinian land, at 
</p>
<p>Palestinian water springs or in the midst of Palestinian neighbourhoods in Hebron and East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem. In some cases, testimonies described years of violence and intimidation directed 
</p>
<p>at the same Palestinian family living in proximity to settlements that had pushed it to 
</p>
<p>abandon its properties.  
</p>
<p>53. The mission heard testimony of the impact of settler violence on children, and notes 
</p>
<p>an increasing trend in their death and injuries. In a submission to the mission, Defence of 
</p>
<p>Children International &#8211;Palestine had documented 127 cases in the West Bank, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem, including four fatalities, since 2008. Settler attacks on schools and 
</p>
<p>harassment of children on their way to school has followed an upward trend since 2010. 
</p>
<p>Testimonies from residents of the village of Al Twanyi describe how children must have 
</p>
<p>Israeli army escorts on their way to and from school to protect them from settler attacks. 
</p>
<p>These escorts are not always provided by the Israeli army or, when provided, are often 
</p>
<p>erratic<i>.</i> 
</p>

</p>

<p>54. The mission also notes the impact of violence and intimidation on the lives and 
</p>
<p>livelihoods of Palestinian farmers, by preventing the access of Palestinians to their land 
</p>
<p>close to settlements through violence and intimidation; burning, uprooting and attacking 
</p>
<p>Palestinian crops; settlers taking over the land and planting their own crops; and fencing off 
</p>
<p>and building on Palestinian agricultural lands. The olive industry is a primary source of 
</p>
<p>income for Palestinian farmers; the olive harvest is therefore a particularly vulnerable 
</p>
<p>period of the year for Palestinian farmers and their crops.31
 
From 2005 to 2012, Yesh Din 
</p>
<p>monitored 162 investigations into vandalism against Palestinian trees (predominantly olive 
</p>
<p>trees); only one investigation led to an indictment.32 Figures for 2012 (until mid-October) 
</p>
<p>show that, during that period, more than 7,500 trees had been damaged or destroyed by 
</p>
<p>settlers.33 </p>
<p>55. The mission heard testimonies on &#8213;price-tag&#8214; attacks, a phenomenon considered 
</p>
<p>distinct from other forms of settler violence. The attacks aim at exacting a price on the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian population living close to settlements for any political or legal move that the 
</p>
<p>settlers interpret as being contrary to their interests. The mission understands that the intent 
</p>
<p>is to deter Israeli authorities from taking any action perceived to be against settlers&#8216; 
</p>
<p>interests while at the same time to provoke Palestinians into a reaction. An-Najah 
</p>
<p>University identified 119 price-tag incidents from 2008 to September 2012.34 The attacks 
</p>
<p>most commonly involve vandalism and the burning of property, cars and houses, and are 
</p>
<p>often accompanied by racist graffiti. The Department of State of the United States of 
</p>
<p>America categorized three price-tag attacks on mosques and a Muslim cemetery as terrorist 
</p>
<p>incidents.35 
</p>
<p>56. The mission is concerned that specific programmes devised to deal with the impact 
</p>
<p>of settler violence on physical and mental health have had to be developed by non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations as a result of the failure of Israeli authorities to stop settler 
</p>
<p>violence and of the persistence of impunity in this regard. The mission notes with particular 
</p>
<p>concern the situation of children and the impact on their development.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>57. Violence, verbal and physical abuses, inhumane and degrading treatment, forced 
</p>
<p>evictions, land and property grabbing, the destruction of property and housing and many of 
</p>
<p>the issues for which testimonies and information was gathered gravely affect the right to the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Depression, 
</p>
<p>anxiety, symptomatic stress, mood disorder and behaviour problems, and post-traumatic 
</p>
<p>stress disorders are some of the most current conditions reported by specialists. Impunity, a 
</p>
<p>feeling of injustice, the recurrence of events and anticipation of renewed abuses, especially 
</p>
<p>on relatives and children, compound these conditions.<b> 
</b></p>

<p><b> 3. Restrictions on religious freedom and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>58. In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem and Nablus all 
</p>
<p>host places of considerable religious significance for Christianity, Judaism and Islam. 
</p>
<p>While the impact of settlements is manifested in various forms throughout the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>the mission notes that both Jerusalem and Hebron have been targeted by particularly 
</p>
<p>aggressive settlement policies and practices owing to their religious significance. 
</p>
<p>Settlements have been established in the heart of both cities, disrupting the lives and the 
</p>
<p>development of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. In addition, major settlement 
</p>
<p>infrastructure has been built around Jerusalem and, to a lesser extent, Hebron, enveloping 
</p>
<p>them and severing social and economic ties with the rest of Palestinian society, while 
</p>
<p>linking the various settlements and the territory of the State of Israel.  
</p>
<p>59. The mission was also informed about archaeological excavations being conducted in 
</p>
<p>and around the Old City of Jerusalem and the construction there of a network of 
</p>
<p>underground tunnels, including those connecting settlement installations in the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood of Silwan with the Old City. It has been alleged that these archaeological 
</p>
<p>excavations are intended to emphasize Jewish cultural heritage while disregarding &#8211; or 
</p>
<p>worse undermining &#8211; the rich heritage of other cultures that have contributed to the 
</p>
<p>millenary history of the city.  
</p>
<p>60. The mission received numerous reports of Palestinians being denied access to places 
</p>
<p>of worship. Limited entry through checkpoints and area closures during holy days prevents 
</p>
<p>Palestinians from attending holy rituals at appointed times at places of worship. The 
</p>
<p>mission also learned that, since 2008, mosques and Christian churches have been targeted 
</p>
<p>in price-tag attacks, including at least nine price-tag arson attacks against Palestinian 
</p>
<p>mosques and 21 incidents where graffiti was used to desecrate mosques, churches and 
</p>
<p>burial grounds with provocative slogans of a racist or a sacrilegious nature, intended to 
</p>
<p>inflame the situation.36  
</p>
<p>61. The mission is concerned that policies and acts aimed at altering the composition of 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem and Hebron by erasing cultural heritage on the basis of religious affiliation, 
</p>
<p>together with redrawing municipal boundaries, are being carried out with the involvement 
</p>
<p>of the Government of Israel, with pernicious effects. It is further concerned that the 
</p>
<p>Palestinians&#8216; right to freedom of religion is being restricted by the settlements. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Dispossession and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>62. Dispossession and displacement featured in most of the submissions, reports and 
</p>
<p>testimony received by the mission. The information brought to light a number of different 
</p>
<p>mechanisms exploited to seize Palestinian land, as well as a discriminatory planning and 
</p>
<p>zoning policy that favours the development of settlements and, as the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded, breaches a range of fundamental rights of 
</p>
<p>Palestinians.37  
</p>
<p>63. Since the beginning of the occupation, Palestinians have seen over 1 million 
</p>
<p>dunams38 of their land seized, enabled by a combination of military orders and selective 
</p>
<p>interpretation of the Ottoman Land Code that ruled land tenure throughout the Ottoman, 
</p>
<p>Mandatory and Jordanian periods. In particular, land has been lost through seizure for 
</p>
<p>military needs, absentee property laws and the declaration of State lands.

</p>
<p> 37 CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para. 25. 
</p>
<p> 38 One dunam equals 1,000 m2. </p>


<p>64. Seized lands are placed within the jurisdictional boundaries of local and regional 
</p>
<p>settlement councils, used not only for urbanization but also as buffer zones surrounding 
</p>
<p>settlements or turned into recreational and nature areas to which Palestinians have no 
</p>
<p>access.  
</p>
<p>65. While the issue is critical throughout the West Bank, the mission notes the large 
</p>
<p>number of demolitions, demolition orders, forced evictions and &#8213;relocation&#8214; plans in zones 
</p>
<p>identified for the consolidation of settlements, including around Bethlehem and the E-1 
</p>
<p>project, aimed at creating an urban continuum between East Jerusalem and Maale Adumim. 
</p>
<p>In this area, the Jahalin Bedouin community in Khan Al-Akhmar, which in the past has 
</p>
<p>experienced several demolitions, lives under the threat of forcible displacement. 
</p>
<p>&#8213;Relocation&#8214; plans are currently under discussion, including to a location near a landfill site 
</p>
<p>where, in 1996, Bedouins had already been relocated in connection with earlier settlement 
</p>
<p>expansions.  
</p>
<p>66. Bedouin communities in general are particularly vulnerable to displacement and 
</p>
<p>dispossession. Eighty per cent of them live in the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea area and 
</p>
<p>around Hebron, constituting the majority of the population in closed military training and 
</p>
<p>firing zones. Many of these communities have already experienced multiple displacements. 
</p>
<p>Many are food insecure, do not have access to basic services, and are not connected to the 
</p>
<p>electricity grid, the road network or water systems. More than 90 per cent face water 
</p>
<p>scarcity, living with less than one-quarter of the minimum standards set by the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization (WHO).39 The Israeli army routinely demolishes their shelters and 
</p>
<p>property, including those provided by or built with the assistance of aid agencies and 
</p>
<p>international donors. In the South Hebron hills, eight villages are at risk of eviction to make 
</p>
<p>way for a new firing zone.  
</p>
<p>67. The processes of dispossession and displacement in the vicinity of settlements and 
</p>
<p>the seam zone include preventing access of Palestinians to their agricultural lands, the 
</p>
<p>takeover and demolition of springs and wells, and movement restrictions. Settler violence 
</p>
<p>and intimidation also play a significant role. 
</p>
<p>68. In East Jerusalem, multiple factors, such as discriminatory building regulations, the 
</p>
<p>large number of demolition orders, residence permit restrictions, the acute housing shortage 
</p>
<p>and violence and intimidation from settlers, put enormous pressures on the city&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Palestinian population. Cases of forced eviction in East Jerusalem, such as in the Sheikh 
</p>
<p>Jarrah neighbourhood, were also reported to the mission, including following successful 
</p>
<p>appeals by settler organizations, some of which linked to Jewish property claims based on 
</p>
<p>their pre-1948 ownership. Numerous testimonies spoke of settlers taking over individual 
</p>
<p>houses inside the Old City. 
</p>
<p>69. Absence of proof of registration (land registration was discontinued by military 
</p>
<p>order in 1968) makes it extremely difficult for Palestinians to obtain recognition of tenure 
</p>
<p>or permits. Besides, Palestinians are excluded from consultative decision-making processes 
</p>
<p>and are not represented in the special planning committees, which are made up of settlers 
</p>
<p>and are entitled to issue and enforce building permits.  
</p>
<p>70. Testimonies confirmed that building permits are rarely if ever granted; in the past 20 
</p>
<p>years, 94 per cent of permit applications were denied. Building without a permit is an 
</p>
<p>offence under military orders, and the execution of a demolition order is accompanied by a 
</p>
<p>large fine. The mission heard in this regard about &#8213;self-demolitions&#8214;, namely, of residents

<p>demolishing their own houses to avoid having to pay a fines. Self-demolitions are not 
</p>
<p>recorded in statistics on demolitions. 
</p>
<p>71. As corroborated by testimonies, many Palestinians are forced to build without a 
</p>
<p>permit, thus living under the constant threat that their home or property may be demolished. 
</p>
<p>Many families and entire communities are at risk of displacement. In East Jerusalem alone, 
</p>
<p>where 33 per cent of Palestinian homes lack building permits, at least 93,100 residents are 
</p>
<p>potentially at risk of being displaced.40 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Restrictions on the freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>72. The mission received information according to which the vast majority of 
</p>
<p>restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians seem to be directly linked to the 
</p>
<p>settlements, and include &#8213;restrictions aimed at protecting the settlements, securing areas for 
</p>
<p>their expansion, and improving the connectivity between settlements and with Israel 
</p>
<p>itself.&#8214;41 The restrictions themselves come in many forms, including settler-only roads, a 
</p>
<p>regime of checkpoints and crossings (closure obstacles), impediments created by the wall 
</p>
<p>and its gate and permit regime, as well as administrative restrictions. The Office for the 
</p>
<p>Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports more than 540 closure obstacles in 2012.42 
</p>
<p>Although there have been significant easing measures in recent years (which have 
</p>
<p>improved connectivity between the main Palestinian cities and towns), movement 
</p>
<p>restrictions reportedly remain in place in areas around settlements.  
</p>
<p>73. The mission notes that restrictions on freedom of movement have a detrimental 
</p>
<p>impact on the access of Palestinians to their land, and have direct consequences for their 
</p>
<p>ability to work and earn a livelihood. The outer expanses of many settlements incorporate 
</p>
<p>Palestinian private property, and access to this land is regulated through the &#8213;prior 
</p>
<p>coordination&#8214; regime whereby the Palestinian landowners are granted a permit for access to 
</p>
<p>their land for a limited number of days each year, normally coinciding with harvest time 
</p>
<p>and based on prior coordination with the Israeli authorities. This regime is in place for 
</p>
<p>Palestinian landowners in some 90 communities with land in the environs of some 55 
</p>
<p>settlements.43 In some cases, the prior coordination regime is applied to private Palestinian 
</p>
<p>land that has been unilaterally fenced off by settlers without authorization by the Israeli 
</p>
<p>authorities. The widespread access restrictions in and around the wall in the form of gate 
</p>
<p>and permit regimes particularly affect access to agricultural land in the seam zone and, as 
</p>
<p>previously noted, these restrictions only apply to the Palestinian population (see paragraph 
</p>
<p>40 above). 
</p>
<p>74. Israel has extended the prior coordination regime to situations where Palestinians 
</p>
<p>face potential settler violence and intimidation. This response has been ineffective in 
</p>
<p>preventing settler violence, while it places the burden of restricting access to land on the 
</p>
<p>victims of settler violence.  
</p>
<p>75. The mission notes that discrimination is particularly evident in the movement 
</p>
<p>restrictions in Hebron and the Jordan Valley, where large Palestinian populations are 
</p>
<p>subjected to permit regimes and areas off limits to traffic and, in some cases, pedestrian

<p>transit. In the H2 area of Hebron, there are 123 movement obstacles are in place to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the movement of approximately 550 Israeli settlers in Hebron and 7,000 in the nearby 
</p>
<p>settlement of Kiryat Arba, at the expense of the Palestinian population (170,000).43 The 
</p>
<p>mission notes that the presence of these settlements has a direct impact on Palestinian 
</p>
<p>livelihoods, as military orders have led to the closure of 512 Palestinian businesses, while at 
</p>
<p>least another 1,100 have closed owing to the restricted access of customers and suppliers.43 
</p>
<p>76. The human rights treaty bodies have expressed their deep concern at restrictions on 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement, describing them as being targeted at a particular national or ethnic 
</p>
<p>group and amounting to gross violations of economic, social and cultural rights.44 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>77. The mission notes that the settlements, including the wall, are the subject of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian demonstrations in places such as Bili&#8216;in and Nabi Saleh, where the vast majority 
</p>
<p>of demonstrators are reported to be acting in a non-violent manner. The Israeli authorities 
</p>
<p>often respond to these demonstrations with restrictions on assembly, declaring areas closed 
</p>
<p>military zones, and employing violent means to suppress demonstrations by firing tear gas, 
</p>
<p>rubber bullets and, on occasion, live rounds. As in the case of closure obstacles that restrict 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement, restrictions on expression and assembly have at their core the aim of 
</p>
<p>ensuring that the daily life of Israeli settlers continues without interruption.45  
</p>
<p>78. The mission heard testimony that, since 2009, residents of Nabi Saleh, a village of 
</p>
<p>600 people, have protested every Friday against the takeover by nearby settlers of the 
</p>
<p>village&#8216;s water spring. The witness described a litany of violent attacks by the Israeli army 
</p>
<p>on peaceful demonstrators that have resulted in one person being killed and more than 400 
</p>
<p>people being injured, including 195 children. On certain occasions, the army has reportedly 
</p>
<p>stopped demonstrations before they have begun by firing tear gas inside the village, forcing 
</p>
<p>all villagers to flee.46  
</p>
<p>79. The mission was informed that Israeli politicians, academics and civil society actors 
</p>
<p>voicing criticism of the settlements are discredited in public discourse. An example of this 
</p>
<p>includes the targeting of veteran combatants who have served in the Israeli military in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory and who voice dissent with the official line of the 
</p>
<p>establishment. The mission acknowledges the valuable contribution made by members of 
</p>
<p>Israeli civil society in highlighting the denial of human rights to the Palestinians by the 
</p>
<p>presence of the settlements. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Restrictions on the right to water 
</b></p>
<p>80. Information and testimonies corroborate the impact of settlement expansion on the 
</p>
<p>right to water of Palestinians, including, as pointed out by, inter alia, the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the great discrepancy between water allocation for 
</p>
<p>Palestinians and settlers, and inequitable access.
 
 
</p>
<p>81. The capacity of the Palestinian Water Authority to develop new water resources is 
</p>
<p>hampered by the water management arrangements governed by the Interim Agreement and 
</p>
<p>the Joint Water Commission that it established, in which &#8213;fundamental asymmetries &#8211; of 
</p>
<p>power, of capacity, of information&#8214; give Israel predominance in the allocation of West

<p>Bank water resources, of which it withdraws 90 per cent.47 The mission learned that a large 
</p>
<p>number of Palestinian projects are rejected by the Commission. In Area C, additional 
</p>
<p>approval is required from the Israeli Civil Administration, even for such small-scale 
</p>
<p>projects as wells or rainwater collection cisterns.  
</p>
<p>82. The ability of the Palestinian Water Authority to transfer water to areas facing water 
</p>
<p>shortages is severely inhibited by territorial fragmentation, since almost every project 
</p>
<p>implies movement through Area C.
 
The mission received testimony about water resources 
</p>
<p>damaged or destroyed by the construction of the wall or lost to the seam zone, cutting off 
</p>
<p>villages from their wells, springs and cisterns. In the Jordan Valley, deep-water drillings by 
</p>
<p>Mekorot, the Israeli national water company, and Mehadrin, an agro-industrial company, 
</p>
<p>have caused Palestinian wells and springs to dry up.
 
Eighty per cent of the total water 
</p>
<p>resources drilled in the area is consumed by Israel and the settlements. 
</p>
<p>83. The lack of availability of Palestinian water resources has led to chronic shortages 
</p>
<p>among Palestinian communities in Area C and a dependence on Mekorot, to which 
</p>
<p>authority over the West Bank water resources was transferred from the military in 1982.  
</p>
<p>84. Mekorot supplies almost half the water consumed by Palestinian communities. The 
</p>
<p>mission heard that Palestinians do not have access to Israeli recycled water available to 
</p>
<p>settlements, and have to use water from the more expensive drinking water supply for 
</p>
<p>irrigation purposes. In the event of a water shortage, valves supplying Palestinian 
</p>
<p>communities are closed; this does not happen for settlements.  
</p>
<p>85. The mission heard of situations where villagers must travel several kilometres to 
</p>
<p>retrieve water when closer water resources serve neighbouring settlements. Settlements 
</p>
<p>benefit from enough water to run farms and orchards, and for swimming pools and spas, 
</p>
<p>while Palestinians often struggle to satisfy their minimum water requirements. According to 
</p>
<p>testimonies received, some settlements consume around 400 litres per capita per day 
</p>
<p>(l/c/d),48 whereas Palestinian consumption is 73 l/c/d, and as little as 10-20 l/c/d49 for 
</p>
<p>Bedouin communities, which depend on expensive and low-quality tanker water.
 
In East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, houses built without a permit cannot connect to the water network. 
</p>
<p>86. Water shortages are further exacerbated by restrictions on movement, the destruction 
</p>
<p>of infrastructure, expropriations, forced evictions and settler violence, which also largely 
</p>
<p>contributes to diminishing access to water for Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>87. Forcible takeovers and vandalism by settlers increasingly impede access to water. 
</p>
<p>According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in March 2012, 30 
</p>
<p>springs in the vicinity of settlements were completely taken over by settlers and 26 were at 
</p>
<p>risk, with settlers fencing them off and threatening villagers. Some of the springs seized 
</p>
<p>have become &#8213;tourist attractions&#8214; or recreational sites, and receive support from the 
</p>
<p>Government of Israel.  
</p>
<p>88. According to testimony received, the destruction of water infrastructure, including 
</p>
<p>rainwater cisterns, by Israeli authorities has increased since the beginning of 2010, doubling 
</p>
<p>in 2012 the number of acts committed in 2011. The denial of water is used to trigger 
</p>
<p>displacement, particularly in areas slated for settlement expansion, especially since these 
</p>
<p>communities are mostly farmers and herders who depend on water for their livelihoods. A

<p>number of testimonies highlighted that the cutting off from water resources often precedes 
</p>
<p>dispossession of lands for new settlement projects. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Impact on economic rights 
</b></p>
<p>89. The agricultural sector, considered the cornerstone of Palestinian economic 
</p>
<p>development, has not been able to play its strategic role because of dispossession of land 
</p>
<p>and the denial of access for farmers to agricultural areas, water resources and domestic and 
</p>
<p>external markets. This has led to a continuous decline in the share of agricultural production 
</p>
<p>in GDP and employment since 1967. 
</p>
<p>90. The expansion of settlements and the development of relevant infrastructure have 
</p>
<p>eroded Palestinian agricultural assets. Dwindling water resources, high transaction and 
</p>
<p>transport costs and shrinking markets have led to a decline in the size of agricultural 
</p>
<p>holdings. It has also resulted in a shift from irrigated to less profitable rain-dependent crops 
</p>
<p>and a decrease in productivity, given that the import of fertilizers into the West Bank is 
</p>
<p>banned for Palestinians. Besides the demolitions carried out by the authorities, villagers 
</p>
<p>suffer recurrent attacks from nearby settlements (especially during the olive harvest 
</p>
<p>season), the destruction of trees, water installations and livestock, putting them under 
</p>
<p>additional pressure to relinquish agricultural activities.  
</p>
<p>91. The wall has divided villages, cut off farmers from their lands and water and 
</p>
<p>curtailed trade with traditional markets, stifling the local economy. One example of this 
</p>
<p>pattern is the village of Nazelt Issa, where half of pre-existing businesses were destroyed to 
</p>
<p>build the wall, while other activities closed down, given that most of their trade was with 
</p>
<p>neighbouring villages now cut off by the wall. With few income-generating prospects left 
</p>
<p>in the village, unemployment is high, and young people leave to seek work.  
</p>
<p>92. The mission was informed by testimony received that &#8213;Israeli settlement agriculture 
</p>
<p>is blooming&#8214;. In the Jordan Valley, settlements set up in the 1960s and 1970s as farming 
</p>
<p>communities on land formerly cultivated by Palestinians have developed into a high-
</p>
<p>technology irrigation agricultural zone and become major contributors to Israeli exports of 
</p>
<p>date palm fruits. In the central West Bank, many agricultural settlements have been 
</p>
<p>developed over the past decade, cultivating olives and grapes for winemaking in Israel. 
</p>
<p>Many Israeli cultivated areas correspond to lands that were cultivated by Palestinians until 
</p>
<p>the second intifada (2000-2005). 
</p>
<p>93. The inability of the Palestinian economy to expand and offer opportunities, high 
</p>
<p>unemployment rates and falling wages in the Palestinian labour market, inflation and 
</p>
<p>increasing poverty are factors that drive Palestinians to seek employment in the settlements 
</p>
<p>and in Israel, where wages are about twice as high as in the Palestinian private sector. A 
</p>
<p>stringent system of permits and quotas that determines employment in Israel and the 
</p>
<p>settlements lends itself to abuse by contractors and middlemen. Palestinians employed in 
</p>
<p>the settlements work primarily in the manufacturing industry and the construction sector. 
</p>
<p>Women are mostly engaged in domestic work and agriculture.
50
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>94. While wages might be higher, employment conditions in the settlements remain 
</p>
<p>precarious. Workers claiming their rights are easily dismissed, and supervision of 
</p>
<p>employers by the Israeli authorities in the settlements remains largely absent. In an audit 
</p>
<p>conducted in June 2011, the State Comptroller noted the &#8213;lack of substantial supervision 
</p>
<p>and enforcement in the field of safety and hygiene&#8214;, even in factories holding and using

<p>dangerous materials. It was noted that, between 2006 and 2010, only four audits were 
</p>
<p>conducted in the 20 industrial zones/settlements operating in the West Bank. 
</p>
<p>95. The employment conditions of Palestinian workers in settlements are subject to a 
</p>
<p>system characterized by legal uncertainties. Palestinians are contracted under the far less 
</p>
<p>favourable pre-1967 Jordanian labour laws, while Israeli citizens in the West Bank are 
</p>
<p>employed under Israeli labour laws. Although the High Court of Israel ruled in 2007 that 
</p>
<p>Israeli labour laws also applied to Palestinian workers, the ruling &#8211; which left open the 
</p>
<p>possibility for the parties to agree otherwise &#8211; is often not enforced. Numerous interlocutors 
</p>
<p>told the mission that this &#8213;cheap labour&#8214; from the numerous Palestinian villages within 
</p>
<p>convenient commuting distance represented an additional incentive for enterprises to move 
</p>
<p>to the settlements. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Impact of businesses 
</b></p>
<p>96. Information gathered by the mission showed that business enterprises have, directly 
</p>
<p>and indirectly, enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the 
</p>
<p>settlements. In addition to the previously mentioned violations of Palestinian worker rights, 
</p>
<p>the mission identified a number of business activities and related issues that raise particular 
</p>
<p>human rights violations concerns. They include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The supply of equipment and materials facilitating the construction and the 
</p>
<p>expansion of settlements and the wall, and associated infrastructures  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The supply of surveillance and identification equipment for settlements, the wall and 
</p>
<p>checkpoints directly linked with settlements  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The supply of equipment for the demolition of housing and property, the destruction 
</p>
<p>of agricultural farms, greenhouses, olives groves and crops  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The supply of security services, equipment and materials to enterprises operating in 
</p>
<p>settlements  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of 
</p>
<p>settlements, including transport  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Banking and financial operations helping to develop, expand or maintain settlements 
</p>
<p>and their activities, including loans for housing and the development of businesses  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The use of natural resources, in particular water and land, for business purposes  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pollution, and the dumping of waste in or its transfer to Palestinian villages  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Captivity of the Palestinian financial and economic markets, as well as practices that 
</p>
<p>disadvantage Palestinian enterprises, including through restrictions on movement, 
</p>
<p>administrative and legal constraints  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Use of benefits and reinvestments of enterprises owned totally or partially by settlers 
</p>
<p>for developing, expanding and maintaining the settlements 
</p>
<p>97. It is with the full knowledge of the current situation and the related liability risks that 
</p>
<p>business enterprises unfold their activities in the settlements and contribute to their 
</p>
<p>maintenance, development and consolidation. Industrial parks in settlements, such as 
</p>
<p>Barkan and Mishor Edomim<i>,</i> offer numerous incentives, including tax breaks, low rents and 
</p>
<p>low labour costs. Economic activities in these zones are growing. A number of banks 
</p>
<p>provide mortgage loans for home buyers and special loans for building projects in 
</p>
<p>settlements. They also provide financial services to businesses in settlements and, in some 
</p>
<p>cases, are physically present there.  </p>


<p>98. The mission noted that some enterprises had withdrawn from settlements because it 
</p>
<p>harmed their image and might entail legal consequences.  
</p>
<p>99. The mission also noted that Israel labels all its export products as originating from 
</p>
<p>&#8213;Israel&#8214;, including those wholly or partially produced in settlements. Some companies 
</p>
<p>operating in settlements have been accused of hiding the original place of production of 
</p>
<p>their products. This situation poses an issue of traceability of products for other States 
</p>
<p>wishing to align themselves with their international and regional obligations. It also poses 
</p>
<p>an issue with regard to consumers&#8216; right to information. The mission notes that these issues 
</p>
<p>are increasingly being addressed by States, regional organizations and some private 
</p>
<p>businesses. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The facts brought to the attention of the mission indicate that the State of Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>has had full control of the settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 
</b></p>
<p><b>1967 and continues to promote and sustain them through infrastructure and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures. The mission notes that, despite all pertinent United Nations resolutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>declaring that the existence of the settlements is illegal and calling for their cessation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the planning and growth of the settlements continues of existing as well as of new 
</b></p>
<p><b>structures</b>. 
</p>
<p>101. <b>The establishment of the settlements in the West Bank, including East 
</b></p>
<p><b>Jerusalem (see annex II), is a mesh of construction and infrastructure leading to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>creeping annexation that prevents the establishment of a contiguous and viable 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian State and undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-
</b></p>
<p><b>determination</b>. 
</p>
<p>102. <b>The settlements have been established and developed at the expense of violating 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights laws and international humanitarian law as applicable in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as recognized notably by the International Court 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Justice in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004.</b>  
</p>
<p>103. <b>The settlements are established for the exclusive benefit of Israeli Jews, and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>being maintained and developed through a system of total segregation between the 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlers and the rest of the population living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This system of segregation is supported and facilitated by a strict military and law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement control to the detriment of the rights of the Palestinian population. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The mission considers that, with regard to the settlements, Israel is committing 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious breaches of its obligations under the right to self-determination and certain 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations under international humanitarian law, including the obligation not to 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer its population into the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Rome Statute 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over the deportation 
</b></p>
<p><b>or transfer, directly or indirectly, by the occupying Power of parts of its own 
</b></p>
<p><b>population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the population of the occupied territory within or outside that territory. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ratification of the Statute by Palestine may lead to accountability for gross violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice for victims. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The existence of the settlements has had a heavy toll on the rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinians. Their rights to freedom of self-determination, non-discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of movement, equality, due process, fair trial, not to be arbitrarily detained, 
</b></p>
<p><b>liberty and security of person, freedom of expression, freedom of access to places of </b></p>


<p><b>worship, education, water, housing, adequate standard of living, property, access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>natural resources and effective remedy are being violated consistently and on a daily 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis. </b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>The volume of information received on dispossession, evictions, demolitions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement points to the magnitude of these practices. These are particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>widespread in certain areas and acute in East Jerusalem.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The mission noted that the identities of settlers who are responsible for violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>and intimidation are known to the Israeli authorities, yet these acts continue with 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity. It is led to the clear conclusion that institutionalized discrimination is 
</b></p>
<p><b>practiced against the Palestinian people when the issue of violence is addressed. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>mission believes that the motivation behind this violence and the intimidation against 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Palestinians and their properties is to drive the local populations away from their 
</b></p>
<p><b>lands and allow the settlements to expand.</b>  
</p>
<p>108. <b>The mission is gravely concerned at the large number of children who are 
</b></p>
<p><b>apprehended or detained, including for minor offences. They are invariably 
</b></p>
<p><b>mistreated, denied due process and a fair trial. In violation of international law, they 
</b></p>
<p><b>are transferred to detention centres in Israel</b>.  
</p>
<p>109. <b>Children endure harassment and violence, and encounter significant obstacles 
</b></p>
<p><b>in attending educational institutions, which limits their right to have access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. The occupying Power, Israel, is failing in its duty to protect the right of 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to education of the Palestinian children and failing to facilitate the proper 
</b></p>
<p><b>working of educational institutions.</b> 
</p>
<p>110. <b>Information gathered by the mission showed that some private entities have 
</b></p>
<p><b>enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the settlements, 
</b></p>
<p><b>either directly or indirectly.</b>  
</p>
<p>111. <b>Women alone in their homes, the Bedouins and other vulnerable groups are 
</b></p>
<p><b>easy targets for settler violence, creating a sense of insecurity in Palestinian society in 
</b></p>
<p><b>general. </b> 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The mission calls upon</b> <b>Israel to, in compliance with article 49 of the Fourth 
</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva Convention, cease all settlement activities without preconditions. In addition it 
</b></p>
<p><b>should immediately initiate a process of withdrawal of all settlers from the Occupied 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian Territory. The mission also urges Israel to ensure adequate, effective and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt remedy for all Palestinian victims for the harm suffered as a consequence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations that are a result of the settlements in accordance with that 
</b></p>
<p>State&#8217;s<b> international obligation to provide effective remedy. Where necessary, steps 
</b></p>
<p><b>must to be taken to provide such remedy in concurrence with the representatives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Palestinian people and the assistance of the international community.</b> 
</p>
<p>113. <b>The mission calls upon</b> <b>Israel to put an end to the human rights violations that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are linked to the presence of settlements. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The mission calls upon Israel to ensure full accountability for all violations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including for all acts of settler violence, in a non-discriminatory manner, and to put an 
</b></p>
<p><b>end to the policy of impunity.</b> 
</p>
<p>115. <b>The mission urges Israel to put an end to arbitrary arrest and detention of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian people, especially children, and to observe the prohibition of the transfer </b></p>


<p><b>of prisoners from the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the territory of Israel, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention</b>. 
</p>
<p>116. <b>The mission calls upon all Member States to comply with their obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international law and to assume their responsibilities in their relations with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>State breaching peremptory norms of international law, and specifically not to 
</b></p>
<p><b>recogniz</b>e an unlawful situation resulting from Israel&#8217;s violations. 
</p>
<p>117. <b>Private companies must assess the human rights impact of their activities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>take all necessary steps </b>&#8211;<b> including by terminating their business interests in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlements </b>&#8211;<b> to ensure that they do not have an adverse impact on the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Palestinian people, in conformity with international law as well as the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles on Business and Human Rights.51 The mission calls upon all Member States 
</b></p>
<p><b>to take appropriate measures to ensure that business enterprises domiciled in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory and/or under their jurisdiction, including those owned or controlled by 
</b></p>
<p><b>them, that conduct activities in or related to the settlements respect human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout their operations. The mission recommends that the Working Group on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Business and Human Rights be seized of this matter.

<p>&#8226; The &#8213;Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel&#8214; is issued. It equates 
</p>
<p><i>Eretz-Israel</i> (in Hebrew &#8213;the Land of Israel&#8214;) to the territory of British Mandate

<p>Palestine
1
, in contrast to the provisions of 1947 United Nations General Assembly

. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The &#8213;Israeli Proclamation&#8214; is issued. It creates a legislative authority: the 
</p>
<p>Provisional Council of State, which unilaterally revokes the British Parliament 
</p>
<p>Decision 6019 (the White Paper of 1939)
3
. The White Paper of 1939 indicates that 
</p>
<p>&#8213;the terms of the (Balfour) Declaration [sic] (&#8230;) do not contemplate that Palestine 
</p>
<p>as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home 
</p>
<p>should be founded IN PALESTINE.[sic] (&#8230;) His Majesty's Government (&#8230;) now

<p>declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become 
</p>
<p>a Jewish State (&#8230;) Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate 
</p>
<p>which, if economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up 
</p>
<p>to (&#8230;) one third of the total population (&#8230;) some 75,000 immigrants (&#8230;) After the 
</p>
<p>period of five years, no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the 
</p>
<p>Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it. (&#8230;) there is now in certain areas 
</p>
<p>no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers 
</p>
<p>of land must be restricted.&#8221;4 </p>
<p>&#8226; The Law and Administration Ordinance 5708-1948 is enacted. Article 15 indicates

<p>&#8226; The &#8213;Absentee Property Law&#8214; 1950 enables the Israeli Government to transfer the 
</p>
<p>property left behind by Palestinians after the 1948 War for the exclusive use by 
</p>
<p>Israel. The Law defines any Palestinian who &#8215;left his ordinary place of residence&#8216; for 
</p>
<p>a place outside the nascent state as an &#8215;absentee&#8216;. The definition is broadly 
</p>
<p>interpreted and includes Palestinians who are deemed to have been absent, even 
</p>
<p>though they are present within the territory of Israel. Such persons are termed 
</p>
<p>&#8213;present absentees&#8214;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  1965 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Planning and Building Law No. 5725 is enacted by the Knesset.7 It establishes a 
</p>
<p>hierarchy of planning bodies (national, regional and local) responsible for land-use 
</p>
<p>planning. The law requires development plans to be prepared, approved, and kept up 
</p>
<p>to date. A permit may be refused if the development conflicts with a plan; penalties

<p>for unpermitted development may include, in extreme cases, demolition

 (Article 
</p>
<p>212 allows the State to demolish homes considered &#8213;a public nuisance&#8214;9). The Law

<p>Palestinian urban growth and limits Palestinian construction by refusing building

<p>permits and reducing the land earmarked for industrial and economic projects,

<p>&#8226; The WZO, co-member of the Ministerial Committee on Settlements, publishes the 
</p>
<p><i>Drobles Plan</i> to build settlements on the central mountain ridge around Palestinian 
</p>
<p>population centres. The plan shifts away from the <i>Allon Plan</i> in that the later had 
</p>
<p>focused on agricultural settlements in unpopulated Arab areas, whereas the former 
</p>
<p>focuses on urban settlements which are relatively easy to set up, market and 
</p>
<p>populate in the midst of populated Arab areas. (October) 
</p>
<p><b>  1979

<p>&#8226; By 1979 there are 43 settlements and 10,000 settlers in the West Bank, excluding

</p>
<p>Jerusalem&#8214; and determining that &#8213;the policy and practices of Israel in establishing 
</p>
<p>settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no 
</p>
<p>legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just 
</p>
<p>and lasting peace in the Middle East.&#8214; 32 The resolution also provides for the

<p>land given to the establishment of settlements.
35
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8226; The High Court decision on the <i>Elon Moreh</i> case rules against the temporary seizure 
</p>
<p>of land for military purposes. The testimony of retired military personnel that the 
</p>
<p>land seized for the <i>Elon Moreh</i> settlement served no military purposes in addition to 
</p>
<p>the testimony of the settlers themselves that they, along with the Israeli Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister, saw the <i>Elon Moreh</i> settlement as a permanent settlement served to 
</p>
<p>convince the High Court that the land was not legitimately seized for military
