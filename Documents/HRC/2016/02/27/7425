<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report presents the main findings of the Independent Expert on his visit 
</p>
<p>to Iceland from 8 to 15 December 2014. The Independent Expert assesses the extent to 
</p>
<p>which Iceland has fulfilled its obligations to protect economic, social and cultural rights in 
</p>
<p>the aftermath of its recent banking crisis.  
</p>
<p>While Iceland managed the crisis better than many other countries and responded 
</p>
<p>overwhelmingly in compliance with its international obligations, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>identifies certain gaps that should be addressed. He recommends that the legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional framework of Iceland be further strengthened in order to prevent the 
</p>
<p>recurrence of a similar crisis and that attention be paid to certain vulnerable groups, in 
</p>
<p>particular highly indebted individuals; people living in rented accommodation; immigrants; 
</p>
<p>and children living in single-parent households.

<p>The Independent Expert identifies several good practices in the Icelandic crisis that

<p>and other countries can learn from the particular path that Iceland chose, which included 
</p>
<p>protecting its core social welfare system, making efforts to ensure citizen participation in 
</p>
<p>the decision-making process and endeavouring to establish political, administrative and

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert conducted an official visit to Iceland from 8 to 15 
</p>
<p>December 2014. The purpose of the visit was twofold: to assess the extent to which Iceland 
</p>
<p>has fulfilled its obligations to protect economic, social and cultural rights in the aftermath 
</p>
<p>of its financial banking crisis; and to identify good practices that other Governments could 
</p>
<p>adopt to prevent negative human rights impacts in the context of financial crises and 
</p>
<p>economic adjustment programmes &#8212; one of the thematic priorities of the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert (see A/69/273).  
</p>
<p>2. During his visit to Iceland, the Independent Expert benefited from discussions with 
</p>
<p>officials from the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, Welfare, the Interior, 
</p>
<p>Education and Foreign Affairs. He met with representatives of the Directorates of Labour 
</p>
<p>and Health, the Central Bank of Iceland, the Financial Supervisory Authority and the Office 
</p>
<p>of the Special Prosecutor, as well as with the President of the Supreme Court and Members 
</p>
<p>of Parliament. He also met with members of the Parliamentary Review Committee, which 
</p>
<p>had been entrusted with following up the report of the Special Investigation Commission 
</p>
<p>set up by the Parliament to study the causes of the banking crisis, the Parliamentary 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman, the Debtors&#8217; Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, and representatives 
</p>
<p>of the Icelandic Association of Local Authorities, the Housing Financing Fund and Welfare 
</p>
<p>Watch. He also met with the President of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, the 
</p>
<p>Director of the Confederation of Icelandic Employers, current and former representatives of 
</p>
<p>the banking industry and their lawyers, and members of the International Monetary Fund 
</p>
<p>delegation that was also visiting Iceland that week. The Independent Expert visited the 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood of Brei&#240;holt, which enabled him to better understand certain challenges that 
</p>
<p>Icelandic society face and see at first hand the important work that citizens and local 
</p>
<p>authorities carried out at the community level. The Independent Expert also met with a 
</p>
<p>wide range of civil society organizations and academics. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert would like to thank the Government of Iceland for its 
</p>
<p>invitation, its full cooperation and the open and constructive dialogue. He expresses his 
</p>
<p>gratitude to all those who took the time to meet with him and share their thoughts and 
</p>
<p>information. He is grateful to the Icelandic Human Rights Centre, the Institute for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights at the University of Iceland, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Association of Iceland for the support provided during the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Framework for analysis: financial crises and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>4. Policy responses to financial crises raise important concerns regarding the protection 
</p>
<p>of economic, social and cultural rights because such responses are often incompatible with 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; obligation to ensure the progressive realization of those rights and to avoid 
</p>
<p>deliberate retrogressive measures, in particular those that are incompatible with the core 
</p>
<p>obligations relating to each right, and States&#8217; duty to use all available resources to satisfy, 
</p>
<p>as a matter of priority, those minimum obligations.1 The Committee on Economic Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights asserts that in times of economic crisis, &#8220;endeavours to protect the most 
</p>
<p>basic economic, social and cultural rights become more, rather than less, urgent&#8221;2 and it has 
</p>
<p>already emphasized that even in times of severe resource constraints, States must protect 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See E/2013/82, paras. 8&#8211;21; also A/HRC/17/34, paras. 11&#8211;24.   
</p>
<p> 2  See the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 2 (1990) on international technical assistance measures, 
</p>
<p>para. 9. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/59/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>the most disadvantaged and marginalized members or groups of society, which would 
</p>
<p>require some prioritization of the most vulnerable.3 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert believes that, even during a harsh crisis, the Government, 
</p>
<p>employers, trade unions and civil society can make a difference. When cutting public 
</p>
<p>expenditure, States have to make policy choices: they can try to minimize the negative 
</p>
<p>impact of a financial crisis on the enjoyment of social rights, in consonance with their 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations, or they can do more harm than necessary to their 
</p>
<p>people by distributing financial losses in an unjust, unequal or discriminatory manner, 
</p>
<p>thereby hitting the most vulnerable in society. Social partners can also contribute, through 
</p>
<p>responsible behaviour, to helping a State overcome a financial crisis, and the participation 
</p>
<p>of civil society may be key to ensuring that the voices and rights of citizens and 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups are not ignored.  
</p>
<p><b> A. </b>Iceland&#8217;s <b>international human rights obligations  
</b></p>
<p>6. Iceland has signed eight core international human rights treaties, but has yet to ratify 
</p>
<p>two of them.4 While Iceland has  accepted that individuals may submit complaints under 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture 
</p>
<p>and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, it has not yet 
</p>
<p>accepted that children and adults may bring complaints under the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child or the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.5 At the 
</p>
<p>regional level, Iceland has ratified the European Social Charter, but has not yet signed or 
</p>
<p>ratified the Additional Protocol to the Charter providing for a system of collective 
</p>
<p>complaints.6 
</p>
<p>7. Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to 
</p>
<p>which it has been a party since 1979, Iceland is obliged to respect and protect, and achieve  
</p>
<p>progressively the full realization of, social and economic rights, including the right to work, 
</p>
<p>social security, health and education, using the maximum available resources. While the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has acknowledged that a financial 
</p>
<p>crisis may require economic adjustments, it reminded the Government in November 2012 
</p>
<p>that such adjustments should: (a) be of a temporary nature; (b) be necessary and 
</p>
<p>proportionate; (c) not be discriminatory and comprise all possible measures, including tax 
</p>
<p>measures, to support social transfers to mitigate inequalities and to ensure that the rights of 
</p>

</p>
<p> 4 The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Iceland has ratified the fundamental conventions of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization. 
</p>

</p>
<p>the disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups are not disproportionally 
</p>
<p>affected; and (d) identify a social protection floor and the minimum core content of rights, 
</p>
<p>and ensure the protection of those rights at all times.7  
</p>
<p>8. The Committee further recommended that Iceland intensify its efforts to address the 
</p>
<p>high unemployment rate; expand the coverage of unemployment insurance to all 
</p>
<p>unemployed persons; and take measures to ensure that the social benefits system provided  
</p>
<p>a minimum essential level of benefits to ensure a decent living for all beneficiaries, 
</p>
<p>including single-parent families. The Committee also recommended that the levels of social 
</p>
<p>benefits be monitored regularly and adjusted according to the cost of living, and that efforts 
</p>
<p>to combat poverty and social exclusion, in particular of families with children, single-parent 
</p>
<p>families and persons with disabilities be strengthened. In addition, the Committee 
</p>
<p>recommended that Iceland take steps to address the negative impact of the financial crisis 
</p>
<p>on the health sector, including through increasing its public health-care budget, and ensure 
</p>
<p>that required health-care services were fully accessible for all, including immigrants and 
</p>
<p>children with disabilities. The Committee also recommended that Iceland increase the 
</p>
<p>budget for the public education system at all education levels, in particular primary and 
</p>
<p>lower secondary education, remedy staff reductions, merging of class groups and 
</p>
<p>cancellation of courses, and address the high dropout rate of students with an immigrant 
</p>
<p>background in upper secondary education.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>Iceland&#8217;s human rights <b>protection framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Icelandic human rights system has several components. Legally, the framework 
</p>
<p>is anchored by the Constitution, sections VI and VII of which recognize several key human 
</p>
<p>rights. Constitutional provisions relating to economic and social rights are more limited: 
</p>
<p>they include freedom of association and the right to form trade unions (art. 74), and 
</p>
<p>freedom to pursue the occupation of one&#8217;s choosing and the right to negotiate terms of 
</p>
<p>employment and other labour-related matters (art. 75), which may be restricted by law. 
</p>
<p>Article 76 states that &#8220;the law shall guarantee for everyone the necessary assistance in case 
</p>
<p>of sickness, invalidity, infirmity by reason of old age, unemployment and similar 
</p>
<p>circumstances. The law shall guarantee for everyone suitable general education and tuition. 
</p>
<p>For children, the law shall guarantee the protection and care which is necessary for their 
</p>
<p>well-being.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>10. Human rights are guaranteed through a three-pronged grievance redress system 
</p>
<p>consisting of the Parliamentary Ombudsman (Althing Ombudsman), the courts and the 
</p>
<p>European Court of Human Rights. Each of those bodies plays a separate, but crucial role. 
</p>
<p>The courts monitor the conformity of laws with the Constitution, while the Althing 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman secures the rights of citizens with respect to the functioning of the 
</p>
<p>administrative bodies, and the European Court oversees general compliance with the 
</p>
<p>European Convention on Human Rights. District courts and the Supreme Court are 
</p>
<p>empowered to resolve the constitutionality of cases; they are also vested with review 
</p>
<p>capacity over decisions made by the executive branch, which includes the power to render 
</p>
<p>invalid laws that conflict with constitutional provisions or infringe human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. The European Convention was incorporated into Icelandic domestic law through Act 
</p>
<p>No. 62/1994 and can therefore be applied directly by the courts. Prior to that, Icelandic 
</p>
<p>courts expressed general hesitation to apply the provisions of the Convention, on the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7  E/C.12/ISL/CO/4, para. 6. 
</p>
<p> 8  Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/59/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>grounds that the Convention was not part of domestic law.9 To date, only relatively few 
</p>
<p>cases relating to economic and social rights have been decided by the European Court.10  
</p>
<p>12. The Office of the Althing Ombudsman is empowered to deal with complaints 
</p>
<p>relating to the administration of the State and local authorities, but may also investigate a 
</p>
<p>particular administration-related matter or practice on its own initiative (see Act 
</p>
<p>No. 85/1997). In the context of the banking crisis, complaints to the Althing Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>increased significantly from about 300 complaints per annum (before 2008) to around 500 
</p>
<p>per annum (2011&#8211;2013), which limited its ability to take up investigations on its own 
</p>
<p>initiative.11 The increase in complaints may partly be attributed to a general disillusionment 
</p>
<p>within Icelandic society with public institutions, in the aftermath of the banking collapse, so 
</p>
<p>that more citizens may have been motivated to use existing mechanisms for redress. The 
</p>
<p>complaints included cases relating to access to social security, welfare and unemployment 
</p>
<p>benefits, housing, financial matters and banking, as well as delays in administrative action. 
</p>
<p>Despite capacity constraints, the Ombudsman launched one ex-officio investigation relating 
</p>
<p>to social housing in the city of Reykjavik.  
</p>
<p>13. In relation to the banking crisis, the Supreme Court took decisions on some 
</p>
<p>important matters. In June 2010, it ruled that foreign currency-indexed loans that had been 
</p>
<p>offered by Icelandic banks to many clients in order to purchase vehicles and houses were 
</p>
<p>illegal and violated the laws designed to protect borrowers from exchange rate risks. On 28 
</p>
<p>October 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the Emergency Act of 6 October 2008 which 
</p>
<p>authorized the Government to take over the management of collapsing financial 
</p>
<p>institutions.  
</p>
<p>14. The Debtors&#8217; Ombudsman was established in 2010 in response to the dramatic 
</p>
<p>increase of household debt during the financial crisis. It plays an important role in 
</p>
<p>protecting the economic and social rights of over-indebted individuals and households in 
</p>
<p>Iceland. 
</p>
<p>15. Disputes between citizens and State institutions relating to economic and social 
</p>
<p>rights frequently come before the Unemployment Insurance and Labour Market Measures 
</p>
<p>Complaints Committee, the Social Security Ruling Committee, the Social Services and 
</p>
<p>Housing Complaints Committee, the Complaints Committee on Debt Mitigation and the 
</p>
<p>Complaints Committee on Gender Equality. Individuals can usually file complaints with 
</p>
<p>those bodies free of charge within three months after a decision affecting them is taken. The 
</p>
<p>respective complaints committees are usually made up of three members appointed by the 
</p>
<p>Minister of Welfare, and their respective Chair must fulfil the eligibility requirements for 
</p>
<p>appointment as a judge to a district court (see, for example, Unemployment Insurance Act 
</p>
<p>No. 54/2006, art. 11).  
</p>
<p>16. The effect of the banking crisis is also reflected in the number of complaints decided 
</p>
<p>by those bodies. For example, in 2009, the Unemployment Insurance and Labour Market 
</p>
<p>Measures Complaints Committee decided only 17 cases, while in 2014, it rendered 
</p>
<p>decisions in 101 cases, including overturning six decisions of the Directorate of Labour. In 
</p>
<p>2009, the complaints committee for social housing dealt with seven cases, while in 2014, it 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See for example, the judgment by the Reykjavik District Court in case No. 968/1959, <i>Olafson</i> v. <i>The 
</i></p>
<p><i>Minister of Finance, </i>28 June 1960; and Supreme Court judgment 1975.601. 
</p>
<p> 10 See, for example, European Court of Human Rights, <i>Kjartan &#193;smundsson </i>v.<i> Iceland</i> (Application No. 
</p>
<p>60669/00), judgement of 12 October 2004. 
</p>
<p> 11 Iceland, <i>Sk&#253;rsla umbo&#240;smanns Al&#254;ingis fyrir &#225;ri&#240;</i> 2013 (Annual report of the Althing Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>2013) available from http://umbodsmaduralthingis.is/Assets/Skyrsla2014.pdf. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/59/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>rendered  100 decisions, including overturning 39 administrative decisions in favour of the 
</p>
<p>claimants.12 
</p>
<p>17. In addition, the Complaints Committee on Transactions with Financial Firms and the 
</p>
<p>Insurance Complaints Committee under the Financial Supervisory Authority deal with 
</p>
<p>disputes between consumers and banks, credit institutions and insurance companies. Private 
</p>
<p>individuals pay a fee of ISK 5,000 or ISK 6,000, respectively, when submitting a complaint 
</p>
<p>to those committees. The fee is reimbursed if the complaint is wholly or partly accepted.13  
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Iceland&#8217;s international human<b> rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>18. In 2012, during its universal periodic review by the Human Rights Council, Iceland 
</p>
<p>undertook several commitments to strengthen its human rights protection system, including 
</p>
<p>considering the ratification of the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to the Convention against Torture and Other 
</p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment and actively examining the 
</p>
<p>possibility of establishing a national human rights institution compliant with the Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles (see A/HRC/19/13/Add.1, paras. 4, 5, and 16).  
</p>
<p>19. In early 2013, the Ministry of the Interior drafted a National Action Plan on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, which included the establishment of a human rights institution. However, to date, 
</p>
<p>the plan has not yet been submitted to the Parliament. Iceland thus remains one of the few 
</p>
<p>European countries that does not have an independent human rights institution, although 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights mechanisms have recommended the establishment 
</p>
<p>of such a body for a number of years.14 The Commissioner for Human Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe recently highlighted the important role that national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and other human rights protection bodies could play in the context of economic 
</p>
<p>crises.15 The time has come to fill that gap. Based on their current legal mandates, neither 
</p>
<p>the Althing Ombudsman nor the Ombudsman for Children can fulfil the role of a national 
</p>
<p>human rights institution. While the Icelandic Human Rights Centre carries out many 
</p>
<p>activities similar to those of human rights institutions in other countries, it lacks the 
</p>
<p>required legal status and adequate and stable funding to fully carry out such a task.  
</p>

a more human face 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The banking collapse 
</b></p>
<p>20. The majority of Iceland&#8217;s banks were privatized between 1991 and 2004, and a 
</p>
<p>floating exchange rate was introduced. Icelandic banks expanded rapidly during the 2000s 
</p>
<p>owing to a combination of uncontrolled risk taking, a strong Icelandic currency exchange 
</p>
<p>rate and very favourable conditions on international financial markets, which enabled them

<p>to provide an ample credit supply at low interest rates. The country became one of the 
</p>
<p>richest countries in the world, with the fourth-highest gross domestic product (GDP) per 
</p>
<p>capita worldwide. From 2003, the public Housing Financing Fund was allowed to provide 
</p>
<p>loans to cover up to 90 per cent of the market value of a house, below a certain ceiling. 
</p>
<p>Commercial banks entered the mortgage loan market, frequently offering better terms than 
</p>
<p>the Government and aggressively expanding their consumer lending, which made Icelandic 
</p>
<p>households among the most heavily indebted in the world.16
 
 
</p>
<p>21. By 2008, Iceland was one of the most overbanked economies in the world, with its 
</p>
<p>banks holding assets to a value 10 times that of the country&#8217;s GDP.17 Early warnings of the 
</p>
<p>crisis by foreign analysts in 2006 where largely ignored.18 Icelandic triple-A rated banks 
</p>
<p>were already facing liquidity problems, but continued to grow, offering costumers abroad, 
</p>
<p>mainly in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>attractive interest rates on presumably secure deposits. The bubble continued to grow until 
</p>
<p>the fall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. when tightening conditions led the gross foreign 
</p>
<p>debt burden of the Icelandic banks to rise from 43 per cent of GDP in 2002 to over 700 per 
</p>
<p>cent of GDP in October 2008, which resulted in the collapse of all three major Icelandic 
</p>
<p>banks &#8212; Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki.  
</p>
<p>22. On 6 October 2008, the Icelandic Parliament passed Emergency Act No. 125/2008, 
</p>
<p>authorizing the Financial Supervisory Authority to take control of the three large banks. 
</p>
<p>Crisis management emphasized the need for uninterrupted domestic banking operations and 
</p>
<p>three new banks &#8212; Islandsbank, Arion Bank and Landsbankinn &#8212; were established to take 
</p>
<p>over the domestic activities of the three collapsed banks. The State became a majority 
</p>
<p>owner of Landsbankinn and a minority owner of the other two banks. The Government 
</p>
<p>injected share capital into the three new banks and several smaller financial institutions and 
</p>
<p>took over losses at a combined cost of roughly one third of GDP for 2008. While foreign 
</p>
<p>investors bore the bulk of the cost of the Icelandic banking collapse, the amount invested by 
</p>
<p>the State to recapitalize the Icelandic Central Bank and to cover the losses from the 
</p>
<p>takeover of Icelandic financial institutions has been estimated at ISK 348 billion to 393 
</p>
<p>billion, an amount almost equivalent to the annual worth of taxes paid by Icelanders.19  
</p>
<p>23. In November 2008, following a steep depreciation of the Icelandic krona, the 
</p>
<p>Government introduced capital controls to stabilize the currency and prevent excessive 
</p>
<p>capital outflows. Shortly thereafter, Iceland applied to the International Monetary Fund 
</p>
<p>(IMF) for emergency financial aid and was granted a US$ 2.1 billion loan under a two-year 
</p>
<p>standby programme. The adjustment programme implemented jointly with IMF was rather 
</p>
<p>unorthodox in the light of previous IMF adjustment programmes; it included stabilizing the 
</p>
<p>currency through the introduction of capital controls; rebuilding the banking sector; and 
</p>
<p>addressing the public deficit through a combination of tax increases and expenditure cuts, 
</p>
<p>while keeping the country&#8217;s social protection system largely untouched.

</p>
<p>24. The rebuilding of the banking sector and the protection of core social expenditure 
</p>
<p>from cuts required borrowing by the Government. While in 2007, the central government 
</p>
<p>debt was 43 per cent of GDP, it reached 109 per cent of GDP in 2013. The main reasons for 
</p>
<p>the increase of public debt were the shifting of private debt &#8212; mainly by banks &#8212; into 
</p>
<p>public debt and the depreciation of the krona, as 33 per cent of the central government debt 
</p>
<p>was denominated in foreign currency.20 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sheltering the welfare state 
</b></p>
<p>25. The emergency legislation approved by Parliament in October 2008 and subsequent 
</p>
<p>adjustment policies were based on the principle that socialization of the losses of the 
</p>
<p>banking collapse should be avoided as much as possible. Savings in deposit accounts were 
</p>
<p>secured for Icelandic customers and given preference over other claims, including those by 
</p>
<p>international institutional investors. The debt of many local businesses was written off to a 
</p>
<p>large degree to ensure that economically viable businesses and related workplaces would 
</p>
<p>survive. The devaluation of the Icelandic krona helped export-driven demand, in particular 
</p>
<p>in the fishing industry, and contributed to a tourism boom. However, workers, in particular 
</p>
<p>those in the construction industry, suffered a heavy blow.  
</p>
<p>26. The Government must be commended for sheltering core social expenditure against 
</p>
<p>cuts. While overall government revenues fell as a consequence of the economic crisis, the 
</p>
<p>State made a strategic decision to maintain the percentage of the budget for health care and 
</p>
<p>education, and even increased social protection expenditure from about 8.5 per cent of GDP 
</p>
<p>in 2008 to above 10 per cent of GDP during the first four years after the banking collapse 
</p>
<p>(see figure 1).

<p>27. Public health expenditure decreased from 7.22 per cent of GDP in 2008 to 6.99 per 
</p>
<p>cent of GDP in 2012, with only a limited shift of health-care costs from public coverage to 
</p>
<p>the pockets of individuals. Private health-care expenditure grew by 13 per cent between 
</p>
<p>2008 and 2012, but remained moderate and, so far, has not exceeded 19.7 per cent (2010) 
</p>
<p>of total health expenditure.  
</p>
<p>28. Measured as a percentage of GDP, overall public education expenditure was only 
</p>
<p>moderately reduced, while private expenditure for education increased by about 12 per cent 
</p>
<p>after the banking collapse.  
</p>
<p>29. As the economy contracted by about 8 per cent between 2008 and 2010, it should be 
</p>
<p>noted that, in real terms, painful cuts were made to public health services and education. 
</p>
<p>Compared to 2007 expenditure, funds spent in 2013 on public health care and education 
</p>
<p>were 7.2 per cent and 8.3 per cent lower, respectively (see table 1). Most of the cuts in the 
</p>
<p>health sector, however, were made strategically, focusing on decreasing hospital costs, 
</p>
<p>postponing investments in hospital infrastructure and the acquisition of new equipment, and 
</p>
<p>reducing pharmaceutical costs. Outpatient services were largely spared cuts. In the 
</p>
<p>education field, primary schools were hardest hit by cuts, while pre-primary and tertiary 
</p>
<p>education institutions suffered less.  
</p>
<p>30. The sharp increase in government spending in 2008, compared to 2007, reflects the 
</p>
<p>cost of recapitalizing the Central Bank of Iceland and the new, downsized domestic 
</p>
<p>branches of Icelandic banks (see table 1, Economic affairs). By 2013, overall government 
</p>
<p>spending had  returned roughly to pre-crisis levels. However, the State had to borrow to 
</p>
<p>cover the costs of the banking collapse, which resulted in the significant increase in public 
</p>
<p>debt service, the main reason for the growth in overall spending on general public services, 
</p>
<p>as debt service is currently responsible for about 60 per cent of the expenditure under this 
</p>
<p>category. In 2013, debt service accounted for 11.1 per cent of all State expenditure, which 
</p>
<p>meant that, compared to the pre-crisis years, fewer funds were available to cover other 
</p>
<p>public costs.  
</p>
<p>31. Spending on public order, safety and justice was reduced only slightly (by 2.4 per 
</p>
<p>cent), while cuts were strongest in the area of road, water and air transportation 
</p>
<p>infrastructure (by 48.6 per cent). It should be noted that the executive and legislative 
</p>
<p>branches also made efforts to save costs.  
</p>
<p>32. Social protection spending peaked during the period from 2009 to 2012 when 
</p>
<p>Iceland witnessed historically unprecedented rates of unemployment. Funds for rental 
</p>
<p>subsidies and to combat social exclusion were also augmented. Government spending on 
</p>
<p>disability pensions grew, owing to the increase in beneficiaries. Public expenditure on old 
</p>
<p>age pensions also registered an upward trend after 2011. Only spending on family and child 
</p>
<p>benefits was reduced as stricter income-based eligibility criteria for accessing benefits were 
</p>
<p>imposed. 
</p>
<p>33. It was not only the smart and more targeted use of funds that ensured that core social 
</p>
<p>and economic rights remained protected, but also the willingness of society &#8212; in particular 
</p>
<p>the overwhelmingly female workforce in the health and education sectors &#8212; to work 
</p>
<p>overtime, accept a salary freeze and use resources more efficiently. As the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on the issue of discrimination against women in law and practice has stressed, such gender 
</p>
<p>imbalances caused by the financial crisis in Iceland need to be corrected (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>34. Welfare Watch, one of the new innovative bodies formed in early 2009, is an 
</p>
<p>independent consultative body, comprising more than 35 representatives of key ministries, 
</p>
<p>municipalities, social partners and civil society, many of whom are also working at the 
</p>
<p>grass-roots level. Welfare Watch was established to monitor the social impact of the crisis, 
</p>
<p>provide advice to State institutions and coordinate targeted interventions on the ground; it </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/59/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>managed to spread the message that, during the crisis, the weakest in society should be 
</p>
<p>protected. The watchdog submitted several reports with recommendations to the 
</p>
<p>Government, as well as one to the Parliament. In 2015, it is expected to put forward 
</p>
<p>additional recommendations on how to address and guarantee the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>suffering multiple forms of deprivation. The Independent Expert hopes that its expert 
</p>
<p>advice will be duly considered by the Icelandic authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Taxation and the distribution of losses  
</b></p>
<p>35. Iceland&#8217;s adjustment programme strongly emphasized increasing revenue generation 
</p>
<p>through taxation, while focusing to a lesser extent on public expenditure cuts. The 
</p>
<p>reintroduction of a progressive income tax system helped to shelter the most vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups from the effects of the crisis. In addition, the flat tax on capital income was 
</p>
<p>increased and a wealth tax was temporarily introduced to generate revenue. The only 
</p>
<p>regressive tax measure was a one per cent increase in the value added tax from 24.5 to 
</p>
<p>25.5 per cent. On the whole, social benefits were directed to lower-income households, 
</p>
<p>mainly by cutting maternal and parental leave entitlements. Disposable income fell across 
</p>
<p>the entire society. The poorest 20 per cent of the population in Iceland lost around 9 per 
</p>
<p>cent of their disposable income between 2008 and 2010. In contrast, 10 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>wealthiest households that had accumulated assets during the boom years of the bubble 
</p>
<p>economy lost 38 per cent of their income. Social transfers and taxation policies reduced 
</p>
<p>inequality in Iceland significantly. They also helped to stabilize internal demand, as the 
</p>
<p>citizens with lower incomes spent a much higher percentage of their funds on goods and 
</p>
<p>services.21 
</p>
<p><b> D. Special Investigative Commission of the Parliament 
</b></p>
<p>36. In December 2008, the Icelandic Parliament set up a Special Investigation 
</p>
<p>Commission to investigate and analyse the processes leading to the collapse of the three 
</p>
<p>main commercial banks. The Commission is co-chaired by a Supreme Court judge, the 
</p>
<p>Parliamentary Ombudsman and an academic expert. The Commission submitted a detailed 
</p>
<p>report to Parliament in April 2012 in which it outlined the responsibilities of entities and 
</p>
<p>individuals, including bankers, politicians and governmental officials in charge of 
</p>
<p>supervising the financial and monetary systems. From December 2009 to September 2010, 
</p>
<p>a Parliamentary Review Committee scrutinized the report. 
</p>
<p>37. On 28 September 2010, the Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution providing 
</p>
<p>for the review of existing legislation, including the Constitution of the Republic of Iceland,  
</p>
<p>Act No. 4/1963 on Ministerial Responsibility and legislation relating to financial markets 
</p>
<p>and their operations. The Independent Expert notes that, while some of the above-
</p>
<p>mentioned legislation has already been reviewed and revised, to date, many of the laws 
</p>
<p>have not yet been amended in order to prevent the recurrence of a similar crisis. 
</p>
<p>38. On 28 September 2010, Parliament also adopted a resolution to initiate legal 
</p>
<p>proceedings against the former Prime Minister, Geir Haarde, before the High Court of 
</p>
<p>Impeachment. Resolutions against three other ministers failed to receive a sufficient

<p>majority in Parliament and therefore they could not be examined by the High Court of 
</p>
<p>Impeachment. The former Prime Minister was cleared by the High Court of most of the 
</p>
<p>charges, but sentenced for failing to call emergency meetings, as provided for under the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. He has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights where his case is 
</p>
<p>still under consideration. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Reform of banking supervision 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Investigative Commission also noted the failure of the supervisory 
</p>
<p>authorities to foresee the crisis. In its report, it concluded that the Financial Supervisory 
</p>
<p>Authority (FME), the institution that bore the main responsibility for monitoring the 
</p>
<p>activities of the banks, had not grown in proportion to the banks and its practices had not 
</p>
<p>kept up with the rapid change in banking practices. Failings of FME included insufficient 
</p>
<p>expertise to carry out its statutory supervisory tasks, as well as a lack of assertiveness when 
</p>
<p>it discovered that regulated entities did not comply with applicable laws or regulations. In 
</p>
<p>response to violations of the law, only written comments were provided to the relevant 
</p>
<p>financial corporations; the issues were not examined through the proper legal channels, nor 
</p>
<p>did the authorities try, in a decisive way, to prevent the collapse and to reduce the size of 
</p>
<p>the balance sheets of Icelandic banks, after 2006. The Special Investigative Commission 
</p>
<p>also detailed the failure of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland and the 
</p>
<p>Ministers responsible to inform each other appropriately or to act adequately on 
</p>
<p>information indicating that urgent action was required. It concluded that, in addition to the 
</p>
<p>former Prime Minister, the Ministers of Finance and Business Affairs, the Director General 
</p>
<p>of FME and three Governors of the Central Bank had shown negligence.22 In addition, FME 
</p>
<p>staff were frequently recruited from their supervisory functions directly into more lucrative 
</p>
<p>jobs in financial institutions whose operations they were previously required to supervise, 
</p>
<p>thereby undermining the ability of FME to perform its functions.  
</p>
<p>40. In the aftermath of the crash, the Government implemented a range of reforms 
</p>
<p>aimed at enhancing the supervisory capacities of FME.23 FME also assisted in the 
</p>
<p>investigation of 205 cases relating to alleged violations prior to the 2008 banking collapse, 
</p>
<p>referring 103 cases of bankers to the Office of the Special Prosecutor, for further action.24 
</p>
<p>41. Iceland should implement the recently passed European banking legislation in order 
</p>
<p>to further strengthen the system of banking supervision. The Financial Stability Council, 
</p>
<p>composed of representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and FME, seeks 
</p>
<p>to adequately monitor the macro-financial situation of the country in order to take timely 
</p>
<p>decisions. As the Parliament played a crucial role in identifying the causes of the financial 
</p>
<p>crisis, one would think that it should play a role in the Financial Stability Council, either by 
</p>
<p>including a parliamentary representative on the Council or by ensuring citizens&#8217; oversight 
</p>
<p>of the Council through a parliamentary committee.

<p>42. The capacity of the judicial system to scrutinize criminal financial and economic 
</p>
<p>conduct was inadequate in comparison to the size of Iceland&#8217;s international banking 
</p>
<p>operations. Parliament passed Act No. 135/2008 establishing the Office of the Special

</p>
<p>relating to the financial undertakings of the Icelandic financial institutions, including the 
</p>
<p>activities of their owners. Since 2011, the Office has also been tasked with investigating 
</p>
<p>economic crimes and tax evasion. The Office deals with complex cases, involving many 
</p>
<p>suspects, witnesses and a huge amount of documentation relating to alleged fraud, 
</p>
<p>embezzlement, market manipulation and insider trading. In 2012, it had up to 110 staff

<p>is commendable and will hopefully promote law-abiding behaviour in the financial sector. 
</p>
<p>However, individuals who have been under investigation, and the lawyers representing 
</p>
<p>them, expressed concerns to the Independent Expert, including about telephone tapping of 
</p>
<p>privileged telephone conversations between suspects and their lawyers.25 The Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert was informed by the Office of the Special Prosecutor that telephone tapping of 
</p>
<p>suspects&#8217; conversations had been stopped after it had become apparent that such 
</p>
<p>communication between lawyers and their clients was not excluded. Adequate resources for 
</p>
<p>the work of the Office are needed to ensure a timely rule-of-law-based exercise of the 
</p>
<p>Special Prosecutor&#8217;s mandate, including the conduct of investigations into past, current and 
</p>
<p>future criminal economic activities. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Participation of citizens and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>44. In the aftermath of the banking collapse, Icelandic citizens took to the streets and 
</p>
<p>protested in front of the Parliament building. The Government resigned and parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections were held in early 2009, which brought a new coalition to power until April 2013. 
</p>
<p>Many citizens had, however, lost trust in the established political and public institutions and 
</p>
<p>new forms of citizens&#8217; participation emerged.  
</p>
<p>45. For the first time in Icelandic history, referenda were held on the question as to 
</p>
<p>whether and to what extent the Government should pay back deposits by foreigners in 
</p>
<p>Icesave, a branch of the former Landsbanki. As most of the concerned savers in the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom and the Netherlands were covered by national banking guarantees, individuals 
</p>
<p>residing in those countries were protected up to their national guarantees from losing all 
</p>
<p>their deposits.  
</p>
<p>46. After the banking crash, there was a huge turnover in senior management at the 
</p>
<p>Financial Supervisory Authority and the Central Bank of Iceland, to a large degree through 
</p>
<p>resignations. However, there appear to have been hardly any sanctions in relation to any 
</p>
<p>criminal or non-criminal aspects of negligent behaviour on the part of officials.

</p>
<p>Administrative, civil or criminal sanctions against government officials appear to have been 
</p>
<p>limited to the trial of the former Prime Minister and one government official who was 
</p>
<p>accused of insider trading. While the efforts to hold bankers accountable are remarkable in 
</p>
<p>the light of modern financial history, a comprehensive attempt to ensure accountability in 
</p>
<p>the public sector appears to be lacking. Furthermore, there are no regulations prohibiting 
</p>
<p>high-level civil servants or Members of Parliament from being immediately re-employed in 
</p>
<p>certain positions in the private sector. Post-employment restrictions have been repeatedly 
</p>
<p>recommended in Council of Europe evaluation reports.26 
</p>
<p>47. In 2012, the Council of Europe identified shortcomings in relation to the 
</p>
<p>independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Iceland.27 In the view of the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert, the system for appointing judges could be further strengthened to ensure absolute 
</p>
<p>independence of the judicial branch from executive influence. A more sophisticated 
</p>
<p>domestic legal framework, establishing the duty of public officials to protect the public 
</p>
<p>interest and outlining the consequences of breaches of that duty would contribute to 
</p>
<p>creating the right incentives for ensuring public accountability.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Impact of the banking crisis on the enjoyment of  
human rights  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>48. While unemployment in Iceland increased to about 10 per cent in 2009 and 2010, it 
</p>
<p>never reached the unprecedented levels seen in other European countries trapped in a debt 
</p>
<p>crisis. Active labour market programmes, training and the opening up of secondary schools 
</p>
<p>and universities to unemployed persons prevented a much larger part of the population from 
</p>
<p>ending up out of work or without training. The policies were largely successful, with the 
</p>
<p>number of long-term unemployed dropping from about 2,500 persons in 2012 to around 
</p>
<p>1,000 job seekers by the end of 2014.  
</p>
<p>49. The Government provided assistance to companies to keep their staff, with reduced 
</p>
<p>working hours and subsidized salaries. Social partners agreed on wage restraint to 
</p>
<p>safeguard employment in the aftermath of the crisis, but decided to increase the minimum 
</p>
<p>wage to protect low-income workers. Instead of shortening the duration of unemployment 
</p>
<p>benefits, the Government temporarily extended unemployment benefits to a maximum 
</p>
<p>duration of four years, preventing a much larger proportion of the unemployed from having 
</p>
<p>to depend on social security benefits as a last resort.  
</p>
<p>50. However, challenges remain; while overall unemployment dropped to 4.1 per cent 
</p>
<p>during the fourth quarter of 2014, unemployment of foreigners, in particular Polish 
</p>
<p>nationals, which had reached over 20 per cent during the crisis years, still stood above 10 
</p>
<p>per cent in July 2014. The youth unemployment rate, at 8.5 per cent, was still significantly

<p><b> B. Right to social security, and combating poverty and social exclusion 
</b></p>
<p>51. The number of people depending on municipal financial aid &#8212; last-resort support &#8212; 
has nearly doubled, from 4,280 households in 2007 to over 8,000 households in 2013. 
</p>
<p>About 4 per cent of the entire population and 6.5 per cent of all households depend on such 
</p>
<p>income support, with single men without children and single women with children being 
</p>
<p>most dependent on municipal financial assistance, and 45 per cent of recipients being 
</p>
<p>unemployed.29 
</p>
<p>52. As of 1 of January 2014, the duration of unemployment benefits was reduced to two 
and a half years and it is expected that many long-term unemployed will have to rely on the 
</p>
<p>minimum social security net offered by municipalities, which are not very well prepared, 
</p>
<p>either administratively or financially, to support the increasing number of people seeking 
</p>
<p>assistance. Municipalities apply different eligibility criteria, so that applicants enjoy 
</p>
<p>different levels of benefits depending on their place of residence, and the differences cannot 
</p>
<p>always be justified by disparities in local living costs. The last-resort social security benefit,  
</p>
<p>aimed at covering the minimum costs for decent living, varies by more than 30 per cent, 
</p>
<p>depending on the municipality. The amount for a single person is between ISK 129,240 (in 
</p>
<p>Akranes) and ISK 169,199 (in Reykjavik).30 A harmonized, equal and non-discriminatory 
</p>
<p>treatment of all applicants, in conformity with article 2 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, appears to be lacking.  
</p>
<p>53. Although the Debtors&#8217; Ombudsman has developed a reference budget for the 
purpose of debt mitigation, Iceland has not yet specified the core minimum budget that 
</p>
<p>individuals and families should have in order to enjoy the essential economic and social 
</p>
<p>rights and to be able to participate in public life, and which reflects actual living costs.  
</p>
<p>54. Welfare, labour market and taxation policies contributed to keeping the percentage 
of persons at risk of poverty and social exclusion, as defined by the European Union, below 
</p>
<p>14 per cent in the aftermath of the crisis. The 2013 European Union survey on income and 
</p>
<p>living conditions shows, however, that particular groups are at risk.31 For example, children 
</p>
<p>(16.6 per cent); foreign citizens (19.0 per cent), unemployed persons (23.2 per cent) and 
</p>
<p>tenants living in accommodation rented at market rates (30.7 per cent) or at reduced rates 
</p>
<p>(33.0 per cent) are at a much higher poverty risk, while homeowners, including those 
</p>
<p>paying mortgages (7.1 per cent) or who have already repaid their loans in full (9.1 per cent) 
</p>
<p>face a below-average risk of poverty or social exclusion (see figure 2 below). Debt relief 
</p>
<p>measures for homeowners appear to have been generally successful in preventing 
</p>
<p>widespread poverty among households paying mortgages. The Independent Expert is, 
</p>
<p>however, particularly concerned about the situation of people who either cannot afford to 
</p>
<p>buy their own accommodation or who have lost their homes owing to the banking crisis.  
</p>
<p>55. Single-parent households continue to require particular attention as 27.1 per cent of 
those households live on less than 60 per cent of the median income. While child poverty in 
</p>
<p>Iceland is low by international standards, the at-risk-of-poverty rates among children whose

<p>56. The Government of Iceland should be commended for successfully combating  
poverty and social exclusion amongst the elderly. By raising the tax-funded guaranteed

<p>minimum pension above the minimum wage in September 2008, and by further increasing 
</p>
<p>the guaranteed  pension as a crisis policy measure in early 2009, old age poverty was 
</p>
<p>substantially reduced (see figure 2 below). Gender differences relating to income poverty 
</p>
<p>among the elderly were also closed. In 2008, 19.7 per cent of all women over 65 years of 
</p>
<p>age lived below 60 per cent of the median income, or the poverty threshold, while in 2013,  
</p>
<p>only 4.0 per cent did so; while income poverty among elderly men dropped from 9.5 per

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>57. Iceland has a high-standard universal health-care system, and hospital services are 
</p>
<p>free of charge. Since 2009, all children have access to free primary health care. On the other 
</p>
<p>hand, user fees for private health care increased from about 16.4 per cent in 2000 to 19.1 
</p>
<p>per cent in 2010 and adult dental care is also payable. The number of people who reported 
</p>
<p>having skipped a dental visit because it was too expensive increased from 6 per cent in 
</p>
<p>2007 to 11 per cent in 2013. Access to affordable dental care is a concern, in particular to 
</p>
<p>people in the lowest income quintile, 18 per cent of whom said that they had skipped a 
</p>
<p>necessary service because they could not afford it.34 The Government should be 
</p>
<p>commended for gradually introducing a scheme to provide free dental health care for 
</p>
<p>children. Expanding such a scheme to individuals in situations of poverty, irrespective of 
</p>
<p>their age, should be considered. 
</p>
<p>58. Research conducted so far indicates that the banking collapse had only limited 
</p>
<p>impact on the health of the population. Studies have identified slightly higher stress levels 
</p>
<p>among women, in particular unemployed women, and students with middle levels of 
</p>
<p>income or education. However, the crisis seems to have reduced smoking, heavy drinking, 
</p>
<p>consumption of sugared soft drinks and fast food, and resulted in better sleeping 
</p>
<p>behaviour.35  
</p>
<p>59. The number of people reporting that they were in good or very good health dropped 
</p>
<p>only slightly from 79.0 per cent in 2007 to 76.8 per cent in 2013. Self-reported good health 
</p>
<p>decreased more among the more affluent, but remained largely unchanged among those 
</p>
<p>with lower incomes. In 2014, the Euro Health Consumer Index ranked Iceland seventh in 
</p>
<p>Europe, with particular good scores on patient rights, prevention and health system 
</p>
<p>outcomes, including the lowest number of infant deaths and the lowest number of potential 
</p>
<p>years of life lost.36 While the Icelandic health system maintained its impressive services, job 
</p>
<p>satisfaction of doctors and nurses probably suffered most owing to cost-containment 
</p>
<p>policies.37 The health sector is starting to encounter difficulties in keeping highly qualified 
</p>
<p>staff, who can easily find more attractive jobs abroad.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>60. Independent research suggests that teaching and learning &#8212; the core functions of 
</p>
<p>schools &#8212; were, to a large extent, protected. The reduction in expenditure on education did 
</p>
<p>not cause a school crisis as access to education of a suitable quality was not threatened. 
</p>
<p>However, that may not apply to all primary schools, which were harder hit by the cutbacks 
</p>
<p>than other schools. Various cuts were made at all school levels; some administrative 
</p>
<p>positions were eliminated; class size was increased; teachers were not paid for overtime and 
</p>
<p>principals served as substitute teachers. A number of schools at the preschool and primary

<p>school levels were merged, while teachers&#8217; salaries have remained low by international 
</p>
<p>standards.38 
</p>
<p>61. Iceland has one of the highest rates of early school leaving in Europe, with boys and 
</p>
<p>immigrant children being at particular risk of dropping out of upper secondary school 
</p>
<p>before attaining the minimum qualifications. The Independent Expert notes that, in its 
</p>
<p>White Paper on Educational Reform, the Government identified tackling secondary school 
</p>
<p>dropout as one of its priorities.39 
</p>
<p>62. The Independent Expert recommends that financial literacy be included in the school 
</p>
<p>curriculum, as a preventive measure. The report of the Special Investigative Commission 
</p>
<p>could be summarized in a more accessible form and discussed in schools. Social and 
</p>
<p>economic rights should be made more visible in the existing curriculum on democracy and 
</p>
<p>human rights, which should include more information on the rights of citizens as clients of 
</p>
<p>banks and how individuals can use existing mechanisms at the national or international 
</p>
<p>level to ensure that their social rights are respected. This should include information about 
</p>
<p>Icelandic institutions that defend the rights of citizens in the social and economic sphere. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to adequate housing and individual debt relief 
</b></p>
<p>63. Past housing policies were nearly exclusively aimed at promoting loan-based home 
</p>
<p>ownership. In the aftermath of the crisis, the value of loans indexed to foreign currency 
</p>
<p>skyrocketed; such loans were popular among the population prior to the banking crash, 
</p>
<p>owing to the spread between the local and foreign currencies, and had been sold recklessly 
</p>
<p>to consumers, in breach of national law provisions. Banks also engaged in competition to 
</p>
<p>offer credit to consumers, but after the crash, thousands of citizens were caught in a debt 
</p>
<p>trap when the value of the Icelandic krona depreciated drastically. Suddenly, many 
</p>
<p>Icelandic homeowners had private debt outstripping the value of their homes and were 
</p>
<p>unable to repay their debts to commercial banks and the Housing Financing Fund.  
</p>
<p>64. The Government reacted by introducing several debt relief schemes and by imposing 
</p>
<p>moratoria on foreclosures. In August 2010, the Government established the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Debtor&#8217;s Ombudsman, funded by a levy on financial institutions, which could negotiate 
</p>
<p>with various lenders on behalf of debtors . Initially, most requests for debt mitigation came 
</p>
<p>from homeowners; however, that trend shifted in 2014. Today, more than half of all debt 
</p>
<p>mitigation applicants live in rented homes.40 There is a worrying trend of a smaller group of 
</p>
<p>people who are heavily indebted and who can neither afford to pay their daily living costs, 
</p>
<p>including housing, nor repay their debt. It is doubtful whether additional debt relief 
</p>
<p>initiatives taken by the current Government in 2014 will adequately and definitively solve 
</p>
<p>the situation of these households. According to views expressed to the Independent Expert, 
</p>
<p>further targeted debt relief for heavily indebted poor households would not present risks to 
</p>
<p>the restructured commercial banks or the Housing Financing Fund, which have largely 
</p>
<p>written off those liabilities on their balance sheets.

</b></p>
<p>65. Iceland still needs an adequately equipped Debtors&#8217; Ombudsman to assist over-
</p>
<p>indebted households with debt mitigation, as well as to provide advice and improve 
</p>
<p>financial literacy so as to prevent citizens from falling into a debt trap again.  
</p>
<p>66. Of particular concern is access for the less affluent to affordable and appropriate 
</p>
<p>housing with secure legal tenure, especially given the fact that many of them have lost their 
</p>
<p>own homes and have entered the rental market. In particular, young persons with children 
</p>
<p>find it difficult to find affordable accommodation. There is a lack of apartments for long-
</p>
<p>term rental and there is a need to improve the legal protection of rent payers and to expand 
</p>
<p>social housing programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Lessons learned  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>67. Several good practices can be identified. First, the Government tried to reduce the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of the banking collapse on its citizens by sheltering their deposits; 
</p>
<p>restructuring and dividing the failed banks into smaller entities to serve the local citizens 
</p>
<p>and economy; introducing capital controls, as needed, and debt relief for companies and 
</p>
<p>private households, including the establishment of a Debtors&#8217; Ombudsman.  
</p>
<p>68. The Government also responded to the financial and economic crisis by sheltering 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups through expanding social protection spending, promoting temporary 
</p>
<p>part-time work, formulating active labour market policies and granting a temporary 
</p>
<p>expansion of entitlement to unemployment benefits, instead of implementing front-loaded 
</p>
<p>austerity measures &#8212; which would have worsened the crisis &#8212;, adjustment policies 
</p>
<p>focused on increasing government revenue through the reintroduction of progressive 
</p>
<p>income taxation, a wealth tax and higher corporate taxes. Although practically every citizen 
</p>
<p>suffered losses, the cost of the collapse was distributed in an overwhelmingly fair manner, 
</p>
<p>with stronger protection for low-income groups, while the wealthy, who are not at risk of 
</p>
<p>falling below the minimum levels of enjoyment of social and economic rights, experienced 
</p>
<p>a much higher drop in their disposable income. Inequality within Icelandic society 
</p>
<p>decreased. While unemployment rose, it never reached the catastrophic levels experienced 
</p>
<p>by other European countries affected by financial crises. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>commends Iceland for, in particular, reducing poverty among the elderly and, more 
</p>
<p>particularly, among elderly women, by increasing the government-guaranteed minimum 
</p>
<p>pension.  
</p>
<p>69. Welfare Watch is worth mentioning as an innovative response to the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>The watchdog can be credited for having improved collaboration between government 
</p>
<p>departments, local authorities and civil society in tackling the social impact of the crisis and 
</p>
<p>for enhancing citizens&#8217; participation. Its work resulted in improved social monitoring and 
</p>
<p>targeted interventions by the authorities and welfare organizations. Welfare Watch also 
</p>
<p>helped to spread the message to the public authorities and society at large that nobody 
</p>
<p>should be left behind as a consequence of the banking collapse. 
</p>
<p>70. Iceland should also be credited for initiating a comprehensive analysis of the causes 
</p>
<p>of the banking collapse by the Special Investigation Commission, which was established by 
</p>
<p>the Parliament. In addition, serious efforts were made to combat impunity for economic 
</p>
<p>crimes in the financial sector through the establishment of the Office of the Special 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor.  </p>

<p><b> B. Can the Icelandic experience be useful in other contexts? 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Independent Expert intends to discuss more thoroughly in a future report how 
States can respond in a human rights-compliant manner to debt and financial crises. He 
</p>
<p>would, however, like to make some remarks in the present report on how the lessons 
</p>
<p>learned in Iceland could be fruitful for other countries.  
</p>
<p>72. First of all, certain particularities should be considered. Before the banking crisis, 
Iceland enjoyed, in comparison with other countries, particularly high levels of realization 
</p>
<p>of social and economic rights. The country ranked very high on the Human Development 
</p>
<p>Index, had one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, enjoyed unemployment 
</p>
<p>levels below 2 per cent and had a high degree of gender equality, despite persistent pay 
</p>
<p>gaps.  
</p>
<p>73. The government of a highly developed country similar to Iceland, may find it easier 
to respond in a human rights-compliant manner to an economic shock when it can still 
</p>
<p>depend on significant revenues, a modern infrastructure and well-equipped, mostly 
</p>
<p>functioning, public institutions with well-trained officials. 
</p>
<p>74. Iceland was able to rely on its social welfare system, which proved largely capable 
of absorbing the shock of the economic crash. Before the crisis, a social security benefit of 
</p>
<p>last resort was already in place to guarantee some basic protection to all. Iceland also had a 
</p>
<p>guaranteed minimum old-age pension and other social benefits that could be adjusted to 
</p>
<p>respond to the crisis. The Icelandic experience underlines the critical role that a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive social security net can play in protecting economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights in the event of an economic downturn. 
</p>
<p>75. The economic crisis was largely rooted in one sector, which helped the response. 
Furthermore, Iceland had a track record of responsible public debt management and was 
</p>
<p>therefore able to take on new debt to recapitalize its Central Bank, downsize its financial 
</p>
<p>institutions and expand its social spending in response to the crisis. Instead of Iceland 
</p>
<p>engaging in a policy of internal devaluation, the sharp fall of the krona helped the country 
</p>
<p>to come out of the economic crisis through export-driven demand and a tourist boom.  
</p>
<p>76. With a population of 320,000, the country is small, with strong interconnections. It 
has an active civil society, well-rooted democratic traditions, a high degree of trade union 
</p>
<p>organization, a long tradition of collective bargaining and conflict resolution through 
</p>
<p>dialogue and compromise, and a public administration that is overwhelmingly willing and 
</p>
<p>competent to respond to its citizens&#8217; needs. In response to public discontent after the 
banking crisis, the Government resigned, which opened the way for early elections, and 
</p>
<p>referenda were held to allow citizens to express their views on certain decisions. There was 
</p>
<p>increased dialogue with and among citizens. While some reform projects have not been 
</p>
<p>completed or have been abandoned, the banking collapse changed the political culture of 
</p>
<p>the country. 
</p>
<p>77. The way in which Iceland dealt with its banking collapse underscores the 
importance of the indivisibility of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights to 
</p>
<p>ensure human rights-compliant responses to a financial crisis. Despite the particularities 
</p>
<p>outlined above, the Independent Expert believes that bigger and less developed countries, 
</p>
<p>with more complex problems, can learn from the policy responses of the Government of 
</p>
<p>Iceland and cherish the value of having a social security net in place to ensure a basic 
</p>
<p>protection floor for all. Of course, those countries must adopt and adjust solutions to meet 
</p>
<p>their particular needs and circumstances.  
</p>
<p>78. International financial institutions can also learn from the successful implementation 
of the adjustment programme in Iceland, which included capital controls, sheltering the 
</p>
<p>social welfare system from cuts and a strong focus on revenue generation and redistribution 
</p>
<p>through taxation policies. In the Independent Expert&#8217;s view, the efforts of the IMF to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/59/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>consult extensively with public institutions and interest groups, including extra-
</p>
<p>Parliamentary groups, improved the design and public acceptance of programmes. 
</p>
<p>However, he noted with regret that economic, social and cultural rights failed to feature 
</p>
<p>more explicitly in the agreed adjustment programme.41  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Iceland managed the financial crisis better than many other countries and must 
continue its efforts to ensure that nobody is left behind. Household debt relief 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures successfully protected the majority of homeowners </b>&#8212;<b> but not all </b>&#8212;<b> from 
poverty and social exclusion. However, a society that is rightly proud of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive social welfare system and considers children and family as its core 
</b></p>
<p><b>priorities, should not tolerate that the risk of children growing up in poverty is at 12.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>per cent, which is higher than the rate of poverty for adults (8.5 per cent).  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The largely human rights-compliant response to the financial crisis was not 
only an outcome of conscious policy decisions, but was also a reflection of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible behaviour of social partners, a vibrant civil society, committed and 
</b></p>
<p><b>competent civil servants and individuals engaged in their communities and working 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards the common good.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Independent Expert believes that international organizations and  
countries facing similar situations can learn from the particular path chosen by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Iceland, which included protecting its core social welfare system, efforts to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>citizens</b>&#8217;<b> participation in the decision-making process and endeavours to establish 
political, administrative and judicial accountability. He recommends that the good 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices identified in this report be closely considered. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Financial systems require appropriate regulations and institutions aimed at 
ensuring that they serve the real economy. Yet, it is also necessary to reflect on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>moral driving forces of the colossal over-borrowing that led an entire country into a 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial crash. To what extent and under what circumstances are debt-based growth 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies necessary and consistent with the full realization of human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>happiness? The Icelandic case shows that those questions are at the core of the role 
</b></p>
<p><b>currently played by financial markets in modern societies.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In conclusion, the Independent Expert would like to recommend that the 
authorities of Iceland: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Address unemployment through a comprehensive employment policy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with special focus on groups at risk of long-term unemployment, such as young people 
</b></p>
<p><b>and immigrants;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Provide further targeted debt relief for poor and highly indebted 
</b></p>
<p><b>households; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that everyone has access, on an equal and fair footing, to social 
</b></p>
<p><b>security benefits of last resort which provide a minimum essential level of benefits that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are monitored and adjusted regularly according to the cost of living; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Continue its efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>of young families with children, single-parent families, persons with disabilities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>immigrants and individuals who are dependent on the rental market;

</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Ensure that the Debtor</b>s&#8217;<b> Ombudsman remains adequately equipped to 
continue to assist over-indebted households with debt mitigation, provide advice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve financial literacy so as to prevent citizens from falling into a debt trap;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Establish, without further delay, a national human rights institution in  
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with the Paris Principles, with a broad mandate covering all human 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(p) Ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the

</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in order to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that individuals are entitled to send complaints under those human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments. The Icelandic response to the banking collapse showed that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government takes its commitments to protect social and economic rights seriously; 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequently, it seems appropriate that Iceland should ensure that its population has 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to those international complaints mechanisms.
