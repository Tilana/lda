</b></p>
<p>In its resolution 10/15, the Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, pursuant to his 
mandate, to prepare, working in consultation with States and other relevant stakeholders, a 
compilation of good practices on legal and institutional frameworks and measures that 
ensure respect for human rights by intelligence agencies while countering terrorism, 
including on their oversight, and to present the compilation in a report to the Council at its 
thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>Owing to the complexity and importance of the issue, the Special Rapporteur has 
been unable to finalize the report. The Special Rapporteur will update the Council thereon 
at its thirteenth session. The report of the Special Rapporteur will appear in document 
A/HRC/14/46.
