</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers paid an official 
visit to Mexico at the Government&#8217;s invitation from 1 to 15 October 2010. She had the 
honour of being received by the President and met with governmental, legislative and 
judicial authorities at both the federal and state levels, as well as with representatives of 
civil society organizations and other stakeholders. Her visits to the Federal District and the 
states of Chiapas, M&#233;xico, Nuevo Le&#243;n, San Luis Potos&#237; and Yucat&#225;n enabled her to assess 
the status of the judiciary in various regions of the country. 
 In her report, the Special Rapporteur states that Mexico is confronted with 
escalating violence, primarily on the part of groups with links to organized crime. Despite 
the measures taken by the Government, crime has extended its tentacles within the country 
and is beginning to affect the daily lives of a large sector of Mexican society. The Special 
Rapporteur emphasizes that this situation makes it all the more important to have a sound, 
independent and effective judiciary. The need to protect court officials from threats and 
intimidation is also underscored. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur observes that persistent structural and organizational flaws 
in the judicial system, especially at the level of federative entities, have an impact on the 
independence and autonomy of judicial authorities. 
 Mexico has carried out far-reaching constitutional reforms in many of the areas

</p>
<p>encompassed by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, who points out that the 2008 
reform of the criminal justice system is particularly pertinent in this respect. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the successful implementation of these reforms hinges upon political 
leadership and redoubled efforts on the part of all relevant institutions and stakeholders. 
</p>
<p> The report includes a thorough analysis of the federal executive branch&#8217;s initiative 
for the reform of the military justice system, which is considered to be unsatisfactory. 
Reference is also made to constitutional reforms relating to human rights, the right to 
amparo and proposed federal legislation on the juvenile justice system. In discussing major 
challenges for the justice system, in addition to the escalating violence and a growing lack 
of public safety attributable primarily to organized crime, mention is made of the issue of 
impunity. In Mexico, this issue is linked not only to structural shortcomings in criminal 
investigations, but also to corruption, which is widespread at all levels but particularly at 
the state and municipal levels. The Special Rapporteur then presents a thorough analysis of 
the constitutional provisions referring to preventive custody (<i>arraigo</i>) and concludes that 
this legal institution is inherently incompatible with the principle of the presumption of 
innocence and the right to personal liberty and should therefore be expunged. 
</p>
<p> The report also covers issues relating to the legal profession and the work of public 
defenders. The Special Rapporteur observes that there is a lack of uniformity in the 
requirements for admission to the bar and notes the absence of an independent oversight 
body to uphold the quality, integrity, ethics and good repute of the legal profession. She 
also recommends that the Office of the Public Defender be made independent of the 
executive branch in all the federative entities in order to uphold the principle of equality of 
arms. The report closes with an analysis of the issue of access to justice, an area in which 
the Government of Mexico must do more for the sake of its people. Particular attention is 
devoted to the difficulties which indigenous peoples and women have in gaining access to 
the justice system.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of the United Mexican States, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Ms. Gabriela Carina Knaul de 
Albuquerque e Silva, visited the country on an official mission from 1 to 15 October 2010 
in order to examine matters relating to the independence of the judicial branch, the judiciary 
and the country&#8217;s lawyers. She visited the Federal District, Tuxtla Guti&#233;rrez and San 
Crist&#243;bal de las Casas in the State of Chiapas, Toluca in the State of M&#233;xico, Monterrey in 
the State of Nuevo Le&#243;n, San Luis Potos&#237; in the State of San Luis Potos&#237; and M&#233;rida in the 
State of Yucat&#225;n. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur had the honour of being received by the President of Mexico 
and met with various federal and state authorities, persons in the judicial branch, public 
human rights bodies and representatives of civil society.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for its invitation to visit the 
country and for its close cooperation and expresses her gratitude to the Mexico Office of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for its 
support.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Federal level 
</b></p>
<p>4. Article 94 of the Constitution provides that the exercise of judicial authority shall be 
vested in the Supreme Court, the Electoral Tribunal, the circuit courts (both those presided 
over by a panel of judges and those in which a single judge presides), and the district 
courts. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Supreme Court 
</b></p>
<p>5. A total of 11 judges sit on the bench of the Supreme Court, which holds proceedings 
in plenary and in various chambers. Its sessions are usually open to the public. 
</p>
<p>6. The Supreme Court has played a vital role in recent years, particularly in terms of 
opening up its proceedings to the public and moving reforms of the country&#8217;s justice system 
forward. The direct broadcasts of its plenary sessions, the publication of its decisions, the 
fact that the Court now holds public hearings on relevant issues and its decision to accept 
documentary submissions from major stakeholders without them necessarily having to be 
litigants are all praiseworthy signs of its modernization. Other signs of greater openness and 
modernity include the forthcoming publication of the transcripts of the Supreme Court&#8217;s 
plenary sessions on its website and the decision to make recordings of plenary sessions held 
since June 2005 accessible over the Internet. In addition, in 2003 the Supreme Court held 
the National Consultation on the Comprehensive Reform of the Mexican Justice System in 
order to elicit proposals from the country&#8217;s legal community and society at large about 
ways to improve the system for the administration of justice. The outputs of the 
Consultation were compiled in the <i>Libro Blanco de la Reforma Judicial</i> (white paper on 
judicial reform), which was published in 2006. This white paper sets forth a number of 
different actions, including 33 actions which it presents as essential items for inclusion on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>the agenda for judicial reform.1 Action No. 27, which relates to the promotion of 
cooperation among the organizations that administer justice, led to the establishment of the 
Mexican Association of Justice Officials (AMIJ). In addition, in 2007 the Supreme Court 
presented 14 proposed constitutional amendments under the State Reform Act.  
</p>
<p>7. Many of the recommended actions in the white paper (such as the reform of amparo 
proceedings, the reinforcement of the judicial branch at the state level and the reform of the 
criminal justice system), as well as a number of the 14 proposals made in 2007, deal with 
issues or circumstances that were examined by the Special Rapporteur during her visit. The 
Special Rapporteur is of the view that, in order to improve the justice system, consideration 
should be given to the proposals made in the white paper and those presented by the 
Supreme Court under the State Reform Act. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Circuit and district courts 
</b></p>
<p>8. Circuit court judges and district court judges are appointed and assigned to a court 
for a period of six years by the Council of the Federal Judiciary. At the end of that time, 
they may be confirmed or promoted. The appointment and promotion of circuit court 
judges and district court judges is conducted by means of an internal or open competitive 
process.2 The selection process is based on written examinations that involve the 
preparation of written decisions on given cases and an oral examination before a panel. In 
making its evaluation, the panel also takes into consideration courses taken by applicants in 
the Institute of the Federal Judiciary, length of service in the federal courts, their 
performance, academic degrees and any refresher or specialized courses that they may have 
taken.3  
</p>
<p>9. While the use of a competitive selection process and written examinations is 
welcome, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the selection and promotion of women 
judges is hindered by the fact that, under existing regulations, candidates are assigned 
points (which are often a decisive factor in the final selection of candidates) for having 
taken refresher and specialized courses, and these courses are usually given in the evenings, 
when it is difficult for female judges who have children to attend. Another source of 
concern is the requirement that, when persons take on new responsibilities as circuit or 
district court judges, they must change assignments, as this limits the participation of 
female judges. Although this is not an instance of de jure discrimination in access to the 
profession, since the persons with the highest scores are selected, it is de facto 
discrimination, since, in practice, the assignment of points for attendance at evening classes 
penalizes women.  
</p>
<p>10. While the Special Rapporteur is aware that a gender equity programme has been 
established in the federal judiciary, its quasi-patriarchal framework and the prevalence of 
certain social conventions are an obstacle to the career advancement of women judges, 
especially to the most senior posts. The Special Rapporteur therefore believes that 
consideration should be given to the use of special temporary measures to ensure a gender 
balance in the judiciary and to make certain that women are able to become judges and to 
advance in their careers. The implementation of such measures should be coupled with 
efforts to raise awareness and promote an understanding of their significance on the part of 
all court officials.

</p>
<p><b> 3. The Council of the Federal Judiciary 
</b>11. Administration, oversight and disciplinary action with respect to the federal 
judiciary, with the exception of the Supreme Court, are the responsibility of the Council of 
the Federal Judiciary (CJF), which is an independent body in both practical and 
administrative terms and is empowered to issue decisions.4 CJF has seven members: the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who also presides over the Council; three circuit court 
and/or district court judges who are appointed by the Supreme Court in plenary; two 
members who are designated by the Senate; and one who is appointed by the President of 
Mexico. There is a conspicuous absence of women in this important body, especially in 
view of the fact that it is responsible for appointing, assigning, confirming and removing 
members of the judiciary in Mexico. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention 
to the need for balanced representation of men and women who are knowledgeable about 
gender issues.  
</p>
<p>12. A number of people expressed concern about the fact that the same person who 
presides over the Supreme Court also presides over the Council, since this could undermine 
the Council&#8217;s independence from the Court. It would be advisable for the Chair of the 
Council to be held by someone other than the Chief Justice, who has important, full-time 
duties to discharge.  
</p>
<p>13. Another cause of concern is the fact that the Constitution states that the Council&#8217;s 
decisions regarding any matter other than the appointment, assignment, confirmation or 
removal of judges, which can be reviewed by the Supreme Court, are final and cannot be 
contested, and there is therefore no judicial or other appeal against such decisions.5  
</p><p>14. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that there should be some provision for 
having any disciplinary or administrative decision that has an impact on the status of judges 
reviewed by an independent judicial body.6 This recommendation also applies to the 
councils of the judiciary and electoral tribunals at the state level. All of the states and the 
Federal District should have a council of the judiciary,7 and a national council should be 
established to coordinate the work of those state councils. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The Public Prosecution Service 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Public Prosecution Service is a key component of the justice system and is 
designed to ensure the proper investigation of crimes and prosecution of offenders. Article 
102 A of the Constitution provides that the Federal Public Prosecution Service shall, inter 
alia, be responsible for the prosecution of all federal offences, for obtaining warrants for the 
arrest of suspects, for uncovering and submitting evidence against accused persons, for 
ensuring the prompt and speedy administration of justice, and for requesting that the court 
apply a given penalty. 
</p>
<p>16. The Attorney-General of the Republic, who is the head of the Federal Public 
Prosecution Service, is appointed by the President, and this appointment must then be 
ratified by the Senate. The fact that the country&#8217;s prosecution services are not independent 
of the executive branch of government is a challenge to be overcome by Mexico&#8217;s federal 
and state justice systems, inasmuch as this lack of autonomy can erode the credibility of the

 At present, only six states do not have such a body: Baja California Sur, Campeche, Chihuahua, 
</p>
<p>Colima, Oaxaca and Tamaulipas. </p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>authority responsible for investigating crimes objectively and undermine confidence in its 
ability to do so.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur has been informed of a number of proposals for converting 
the Public Prosecution Service into an autonomous body and recommends that these 
proposals be accorded due consideration and be approved without delay, since the 
implementation of the new criminal justice system requires that the administration of 
justice be fully independent of the executive branch. 
</p><p>18. It is also necessary to ensure effective oversight of all prosecution services, increase 
their transparency, fully implement a system for the advancement of judges along a career 
path and improve the system for ensuring accountability. The process involved in 
converting the country&#8217;s prosecution services into autonomous bodies should be coupled 
with their rationalization, monitoring and reorganization.  
</p>
<p><b> B. State level 
</b></p>
<p>19. At the state level, the workings of the justice system are regulated primarily by the 
states&#8217; constitutions and their laws governing the organization of the bodies within that 
system. The make-up and names of these different agencies vary a great deal, but, generally 
speaking, the judicial branch is composed of a high court, courts of first instance, municipal 
courts and a council of the judiciary. In some states, electoral tribunals and administrative 
courts, as well as the public defender&#8217;s office, also form part of the judicial branch.  
</p>
<p><b>  Appointment and term of office 
</b></p>
<p>20. In general, the chief justice of the high court is elected by the full panel of judges of 
that court. In most cases, judges are appointed by the state council of the judiciary on the 
recommendation of the head of the executive branch at the state level, with the approval of 
the legislature or of its standing intersessional committee. Under this system, which is used 
throughout the country, the governor is the person who actually appoints judges, although 
this appointment is then ratified by the state congress. This link with the executive branch is 
so strong that, in practice, the latter also determines who will be appointed chief justice, 
which can seriously undermine the independence and autonomy of the bodies charged with 
administering justice at the local level. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was 
witness, on at least two occasions, to the existence of an unusually close relationship 
between a chief justice and the governor of the state in question.  
</p><p>21. With regard to the appointment of high court justices, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that the necessary steps, including structural and legislative changes, should be 
taken to ensure the complete independence of the state judiciary from the executive branch. 
22. The judges of courts of first instance are usually appointed by means of a 
competitive application process. There are some states, however, where judges can also be 
appointed directly. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to establish and apply objective criteria 
for the selection and promotion of judges8 in order to place the focus on candidates&#8217; 
abilities and integrity and on merit. The existing practice at both the federal and state levels, 
whereby judges are selected on the basis of competitive examinations, may therefore be a 
suitable procedure, especially if these competitive screening processes take the form, at 
least in part, of written, anonymous and objectively scored examinations.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 See A/HRC/11/41, paras. 30 and 97.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.11-12933 
</p>
<p>24. A system for the entire judiciary in which the appointment, promotion and removal 
of judges are based on objective criteria should be established. Open competitive selection 
mechanisms should be used throughout the country so that the best possible professional 
can be selected for each position on the basis of objective, transparent criteria that 
incorporate a gender perspective.  
</p>
<p>25. The term of office for judges of various ranks differs from one state to another. In 
most cases, judges are appointed for an initial period after which they may be confirmed in 
their posts. Sometimes this confirmation process involves an in-service proficiency 
examination.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the requirement that an appointment be 
confirmed or ratified upon the completion of an initial term of office could undercut the 
independence of judges, as the need for confirmation could subject them to undue pressure 
in the performance of their functions and make it difficult for them to be impartial. It would 
be another matter to have a probationary period after which the incumbent&#8217;s appointment 
could be confirmed. Otherwise, short terms of office could weaken the judicial system.9 
</p><p>27. The Special Rapporteur recommends that judges be given security of tenure once 
they have been appointed on the basis of a competitive selection process. If a probationary 
period is to be established, it should be short and no extensions should be permitted; once 
this period is over, a permanent appointment should be granted, although this does not 
mean that judges may not be required to attend refresher courses or pass in-service 
proficiency examinations.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  General observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Concentration of judicial activity 
</b>28. There are a number of areas in which the administration of justice at both the federal 
and state levels does not fall within the purview of the judicial branch. At the federal level, 
examples would include tax law, administrative law, labour law, military law and agrarian 
law. There have been a number of initiatives for making these areas autonomous and 
independent of the executive branch and transferring them to the judicial branch. The 
incorporation of the Electoral Tribunal into the federal judicial branch in 1996 is one 
example of a step in this direction. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur believes that all aspects of the administration of justice 
should be encompassed within the judicial branch. Consideration should therefore be given 
to proposals for attaining the necessary unification of judicial activity within the 
independent organ responsible for the administration of justice in Mexico.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Budget 
</b></p>
<p>30. A sufficient budget is required in order to have an effective judiciary and system for 
the administration of justice. There are a number of proposed bills under which no less than 
2 per cent of federal and state budgets would be allocated to the respective judicial 
branches. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the passage of these bills would 
strengthen the judiciary&#8217;s financial and budgetary autonomy and, hence, its independence 
and would enhance the administration of justice. The Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the judiciary give these proposals serious consideration, make an effort to rationalize the

</b></p>
<p>expenditures of the judicial branch, increase the transparency of its administrative 
procedures and heighten its effectiveness and efficiency. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Recent reforms and developments affecting the judicial 
system  
</b></p>
<p>31. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed about various long-term 
constitutional changes geared towards increasing constitutional recognition and protection 
of human rights and overhauling key institutions with the justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional reform of the criminal justice system 
</b>32. The chief aim of the constitutional reform of the criminal justice system approved in 
200810 is to convert the country&#8217;s semi-inquisitorial system into an oral, adversarial system 
of criminal justice. The reform&#8217;s positive aspects include its incorporation of the principle 
of the presumption of innocence and the provision that any statement that is not made in the 
presence of a judge is invalid. The reform will contribute to greater transparency, more 
effective public information services and better access to the criminal justice system. 
Difficulties have been encountered in its implementation, however, and the advancement of 
the reform process does not appear to be underpinned by a determined, constant and steady 
foundation of political will. The escalation of violence and growing lack of public safety 
have been cited as reasons for delaying or weakening the implementation of this reform. In 
some cases, such as in Chihuahua, counter-reforms have been brought to the fore that 
reduce the new system&#8217;s effectiveness in guaranteeing fundamental rights.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur believes that the successful implementation of the reform of 
the criminal justice system will hinge on political leadership and on the redoubled efforts of 
all the relevant institutions and stakeholders, as well as on the necessary economic 
investments and other specific actions. The broad-based political consensus that paved the 
way for the reform&#8217;s passage is now in urgent need of the support, in word and deed, of the 
authorities at the highest level in order to backstop, advocate and accelerate the reform&#8217;s 
implementation.  
</p>
<p>34. Efforts must be made to encourage all court officials and legal professionals to 
embrace the new criminal justice system and to dispel doubts and misconceptions about the 
new system&#8217;s nature and effectiveness. Law school curricula should be reoriented towards 
the study and analysis of the new criminal justice system.11 In the opinion of the Special 
Rapporteur, efforts to introduce a system of indicators for gauging progress in 
implementing the reform should also be stepped up. The Government has reported that the 
Technical Secretariat of the Coordinating Council for the Implementation of the Criminal 
Justice System (SETEC)12 is designing a system of indicators for use in monitoring and 
evaluating the implementation of the reform and hopes to have baseline indicators for all 
the states by late 2011.  
</p>
<p>35. Of the country&#8217;s 32 federative entities, only Baja California, Chihuahua, Durango, 
M&#233;xico, Morelos, Nuevo Le&#243;n, Oaxaca and Zacatecas have brought their justice systems 
into line with the reform. Progress at the federal level since 2008 has not been noteworthy

</p>
<p>either, as the legislature has not yet passed the corresponding amendments to the Federal 
Code of Criminal Procedure,13 organizational laws and other ordinances relating to the new 
criminal justice system or the relevant legislation on the application of criminal penalties 
and other matters.  
</p>
<p>36. Under the applicable provisions, the Government of Mexico and the governments of 
its individual states are free to decide when and how to implement the constitutional reform 
so long as they do so within the eight-year implementation period, which will come to an 
end in 2016. Nonetheless, the period of time provided for completion of the reform should 
be used by the Government of Mexico and by the federative entities to phase in the new 
system gradually, rather than to defer the actions and changes required for its 
implementation.  
</p>
<p>37. As part of this process, passage is recommended, for example, of the Judgements 
Enforcement Act, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in April 2009 and is 
now before the Senate. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Reform of the military justice system 
</b>38. In accordance with article 13 of the Constitution, offences and contraventions of 
military discipline fall within the purview of the military justice system, but military courts 
&#8220;may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, extend their jurisdiction to include 
persons who do not belong to the Army&#8221;. In addition, &#8220;when a civilian is implicated in an 
offence or contravention of military law, the case shall be heard by the corresponding civil 
authority&#8221;. This provision is clearly stated and is in line with international standards 
relating to the jurisdiction of military courts, which, by definition, is of an exceptional 
nature. 
</p>
<p>39. The wording of article 57 of the Code of Military Justice and, in particular, of 
section II (a) is a cause of concern, however, inasmuch as offences against military 
discipline are defined as including ordinary and federal offences when they are &#8220;committed 
by military personnel when on duty or as a result of acts related thereto&#8221;. As a consequence 
of this open-ended wording and the even broader way in which it has been interpreted, 
military personnel alleged to have violated the human rights of civilians have been tried in 
military courts. This is a source of serious concern at a time when military personnel are 
serving as public security forces.  
</p>
<p>40. Following the issuance by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of its 
judgement of November 2009 in the case of <i>Radilla-Pacheco v. Mexico</i>, in which it 
determined that Mexico should adopt, within a reasonable period of time, the appropriate 
legislative reforms in order to make article 57 of the Code of Military Justice compatible 
with international standards in this field,14 the federal executive branch stated that it would 
submit a bill to limit the scope of military courts&#8217; jurisdiction. During the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, two new judgements were issued by the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights in which it again called upon the State to reform the military justice system.15  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 The Government has reported that the proposed federal code of criminal procedure was approved by 
</p>
<p>the Coordinating Council on 9 December 2010.

 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, <i>Fern&#225;ndez Ortega and others v. Mexico</i>, judgement of 30 
</p>
<p>August 2010, and <i>Rosendo Cant&#250; and others v. Mexico</i>, judgement of 31 August 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>41. On 18 October 2010, the federal executive submitted a bill that would exclude only 
three offences from the jurisdiction of the military courts: enforced disappearance, torture 
and rape. Although this would certainly be a step in the right direction, a list of specific 
offences that are not subject to military jurisdiction is not satisfactory, given the exceptional 
nature of these courts&#8217; jurisdiction. Furthermore, this bill would not exclude other equally 
serious crimes and human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions, from military 
courts&#8217; jurisdiction.  
</p><p>42. In December 2010, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights again found against 
Mexico in a judgement in which the Court reiterated that the military courts were not 
competent to investigate, judge or punish alleged perpetrators of human rights violations 
and that such violations fell within the purview of the ordinary justice system. In its 
judgement, the Court added that its finding applied not only to cases of torture, enforced 
disappearance and rape, but to all human rights violations.16 The Special Rapporteur 
believes that the military justice system in Mexico should not have jurisdiction over human 
rights violations or over cases involving civilian victims.17 
</p>
<p>43. An additional concern about this bill is that it would not resolve another 
shortcoming of the current system of military justice, which is that victims or their family 
members do not have access to an effective remedy (including amparo) to contest cases 
tried by the military courts. The Special Rapporteur considers that, in addition to reforming 
the Code of Military Justice, amendments should be adopted that would provide access to 
an effective judicial remedy to persons affected by judgements issued by military courts. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Constitutional reform in the area of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>44. Under the proposed reform, which would amend 11 articles of the Constitution, the 
human rights standards set forth in international treaties would be expressly recognized in 
article 1.18 If passed, this reform would contribute to the effective protection of human 
rights, to the implementation of recommendations and judgements issued by international 
human rights organizations and to the development of the Supreme Court&#8217;s jurisprudence in 
the area of human rights. Mexico has the opportunity to foster changes in the way that the 
judicial branch functions so that its inner workings reflect the international commitments 
assumed by the State.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the constitutional reform relating to 
human rights be passed as soon as possible and that mechanisms be established for putting 
into effect the judgements of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the decisions 
and recommendations of other international and regional human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reform of the juvenile justice system 
</b>46. In 2006 an amendment to article 18 of the Constitution entered into force under 
which a special justice system for juveniles was established. Although this amendment does 
provide for an adversarial system and places emphasis on rehabilitation, the secondary

 The Supreme Court has already ruled on the ranking of treaties within the national legal system. See 
</p>
<p>Amparo Review No. 1475/98.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.11-12933 
</p>
<p>federal legislation19 appears to set aside the principles of public disclosure and of 
adversarial, oral proceedings. Consideration is being given to an approach whereby, under a 
transitional article, Congress would make the necessary changes to bring the juvenile 
justice system into line with the new adversarial criminal justice system provided for in the 
2008 constitutional reform once it has been implemented at the federal level. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur does not understand this <i>modus operandi</i>, which would 
seem to be neglecting an opportunity to make the federal juvenile justice system an 
example to be emulated rather than a transitional model based on the existing, outmoded 
system. By definition, the juvenile justice system must be a specialized one that is not 
linked to the justice system for adults. The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that 
the juvenile justice system adopt an oral and adversarial procedural model that includes all 
the protective mechanisms provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and is 
in full compliance with international standards in the area of juvenile justice.  
48. Sufficient funding must also be provided for the implementation of the 
constitutional reform relating to the juvenile justice system at all levels, particularly in 
terms of the necessary infrastructure and specialized training for the system&#8217;s staff. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Reform of amparo proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>49. Amparo proceedings, which are an institution of Mexican origin, appear to have 
become an inaccessible, slow, complicated and costly remedy that is out of the public&#8217;s 
reach. A reform is currently under discussion which, in the view of the Special Rapporteur, 
ought to afford broader access to amparo proceedings, provide for the recognition of 
legitimate interests, permit the institution of collective amparo proceedings, give general 
effect to amparo decisions under certain circumstances, and strengthen the role of this legal 
institution in protecting human rights.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur considers that Congress should pass the constitutional 
amendment concerning amparo proceedings without delay and that a new law on the 
remedy of amparo should be promulgated that is fully aligned with international human 
rights standards and that duly reflects the proposals presented by the federal judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges for the justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Escalating violence and a growing lack of public security as a result of 
organized crime 
</b></p>
<p>51. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur saw first-hand that Mexico is in crisis 
owing to the exponential increase in violent incidents, most of which are linked to 
organized crime. This situation has a direct impact on the work of judges, public 
prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers. In many cases, judges, court officials and legal 
professionals are unable to act freely or fully independently because they are faced with 
threats, intimidation, harassment and other forms of undue pressure.20 In addition, criminals 
and particularly organized crime are stepping up their efforts to infiltrate and interfere with 
judicial institutions through the use of corruption and threats. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19
 On 9 December 2010, the Joint Senate Committee on Justice, Internal Affairs and Legislative Studies 
</p>
<p>submitted a bill that would, inter alia, promulgate the Federal Juvenile Justice Act. 
 
</p>
<p>20
 During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s stay in the country, an attack at a federal court building in 
</p>
<p>Monterrey, Nuevo Le&#243;n, left one security officer wounded. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>believes that it will only be possible to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and to 
combat violence effectively if the justice system as a whole is sound, independent and 
properly shielded from threats, pressure and outside interference.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur sees the safety of judges, prosecutors and lawyers as a key 
issue. The State is responsible for ensuring their safety and to take into account the specific 
risks to which they are exposed in the course of, for example, particularly sensitive cases, 
such as those dealing with corruption, organized crime or human rights violations.21 
</p>
<p>53. In view of the above, the Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that a 
comprehensive preventive system be adopted for the protection of all justice officials at the 
federal and state levels.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur believes that widespread impunity, which has come to be 
seen as commonplace, is one of the major challenges to be faced by Mexico. Its causes 
appear to include a flawed system of crime investigation and repeated jurisdictional 
disputes between federal and state authorities which hinder the State&#8217;s efforts to mount an 
effective response. 
</p>
<p>55. In addition, a number of sources, including senior officials, have informed the 
Special Rapporteur about widespread corruption in the police force, particularly at the 
municipal and state levels, which criminal groups appear to have infiltrated to a greater 
extent. The current structure of the country&#8217;s police apparatus is not conducive to its control 
and oversight either, since 92 per cent of the country&#8217;s approximately 420,000 police 
officers work in the state and municipal forces. At the municipal level alone, there are some 
22,000 different police forces. The Federal Government is seeking to overhaul this 
apparatus by establishing a single leadership structure in each state as a means of increasing 
the professional stature of the police force and strengthening oversight and accountability. 
</p>
<p>56. Corruption is found at all levels of the justice system. Although the Government has 
introduced &#8220;confidence checks&#8221; and reviews of the finances of police officers, public 
prosecutors and the staff of other judicial bodies in an effort to address this problem, these 
measures do not appear to have been enough to eradicate corruption. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur notes that the extent of government involvement in the 
effort to combat impunity is a reflection of the extent of a State&#8217;s commitment to the full 
enjoyment of human rights.22  
</p><p>58. Steps should be taken, as a matter of urgency, to strengthen the technical and 
investigative capacity of the country&#8217;s police forces and public prosecution services and to 
provide specialized and professional training to their staff. The structure of the police force 
should also be overhauled with a view to improving oversight and the professional stature 
of its members. The system for apportioning responsibility for investigating crimes and 
prosecuting offenders between federal and state agencies needs to be clarified.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.11-12933 
</p>
<p>59. Internal oversight mechanisms also should be reinforced to ensure accountability of 
all components of the criminal justice system (police force, public prosecution services, the 
judiciary, offices of public defenders and judicial officials).  
</p>
<p><b> C. Preventive custody 
</b></p>
<p>60. Preventive custody (<i>arraigo</i>) is a precautionary measure that is used to make sure 
that a suspect remains available during the criminal investigation stage. An article 
providing for preventive custody was incorporated into the Constitution in 2008, after the 
Supreme Court had ruled that such detention was unconstitutional in 2006.23 
</p>
<p>61. The decision to provide for the use of preventive custody in the Constitution 
presumably has something to do with the Government&#8217;s need for such an instrument given 
the exceptional degree of violence in the country caused by the presence of organized 
crime. The most commonly cited rationale for preventive custody, however, is that it can be 
used in cases of flagrante delicto when the person in question has apparently been involved 
in the commission of some other offence associated with organized crime but there is not 
yet sufficient evidence to prove it. 
</p>
<p>62. In these cases, as a general rule, rather than prosecuting a person for a flagrante 
delicto offence, prosecutors prefer to have them held in preventive custody even though 
they do not have enough evidence to charge them with another more serious crime. This is 
also because prosecutors usually prefer to have such people available for questioning rather 
than having them brought before a judge.  
</p><p>63. These considerations simply confirm the arbitrary nature of preventive custody and 
its incompatibility with the principle of the presumption of innocence and the right to 
personal liberty. Cases of preventive custody were found to be a form of arbitrary detention 
by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the Human Rights Council following its 
visit to Mexico. Moreover, it was found to be inherently at variance with the oral, 
adversarial model adopted by Mexico for use in its system of criminal procedure.  
</p>
<p>64. Under the provision governing preventive custody, persons may be detained for the 
purpose of an investigation, whereas the appropriate and correct course of action would be 
to swiftly undertake an effective investigation and then proceed to make an arrest. The use 
of preventive custody is the outgrowth of a poorly functioning system for investigation and 
the administration of justice. It creates incentives that run counter to the enhancement of 
judicial authorities&#8217; investigative capacity and may be conducive to other human rights 
violations. The Special Rapporteur therefore considers that the legal institution of 
preventive custody should be expunged from Mexico&#8217;s criminal justice system.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 Article 16 of the Constitution states that: &#8220;When dealing with organized crime, the judicial authority, 
</p>
<p>at the request of the prosecutor, may order that a person be held in preventive custody in a facility and 
for a period of time as provided for by law, up to a maximum of 40 days, if such detention is 
necessary for the success of the investigation or for the protection of persons or property, or if there is 
a well-founded risk that the suspect will abscond from justice. This time period may be extended if 
the Public Prosecution Service demonstrates that the original grounds for preventive custody are still 
valid. The total period of preventive custody may not, however, exceed 80 days.&#8221; </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> V. The legal profession and the Office of the Public Defender 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The legal profession 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur found that the standards that individuals are required to 
meet in order to become members of the legal profession are not uniform and that there is 
no independent oversight mechanism for upholding the quality, integrity, ethics and good 
repute of the profession. The great majority of the lawyers with whom the Special 
Rapporteur met referred to a lack of confidence in the profession and a tendency to 
disparage it and felt that there was an urgent need for its revitalization and regulation.  
</p>
<p>66. Apart from differences in legal training, the quality of the services rendered by legal 
professionals also has to do with other factors, such as the presence of procedures for 
establishing responsibility and accountability, and with the application of strict ethical 
standards in the profession. No such structural apparatus for practitioners of the legal 
profession appears to be in place. There is therefore an urgent need to regulate the legal 
profession in order to ensure that qualified, professional representation is provided. One of 
the measures that could improve the situation would be to make membership in the bar 
association and bar certification a requirement. Another would be to require persons who 
have completed law school and who wish to practice law to complete an internship and take 
a comprehensive examination in order to obtain their law degree and qualify to exercise the 
profession.  
</p>
<p>67. Another important factor is that the great majority of lawyers, including those 
employed in the judicial branch, do not seem to routinely invoke international human rights 
law. This state of affairs clearly reflects a form of cultural resistance which can be altered 
only through the provision of a sound legal education with an international human rights 
focus.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur considers that international human rights law should be an 
obligatory part of the curricula of all law schools. 
</p>
<p>69. International human rights law should be covered in the courses that students must 
take in order to become judges or lawyers. Training in this area should not be confined to 
the early stages of a person&#8217;s career, but should instead be provided on an ongoing basis 
throughout justice officials&#8217; professional lives.  
</p><p>70. A coordinated, sustainable civic and legal education policy should also be designed 
and implemented across-the-board, not only for law students, but for the population at 
large. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Office of the Public Defender 
</b></p>
<p>71. In order to ensure that justice is administered properly, public defence attorneys 
must perform their duties in a professional and effective manner. The alignment of public 
defenders&#8217; salaries with those of public prosecutors as part of the 2008 constitutional 
reform is clearly a step forward, as is constitutional recognition of accused persons&#8217; right to 
a qualified, professional defence.24 
</p>
<p>72. The Federal Office of the Public Defender is part of the judicial branch. At the state 
level, however, the situation varies; in some states, the public defender&#8217;s office is attached 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>24
 Article 20, section B VIII, of the Constitution. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.11-12933 
</p>
<p>to the judicial branch, as in Chiapas, whereas, in others, it is part of the executive branch, as 
in Yucat&#225;n, San Luis Potos&#237;, M&#233;xico and Nuevo Le&#243;n. The autonomy and independent 
action of the public defender&#8217;s office may be hampered in states where both the public 
defender&#8217;s office and the public prosecution service are attached to the executive branch. 
There are marked differences between the situation at the state and federal levels in terms 
of the quality, effectiveness and accessibility of public defence services.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur considers that, in order to uphold the principle of equality of 
arms, offices of the public defender should be made independent of the executive branch. 
She also recommends that these offices&#8217; infrastructure should be improved by, for example, 
allocating sufficient human and financial resources and setting up autonomous investigative 
and expert services units within these offices.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Access to justice 
</b>74. Mexicans, and especially vulnerable groups and people living in marginal areas, 
generally see the justice system and judicial officials as being remote from their daily lives 
and not readily accessible.  
</p>
<p>75. The actual physical distance between the places where people live and the courts in 
some regions, a lack of infrastructure and of suitable facilities for persons with disabilities, 
and discriminatory treatment of certain groups are some of the factors that interfere with 
people&#8217;s access to justice. In the most remote areas of the country, infrastructure is 
inadequate, and victims, parties to a trial, other litigants, lawyers and public defenders have 
to travel long distances to reach the courts. The Special Rapporteur has also observed that, 
mainly at the local level, the courts have difficulty in ensuring access to persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>76. Mexico should build the capacity of its institutions and procedures for guaranteeing 
the right of disadvantaged persons and members of vulnerable groups to obtain justice. As 
part of this effort, it should also promote access to the justice system for persons living in 
remote areas of the country. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women 
</b></p>
<p>77. Although advances have been made in providing women with access to justice, 
including the promulgation of laws aimed at giving women access to a life free of violence, 
women continue to face obstacles in this respect. As a result of the unsafe situation existing 
in the country, the number of women victims has increased. Gender-based violence has also 
been on the rise, while the percentage of such cases which are solved remains very low. 
The Special Rapporteur has received information about cases of gender-based violence in 
which staff of the public prosecution service have pressured victims to drop their charges 
and resolve the situation through conciliation proceedings or mediation.  
</p>
<p>78. Judicial institutions&#8217; efforts to incorporate a gender perspective into their work have 
not yet resulted in effective gender mainstreaming across the entire range of judicial 
activity, as gender stereotypes continue to exist.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur urges judicial authorities and other officials involved in the 
administration of justice to take all necessary steps to ensure that women have full access to 
justice and, in particular, to make certain that cases of violence against women are 
effectively investigated and their perpetrators punished, as well as to mainstream a gender 
perspective in all areas of activity of the judicial system.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the legislative progress that has been made in 
improving indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice. The extent to which indigenous peoples&#8217; 
and communities&#8217; right to apply their own legal systems is recognized varies a great deal, 
however. The tendency in most local legislatures is to restrict the material jurisdiction of 
indigenous judicial authorities. In some cases, community authorities responsible for the 
administration of traditional justice are required to have formal legal training or to be 
formally appointed, and the traditional system is subordinate to the ordinary justice system. 
Difficulties in ensuring the availability of bilingual court interpreters also persist.  
</p>
<p>81. Educational media campaigns in indigenous languages designed to inform people 
about the procedures for obtaining access to the justice system need to be stepped up. In 
addition, information about the ways in which justice is administered by indigenous peoples 
and about the need to respect their legal systems should be disseminated among, inter alia, 
judicial officials.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b>82. <b>In general, the federal judiciary is independent and impartial. The Supreme 
Court has played a key role in recent years, especially in opening its door to the public 
and in promoting the reform of the country&#8217;s justice system. 
</b>83. <b>The independence, autonomy and impartiality of judicial bodies at the state 
level are being called into question, however, because of the fact that the federal 
executive takes part in the appointment of judges at that level. The linkage existing 
between superior court judges and the executive branch at the state level can seriously 
undermine the independence and autonomy of judicial bodies at the local level. 
</b>84. <b>At both the federal and state levels, with the exception of the Supreme Court, 
the independence of the judiciary is threatened by a lack of transparency and the 
impunity that this engenders, by inefficiency and corruption, and by undue influence 
and interference on the part of the public and private sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>At the federal and state levels, there are areas of judicial activity that do not fall 
within the purview of the judicial branch, such as tax, administrative, labour, military 
and agrarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The requirement that a judicial appointment be confirmed after an initial 
period has been completed, which seems to be in effect at the federal level and in 
virtually all the states, could undermine the independence of the judiciary, since the 
need to have their appointments ratified could expose judges to undue pressure and 
deprive them of the necessary impartiality. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The fact that the Public Prosecution Service is part of the executive branch 
could erode the credibility of the Service, which is supposed to take an objective 
approach to the investigation of crimes and the prosecution of accused persons, and 
could undermine people&#8217;s confidence in its ability to do so. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Successful implementation of the reform of the criminal justice system will 
hinge on political leadership and on the redoubled efforts of all the relevant 
institutions and stakeholders, as well as on economic investments and other actions 
which should be undertaken at once.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The proposal for the reform of the military justice system, as it currently 
stands, does not appear to be satisfactory. The Special Rapporteur shares and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.11-12933 
</p>
<p><b>reiterates the conclusions of a number of global and regional human rights 
organizations that have maintained that Mexico&#8217;s military courts should not have 
jurisdiction over cases involving human rights violations or cases in which the victims 
are civilians. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The human rights reform passed by Congress plays an extremely important 
part in ensuring the effective protection of the human rights of all persons by, in 
particular, contributing to the implementation of recommendations and decisions 
made by international and regional human rights organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The shortage of financial and human resources and the absence of suitable 
specialized and general training for members of the police force and of the Public 
Prosecution Service are some of the greatest challenges for the country&#8217;s justice 
system. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Preventive custody (<i>arraigo</i>) is an arbitrary measure that is incompatible with 
the principle of the presumption of innocence and the right to personal liberty. It is 
also inherently at variance with the oral, adversarial model with which Mexico has 
replaced its former semi-inquisitorial system. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Access to justice is an area in which Mexico must do more for the sake of many 
of its citizens, especially women, the indigenous population, immigrants and people 
living in poverty and in remote rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Based on the above conclusions, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
following recommendations to the Government of the United Mexican States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Steps should be taken towards the functional, organizational and 
structural unification of all judicial activity in Mexico within the judicial branch;  
 (b) An autonomous, appropriate and sufficient budget should be established 
for the effective, independent and autonomous operation of the judiciary and for the 
administration of justice; 
 (c) The bills and proposals submitted to a number of legislatures under 
which no less than 2 per cent of federal and state budgets would be allocated to the 
respective judicial branches should be considered and approved. The judiciary should 
also do more to rationalize expenditure, make its administrative activities more 
transparent, and operate more effectively and efficiently; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Consideration should be given to the use of special temporary measures 
to attain a gender balance in the judiciary, along with proper training and awareness-
raising activities so that all members of the judiciary will understand the aim and 
rationale of these special measures, and to ensure that women join the judiciary and 
are promoted within it;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The proposals for the improvement of the justice system made by the 
Supreme Court in its white paper and within the framework of State reforms should 
be examined and taken into account; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) <i>Appointment of judges and their terms in office</i>. The necessary steps, 
including structural and legislative changes, should be taken to ensure that the 
members of the judiciary at the state level are fully independent of the corresponding 
executive branch; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) A system for the entire judiciary in which the appointment, promotion 
and removal of judges are based on objective criteria should be fully established. 
Competitive selection mechanisms should be used throughout the country so that the 
best possible professionals can be selected on the basis of objective, transparent 
criteria that incorporate a gender perspective;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Judges should be given security of tenure once they have been appointed 
on the basis of a competitive selection process and their appointments should be made 
permanent. If a probationary period is to be established, it should be short and no 
extensions should be permitted. Once this period is over and the candidates&#8217; 
performance has been judged to be satisfactory, they should be given permanent 
appointments, although this does not mean that judges may not be required to attend 
refresher courses or pass in-service proficiency examinations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) <i>Council of the Judiciary</i>. The Council of the Judiciary should be presided 
over by someone other than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who has 
important, full-time duties to discharge. There should also be a balanced 
representation of men and women who are knowledgeable about gender issues; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) In view of the fact that the decisions of the Council of the Judiciary are 
final and cannot be contested, and that there is therefore no judicial or other appeal 
against such decisions (unless they refer to the appointment, assignment, confirmation 
or removal of federal judges, which can be reviewed by the Supreme Court, or to the 
removal of judges at the state level), the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
provision be made for another independent judicial body to review disciplinary and 
administrative decisions, whether taken at the federal or state level, which have an 
impact on the status of judges;  
 (k) A national council should be established within the judiciary to 
coordinate the work of the councils of the judiciary; 
 (l) <i>Public Prosecution Service</i>. Consideration should be given to the 
proposals that have been put forward for making the Public Prosecution Service 
genuinely autonomous from the executive branch; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) In order to ensure effective oversight of public prosecution services, their 
transparency must be enhanced and the system for ensuring their accountability must 
be improved through, inter alia, the work of internal oversight bodies. The process 
involved in converting the country&#8217;s public prosecution services into autonomous 
bodies should be coupled with their rationalization and reorganization; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) <i>Constitutional reform of the criminal justice system</i>. The broad-based 
political consensus that paved the way for the passage of this reform is now in urgent 
need of the support, in word and deed, of the authorities at the highest level in order 
to backstop, advocate and accelerate the reform&#8217;s implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) Efforts should be made to radically alter the attitude of court officials 
and legal professionals towards the new criminal justice system, to encourage them to 
embrace it, and to dispel doubts and misconceptions about the new system&#8217;s nature 
and effectiveness. Law school curricula should be reoriented towards the new criminal 
justice system. A system of indicators for gauging progress in implementing the 
reform should be introduced without delay; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) The period of time provided for completion of the reform should be used 
by the Government of Mexico and by the federative entities to phase in the new 
system gradually, rather than to defer the actions and changes required for its 
implementation; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.11-12933 
</p>
<p><b> (q) In order to provide effective access to justice, mechanisms should be 
established to ensure prompt and full execution of judicial decisions and compliance 
with them. The bill on the enforcement of judgements which was approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies in April 2009 and is currently under consideration by the Senate 
should be passed as soon as possible; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (r) <i>The military justice system</i>. In addition to reforming the Code of Military 
Justice, persons affected by judgements issued by military courts should have an 
effective judicial remedy for contesting or challenging them; 
 (s) <i>Constitutional reform in the area of human rights</i>. This reform should 
enter into force as soon as possible. In addition, consideration should be given to the 
establishment of mechanisms for facilitating the implementation in Mexico of 
judgements of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the decisions and 
recommendations of other international and regional human rights bodies;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (t) <i>The juvenile justice system</i>. The juvenile justice system should 
immediately adopt an oral, adversarial procedural model that includes all the 
protective mechanisms provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
is in full compliance with international standards in the area of juvenile justice; 
 (u) Implementation of the constitutional reform relating to the juvenile 
justice system at all levels requires, as a matter of urgency, that sufficient funding be 
provided for the necessary infrastructure and specialized training for the system&#8217;s 
staff; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (v) <i>Reform of amparo proceedings</i>. Mexico should facilitate access to amparo 
proceedings, which are an institution of Mexican origin. It should provide for the 
recognition of legitimate interests, permit collective amparo proceedings, give general 
effect to amparo decisions under certain circumstances and strengthen the protection 
afforded by this legal institution for human rights that are recognized in international 
instruments; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (w) The constitutional reform bill relating to amparo that was passed by 
Congress and is awaiting ratification by the state legislatures should be approved 
without delay, and a new law on the remedy of amparo should be promulgated that is 
fully aligned with international human right standards and that duly reflects the 
proposals presented by the federal judiciary;  
 (x) <i>Challenges for the justice system</i>. A comprehensive preventive system 
should be adopted for the protection, as a matter of urgency, of all justice officials, 
judges, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders at the federal and state levels; 
 (y) Steps should be taken on an urgent basis to strengthen the technical and 
investigative capacity of the country&#8217;s police forces and public prosecution services 
and to provide specialized and professional training to their staff. The structure of the 
police force should also be overhauled with a view to improving oversight and the 
professional stature of its members; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (z) The system for apportioning responsibility and jurisdiction over the 
investigation of crimes and the prosecution of offenders between federal and state 
agencies should be clarified; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (aa) The Special Rapporteur considers that internal oversight mechanisms 
should be refined in order to ensure the accountability of all components of the 
criminal justice system (police force, public prosecution services, the judiciary, offices 
of public defenders and judicial officials); </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-12933 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (bb) The institution of preventive custody (<i>arraigo</i>) should be expunged from 
Mexico&#8217;s criminal justice system; 
 (cc) <i>The legal profession and public defenders</i>. The regulation of members of 
the legal profession is urgently needed in order to ensure that qualified, professional 
representation is provided. One of the measures that could improve the situation 
would be to make membership in the bar association and bar certification a 
requirement. Another would be to require persons who have completed law school 
and who wish to practice law to complete an internship and take a comprehensive 
examination in order to obtain their law degree; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (dd) International human rights law should be an obligatory part of the 
curricula of all law schools; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (ee) International human rights law should be covered in the courses that 
students must take in order to become judges or lawyers. Training in this area should 
not be confined to the early stages of a person&#8217;s career, but should instead be provided 
on an ongoing basis throughout justice officials&#8217; professional lives; 
 (ff) A coordinated, sustainable civic and legal education policy should also be 
designed and implemented across-the-board for law students and for the population 
at large;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (gg) In order to uphold the principle of equality of arms within the criminal 
justice system, offices of the public defender should be independent of the executive 
branch. Such offices&#8217; infrastructure should also be improved by, for example, 
allocating sufficient human and financial resources and setting up autonomous 
investigative and expert services units within these offices; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (hh) <i>Access to justice</i>. Mexico should build the capacity of its institutions and 
procedures for guaranteeing the right of disadvantaged persons and members of 
vulnerable groups to obtain justice. It should promote access to justice in remote areas 
of the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) Judicial authorities and other officials involved in the administration of 
justice should take all necessary steps to ensure that women have full access to justice 
and, in particular, to make certain that cases of violence against women are effectively 
investigated and their perpetrators punished, as well as to mainstream a gender 
perspective in all areas of activity of the judicial system; 
 (jj) Educational media campaigns in indigenous languages designed to 
inform people about the procedures for obtaining access to justice should be stepped 
up;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (kk) Information about the ways in which justice is administered by 
indigenous peoples and about the need to respect their justice systems should be 
disseminated among judicial officials and the public at large. 
</b></p>
