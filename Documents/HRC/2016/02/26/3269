<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of Ireland was held at the 7th meeting on 6 
October 2011. The delegation of Ireland was headed by Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice 
and Equality. At its 11th meeting held on 10 October 2011, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Ireland.  
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Ireland: Bangladesh, Italy and the Republic of 
Moldova. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Ireland: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">7. Egypt noted the efforts exerted to ensure the promotion and protection of human 
rights, including economic, social and cultural rights. Egypt pointed out that more needed 
to be done in the area of addressing the rights of migrants, combating racial discrimination 
and racial profiling. Egypt expressed concern about the de facto religious discrimination in 
access to education. Egypt made recommendations.  </footnote>/12/IRL/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">6. Estonia encouraged Ireland to continue its efforts to launch a national action plan on 
the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) as indicated in the national 
report. Estonia made a recommendation. 
</footnote>/12/IRL/2 and Corr.<footnote name="1">00. Honduras acknowleged that Ireland had ratified most of the main international 
instruments and that it has extended a standing invitation to the Human Rights Council 
special procedures. While noting the efforts of Ireland to eliminate racial discrimination, 
Honduras expressed concern at reports of racial profiling by police. Honduras inquired 
about the intentions of Ireland with regard to a National Action Plan and to ratification of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Honduras made a 
recommendation.  
</footnote>); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">5. Ghana noted that Ireland had put in place measures to address inequalities, such as 
gender equality policies to foster the advancement of women in all facets of life. Ghana 
also noted that the national report refers to the commitment of Ireland to eliminate all forms 
of racial discrimination. Ghana requested further information on the impact of the National 
Action Plan Against Racism for the period 2005-2008 developed by Ireland as a follow-up 
to the Durban anti-racism conference. Ghana made recommendations.  
</footnote>/12/IRL/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Ireland through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Ireland indicated its fullest commitment to the UPR process and intention to pay 
fullest attention to the recommendations of the Human Rights Council.  The valuable 
contribution of the Human Rights Commission to the compilation of the stakeholders&#8217; 
</p>
<p>submission was recognized, as was the role of consultation with civil society, including the 
Trade Union movement in Ireland, in preparation of the National Report. 
</p>
<p>6. A public forum for civil society organized by the Department of Foreign Affairs was 
held in December 2010. The Department of Justice followed up with a series of seven 
public meetings throughout Ireland. The Government welcomed the consultations held by 
various civil society actors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the 
consultations held by the Irish Human Rights Commission. All of these initiatives have led 
to a very high level of public awareness of the UPR mechanism in Ireland. 
</p>
<p>7. The State party has set out the following commitments as part of the UPR process: a 
Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes against Children and Vulnerable 
Adults) Bill and a National Vetting Bureau Bill were presently being prepared and would 
be presented to Parliament as soon as possible and revised Children First guidelines would 
be placed on a statutory basis. Ireland will shortly be in a position to ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. Mental capacity legislation for ratification of the </p>


<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was progressing. Ireland hoped to 
sign the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights before the end of 2011. The reservation of Ireland to Article 19.2 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, concerning the licensing of broadcasting 
enterprises, will be withdrawn. The Government was committed to developing a system of 
universal health care. The Government was committed to reducing the time taken to 
process applications for citizenship to an average of six months.  In regard to immigration 
and asylum matters generally, steps were being taken to reduce unacceptable delays in parts 
of the system.  Legislation was before Parliament which would simplify procedures so that 
decisions on asylum, protection and immigration could be taken speedily and in a 
transparent manner. 
</p>
<p>8. Legislation was being prepared to enable ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. Legislation was before Parliament to outlaw the practice of 
female genital mutilation. Ireland was also committed to ratification of the Aarhus 
Convention. Ireland was committed to reviewing family law and the law on domestic 
violence. 
</p>
<p>9. Ireland emphasized that its commitment to human rights was based on the principle 
that governments must always act with the intention of respecting the rights of the 
individual and human dignity. 
</p>
<p>10.  It reiterated that it was never acceptable for any government to treat national or 
religious or ethnic minorities as inferior; or to discriminate against women generally or gay 
men or gay women; or to discriminate against children and to fail to recognize their 
vulnerability; or to exclude disabled persons from inclusion; or to repress freedom of 
expression because it feared or disagreed with the speaker&#8217;s opinion, except where such 
opinion constitutes incitement to hatred.  
</p>
<p>11. On the question of human rights, there was no room for moral relativism or 
selectivity &#8211; respect for dignity and human rights that secured that bedrock value was the 
incontestable baseline of decent politics everywhere. It was also crucial that States which 
ask human rights questions of others stand on a sound and honest foundation of protecting 
the human rights of their own citizens. This was crucial to ensure that credibility attaches to 
questions put to others and so that they are not simply perceived as opportunistic political 
positioning on the chessboard of international politics. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government&#8217;s concern about the welfare of the most vulnerable in society, 
children, had led to a commitment to reorganize the business of Government so as to create 
a separate government department with sole responsibility for children and young people.  
</p>
<p>13. The national minimum wage, which had been reduced, has been restored. 
</p>
<p>14. Ireland&#8217;s population was growing and becoming more diverse &#8211; about 15 per cent of 
those living in Ireland were non-citizens, most of whom had come to Ireland in the last 
decade. Strategies were in place in health, education and other sectors to promote 
integration and combat racism.  
</p>
<p>15. While there was no room for complacency, Ireland had not experienced the anti-
immigrant campaigns which had occurred in other countries or the rise in so called hate 
crime, targeting minorities. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government was developing proposals for a Constitutional Convention which 
would review the current Constitution, adopted in 1937. 
</p>
<p>17. The present Constitution contained explicit guarantees in respect of certain 
fundamental rights and other fundamental rights had been identified by the Courts as being 
provided for in the Constitution. </p>


<p>18. A referendum dealing with the rights of children will be held early in the New Year. 
</p>
<p>19. Subsequent to the submission of the national report, the Government published a 
Commission of Investigation report into the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government decided, following consideration of the Commission report, to take 
the measures set out below. 
</p>
<p>21. A Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and 
Vulnerable Adults) Bill and a National Vetting Bureau Bill, to provide a statutory basis for 
vetting of applicants for employment and employees working with children, were being 
drafted and would be presented in final form to Parliament as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>22. It was intended to place a statutory obligation on every organization working with 
children to protect and safeguard those children when in their care &#8211; including statutory, 
private, community and voluntary organizations. 
</p>
<p>23. Legislation to enable ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography is at an 
advanced stage of preparation. 
</p>
<p>24. A Department of Children and Youth Affairs had been established. Work on 
creating a stand-alone agency to deal with child protection issues has started. 
</p>
<p>25. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will oversee an implementation 
framework for each government department and sector working with children. The 
framework will have a strong emphasis on inspection and the need to provide demonstrable 
evidence that the guidelines are being properly implemented across all sectors. 
</p>
<p>26. In the case of the health sector, the remit of the Health Information and Quality 
Authority was being extended to include oversight of the Health Service Executive's Child 
Protection Services. 
</p>
<p>27. Ireland had a dualist system under which international agreements to which Ireland 
becomes a party do not become a part of domestic law unless so determined by Parliament 
through legislation. 
</p>
<p>28. While treaty committees have recommended that the Conventions which they 
variously monitor should be incorporated into domestic Irish law, it was not intended to 
alter current practice.  
</p>
<p>29. Work on the preparation of the necessary Mental Capacity Bill to allow ratification 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was proceeding.  A revised 
strategy for housing for people with disabilities had been launched. 
</p>
<p>30. The Minister for Disabilities had reviewed arrangements for monitoring 
implementation of the national disability strategy. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government attached great importance to having accessible, affordable 
arrangements in place in order that those whose rights have been infringed can vindicate 
their rights, especially the most vulnerable in society. 
</p>
<p>32. Publication of a Legal Services Bill which will provide greater transparency to the 
calculation of legal costs, provide alternative structures for the delivery of legal services 
and protect consumer rights had been announced. Enactment of the Bill should effect a 
reduction in legal costs, of benefit to those most in need of affordable legal services. 
</p>
<p>33. Rationalization of the number of State bodies in the area of employment protection 
will ensure that one agency will deal with all complaints, and thereby that people can 
access processes to vindicate their rights. </p>


<p>34. The Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority will be merged to 
form a new strengthened and enhanced Human Rights and Equality Commission. 
</p>
<p>35. The new body will fully comply with the Paris Principles and the State party is 
confident that the International Coordinating Committee will be able to grant &#8220;A&#8221; status to 
this new body. 
</p>
<p>36. Funding will be provided to enable the new Human Rights and Equality 
Commission to function effectively and independently in accordance with the Paris 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>37. Currently, unemployment stood at a little over 14 per cent.  This was a great 
challenge.  The Government had introduced some measures designed to allow people to 
improve their skills or to find employment and had encouraged unemployed people to 
return to education. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition, the State Work Training Agency had been reorganized and refocused to 
improve and make the training provided more relevant. 
</p>
<p>39. On matters related to prisons, the<b> </b>Criminal Justice (Community Service) 
(Amendment) Act 2011<b> </b>introduced<b> </b>a requirement on judges when considering the 
imposition of a sentence of twelve months&#8217; imprisonment or less, to first consider the 
alternative sanction of community service. 
</p>
<p>40. Particular concern was expressed by the Committee against Torture on a proposed 
large-scale prison building project.  The State party had appointed an expert group, which 
had reported that smaller units of accommodation would be sufficient for needs and would 
meet the objective of ensuring that the prisoners had hygienic, in-cell sanitation facilities. 
</p>
<p>41. The Irish Government remains committed to protecting the position of the most 
vulnerable in society.  A core principle of the social protection system is that both nationals 
and non-nationals can access it equally. The habitual residence condition was however, 
applied to both Irish and non-Irish applicants. 
</p>
<p>42, The State party reported that, in the last month, some form of supplementary welfare 
payments had been made to 115,000 non-Irish nationals. In addition, child benefit payments 
had been made to the non-Irish parents of over 215,000 children.  About 20 per cent of 
those aged 18 or under living in Ireland are the children of non-Irish parents. 
</p>
<p>43. The Government was committed to developing a system of universal health care 
where treatment would be provided on the basis of assessed medical need rather than ability 
to pay.  This was a radical change and would take time to put in place.  The driving force 
behind these changes was the improvement of services for patients. 
</p>
<p>44. A study published last year revealed lower life expectancy and other areas of 
concern, such as a higher suicide rate than in the rest of the population, amongst Travellers. 
</p>
<p>45. To tackle these concerns, national and regional fora had been established, with 
Traveller participation, to advise on how services could best be delivered and also advise on 
implementation of the national intercultural health strategy as it affected Travellers. 
</p>
<p>46. Despite the national constraints, Ireland was determined to maintain efforts to help 
the poorest people and communities in Africa and elsewhere. This year, Ireland had 
provided &#8364;<footnote name="6">4. Norway commended the work of the Government of Ireland on the report as well as 
the active involvement of Irish civil society in the UPR process. Norway noted the low 
living standards in many Irish prisons and enquired about measures taken in this regard. 
Norway expressed concern at the issue related to employees of an Irish airline company 
who were prevented from engaging in trade union membership in order to get better 
working conditions. Norway made recommendations.  
</footnote>59 million in aid for programmes in some of the poorest regions in the world. 
</p>

<p>48. Support was being provided to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, to a wide range of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working on human 
rights issues, and to national human rights institutions in a number of developing countries. 
</p>
<p>49. Ireland believed that without a strong culture of human rights and good governance, 
long-term sustainable development was not possible. 
</p>
<p>50. Ireland was committed to expeditious implementation of the European Court of 
Human Rights judgement in the A, B and C v Ireland case and an expert group would be 
appointed in November, drawing on appropriate medical and legal expertise, with a view to 
making recommendations to Government on how this matter should be best addressed. 
</p>
<p>51. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe had noted the action plan 
submitted by the Government and would discuss the matter in March 2012. 
</p>
<p>52. On citizenship matters, the Minister of Justice and Equality had introduced the new 
modification in the process to reduce the length of time and the new formal arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>53. During the interactive dialogue, 49 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>54. Sri Lanka took particular note of the legislative action taken by Ireland to safeguard 
employment rights, and health and safety standards in the workplace, and to prohibit 
discrimination based on gender, race, disability and religious belief.  It commended Ireland 
for the provision of free pre-school, primary and post-primary education for the majority of 
students.  It requested it to undertake adequate safeguards to ensure that responses to 
financial and economic crises do not lead to a situation which will give rise to racism, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against foreigners, immigrants and persons belonging to 
minorities. Sri Lanka made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Cambodia welcomed the step taken by the Government of Ireland to approve the 
preparation of legislation to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
and appreciated Ireland&#8217;s commitment by extending a standing invitation to all United 
Nations human rights special procedures. Cambodia was encouraged by the commitment of 
Ireland to implement policies, programmes and legislation that aim at promoting and 
protecting its citizens&#8217; rights, including its commitment to review the law on domestic 
violence. Cambodia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Algeria commended Ireland for ratifying most of the international human rights 
instruments and on its efforts in combating domestic violence by developing a framework 
to prevent and respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Algeria expressed 
concern at the overlapping of several human rights bodies dealing with complaints, 
monitoring and inspection such as those referred to in Section III (B) of the national report 
and inquired about the coordination between these various bodies. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. France recalled that Ireland had not yet ratified the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and inquired about the obstacles to this ratification. France noted 
that women continue to be underrepresented in public and political life, and inquired about 
the legislative measures Ireland intended to take in this regard. France also inquired about 
Ireland&#8217;s  intention to implement the European Court of Human Rights decision A, B and C 
vs. Ireland relating to abortion. France made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>Children, including through the creation of a National Action Plan. Ireland has made 
progress in protecting the rights of persons with disabilities through, inter alia, passage of 
the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004, and the 
Health Act 2007. Canada made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>59. The Republic of Moldova commended Ireland for, inter alia, upholding a standing 
invitation for human rights special procedures, establishing mechanisms for the protection 
of human rights such as the Human Rights Commission, which was accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; 
status.  It welcomed progress in fostering the advancement of women in all areas and 
acknowledged Ireland&#8217;s efforts to combat domestic violence against women.  The Republic 
of Moldova made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. Greece noted that the new Government intended to convene a Constitutional 
Convention to consider the need for comprehensive constitutional reform with an emphasis 
on human rights and asked how the Government envisaged the participation of different 
stakeholders in this process and whether it would put forward its proposals. Greece inquired 
about the changes that the constitutional referendum would bring to the rights of the child.  
Finally it requested further information on the development of human rights after decades 
of violence and the Good Friday Agreement. Greece made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>61. The Czech Republic appreciated the draft legislation before the Irish parliament on 
simplification of procedures for asylum and immigration, but remained concerned at Irish 
immigration policy. The Czech Republic noted that Travellers continue to suffer 
discrimination. The Czech Republic made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>62. Turkey noted reports that the education system in Ireland was still mainly dominated 
by the Catholic Church. It referred to reports on the abuse of children while in institutional 
care, including acts that amounted to torture and degrading treatment. Turkey asked for an 
evaluation by Ireland on these situations, and comments on those reports. Turkey made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Iraq noted that Ireland had extended a standing invitation to Human Rights Council 
special procedures and that it was paying particular attention to the rights of elderly people. 
Iraq made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>68. Australia noted the announcement by Ireland of the formation of a new institution, 
the Human Rights and Equality Commission, by merging the two existing entities. 
Australia noted that Ireland considered it a priority to hold a referendum on children&#8217;s 
rights with a view to incorporating those rights in the Constitution. Australia commended 
the Government&#8217;s commitment to promptly ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities. Australia noted problems in relation to prison accommodation and 
encouraged Ireland to bring conditions for detainees in line with international standards.  
Australia made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. Portugal commended Ireland for the broad consultative process in drafting the 
national report, including the creation of a dedicated user-friendly website, and considered 
that this practice should be followed.  Portugal requested further information on the 
implementation of article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Portugal 
welcomed Ireland&#8217;s proposal to increase women&#8217;s participation in public life and inquired 
</p>
<p>as to how Ireland was considering addressing the existing gender pay gap. Portugal made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Ireland will hold a referendum on the rights of the child in 2012. Preparatory work is 
already under way.  A new government department has been established to address issues 
relating to children. The Government is also preparing legislation to facilitate the 
establishment of a Child Protection Agency.  The delegation noted that independence of the 
new Human Rights and Equality Commission will be enhanced by the strengthening of 
arrangements for it to report to the Oireachtas.   It will have an important role to play in the 
advancement of human rights across the island of Ireland, and will continue to work with 
the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in that regard.  In relation to the issue of 
racism, the delegation recalled that Ireland has a strong statutory framework, which 
prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race. The Constitution also contains a provision 
guaranteeing freedom of religion.  Regarding the issue of abortion, the delegation explained 
that Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution guarantees the right to life of the unborn child with 
due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.  The judgement of the European Court of 
Human Rights confirmed that Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution is in conformity with the 
European Convention on Human Rights. The Court accepted that Article 40.3.3 of the Irish 
Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in another case, the &#8220;X Case&#8221;, provides 
</p>
<p>that it is lawful to terminate a pregnancy in Ireland if it is established as a matter of 
probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of 
the mother which can only be avoided by a termination of the pregnancy. This has not been 
altered by the judgement of the European Court on Human Rights.  The delegation noted 
that the judgement of the European Court on Human Rights highlights the lack of effective 
and accessible rules in relation to the application of Article 30.3.3. In response to this 
judgement the Government will establish an expert group with a view to making 
recommendations to the Government on how this matter should be properly addressed. It is 
intended that the Expert Group will be established in November 2011.  Regarding prisons, 
the delegation noted that all new prison spaces will have in-cell sanitation. The Government 
has recently implemented alternatives to custodial measures and further measures are being 
pursued. The delegation recalled that legislation prohibits discrimination against Travellers. 
In relation to recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group, the delegation indicated that 
serious consideration is being given to the question.  
</p>
<p>71. The United States of America commended Ireland for establishing a Commission of 
Investigation to examine the clerical sexual abuse of minors and assigning child protection 
matters to a stand-alone government agency. It encouraged Ireland to carry out a 
transparent and thorough investigation, commended its efforts to combat gender inequality 
in the workplace and welcomed the committed review of its laws against domestic 
violence. The United States of America made a recommendation. </p>


<p>72. Slovenia commended Ireland for the all-inclusive process prior to reporting to the 
Working Group. Slovenia welcomed the Government&#8217;s decision to establish an expert 
group, drawing on appropriate medical and legal expertise to address the European Court of 
Human Rights judgement on the right to a termination of pregnancy in certain cases. 
Slovenia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>73. Timor-Leste welcomed the pledges made by Ireland to improve prison conditions 
and looked forward to their realization. Timor-Leste noted that Ireland, through the 
enactment of the Criminal Justice Act in 2006, had lowered the age of criminal 
responsibility from 12 to 10 years for serious crimes, and requested clarifications on the 
rationale behind these changes.  Timor-Leste made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>74. Uruguay noted the efforts made by Ireland to protect the rights of separated and 
unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, but deplored the fact that laws do not offer 
protection according to the guidelines developed by UNHCR. Uruguay noted that 
prohibition of corporal punishment is being reviewed, but is still not punishable by law. 
Uruguay made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>75. Chile welcomed the important list of rights recognized in the Constitution as well as 
the development of the institutional framework of protection, which includes, inter alia, the 
Irish Commission of Human Rights, a variety of ombudsmen in the field of children&#8217;s 
rights, access to information, freedom of the Press, health and financial services. Chile 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Argentina paid tribute to Ireland for establishing a Ministry for Integration, tasked 
with the responsibility for shaping public policies in this field. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Switzerland noted that Irish legislation prohibits discrimination against employees; 
nevertheless certain medical, religious and educational institutions are entitled to turn down 
application forms from homosexual and unmarried people. Switzerland expressed concern 
at the situation in Irish prisons, particularly overcrowding and detention conditions. 
Switzerland pointed out that the mandate of the recently established Prison Inspector was 
insufficient. Switzerland expressed concerns at the ongoing level of violence against 
women. Switzerland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>78. Hungary commended Ireland for its financial contribution to OHCHR. Hungary 
expressed concerns at prison conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitation and 
health care.  Hungary congratulated Ireland on the unprecedented improvement concerning 
participation in higher education in recent decades. Hungary made recommendations.

Bill in 2012.  In relation to comments about inter-prisoner violence the delegation rejected 
the assertion that the issue was particularly bad in Irish prisons. The delegation noted that 
Ireland has a comprehensive social protection infrastructure. The National Action Plan for 
Social Inclusion 2007-2016 demonstrates the Government&#8217;s commitment to combating 
poverty and building an inclusive society.  The Government is aware of the difficulties 
which have arisen with regards to what have been termed &#8220;sham marriages&#8221;. An Garda

from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. Romania made a recommendation.  
</p>

Discrimination regarding increased discrimination, particularly vis-&#224;-vis persons of African 
origin and the lack of legislation preventing racial profiling by the police and other law 
enforcement bodies. Uzbekistan further noted that the persistence of unsatisfactory 
conditions in Irish prisons was of great concern, especially overcrowding, problematic 
sanitary conditions and violence amongst inmates. Uzbekistan made recommendations.   
</p>

X case and later judgements of the European Court regarding abortion in limited 
circumstances. Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Slovakia commended Ireland for its open and constructive participation in the 
universal periodic review and noted the broad consultation process for the preparation of

made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>96. Indonesia noted the positive efforts of the Government of Ireland to provide a 
framework and safeguards for the protection of civil, political, economic and cultural rights </p>


<p>for all people in Ireland. In particular, Indonesia commended the guarantee of the right to

budget for health care and education. Indonesia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>97. Pakistan noted the resolve of the Government of Ireland to provide better education 
and health services to the Traveller community. Pakistan mentioned that in 2011 the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had noted with regret that the 
economic recession was likely to threaten the ongoing efforts of the Government to combat 
racial discrimination due to disproportionate budget cuts to those mechanisms dealing with 
the anti-racism agenda. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>98. Malaysia noted with concern the increase in complaints of discrimination against 
minority groups including Muslims.  Instances of racial profiling of non-Irish persons by

diversity and tolerance of other faiths and beliefs. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>99. Azerbaijan noted that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination

also expressed concern at the lack of legislation proscribing racial profiling by the Garda 
S&#236;och&#224;na (Police) and other law enforcement personnel. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations.

children. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>

S&#237;och&#225;na does not engage in, or carry out, this practice.  The delegation noted that the 
Government maintains an ongoing dialogue and engagement with all faith and non-faith 
groups.  Discrimination on religious grounds is prohibited.  Freedom of assembly and 
freedom of expression are guaranteed by the Constitution and fully respected by the 
Government.  These freedoms include the right to partake in demonstrations and to 
participate in the political process.  The delegation recalled that Irish legislation provides 
strong protection against religious discrimination and incitement to hatred, including 
Islamophobia. &#8220;Hate speech&#8221; can be criminally prosecuted through the Irish Courts. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Ireland thanked all delegations for their contributions to the interactive 
dialogue, and welcomed the constructive spirit in which recommendations were given.
