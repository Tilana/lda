A brief explanation of any of the figures in 2.1 to 2.4 necessary to enable the figures 
to be understood.
-  Due to Australian Accounting Standards, the reverse acquisition that occurred 
resulted in IOT Group Limited (Formally Ardent Resources Limited), the legal 
parent, being treated as the accounting subsidiary. As a result. IOT Pty Ltd, the 
legal subsidiary, has been treated as the accounting parent. Therefore, 
comparative figures of OK IOT Pty Ltd have been used for comparison purposes 
which had no operating activity prior to 1 July 2015.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
NOTE 1. 
 
Basis of Preparation    
These  general  purpose  interim  financial  statements  for  the  half-year  reporting  period  ended  30  June  2016 
have been prepared in accordance with requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting 
Standard  AASB  134:    Interim  Financial  Reporting.  The  Group  is  a  for-profit  entity  for  financial  reporting 
purposes under Australian Accounting Standards. 
 
The  interim  financial  report  is  intended  to  provide  users  with  an  update  on  the  latest  annual  financial 
statements of IOT Group Limited (formally Ardent Resources Limited) and its controlled entities (referred to as 
the “consolidated group” or “group”). Subsequent to the release of the Annual Financial Reports of IOT Group 
Limited (formally Ardent Resources Limited) significant changes in operations have occurred. As a result, the 
new accounting policies of the group have been summarised as follows.  
 
Accounting Policies 
Due to the reverse acquisition, new accounting policies and methods have been used and are included below. 
 
Comparative Figures 
When  required  by  Accounting  Standards,  comparative  figures  have  been  adjusted  to  conform to changes  in 
presentation for the current financial year. 
 
Where  the  Group  retrospectively  applies  an  accounting  policy,  makes  a  retrospective  restatement  or 
reclassifies  items  in  its  financial  statements,  an  additional  (third)  statement  of  financial  position  as  at  the 
beginning of the preceding period in addition to the minimum comparative financial statements is presented. 
 
Reverse Acquisition 
On 18 March 2016, the company, formerly named Ardent Resources Limited, completed the 100% acquisition 
of  OK  IOT  Group  Pty  Ltd.  As  a  result  of  this  acquisition  Ardent  Resources  Limited  changed  its  name  to  IOT 
Group Limited. The acquisition of OK IOT Group Pty Ltd resulted in the shareholders of OK IOT Group Pty Ltd 
obtaining  control  of  the  merged  entity.  In  addition,  the  board  of  directors  of  the  merged  entity  was 
restructured and the OK IOT Group Pty Ltd management team has assumed responsibility for the management 
of the merged entity. Consequently, the acquisition has been accounted for with reference to the guidance for 
reverse acquisitions set out in AASB 3 “Business Combinations”. 
 
The  application  of  the  reverse  acquisition  guidance  contained  in  AASB  3  has  resulted  in  IOT  Group  Limited 
(formerly Ardent Resources Ltd) (the legal parent) being accounted for as the subsidiary and OK IOT Group Pty 
Ltd (the legal subsidiary) being accounted for as the parent entity. 
 
The  acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  using  the  principles  set  out  in  AASB  3  “Business  Combinations” 
whereby  OK  IOT  Group  Pty  Ltd  is  deemed  to  have  issued  shares  in  exchange  for  the  net  assets  and  listing 
status of IOT Group Limited. In accordance with AASB 3, the difference between the fair value of the deemed 
consideration  paid  by  OK  IOT  Group  Pty  Ltd  and  the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  net  assets  of  IOT  Group 
Limited, has been recognised as goodwill of $1,587,745 as set out in Note 3. 
 
Given  OK  IOT  Group  Pty  Ltd  is  considered  to  be  the  parent  of  the  group  for  accounting  purposes,  the 
consolidated  financial  statements  represent  a  continuation  of  the  financial  statements  of  OK  IOT  Group  Pty

Ltd, with the exception of the capital structure. The results for the half year ended 30 June 2016 comprise the 
results  of  OK  IOT  Group  Pty  Ltd  for  the  full  year  and  the  results  of  IOT  Group  Limited  subsequent  to  the 
completion of the acquisition. 
 
The comparative information is that of OK IOT Group Pty Ltd. OK IOT Group Pty Ltd incorporated on the 4th of 
May  2015  and  had  no  activity  prior  to  1  July  2015.  Therefore,  there  is  no  comparative  information  for  the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
 
The impact of the group restructure on each of the primary statements is as follows: 
 
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income 
 
  The 2016 consolidated statements comprise 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2016 OK IOT Group Pty Ltd and 18th
March 2016 to 30 June 2016 of IOT Group Limited (formally Ardent Resources Limited).

statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

stated in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and consolidated 
statement of financial position.
  No comparative information as OK IOT Group Pty Ltd did not have any activity prior to 1 July 2015. 
 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate all of the assets, liabilities and results of the parent and all of the 
subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities the parent controls. The parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or 
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. A list of the subsidiaries is provided in Note 8. 
 
The assets, liabilities and results of all subsidiaries are fully consolidated into the financial statements of the Group 
from the date on which control is obtained by the Group. The consolidation of a subsidiary is discontinued from the 
date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions 
between group entities are fully eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
changed and adjustments made where necessary to ensure uniformity of the accounting policies adopted by the 
Group. 
 
Business Combinations 
Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses and results in the 
consolidation of its assets and liabilities.
A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving 
entities or businesses under common control. The business combination will be accounted for from the date that 
control is attained, whereby the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities) assumed are recognised. 
 
When measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination, any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement is also included. Subsequent to initial recognition, contingent consideration 
classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability is remeasured each reporting period to fair value, recognising any 
change to fair value in profit or loss, unless the change in value can be identified as existing at acquisition date.
All transaction costs incurred in relation to the business combination other than those associated with the issue of 
a financial instrument are recognised as expenses in profit or loss when incurred.
The acquisition of a business may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. 
 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the sum 
of:
i. 
ii.
iii.
The consideration transferred; 
Any non-controlling interest (determined under either the full goodwill or proportionate interest method); 
and 
The acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest;
over the acquisition date fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. 
 
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination plus the acquisition date 
fair value of any previously held equity interest shall form the cost of the investment in the separate financial 
statements. 
 
Fair value remeasurements in any pre-existing equity holdings are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which 
they arise. Where changes in the value of such equity holdings had previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income, such amounts are recycled to profit or loss. 
 
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is 
included in investments in associates. 
 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units or a group of cash-
generating units, representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored being not larger than an operating 
segment. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity 
disposed of.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Changes in the ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions and do not affect the carrying amounts of goodwill. 
 
Intangibles other than goodwill 
Development costs 
Capitalised development costs have a finite useful life and are amortised on a systematic basis based on the future 
economic benefits over the useful life of the project.  
 
Impairment of assets 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be 
impaired. The assessment will include the consideration of external and internal sources of information, including 
dividends received from subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures deemed to be out of pre-acquisition profits. If 
such an indication exists, an impairment test is carried out on the asset by comparing the recoverable amount of 
the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, to the asset’s carrying 
amount. Any excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with another Standard (eg in accordance 
with the revaluation model in AASB 116:   Property, Plant and Equipment). Any impairment loss of a revalued asset 
is treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with that other Standard. 
 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Impairment testing is performed annually for goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives and intangible assets 
not yet available for use. 
 
Income Tax 
The income tax expense for the year only comprises of current income tax expense. The group does not account for 
deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. 
 
Current income tax expense charged to profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income. Current liabilities 
(assets) are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to (recovered from) the relevant taxation authority. 
 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that 
net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur.  
 
Fair value of assets and liabilities 
The Group measures some of its assets and liabilities at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, 
depending on the requirements of the applicable Accounting Standard. 
 
Fair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset or would have to pay to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement 
date. 
 
As fair value is a market-based measure, the closest equivalent observable market pricing information is used to 
determine fair value. Adjustments to market values may be made having regard to the characteristics of the 
specific asset or liability. The fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are

determined using one or more valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, 
the use of observable market data. 
 
To the extent possible, market information is extracted from either the principal market for the asset or liability or, 
in the absence of such a market, the most advantageous market available to the entity at the end of the reporting 
period. 
 
For non financial assets, the fair value measurement also takes into account a market participant’s ability to use the 
asset in its highest and best use or to sell it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest 
and best use. 
 
The fair value of liabilities and the entity’s own equity instruments (excluding those related to share-based payment 
arrangements) may be valued, where there is no observable market price in relation to the transfer of such 
financial instruments, by reference to observable market information where such instruments are held as assets. 
Where this information is not available, other valuation techniques are adopted and, where significant, are detailed 
in the respective note to the financial statements. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value as indicated less, where applicable, any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment are measured on the cost basis and therefore carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment. In the event the carrying amount of plant and equipment is greater than the 
estimated recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down immediately to the estimated recoverable 
amount and impairment losses are recognised either in profit or loss or as a revaluation decrease if the impairment 
losses relate to a revalued asset. A formal assessment of recoverable amount is made when impairment indicators 
are present. 
 
The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors to ensure it is not in excess of the 
recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash 
flows that will be received from the asset’s employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows 
have been discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts. 
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in profit or loss 
during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
 
Depreciation 
The depreciable amount of all fixed assets, including capitalised lease assets, is depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the asset’s useful life to the consolidated group commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use. 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the 
estimated useful lives of the improvements.

The depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable assets are:
Class of Fixed Asset
Leasehold improvements
Plant and equipment
Depreciation Rate
2.5-5%  
10-33%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period. 
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. When revalued assets are sold, amounts 
included in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings. 
 
Financial instruments 
 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions to the instrument. For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the company commits itself to 
either the purchase or sale of the asset. 
 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument is 
classified “at fair value through profit or loss”, in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss 
immediately. 
 
Classification and subsequent measurement 
Financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
or cost. 
 
Amortised cost is calculated as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial 
recognition less principal repayments and any reduction for impairment, and adjusted for any cumulative 
amortisation of the difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated using the effective 
Interest method. 
 
The effective interest method is used to allocate interest income or interest expense over the relevant period and is 
equivalent to the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts (including fees, transaction costs 
and other premiums or discounts) over the expected life (or when this cannot be reliably predicted, the contractual 
term) of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. Revisions to 
expected future net cash flows will necessitate an adjustment to the carrying amount with a consequential 
recognition of an income or expense item in profit or loss.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial assets are classified at “fair value through profit or loss” when they are held for trading for the 
purpose of short-term profit taking, derivatives not held for hedging purposes, or when they are designated 
as such to avoid an accounting mismatch or to enable performance evaluation where a group of financial 
assets is managed by key management personnel on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented 
risk management or investment strategy. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes 
in carrying amount being included in profit or loss. 
 
Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Gains or losses are 
recognised in profit or loss through the amortisation process and when the financial asset is derecognised. 
 
Held-to-maturity investments 
 
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or 
determinable payments, and it is the Group’s intention to hold these investments to maturity. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss through the 
amortisation process and when the financial asset is derecognised. 
 
Available-for-sale investments 
 
Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative financial assets that are either not capable of being 
classified into other categories of financial assets due to their nature or they are designated as such by 
management. They comprise investments in the equity of other entities where there is neither a fixed 
maturity nor fixed or determinable payments. 
 
They are subsequently measured at fair value with any remeasurements other than impairment losses and 
foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income. When the financial asset is 
derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss pertaining to that asset previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets are classified as non-current assets when they are not expected to be sold 
within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. All other available-for-sale financial assets are 
classified as current assets. 
 
Financial liabilities 
 
Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial guarantees are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss through the amortisation process and when the 
financial liability is derecognised.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Impairment 
A financial asset (or a group of financial assets) is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events (a “loss event”) having occurred, which has an impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset(s). 
 
In the case of available-for-sale financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the market value of the 
instrument is considered to constitute a loss event. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
Also, any cumulative decline in fair value previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to 
profit or loss at this point. 
 
In the case of financial assets carried at amortised cost, loss events may include: indications that the debtors or a 
group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal 
payments; indications that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; and changes in arrears or 
economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost (including loans and receivables), a separate allowance account is 
used to reduce the carrying amount of financial assets impaired by credit losses. After having taken all possible 
measures of recovery, if management establishes that the carrying amount cannot be recovered by any means, at 
that point the written-off amounts are charged to the allowance account or the carrying amount of impaired 
financial assets is reduced directly if no impairment amount was previously recognised in the allowance account. 
 
When the terms of financial assets that would otherwise have been past due or impaired have been renegotiated, 
the Group recognises the impairment for such financial assets by taking into account the original terms as if the 
terms have not been renegotiated so that the loss events that have occurred are duly considered. 
 
Derecognition 
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expire or the asset is 
transferred to another party whereby the entity no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the risks 
and benefits associated with the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability 
extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-
cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Employee benefits 
Short-Term employee benefits 
Provision is made for the Group’s obligation for short-term employee benefits. Short-term employee benefits 
are benefits (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after 
the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service, including wages, 
salaries and sick leave. Short-term employee benefits are measured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected 
to be paid when the obligation is settled. 
 
The Group’s obligations for short-term employee benefits such as wages, salaries and sick leave are recognised 
as a part of current trade and other payables in the statement of financial position. The Group’s obligations for 
employees’ annual leave and long service leave entitlements are recognised as provisions in the statement of 
financial position.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Other long-term employee benefits 
At this stage there are no long term leave entitlements. 
 
Equity-settled compensation 
The Company provides compensation benefits to employees (including directors) of the Company in the form 
of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights 
over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
 
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by a Black Scholes model. 
 
The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of 
earnings per share. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for 
which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably 
measured. 
 
Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation at the end of 
the reporting period. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits available on demand with banks and bank 
overdrafts. 
 
Revenue and other income 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable after taking into account any 
trade discounts and volume rebates allowed.  
 
Subscription income 
Revenue from subscriptions is recognised on a cash basis. 
 
Interest revenue 
Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables include amounts due from customers for goods sold and services performed in 
the ordinary course of business. Receivables expected to be collected within 12 months of the end of the 
reporting period are classified as current assets. All other receivables are classified as non-current assets. 
 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables represent the liabilities for goods and services received by the entity that remain 
unpaid at the end of the reporting period. The balance is recognised as a current liability with the amounts 
normally paid within 30 days of recognition of the liability.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except 
where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).  
 
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of 
GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the statement 
of financial position. 
 
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or 
financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are presented as operating cash flows 
included in receipts from customers or payments to suppliers. 
 
Critical accounting estimates and judgments 
The  directors  evaluate  estimates  and  judgements  incorporated  into  the  financial  statements  based  on 
historical  knowledge  and  best  available  current  information.  Estimates  assume  a  reasonable  expectation  of 
future  events  and  are  based  on current  trends and economic  data, obtained both  externally  and within  the 
company. 
 
Key estimates 
 
Impairment 
The company assesses impairment at the end of each reporting period by evaluation of conditions and events 
specific to the company that may be indicative of impairment triggers. 
 
Key judgements 
 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires estimation of the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill have been allocated. The amount of 
goodwill is discussed in note 4. 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees by 
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date. The fair value is determined by an external 
valuer using the Black Scholes Model simulation. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-
settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the annual reporting period but may impact expenses and equity.

New Accounting Standards for Application in Future Periods 
Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are not yet mandatorily applicable to the 
Group, together with an assessment of the potential impact of such pronouncements on the Group when 
adopted in future periods, are discussed below: 
 
-  AASB 9: Financial Instruments  and associated Amending Standards (applicable to annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018) 
 
The Standard will be applicable retrospectively (subject to the provisions on hedge accounting outlined below) 
and includes revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, revised 
recognition and derecognition requirements for financial instruments and simplified requirements for hedge 
accounting. 
 
The key changes that may affect the Group on initial application include certain simplifications to the 
classification of financial assets, simplifications to the accounting of embedded derivatives, upfront accounting 
for expected credit loss, and the irrevocable election to recognise gains and losses on investments in equity 
instruments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income. AASB 9 also introduces a new model 
for hedge accounting that will allow greater flexibility in the ability to hedge risk, particularly with respect to 
hedges of non-financial items. Should the entity elect to change its hedge policies in line with the new hedge 
accounting requirements of the Standard, the application of such accounting would be largely prospective. 
 
The directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 will not have an impact on the Group’s financial 
instruments.
-  AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (applicable to annual reporting periods commencing on or
after 1 January 2018) 
 
When effective, this Standard will replace the current accounting requirements applicable to revenue with a 
single, principles-based model. Except for a limited number of exceptions, including leases, the new revenue 
model in AASB 15 will apply to all contracts with customers as well as non-monetary exchanges between 
entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers and potential customers. 
 
The core principle of the Standard is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised 
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be 
entitled in exchange for the goods or services. To achieve this objective, AASB 15 provides the following five-
step process: 
 
 
  Determine the transaction price; 
  Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and 
  Recognise revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
The transactional provisions of this Standard permit an entity to either: restate the contracts that existed in 
each prior period presented per AASB 108: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors; or 
recognise the cumulative effect of retrospective application to incomplete contracts on the date of initial 
application. There are also enhanced disclosure requirements regarding revenue.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer; 
Identify the performance obligations in the contract(s);

FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Although the directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will have an impact on the Group’s financial 
statements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.
-  AASB 16: Leases (applicable to annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019)
When effective, this Standard will replace the current accounting requirements applicable to leases in AASB 
117: Leases and related Interpretations. AASB 16 introduces a singles lessee accounting model that eliminates 
the requirement for leases to be classified as operating or finance leases. 
 
The main changes introduced by the New Standard include:
  Recognition of a right-to-use asset and liability for all leases (excluding short-term leases with less than 12
months of tenure and leases relating to low-value assets);
  Depreciation of right-to-use assets in line with AASB 116: Property, Plant and Equipment in profit or loss
and unwinding of the liability in principal and interest components;
  Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the initial measurement of the
lease liability using the index or rate at the commencement date;
  By applying a practical expedient, a lessee is permitted to elect not to separate non-lease components and
instead account for all components as a lease; and
  Addition disclosure requirements.
The transitional provisions of AASB 16 allow a lessee to either retrospectively apply the Standard to 
comparatives in line with AASB 108 or recognize the cumulative effect of retrospective application as an 
adjustment to opening equity on the date of initial application. 
 
Although the directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will have an impact on the Group’s 
financial statements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.

NOTE 3. Business acquisition cost 
On 18 March 2016, the company, formerly named Ardent Resources Limited, completed the 100% 
acquisition of OK IOT Group Pty Ltd and changed its name to IOT Group Limited. The acquisition of OK 
IOT Group Pty Ltd resulted in the shareholders of OK IOT Group Pty Ltd obtaining control of the merged 
entity. 
 
Nominees of OK IOT Group Pty Ltd serve as executive directors and the OK IOT Group Pty Ltd 
management team has assumed responsibility for the management of the merged entity. Consequently, 
the acquisition has been accounted for with reference to the guidance for reverse acquisitions set out in 
AASB 3 “Business Combinations”. 
 
The application of the reverse acquisition guidance contained in AASB 3 has resulted in the Company 
(the legal parent) being accounted for as the subsidiary and OK IOT Group Pty Ltd being accounted for as 
the parent entity. 
 
The  acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  using  the  principles  set  out  in  AASB  3  “Business 
Combinations” whereby OK IOT Group Pty Ltd is deemed to have issued shares in exchange for the 
net  assets  and  listing  status  of  IOT  Group  Limited.  In  accordance  with  AASB  3,  the  difference 
between the fair value of the deemed consideration paid by OK IOT Group Pty Ltd and the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets of IOT Group Limited, has been recognised as goodwill of $1,587,745 
as set out below.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
IOT GROUP LIMITED (FORMALLY ARDENT RESOURCES LIMITED)
A.B.N. 66 140 475 921
AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report 
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year consolidated financial report of IOT Group Limited 
and controlled entities (the consolidated entity) which comprises the consolidated statement of 
financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated 
statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, the accounting policies and other 
selected explanatory notes and the directors’ declaration. 
 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-year Financial Report 
The Directors of IOT Group Limited (the group) are responsible for the preparation of the half-year 
financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards 
(including Australian Accounting Interpretations) and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such 
internal control as the director’s determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the half-year 
financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review engagements ASRE 2410: 
Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity in order to state 
whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that 
makes us believe that the financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 
including giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 
and its performance for the half-year ended on that date and complying with Accounting Standard 
AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of IOT 
Group Limited and controlled entities, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical 
requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report. 
 
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion.
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation
Matters Relating to the Electronic Presentation of the Audited Financial Report 
This review report relates to the financial report of the company for the half-year ended 30 June 
2016 included on the website of IOT Group Limited. The directors of the company are responsible 
for the integrity of the website and we have not been engaged to report on its integrity. This review 
report refers only to the half-year financial report identified above and it does not provide an 
opinion on any other information which may have been hyperlinked to or from the financial report. 
If users of this report are concerned with the inherent risks arising from electronic data 
communications, they are advised to refer to the hard copy of the reviewed financial report to 
confirm the information included in the reviewed financial report presented on the company’s 
website. 
 
Independence 
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations 
Act 2001, which has been given to the directors of IOT Group Limited, would be in the same terms if 
provided to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report. 
 
Conclusions 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the half-year financial report of IOT Group Limited and controlled entities is not in 
accordance with the Corporations Act 2001  including:
  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016
and of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and 
 
complying with AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 
2001.
