<p><b>A.  RESOLUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>2/1.  Intergovernmental Working Group on the Review of Mandates 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
in which the Assembly decided that the Council should improve and rationalize all mandates, 
mechanisms, functions and responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights in order to 
maintain a system of special procedures, expert advice and a complaint procedure, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its decision 1/104 of 30 June 2006, in which it decided to establish an 
open-ended intergovernmental working group on the issue of reviewing and, where necessary, 
improving and rationalizing all human rights mandates, mechanisms, functions and 
responsibilities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the draft manual of the United Nations human rights special procedures of 
June 2006, revised by the Coordination Committee of the special procedures, and the decision 
taken at the thirteenth meeting of the special procedures to submit the manual to Governments 
and other stakeholders for comments and inputs, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Requests</i> the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on the Review of 
Mandates to review the revised draft manual of the United Nations human rights special 
procedures of June 2006 and to make recommendations on possible additions or amendments 
thereto; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also requests</i> the Coordinating Committee of the special procedures to extend 
until the closure of the fourth session of the Council, which will be held from 12 March 
to 6 April 2007, the deadline for the submission of comments and inputs to the draft manual of 
special procedures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further requests</i> the Working Group to draft a code of conduct regulating the 
work of the special procedures, taking into account, inter alia, the suggestions made by the 
members of the Council during the discussions at its second session on the reports of the special 
procedures mandate holders, as well as at previous formal and informal sessions of the Working 
Group; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Invites</i> the Working Group to report to the Council at its fourth session on the 
progress achieved in the implementation of the present resolution. 
</p>
<p><i>31st meeting 
27 November 2006 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted by a recorded vote of 30 votes to 15, with 2 abstentions.  See chap. III.] </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2/2.  Human rights and extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless 
of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and manifestations are 
particularly severe in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> in this regard the commitments made at relevant United Nations 
conferences and summits, including the commitments in the World Summit for Social 
Development, held in Copenhagen in 1995, in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
adopted by the General Assembly in 2000 and the outcome document of the 2005 World Summit 
approved by the Heads of State and Government and adopted by the General Assembly by its 
resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Affirms</i> that the fight against extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the 
international community; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note</i> of the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights:  
the rights of the poor annexed to Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights resolution 2006/9 of 24 August 2006; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to circulate 
the draft guiding principles, in order to obtain the views of States, relevant United Nations 
agencies, intergovernmental organizations, United Nations treaty bodies, special procedures, 
including the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, national 
human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations, especially those in which people in 
situations of extreme poverty express their views, and other relevant stakeholders, and to report 
to the Council at its seventh session. 
</p>
<p><i>31st meeting 
27 November 2006 
</i></p>
<p>[Resolution adopted without a vote.  See chap. III.] 
</p>
<p><b>2/3.  Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan due 
to the violation of their fundamental and human rights since the Israeli military occupation 
of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, including the latest, 
resolution 60/40 of 1 December 2005, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had failed so 
far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw 
from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of Israel&#8217;s decision of 14 December 1981 to impose 
its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has resulted in the 
effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of non-acquisition of territory by force in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories (A/60/380) of 26 August 2005 and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli 
settlement in the occupied Arab territories and regretting Israel&#8217;s constant refusal to cooperate 
with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter, international law and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and the 
relevant provisions of the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of the peace process which started in Madrid on the 
basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern over the halt in 
the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the basis of 
the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) with a view 
to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
 <i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
the most recent being resolution 2005/8 of 14 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions 
of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, in particular resolution 497 (1981), in 
which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal 
effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 
demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, 
and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must 
be allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from its 
repressive measures against them and from all other practices mentioned in the report of the 
Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian 
People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to 
be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character and legal status of the 
occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and 
of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have 
no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls once again upon</i> Member States not to recognize any of the legislative or 
administrative measures and actions referred to above; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of 
all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, international 
and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations and 
to give it the widest possible publicity, and to report on this matter to the Human Rights Council 
at its fourth session, due to be held in March/April 2007; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>7. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of the human rights violations in the 
occupied Syrian Golan at its fourth session. 
</p>
<p><i>31st meeting 
27 November 2006 
</i></p>
<p>[Resolution adopted by a recorded vote of 32 to 1, with 14 abstentions.  See chap. III.] 
</p>
<p><b> 2/4. Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
  East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter and as elaborated in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the 
Security Council and the General Assembly, most recently General Assembly resolution 60/106 
of 8 December 2005 in which it reaffirmed, inter alia, the illegality of the Israeli settlements in 
the occupied territories, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that Israel is a party to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de jure to Palestinian 
and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of High Contracting 
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 2001, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory </i>(see A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1), and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of 
international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> its attachment to the implementation by both parties of their obligations 
under the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
(S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all settlement activity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its grave concern</i> about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 
settlement building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of 
international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, including plans to 
expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East Jerusalem, thus threatening the 
creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the 
realization of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting </i>the dismantlement of settlements in the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern 
West Bank, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing construction, contrary to international 
law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future negotiations and make the 
two-State solution physically impossible to implement and which is causing the Palestinian 
people further humanitarian hardship, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include the 
great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully with 
the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (E/CN.4/2006/29 and A/HRC/2/5) and calls upon 
the Government of Israel to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur to allow him fully to 
discharge his mandate; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at:   
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians

</p>
<p><b>IV. Report to the General Assembly on the second  
session of the Council 
</b></p>
<p>252. At the 35th meeting, on 29 November 2006, the Rapporteur and Vice-President, 
Mr. Musa Burayzat (Jordan), introduced the draft report of the second session of the Council 
(A/HRC/2/L.10 and A/HRC/2/L.11) containing, respectively, the proceedings and the texts of 
the proposals acted upon as at the conclusion of its 30th meeting, on 6 October 2006.   
</p>
<p>253. The draft report was adopted <i>ad referendum</i>. 
254. The Council decided to entrust the Rapporteur with the finalization of the report. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>ANNEXES 
</b></p>
<p>ANNEX I 
</p>
<p><b>Agenda 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Adoption of the agenda and organization of work. 
</p>
<p>2. Implementation of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 
entitled &#8220;Human Rights Council&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 3. Report to the General Assembly on the second session of the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>ANNEX II 
</p>
<p><b>Administrative and programme budget implications of decision 2/109 
on Effects of economic reform policies and foreign debt on the full 
 enjoyment of all human rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of draft decision A/HRC/2/L.17, the Human Rights Council would 
decide to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene an Expert Consultation 
to discuss the proposed draft general guidelines and to invite the international financial 
institutions, notably the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as regional 
development banks, relevant United Nations agencies and national experts and stakeholders to 
contribute to the consultations.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Should the draft decision be adopted by the Human Rights Council, total full costs 
of conference servicing for a three-day expert consultation in Geneva, travel, and daily 
subsistence allowance for seven experts and related consultancy would amount to US$ 151,000 
in the 2006-2007 biennium as follows: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council  
  affairs and conference management 
</p>
<p>80 700 
</p>
<p>Section 23 Human Rights (travel, daily subsistence allowance and  
  consultancy requirements) 
</p>
<p>68 500 
</p>
<p>Section 28E, Administration Geneva (conference servicing costs) 1 800 
     Total 151 000 
</p>
<p>3. Provisions have not been included in the programme budget for the 2006-2007 biennium 
under the above-mentioned sections to implement the activities in response to the decision.  
Additional resources will therefore be required.   
</p>
<p>4. It will be recalled that under the procedures established by the General Assembly in its 
resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987, a contingency fund 
is established for each biennium to accommodate additional expenditures derived from 
legislative mandates not provided for in the programme budget.  Under this procedure, if 
additional expenditures are proposed that exceed the resources available from the contingency 
fund, the activities concerned can be implemented only through the redeployment of resources 
from low-priority areas or the modification of existing activities.  Otherwise, such additional 
activities must be deferred to a later biennium. 
</p>
<p>5. The additional provisions cannot be met from the contingency fund as other activities in 
the 2006-2007 biennium charged against the fund will have exhausted the fund during the main 
part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  It is not possible at this stage to identify 
activities under sections 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and 
conference management, section 23, Human Rights, and section 28E, Administration, Geneva, of  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the programme budget for the 2006-2007 biennium that could be curtailed, deferred, terminated 
or modified in order to meet the net additional requirements of US$ 151,000, although 
preliminary review leads the Secretariat to assume that some absorption of the estimated 
requirements is possible.  The Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be 
redeployed to meet the requirements in the 2006-2007 biennium.  At the time the Assembly 
reviews, at its sixty-first session, the question of the revised estimates resulting from the decision 
taken by the Human Rights Council, it is anticipated that the Secretariat would be in a position to 
inform the Assembly on how to meet the additional requirements. </p>
