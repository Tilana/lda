Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Three and Nine Months Ended May 31, 2016 and 2015
(Expressed In Canadian Dollars) (Unaudited)
1.
Nature of Business and Going Concern
Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc. (formerly: Eagleford Energy Corp.) (“ICE” or the “Company”) was amalgamated under the Business Corporations Act
(Ontario) on November 30, 2009. The Company filed articles of amendment effective February 1, 2016, and changed its name from Eagleford Energy Corp.,
to Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc., and consolidated its common shares on the basis of one (1) new share for every ten (10) old shares. Through the
Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Digital Widget Factory Inc., the Company operates an expanding portfolio of web sites under the primary URL
www.digiwidgy.com. Digital Widget Factory Inc., is a global, multi-language proprietary online content creation, management and advertising platform that
powers user and advertising engagement programs in the US, Canada, Asia, Middle East, Europe, Central and South America in over 50 languages in real-
time to desktop, mobile and portable devices (Note 5).
The Company's registered office is located at 1 King Street West, Suite 1505, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 1A1.
The Company’s common shares trade on the OTCQB under the symbol ICEIF.
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, as they come due
for the foreseeable future. The Company is in the process of seeking additional opportunities and ventures of merit and has not yet realized profitable
operations. The Company requires additional financing for its working capital and for the costs of further development opportunities.
Due to continuing operating losses, the Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain adequate financing and to reach
profitable levels of operation. The Company will continue to seek additional forms of debt or equity financing, or other means of funding its operations,
however, there is no assurance that it will be successful in doing so or that funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The ability of
the Company to arrange such financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions as well as the business performance of
the Company.
The Company has accumulated significant losses and negative cash flows from operations in recent years which raise doubt as to the validity of the going
concern assumption. At May 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $94,372 (August 31, 2015 working capital deficiency: $3,233,160) and an
accumulated deficit of $31,675,662 (August 31, 2015: $18,023,164). These material uncertainties may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements do not give effect to adjustments, if any that would be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize its assets and liquidate its liabilities in other than the normal
course of business and at amounts that may differ from those shown in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As at and for the period ended
May 31, 2016, the Company received $448,663 upon the exercise of common share purchase warrants, $80,000 in private placement proceeds and settled
approximately $2,054,350 in debt (Note 10 and 16 b).

Basis of Preparation
Statement of Compliance
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). These
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim
Financial Reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements required by IFRS as issued by the
IASB and interpretations issued by IFRIC. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company were approved by the
Board of Directors on July 27, 2016.
Basis of Preparation
The policies applied in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are based on IFRS issued and outstanding as of the date the
Board of Directors approved the statements. The same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in these unaudited interim condensed

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Intercompany balances and transactions, and any
unrealized income and expenses arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ICE, the legal parent, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Digital Widget Factory Inc., (incorporated February 29, 2016 in the Province of Ontario) (“DWF Ontario”) and DWF Ontario’s three inactive wholly-owned

3. Significant Accounting Policies and Newly Adopted Accounting Policies
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using the same accounting policies and methods as those described
in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2015. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are
prepared in compliance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34). Accordingly, certain information and disclosure
normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with International Reporting Standards have been omitted or condensed. These
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as at and for the
year ended August 31, 2015, and the newly adopted accounting policies described below:
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be
measured reliably. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets which have a finite useful life are amortized over the useful economic life of the asset and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization
and any accumulated impairment losses. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits is accounted for by changing the
amortization period or method, as appropriate, and adjusted prospectively.
Amortization is calculated using the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company has elected to amortize the technology over 5
years.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether the
indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount.

Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The following standards, amendments and interpretations, which may be relevant to the Company have been introduced or revised by the IASB:

(Expressed In Canadian Dollars) (Unaudited)
(i) In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue,
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, and IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers, and
SIC 31 Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive five-step framework for the timing and
measurement of revenue recognition. The Company intends to adopt IFRS 15 effective September 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the amendment
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
(ii) On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the complete IFRS 9 (IFRS 9 (2014)). In November 2009, the IASB issued the first version of IFRS 9, Financial
Instruments (IFRS 9 (2009) and subsequently issued various amendments in October 2010, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) and November 2013 IFRS
9 Financial Instruments (2013). The mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 is for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and must be applied
retrospectively with some exemptions. Early adoption is permitted. The restatement of prior periods is not required and is only permitted if information is
available without the use of hindsight. The Company does not intend to adopt the new standard prior to its effective date and has not yet determined the
impact of this new standard on the consolidated financial statements.

Intangible Assets
The Company entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which effective February 29, 2016, the Company acquired the net assets of Digital
Widget Factory Inc., (the “Acquired Assets”) a Belize company (the “Vendor”), in an all-stock transaction by issuing 12,500,000 million common shares and
5,750,000 Series A preferred shares of ICE to the Vendor (the “Acquisition Agreement”). The Series A preferred shares are convertible into units of ICE with
each unit comprised of 1 common share and 1 common share purchase warrant entitling the holder to acquire an additional common share of ICE for $0.35
for up to 3 years (the common shares and the preference shares are hereafter referred to as the “Purchase Price Shares”). All of the Purchase Price Shares
are subject to the provisions of an Escrow Agreement and a Lock-up and Leak-out Agreement.
The essential component of the Acquired Assets is a proprietary intelligent content platform ( the “Technology”) developed by Digital Widget Factory Inc. and
evidenced by an expanding portfolio of websites under the primary URL www.digiwidgy.com. A third party licence facilitates multi-language conversion of
the content in the websites created by the Technology (the “DWF Technology”). The Company did not assume any of the liabilities of the Vendor in the
transaction. The DWF Technology is comprised of a cloud based, global proprietary online content creation, management and advertising platform that
powers online user and engagement programs globally in over 50 languages in real-time to desktop, mobile and portable devices. The DWF Technology
delivers engagement in language of choice, determined by the user’s system and location based opportunities determined by the user’s location, creating
potentially increased interaction and revenue opportunities over conventional single language programs.  The Technology also provides increase
economies of scale in the “production” of content, as it localizes the user experience on a technical, rather than a human process, increasing cost efficiencies
and increasing speed to global markets.
The Company’s business model is to create, source and secure commercial content, internally and externally and obtain commercial partner content
programs, which would utilize the DWF Technology to funnel such content to the market place. The Company’s revenue strategy is Content driven.
50% of the Purchase Price Shares (6,250,000 common shares and 2,875,000 Series A preferred shares are held in escrow as security until the earlier of (1)
satisfaction by ICE of the Vendors indemnity obligations under of the Acquisition Agreement; (2) an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (3)
termination date of Escrow Agreement on March 6, 2017 (the “Escrow Agreement”).
The Vendor may not offer, sell, contract to sell, grant any option to purchase, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer title to any of the
Purchase Price Shares during the period commencing on the March 4, 2016 and ending on December 4, 2016 (the “Lockup Period”). During the 12 month
period following the Lockup Period, the Vendor shall be permitted to make sales of up to 25% of the Purchase Price Shares in each successive three month
period. If the Vendors sales are less than 25% in any such three month period, the unsold portion shall carry forward into the next three month period (the
“Lock-up and Leak-out Agreement”).

The fair value of the transaction was estimated at approximately $9,530,250 and paid through the issuance by the Company of the Purchase Price Shares. In
arriving at the estimated fair value of the Purchase Price Shares on the effective date of the acquisition, the Company discounted the market value of the
Purchase Price Shares after factoring in certain provisions and conditions of the Lock-up and Leak-out Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, Rule 144
restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the associated liquidity risk. The purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets acquired as at February
29, 2016 was as follows:

The Company’s prior decommissioning obligations resulted from its ownership interests in petroleum and natural gas assets. The decommissioning
obligation was estimated based on the Company’s net ownership interest in all wells and facilities, estimated costs to reclaim and abandon these wells and
facilities, and the estimated timing of the costs to be incurred in future years. The Company had no decommissioning obligations at May 31, 2016 (August 31,
2015: $11,563 based on an undiscounted total future liability of $11,563).

experienced any collection issues with its receivables to date. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts as determined by management
based on their assessed collectability; therefore, the carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally represents the maximum credit exposure. The
Company believes that its counterparties currently have the financial capacity to settle outstanding obligations in the normal course of business.
Concentration risks exist in cash because significant balances are maintained with one financial institution. The risk is mitigated because the financial
institution is an international bank.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows:

Liquidity Risk
The Company monitors its liquidity position regularly to assess whether it has the funds necessary to fulfill planned opportunities or that viable options are
available to fund such opportunities from new equity issuances or alternative sources of financings. As a company without significant internally generated
cash flow, there are inherent liquidity risks, including the possibility that additional financing may not be available to the Company, or that such financing
terms may not be acceptable to the Company.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows due to adverse changes in
financial market prices, including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and other relevant market or price risks. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk.
(i) Currency Risk
The Company is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company operates in Canada and a portion of its expenses are incurred in U.S.
dollars. A significant change in the currency exchange rates between the Canadian dollar relative to US dollar could have an effect on the Company’s
financial instruments. The Company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure.

(ii)Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market
interest rates. The majority of the Company’s debt is short-term in nature with fixed rates. Based on management's knowledge and experience of the financial
markets, the Company believes that the movements in interest rates that are reasonably possible over the next twelve month period will not have a
significant impact on the Company.
(iii)Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments included on the consolidated statements of financial position are comprised of cash, trade and other receivables, trade
and other payables, shareholders’ loans, loans payable, provisions and derivative liabilities.
The Company classifies the fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value according to the following hierarchy based on the amount of observable
inputs used to value the instrument.
• Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which
transactions occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
• Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1. Prices in Level 2 are either directly or indirectly observable as of
the reporting date. Level 2 valuations are based on inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and volatility factors, which can be
substantially observed or corroborated in the marketplace.
• Level 3 – Valuations in this level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Cash and derivative liabilities are stated at fair value (Level 1 measurement). The carrying value of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables,
loans payable, secured note payable and provisions approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments (Level 3
measurement). Shareholders’ loans are measured at the exchange amount.

Capital Management
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Company will have sufficient financial capacity, liquidity and flexibility to funds its
operations, growth and ongoing development opportunities. The Company’s capital requirements currently exceed its operational cash flow generated. As
such, the Company is dependent upon future financings in order to maintain its flexibility and liquidity and may from time to time be required to issue equity,
issue debt or adjust capital spending.
The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions, availability of capital and the risk
characteristics of any underlying assets in order to meet current and upcoming obligations.
The board of directors does not establish quantitative return on capital criteria for management, but rather relies on the expertise of the Company's
management and favourable market conditions to sustain future development of the business. As at February 29, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company
considered its capital structure to comprise of shareholders’ equity.
Management reviews its capital management approach on an ongoing basis and believes that this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is
reasonable. There were no changes in the Company’s capital management plan during the period ended May 31, 2016. The Company is not subject to any
externally imposed restrictions on its capital requirements.

Dissolution of Dyami Energy LLC
As previously disclosed, the Company had solicited lenders and investors in an attempt to obtain debt/equity financings as a means to improve Dyami
Energy’s financial situation. Despite the Company’s attempts, these efforts were unsuccessful and management determined that it could no longer fund the
Murphy Lease operations, hence the lease was considered impaired and during the year ended August 31, 2014 an impairment loss of $1,675,749 was
recorded by Dyami Energy. On March 6, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Termination of a Domestic Entity with the Secretary of State, Texas for its
wholly-owned subsidiary Dyami Energy and, effective April 3, 2014, Dyami Energy was dissolved.
The Company’s investment in Dyami Energy had been deconsolidated from the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as at the effective date, and
presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as an impairment of the
net assets and liabilities on dissolution of subsidiary. Prior obligations related to Dyami Energy, with respect to the Matthews and Murphy Leases of
$893,990 expired and have been recorded as a gain on de-recognition of financial liabilities in the in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
statements of operations.
