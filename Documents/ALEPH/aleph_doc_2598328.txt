2.6 Brief explanation of any of the figures in 2.1 to 2.4 above necessary to enable figures to be understood
The decrease in revenue as stated above is on a consolidated basis across all operating segments of the Group. The
variance in revenue from HY2015 to HY2016 of each segment are as per below:
-  Refined petroleum segment revenue down 72.6%;
-
-
Petrochemical segment revenue down 36.2%; and
Petrol station and convenience segment revenue up 100% (this additional segment has been included for
the half-year ended 30 June 2016 as a result of acquisitions during the period).
The 44.2% consolidated decrease in revenue as stated above is mainly attributable to the fall in wholesales of the
both refined petroleum and petrochemicals segments. The fall in the wholesales of both segments is as a result of
the decreases in both sales volumes and average selling prices during the period which reflects the low oil price and
the slowdown in the Chinese industrial sector.
Revenue  in  original  transactional  currency  (ie.  RMB)  dropped by  44.3%  from  RMB2,144,816,000  in  HY2015  to
RMB1,194,615,000 in HY2016. Meanwhile, the average exchange rate of RMB against AUD remained steady with
a rise by 0.2% from 0.2082 in HY2015 to 0.20857 in HY2016.

Review of operations and financial results
Commentary on Half Year Results
The  Directors  of  Premiere  Eastern  Energy  Limited  (“Premiere”  or  “the  Company”)  and  its  controlled  entities 
(“the Group”) hereby present the Company’s Interim Report for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 (“1H2016”). 
Through  this  report,  the  Board  seeks  to  provide  an  update  to  its  shareholders  and  the  market  on  the  results 
achieved  for  1H2016. It should  be  noted that  the  Group’s  financial  year  runs from  January  to December  each 
year.
The  Group  has  incurred  a  loss  after  tax  of  $2.3  million  for  1H2016,  compared  to  a  profit  after  tax  of  $14.1 
million for the half-year ended 30 June 2015 (“1H2015”). As a result of the depreciation of the Chinese Renminbi 
(“RMB”) against Australian dollar (“AUD”), the Company has recorded a foreign exchange loss on translation of 
foreign  operation  of  $8.9  million.  The  Company  has  maintained  strong  cash  and  cash  equivalents  balance  at 
$157.6 million.

Review of operations and financial results (continued) 
 
Corporate Results Summary
For 1H2016, the Group, through its main operating China based subsidiaries, has achieved the following:
•  Group  revenue  for  the  half-year  (excluding  other  revenue)  dropped  by  44.2%  to  $249.1  million  compared  to
$446.6 million in 1H2015;
o  Existing wholesale business:
Our  existing  wholesale  business  in  the  sales  of  refined  petroleum  and  other  petrochemicals 
continued  to  suffer  from  a  negative  growth  in  the  current  period.  Sales  of  refined  petroleum 
and  other  petrochemicals  dropped  by  72.6%  to  $27.4  million  and  36.2%  to  $221.1  million 
respectively.  The  decrease  in  sales  of  both  segments  was  attributable  to  the  decrease  in  sale 
volumes and average selling prices.  
 
The  business  environment  of  our  industry  in  the  wholesale  of  refined  petroleum  and  other 
petrochemicals  worsened  since  the  second  half  of  the  year  (“2H2015”).  Customers  became 
more prudent and alert in making their purchase orders, which resulted in the decrease in sales 
volumes  of  our Group.  Moreover,  the  competition  in  the  wholesale  market  remained  intense 
due  to  cheaper  sources  of  products  obtained  by  our  main  competitors  from  the  overseas 
market. They were able to offer more price-competitive products to the market. With a view to 
maintaining  our  customer  base  and  market  share,  we  have  lowered  our  selling  prices  of  our 
products so as to maintain our competitiveness in the market.   
 
Sales  of  refined  petroleum  and  other  petrochemicals  contributed  to  11.0%  (1H2015:  22.4%) 
and 88.7% (1H2015: 77.6%) of the Group’s revenue in 1H2016 respectively. During the period, 
the  Group  distributed  an  aggregate  of  33,534  tonnes  (1H2015:  87,497  tonnes)  of  refined 
petroleum and 277,583 tonnes (1H2015: 342,590 tonnes) of other petrochemicals respectively 
in the PRC;
o  New retail business in petrol stations and convenience stores:
We  have  recorded  sales  of  $0.6  million,  representing  only  0.3%  of  the  Group’s  revenue  in 
1H2016. As we acquired our new business at end of May 2016, only one-month result has been 
contributed to the Group’s revenue.
•  Gross  profit  margin  of  1.4%  was  achieved  for  the  current  period,  representing  a  deterioration  from  6.0%  in 
1H2015. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to the decrease in the average selling prices of both refined 
petroleum and other petrochemicals in our wholesale business;
•  Group loss before tax of $2.3 million, contrary to a profit before tax of $19.5 million in 1H2015;
•  Group loss after tax of $2.3 million, contrary to a profit after tax of $14.1 million in 1H2015;
•  Foreign exchange translation loss of $8.9 million, arising from the depreciation of RMB against AUD during the
period;
•  Maintaining strong cash position of $157.6 million;
- 2 -
The Group, as one of the leading integrated supply chain manager engaging in the wholesale of refined petroleum 
and petrochemical products within the PRC, will continue to maintain and develop the wholesale business despite 
the worsened business environment and intense market competition in the PRC.
Since  the  second  quarter  of  this  year,  we  have  successfully  acquired  and  launched  our  new  business  in  the 
operation of retail petrol stations. Going forward, we are looking for business opportunities to acquire more retail 
petrol stations for our vertical expansion within the petrochemical industry.
A  copy  of  the  Auditor’s  Independence  Declaration  as  required  under  s307C  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001  is

with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting.  They do not include

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE HALF-YEAR
ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
4.  Estimates
When  preparing  the  interim  financial  statements,  management  undertakes  a  number  of  judgements,  estimates 
and  assumptions  about  recognition  and  measurement  of  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses.    The  actual 
results may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management, and will seldom equal 
the estimated results. 
 
The judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the interim financial statements, including the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied in the Group’s last annual financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2015.

Petrol Station”) and 100% of Guangzhou You Yi Convenience Stores Co Ltd (“YY Convenience Stores”).  
 
A  supplementary  agreement  has  been  signed  with  the  two  personal  shareholders  holding  53%  of  the  shares  in 
GBD Petrol Station that Universal would possess all the 100% beneficial interest in GBD Petrol Station and bear

(ii) Identifiable net assets/(liabilities)
The fair values of the net assets/(liabilities) acquired have been determined provisionally at 30 June 2016, 
because the acquisition was completed late in the period.
(iii) Goodwill
The goodwill that arose on the business combination has been determined provisionally at 30 June 2016, 
because  the  acquisition  was  completed  late  in  the  period.    The  Group  is  currently  obtaining  the 
information necessary to finalise its valuation and identify any separately identifiable intangible assets if 
applicable.
(iv) New retail business contribution to the Group’s results
The  acquisition  of  Universal  contributed  $571,000  and  $74,000  to  the  Group’s  revenues  and  profits, 
respectively from the date of the acquisition to 30 June 2016.  Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 
2016, the Group’s revenue for the period to 30 June 2016 would increase by $2,823,000 and the Group’s 
profit for the period would have decreased by $28,000.

A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures.  A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence 
In conducting our review, we complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001.
Conclusion 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes 
us believe that the half-year financial report of Premiere Eastern Energy Limited is not in 
accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 
and of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and
