<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
</p>
<p>Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to Azerbaijan from 19 to 24 May 2014 at 
</p>
<p>the invitation of the Government and as mandated by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 23/8. The objective of the visit was to examine the human rights situation of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons in the country since the last assessment made in 2010 by the 
</p>
<p>previous mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>The Government of Azerbaijan has made commendable progress in providing 
</p>
<p>durable housing for internally displaced persons, especially with the construction of new 
</p>
<p>settlements that are all equipped with modern facilities. Continued efforts to provide 
</p>
<p>similar housing to those still living in the collective centres visited are still necessary, in the 
</p>
<p>context of a rights-based development approach to address the situation of all internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons in and outside settlements. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
</p>
<p>the abiding need to find durable solutions to the protracted situation of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons in Azerbaijan.

</p>
<p>In Azerbaijan, one of the main obstacles encountered in the search for durable 
</p>
<p>solutions for internally displaced persons, including return to their homes or places of 
</p>
<p>origin, remains the absence of a political settlement to the unresolved armed conflict in and 
</p>
<p>around the Nagorno-Karabakh region,1 Azerbaijan. In this connection, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur calls upon all the parties concerned to step up efforts towards reaching a 
</p>
<p>political settlement that would enable durable solutions, including return, from a combined 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and development perspective, and take all the necessary measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>that all internally displaced persons can exercise their right to make a free and informed 
</p>
<p>decision as to whether to return voluntarily to their homes or places of habitual residence in 
</p>
<p>safety and dignity, to integrate locally or to resettle elsewhere in the country.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 23/8 
and at the invitation of the Government of Azerbaijan, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
</p>
<p>rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official follow-up visit 
</p>
<p>to Azerbaijan from 19 to 24 May 2014. The objective of the visit was to follow up on the 
</p>
<p>visits conducted by his predecessors, the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, Francis Deng, in 1998 and the Representative of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, in 2007 and 
</p>
<p>2010.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Head of the State 
Committee for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons; the Minister of Health; the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Minister of Economy and Industry, the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Protection, and the Deputy Minister of Education. 
</p>
<p>He also met with the Deputy Chairman of the Parliament, the Chairman of the Social Policy 
</p>
<p>Committee and the Chairperson of the Human Rights Committee of the Parliament. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur further met with the Deputy President of the State Oil Fund and held 
</p>
<p>meetings with the Ombudsman of Azerbaijan, representatives of the international 
</p>
<p>community and non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>3. During his week-long mission, the Special Rapporteur visited locations where 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) live in the western district of Agdam, in new 
</p>
<p>settlements in the Binagadi district of Baku and the Masazir settlement in the Absheron 
</p>
<p>district. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
Azerbaijan for its full cooperation during his visit. He is also grateful to all his 
</p>
<p>interlocutors, especially IDPs who kindly shared their experiences and different 
</p>
<p>perspectives with him. He looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue with the 
</p>
<p>Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in the present report. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to sincerely thank the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for ably coordinating his visit to 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan. He is grateful for all the logistical, administrative and substantive support he 
</p>
<p>received, which facilitated the conduct of the visit. He would also like to thank the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Resident Coordinator and the United Nations country team for their support and 
</p>
<p>cooperation.  
</p>
<p>6. Durable solutions should be regarded inclusively as options available to all IDPs. A 
humanitarian and development approach to achieving durable solutions requires that they 
</p>
<p>be delinked from the political issues concerning the Nagorno-Karabakh region.2 However, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur considers that the full restoration of the human rights of IDPs by 
</p>
<p>means of durable solutions requires first and foremost a resolution to the outstanding peace 
</p>
<p>negotiations relating to the armed conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 
</p>
<p>Following his mission, the Special Rapporteur was privileged to address the Security 
</p>
<p>Council in the framework of an &#8220;Arria formula&#8221; meeting in which he conveyed important 
messages calling for the implementation by the Minsk Process of Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993). The General Assembly has 
</p>
<p>passed resolutions relating to the conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Any reference to the Nagorno-Karabakh region is understood to be in compliance with General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 62/243. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>notably resolutions 48/114 (1993), 60/285 (2006) and 62/243 (2008). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur calls upon all parties to take all the necessary measures to ensure that all IDPs 
</p>
<p>can exercise their right to make a free and informed decision as to whether to return 
</p>
<p>voluntarily to their homes or places of habitual residence in safety and dignity, to integrate 
</p>
<p>locally or to resettle elsewhere in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Current situation of internal displacement in Azerbaijan  
</b></p>
<p>7. The phenomenon of internal displacement in Azerbaijan has been addressed in 
previous reports by this mandate (see E/CN.4/1999/79/Add.1, A/HRC/8/6/Add.2 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/16/43/Add.2). The situation of IDPs in Azerbaijan remains a consequence of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s unresolved armed conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the Government of Azerbaijan, there were 609,029 IDPs as at the end 
of 2013, predominantly former residents of the Nagorno Karabakh and the seven 
</p>
<p>surrounding territories, who have been displaced since the armed conflict in and around the 
</p>
<p>Nagorno-Karabakh region which ended with the 1994 ceasefire, which to date is still in 
</p>
<p>place. About 50 per cent of IDPs live in the urban areas of Baku and Sumgayit. The IDP 
</p>
<p>population has grown and is expected to continue rising given the protracted situation of 
</p>
<p>internal displacement. For example, in Agdam district, where the Special Rapporteur met 
</p>
<p>with IDPs, the official figures refer to a total number of 145,000 IDPs out of the 190,000 
</p>
<p>inhabitants of that district. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Framework for the protection and assistance of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic response 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes that there is an effective humanitarian response to 
internal displacement in Azerbaijan. The Government confirmed that in the past 20 years a 
</p>
<p>total of US$ 5.5 billion has been allocated for the assistance of IDPs. Out of that figure, 
</p>
<p>US$ 2.5 billion comes from the State budget, US$ 1.9 billion from the State Oil Fund and 
</p>
<p>US$ 1.1 billion are contributions made by international financial institutions and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations present in the country. 
</p>
<p>10. The body of legislation put in place by the Government to address internal 
displacement has essentially remained the same since the previous visits of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors. According to the Government, a total of 95 orders and decrees 
were signed by the President, 357 resolutions and decrees were approved by the Cabinet of 
</p>
<p>Ministers and 33 laws were adopted by the National Parliament, including the 1998 Law on 
</p>
<p>Citizenship, the 1999 laws on the status of refugees and IDPs and on social protection of 
</p>
<p>IDPs and persons equated to them. Presidential Decree No. 895 of 17 September 1998 on 
</p>
<p>the State programme on solutions to problems of refugees and IDPs, Decree No. 298 of 
</p>
<p>1 July 2004 on the State Programme for improvement of living conditions and increasing 
</p>
<p>employment for refugees and IDPs, Decrees No. 2475 of 31 October 2007 and No. 1346 of 
</p>
<p>21 February 2011 on the Annexes to the State Programme on improvement of living 
</p>
<p>conditions and increasing employment opportunities have been approved to date. In 
</p>
<p>addition, following his visit, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to the State 
Programme on poverty reduction and sustainable development in the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan for 2008&#8211;2015, approved by Decree No. 3043 of 15 September 2008 by the 
President of Azerbaijan; State Programme on implementation of the employment strategy 
</p>
<p>of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2011&#8211;2015, approved by Decree No. 1836 of 
15 November 2011 by the President; State Programme on socioeconomic development of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2014&#8211;2018, approved by Decree No. 118 of the 
President on 27 February 2014. 
</p>
<p>11. The State Programme was amended again in 2011 to include additional support for 
IDPs, and a revised programme for 2015&#8211;2020 is under preparation. The Special 
Rapporteur views those developments as proving an ideal opportunity to consult IDPs, 
</p>
<p>assess their needs for durable solutions and ensure that the most vulnerable are prioritized. 
</p>
<p>A needs-based profiling assessment would prepare the ground for durable solutions, 
</p>
<p>including the master return plan, and reveal the extent to which IDPs still have needs 
</p>
<p>relating to their displacement in order to tailor solutions accordingly under the next 
</p>
<p>programme. Findings from such a profiling and needs assessment exercise would also be 
</p>
<p>relevant to priority-setting and implementation of the development frameworks beyond 
</p>
<p>2015 of the Government and the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur observes that comprehensive legislation addressing all 
human rights of IDPs and durable solutions has yet to be adopted or consolidated. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the 1999 legislation on forcibly displaced people must be brought into line with 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The causes of displacement should 
</p>
<p>include human rights violations, generalized violence and natural and human-made 
</p>
<p>disasters. At present, persons internally displaced by disasters are not registered as IDPs 
</p>
<p>and are therefore not eligible for the benefits set out in the 1999 legislation. Separate laws 
</p>
<p>and policies dedicated to displacement caused by disasters are therefore required to ensure a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive approach overall. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International response 
</b></p>
<p>13. There has been a steady decline in international humanitarian engagement in 
Azerbaijan, as the country has experienced substantial oil-driven growth that has enabled it 
</p>
<p>to become an aid donor itself. 
</p>
<p>14. United Nations agencies and international organizations have found it increasingly 
difficult to secure humanitarian funding, but several continue to work with IDPs. Those 
</p>
<p>include both humanitarian and development stakeholders that the Special Rapporteur met 
</p>
<p>during his mission, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International 
</p>
<p>Organization for Migration, UNHCR, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Health Organization and the World Bank, 
</p>
<p>and also Oxfam and World Vision.3 
</p>
<p>15. Despite constraints on its budget, UNHCR undertook its largest participatory 
assessment in the country to date in 2013, interviewing around 1,600 IDPs and 150 of their 
</p>
<p>local community neighbours. Although this was the most extensive and largest consultation 
</p>
<p>ever undertaken by UNHCR, the findings might not be fully representative of the entire and 
</p>
<p>very diverse IDP population as the 1,600 IDPs to whom UNHCR was able to reach out 
</p>
<p>only represent some 0.26 per cent of the total IDP population in Azerbaijan. In addition to 
</p>
<p>standard questions on protection risks, the assessment included others on the development 
</p>
<p>priorities and challenges of IDPs. The assessment&#8217;s findings informed United Nations-
facilitated national consultations with the citizens of Azerbaijan for the country&#8217;s post-2015 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 According to information provided by World Vision, that non-governmental organization has two 
</p>
<p>projects targeting IDPs, one relates to disaster risk reduction awareness among children in Agjebedi 
</p>
<p>district and the other project, called &#8220;Sheki-Zakatala Development Model Project&#8221;, aims to support 
</p>
<p>integrated and sustainable entrepreneurship development in six districts of the Sheki-Zaqatala 
</p>
<p>economic region. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>sustainable development framework, which is aligned with the Government&#8217;s strategy 
&#8220;Azerbaijan 2020: the vision of the future&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p>16. In 2011, the World Bank launched a US$ 78.5 million project to improve economic 
self-reliance and living conditions of IDPs in more than 60 collective centres. Given that, 
</p>
<p>with the exception of the International Committee of the Red Cross, international agencies 
</p>
<p>rely on local non-governmental organizations as implementing partners, the establishment 
</p>
<p>of an operating environment more conducive to their work is particularly important.  
</p>
<p>17. Increasing access to quality reproductive health services for women, men and young 
people paying particular attention to the needs of vulnerable populations has been among 
</p>
<p>the key priorities of the United Nations Population Fund. Special attention is given to 
</p>
<p>improving national mechanisms for gender equality, women&#8217;s empowerment and 
prevention of gender-based violence.5 
</p>
<p>18. Intergovernmental organizations continue to focus on conflict resolution. The 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the co-chairs of its Minsk Group 
</p>
<p>&#8212; France, the Russian Federation and the United States of America &#8212; have conducted 
more than two decades of diplomacy, but a resolution to the conflict and the achievement of 
</p>
<p>durable solutions to displacement remain elusive. The former European Union Special 
</p>
<p>Representative for the South Caucasus visited Azerbaijan in mid-2013 and pressed for 
</p>
<p>confidence-building measures. The Special Rapporteur encourages the new Special 
</p>
<p>Representative, appointed on 8 July 2014, to meet with IDPs and enable them to engage in 
</p>
<p>peace and reconciliation efforts as well as confidence-building measures. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur considers that to achieve durable solutions in Azerbaijan 
effectively, it is necessary for the international community to engage and coordinate with a 
</p>
<p>wide range of national and international actors, including the Government, neighbouring 
</p>
<p>States, development, humanitarian, human rights and peacebuilding organizations, donors 
</p>
<p>and the private sector. 
</p>
<p>20. Given the protracted nature of displacement and the need for a firm evidence-based 
approach to durable solutions, the data collected during the latest UNHCR participatory 
</p>
<p>assessment (2013) are an important basis from which to develop a policy for local 
</p>
<p>integration of IDPs as a transitional solution pending the establishment of conditions which 
</p>
<p>would allow those IDPs wishing to return to the Nagorno-Karabakh region to do so in 
</p>
<p>accordance with Guiding Principle28.6 The data could be used to design a larger scale IDP 
</p>
<p>profiling exercise to determine appropriate durable solutions following the criteria set out in 
</p>
<p>the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for 
</p>
<p>Internally Displaced Persons. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Specific rights and issues of concern for internally displaced 
persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to an adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>21. Under principle 18 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, all IDPs 
have the right to an adequate standard of living. At a minimum that right includes basic 
</p>
<p>shelter and housing. The Government has taken positive steps to meet the housing needs of 
</p>
<p>IDPs. From 2001 to 2013, 82 temporary settlements with sociotechnical infrastructure were 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 See UNHCR, &#8220;Being an IDP in Azerbaijan&#8221;, report from a participatory assessment with IDPs in 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan (Baku, June 2013), p. 8. 
</p>
<p> 5 See UNFPA, Country Programme Action Plan 2011&#8211;2015.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>constructed, benefiting 40,000 families, i.e. 180,000 IDPs. In addition, 139 secondary 
</p>
<p>schools, 6 music schools, 51 kindergartens, 55 medical facilities, 45 cultural centres and 
</p>
<p>2 Olympic sports complexes were constructed; 648 km of road, 815 km of water pipeline, 
</p>
<p>1,412 km of overhead power, 333 km of gas pipes were built; 715 different capacity power 
</p>
<p>transformers were installed in those new settlements. For instance, the Government reports 
</p>
<p>that 760 families or 3,800 IDPs live in the newly built settlement of Masazir in Absheron 
</p>
<p>district which the Special Rapporteur visited during his mission. From the point of view of 
</p>
<p>IDPs, the considerable amount of government funding devoted to the construction of new 
</p>
<p>settlements and facilities is strongly appreciated, as noted by the Special Rapporteur during 
</p>
<p>his visit.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur noted other improvements since the last mission of his 
predecessor. For instance, tent camps and the most severe cases of inadequate housing such 
</p>
<p>as railway wagons had been closed and the IDPs concerned had been resettled in newly 
</p>
<p>constructed government settlements. On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur observed 
</p>
<p>that some IDPs continued to live in dormitories. In total, there are 268 dormitories across 
</p>
<p>the country. In Binagadi district that the Special Rapporteur visited, there were still 48 
</p>
<p>dormitories where IDPs live in precarious conditions that need improving to reach the same 
</p>
<p>standard as the new settlements. 
</p>
<p>23. Problems also exist in a number of new IDP settlements located in isolated areas, a 
long distance from essential services, employment opportunities and administrative 
</p>
<p>authorities, and in a few cases very close to the front line. That not only creates a sense of 
</p>
<p>physical insecurity and isolation for IDPs from the local population, but also affects the 
</p>
<p>ability of IDPs to become self-reliant. It is important that livelihood opportunities are 
</p>
<p>planned and created as part of the new settlements. 
</p>
<p>24. Housing arrangements for IDPs in the new settlements are of a temporary nature and 
housing is provided on a free cost basis as IDPs are treated as &#8220;guests&#8221; pending 
implementation of the &#8220;Great Return&#8221; master plan. Those measures are no doubt welcome 
and have gone a long way to improve the well-being of IDPs. While IDPs enjoy privileged 
</p>
<p>housing, they have no rights of ownership because return to their original homes or places 
</p>
<p>of habitual residence is the durable solution predicated. Indeed all the IDPs that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur met with expressed the desire to return to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. As 
</p>
<p>mentioned above, the Special Rapporteur advises that all durable solutions are options open 
</p>
<p>to IDPs in keeping with the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally 
</p>
<p>Displaced Persons. 
</p>
<p>25. According to principle 28, paragraph 2, of the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement, &#8220;special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation of internally 
displaced persons in the planning and management of their return or resettlement and 
</p>
<p>reintegration&#8221;. The findings of the recent UNHCR participatory assessment indicate that 
both the IDPs who had moved to new settlements and those who were waiting to be moved 
</p>
<p>stated that they had not been consulted about their needs and wishes in the process.7 The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to expand and broaden 
</p>
<p>consultations to ensure that all IDPs, in particular women, are better informed, consulted 
</p>
<p>and involved in the development and implementation of resettlement plans as the 
</p>
<p>Government speeds up its efforts to construct and allocate new units for the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable IDPs.

<p><b> B. Employment and livelihood opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>26. In Azerbaijan IDPs are an increasingly diverse group in terms of income, social 
mobility and the degree to which they have integrated into the larger society. Conditions are 
</p>
<p>particularly difficult in rural areas, where seasonal agricultural work is one of the few 
</p>
<p>occupations available.  
</p>
<p>27. IDPs overall display lower employment rates and higher work inactivity rates than 
those who have not been displaced. According to the World Bank, the poverty rate among 
</p>
<p>IDPs in 2008 was 25 per cent compared to 20.1 per cent among the ordinarily resident 
</p>
<p>population; 42.5 per cent of IDPs lived in one-room accommodation compared to only 
</p>
<p>9.1 per cent of non-IDPs; IDP families had an average of 36 square metres of living space 
</p>
<p>compared to 74 square metres for local families; rates of access to electricity, hot water and 
</p>
<p>bathrooms were worse among the displaced than others; the employment rate among IDPs 
</p>
<p>was 40.1 per cent compared to 57.4 per cent among the ordinarily resident population; and 
</p>
<p>the work inactivity rate among IDPs was 54.3 per cent compared to 36.2 per cent among 
</p>
<p>those who were not IDPs.8 
</p>
<p>28. The lack of available jobs in areas where IDPs live and their lack of social 
connections to secure appointments stem from and contribute to the marginalization of 
</p>
<p>IDPs. That marginalization may be linked to the location of some of those IDP settlements, 
</p>
<p>which remain disconnected from neighbouring communities.9 
</p>
<p>29. In addition, a distinct characteristic of protracted displacement in Azerbaijan relates 
to the fact that a whole generation of the internally displaced youth has only known a life of 
</p>
<p>displacement and is being brought up with the message and prospect of returning to its 
</p>
<p>place of origin. Young persons thus inherit the legacy of their parents, bound to their place 
</p>
<p>of origin in view of what is considered the temporary nature of the settlements for IDPs. 
</p>
<p>That may be a crucial factor in the dislocation and disruption of the capacity of young IDPs 
</p>
<p>to become self-reliant in places of displacement.  
</p>
<p>30. As confirmed by a number of stakeholders that the Special Rapporteur met during 
his mission, the dependency syndrome engendered among IDPs persists, which the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor had noticed during his previous visit. That seems to be due to a 
combination of factors such as regarding the situation of IDPs as being temporary, the high 
</p>
<p>social protection which does not encourage them to become self-reliant and livelihood 
</p>
<p>activities which are too low income to ensure self-sustainability. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts made by the Government to reduce 
the gap between IDPs and the habitually resident population. During his visit, he was 
</p>
<p>informed by the Government that 161,000 persons out of 380,000 able-bodied IDPs had 
</p>
<p>been provided with permanent employment in budget organizations and other areas and 
</p>
<p>200,000 persons had been provided with temporary employment as a result of the actions 
</p>
<p>undertaken in that respect. Currently unemployed IDPs, who used to work in enterprises 
</p>
<p>and organizations funded from the State budget and who lost their jobs owing to 
</p>
<p>displacement, have continued to receive an average monthly salary since May 1994. That 
</p>
<p>involves a total of 11,000 IDPs.  
</p>
<p>32. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that in 2013, 1,713 IDPs, 
including 750 persons residing in compact areas, were provided with employment by the 
</p>
<p>State Employment Service under the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, 340 were 
</p>
<p>provided with an unemployment allowance, 405 were involved in vocational training and

</p>
<p>197 persons were engaged in public works based upon current requirements of the job 
</p>
<p>market. 
</p>
<p>33. In the past 10 years, 18,426 displaced persons have been provided with employment 
by the State Employment Service under the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, 4,691 
</p>
<p>persons were provided with an unemployment allowance, 3,608 persons were involved in 
</p>
<p>vocational training courses and 2,454 persons were engaged in public works on a paid 
</p>
<p>basis. 
</p>
<p>34. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, government officials informed him that 
within the framework of the National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support (under the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Economy and Industry) preferential loans amounting to AZN 26.5 million10 had 
</p>
<p>been allocated to 1,200 IDPs for funding entrepreneurship investment projects in the past 
</p>
<p>10 years; in addition, preferential loans in the amount of AZN 15.9 million11 had been 
</p>
<p>allocated for funding six investment projects involving new technologies. Microcredits in 
</p>
<p>the amount of AZN 7.7 million12 were extended to 10,800 IDPs in various districts and 
</p>
<p>cities of Azerbaijan by the Social Development Fund of IDPs within the framework of a 
</p>
<p>loan agreement between the World Bank and the Government (IDP Living Standards and 
</p>
<p>Livelihoods Project). In addition, 520 various types of community microprojects, benefiting 
</p>
<p>310,000 persons, 83 per cent of whom were IDPs, and valued at AZN 30 million,13 had 
</p>
<p>been implemented in the past 10 years by the Fund. 
</p>
<p>35. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed that insecurity added to 
the difficulties that people living along the Line of Contact faced in accessing their land for 
</p>
<p>livelihoods. Around 128,000 persons, both local inhabitants and IDPs, live within five 
</p>
<p>kilometres of the Line of Contact. With virtually no local employment nor income-
</p>
<p>generating opportunities, most depend on subsistence farming, but their livelihoods are 
</p>
<p>undermined, either because their land is adversely occupied or because it is too close to the 
</p>
<p>Line of Contact. The Azerbaijan National Agency for Mine Awareness continues to clear 
</p>
<p>landmines and run public information campaigns, and the Azerbaijan Reconstruction and 
</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Agency  as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross have built 
</p>
<p>protective walls and redesigned homes to shield the most exposed residents from stray 
</p>
<p>bullets. Despite those efforts, residents continue to struggle to access and earn an income 
</p>
<p>from their land.14 
</p>
<p><b> C. Social security 
</b></p>
<p>36. Social security for IDPs is overseen by the State Committee for Refugees and IDPs. 
Irrespective of their temporary residence, all IDPs enjoy social protection envisaged for 
</p>
<p>them in accordance with national legislation. They are exempted from service fees such as 
</p>
<p>electricity, natural gas and drinking water and those expenditures are settled by the State 
</p>
<p>directly to the service entities. Moreover, effective from August 2013, the amount of 
</p>
<p>funding allocated to the monthly bread allowance was increased to AZN 18.1 (equal to 
</p>
<p>US$ 23) per person/month. Those allowances are paid into bank accounts. During the 
</p>
<p>autumn-winter season, late in the year, IDPs temporarily settled in cities and regions 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 US$ 25.3 million as at 18 March 2015. 
</p>
<p> 11 US$ 15.2 million as at 18 March 2015. 
</p>
<p> 12 Almost US$ 10 million as at 21 August 2014. 
</p>
<p> 13 US$ 38 million as at 21 August 2014. 
</p>
<p> 14 See Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, &#8220;Azerbaijan: After more than 20 years, IDPs still 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>without a constant natural gas supply are provided with 40 litres of kerosene oil each 
</p>
<p>month. 
</p>
<p>37. IDPs are also exempted from a number of taxes and fees including fees for the 
issuance of their identity cards; or for submitting court applications; or for their State 
</p>
<p>license plates and driver&#8217;s licence. They also benefit from reduced taxation including for 
income taxes. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to education</b>15<b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. By virtue of the Presidential Decree of 4 August 2003, the number of IDPs receiving 
paid education is higher than the general population. In addition, the Presidential Decree of 
</p>
<p>14 September 2011 provides that, starting from the 2011/2012 academic year, tuition fees 
</p>
<p>are covered by the State budget for all IDPs admitted to bachelor and master educational 
</p>
<p>degrees at State universities on a paid basis. The Government continues to exempt all IDPs 
</p>
<p>from paying for secondary school textbooks. The Special Rapporteur notes that, although 
</p>
<p>instruction at State universities is free for IDPs who pass the entrance exams, not all are 
</p>
<p>able to afford the living costs, and it is not very easy for some IDPs to obtain access into 
</p>
<p>reputable institutions. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes that there continues to be a lack of sufficient data 
collected on IDP access to education. As also pointed out by UNHCR in its recent 
</p>
<p>participatory assessment, no comprehensive information exists on the level and quality of 
</p>
<p>education, the literacy rate among IDPs compared to the general population, access to 
</p>
<p>equipment and enrolment rates. Such data should be compiled to assess statistically the 
</p>
<p>extent and quality of education offered to IDPs. 
</p>
<p>40. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur also noted that IDPs in larger communities 
are still offered education separately from the rest of the population. Their parents are given 
</p>
<p>the choice between sending their children to mainstream schools or institutions specifically 
</p>
<p>for IDPs. The curricula are identical and in some places classes are taught in the same 
</p>
<p>building. Around 60 per cent of IDP children are educated separately.16 
</p>
<p>41. The Government&#8217;s rationale for segregated schooling is that it helps children to 
adapt to their displacement and to maintain the social fabric of displaced communities, 
</p>
<p>which in turn will make reintegration easier when they return.17 During his visit, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur heard concurring voices according to which many IDPs value and wish to retain 
</p>
<p>both their status and separate schooling, so that their children can understand their heritage 
</p>
<p>and because they find teachers in schools for IDPs more attentive and collaborative. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur cautions, however, against prolonged segregation which is 
not in the best interests of the child and the society as a whole. Special measures for 
</p>
<p>separate education may be necessary for logistical reasons in the immediate aftermath of 
</p>
<p>displacement, but the justification weakens as displacement continues, even if parents 
</p>
<p>support the practice. Segregation reinforces IDP stigmatization and their isolation from the 
</p>
<p>broader community and encourages nostalgia for the past, hampering their integration and 
</p>
<p>adding to their precarious social position. Encouraging mixed schooling with local children, 
</p>
<p>as recommended by a number of United Nations bodies18 as well as by stakeholders met 
</p>
<p>during the mission, speeds up the integration of IDP children and their parents.

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>43. Health services are extended to IDPs in the area of their temporary residence. There 
are 326 health facilities in the districts occupied by IDPs, served by 700 physicians and 
</p>
<p>2,300 nurses. The drive to meet health needs is encouraging. 
</p>
<p>44. Difficulties remain for IDPs in accessing health services owing to the limited 
availability of services and supplies in their communities; demands for unofficial payment 
</p>
<p>and the often poor quality of the services offered were cited. It was considered particularly 
</p>
<p>difficult to access health care for serious medical conditions as well as mental health 
</p>
<p>problems and reproductive health needs. When visiting certain settlements, even new ones, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur indeed noticed the lack of a systematic approach with regard to IDP 
</p>
<p>access to health care. Very often, mobile clinics cover specific areas and inside settlements, 
</p>
<p>only a small facility is available, sometimes without any practitioner present on a regular 
</p>
<p>basis. The findings of the UNHCR participatory assessment indicate that, while those 
</p>
<p>obstacles to adequate health care may be similar to problems faced by many of the non-
</p>
<p>displaced Azerbaijanis, IDPs generally are more vulnerable to health risks, mainly owing to 
</p>
<p>a combination of poor economic conditions and their current and past experiences as IDPs. 
</p>
<p>Adversely, the negative impact of poor health on the general economic and psychosocial 
</p>
<p>situation of IDPs is often more substantial for them than for the general population.19 
</p>
<p>45. According to the above-mentioned UNHCR participatory assessment, mental health 
problems and psychological stress were reported to be relatively common amongst IDPs. 
</p>
<p>However, those suffering from mental health issues generally did not receive any treatment. 
</p>
<p>In most locations, IDPs reported that they did not have access to specialist services such as 
</p>
<p>psychologists. The youth and young women in particular felt that they were in need of 
</p>
<p>somebody to talk to about their concerns, especially as they found some issues too sensitive 
</p>
<p>to be discussed with family members. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes that, despite the authorities&#8217; efforts to develop an 
action plan, the recommendations of the mental health assessment performed by the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization should be implemented fully with concrete actions to ensure more 
</p>
<p>comprehensive health services, including in the area of mental health, and increased 
</p>
<p>deployment of qualified medical staff to rural areas. 
</p>
<p>47. In close partnership with local academia, regional authorities and international 
experts, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund designed a project to initiate a system change 
in addressing the psychosocial needs of internally displaced adolescents and youth, 
</p>
<p>investing in school psychologists&#8217; capacity in Line of Contact districts to provide adequate 
counselling services, and establishing psychological supervision. The study reveals a high 
</p>
<p>dependency syndrome among IDP youth who, inter alia, have lost hope of finding a job 
</p>
<p>owing to the uncertainty over their future.20 
</p>
<p>48. Limited access to reproductive health services is a matter that has to be addressed 
urgently on the basis of principle 19, paragraph 2, of the Guiding Principles on Internal 
</p>
<p>Displacement, by which special attention should paid to the health needs of women, 
</p>
<p>including access to female care providers and services, such as reproductive health care. 
</p>
<p>Female IDPs generally have limited access to maternal and newborn health services (either 
</p>
<p>due to distance or to cost expenses).21 A related issue which needs to be dealt with is the 
</p>
<p>lack of information about family planning amongst IDP communities. The UNHCR 
</p>
<p>findings indicate that abortions were considered to be widespread and while it was difficult 
</p>
<p>for some women and most men to talk about those sensitive issues, all the women who 
</p>

<p> 19 See UNHCR, &#8220;Being an IDP in Azerbaijan&#8221; (footnote 4), p. 6. 
</p>
<p> 20 UNICEF Annual Report 2013: Azerbaijan, p. 14. 
</p>
<p> 21 See UNHCR, &#8220;Being an IDP in Azerbaijan&#8221; (footnote 4 above), p. 47. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>reported on it stated that abortions were the only form of birth control about which they 
</p>
<p>knew and to which they had access.22 
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of movement, registration and assistance 
</b></p>
<p>49. The system of registration and assistance to IDPs has implications for their freedom 
of movement and choice of place of residence. Monthly allowances and other assistance for 
</p>
<p>IDPs, including new housing, are dependent on their continued presence at their 
</p>
<p>government-registered address. By linking the provision of assistance to the registered 
</p>
<p>addresses of IDPs, the Government aims to maintain displaced communities together so 
</p>
<p>that they can reintegrate more easily upon return. At the same time, however, those 
</p>
<p>measures have a restrictive effect on the freedom of movement and choice of residence of 
</p>
<p>IDPs. In its participatory assessment, UNHCR noted that many IDPs reported that they felt 
</p>
<p>that their freedom of movement was restricted, in particular because access to assistance 
</p>
<p>and free housing tied them to their registered residence and thus hindered them from 
</p>
<p>moving to search for employment elsewhere.23 Under principle 14 of the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>on Internal Displacement, every IDP has the right to liberty of movement and freedom to 
</p>
<p>choose his or her residence. The registration and assistance of IDPs should be guided and 
</p>
<p>informed by that principle rather than restricting it. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Participation in public and political life 
</b></p>
<p>50. On the one hand, IDPs have full rights to participate in parliamentary and 
presidential elections. Administrative structures from in and around Nagorno-Karabakh 
</p>
<p>were retained and moved to areas of high concentration of IDPs. There are currently 
</p>
<p>11 deputies from Nagorno-Karabakh and seven from territories around Nagorno-Karabakh 
</p>
<p>in the Parliament (which comprises a total of 125 members).24 
</p>
<p>51. On the other hand, IDPs cannot vote in municipal council elections where they 
currently reside, thus decreasing their ability to affect local decision-making. Nor can they 
</p>
<p>stand as candidates in municipal elections in their areas of displacement. However, IDPs 
</p>
<p>can run as candidates and vote in municipal elections, but only in their areas of origin. In 
</p>
<p>those areas, local councils were suspended after the armed conflict in and around Nagorno-
</p>
<p>Karabakh. Nevertheless, the Government maintains constituencies in IDP areas of origin, in 
</p>
<p>readiness for the time when the return of IDPs will become possible. Some IDPs 
</p>
<p>themselves prefer that arrangement as part of their desire to preserve the cohesion of their 
</p>
<p>community and retain a separate voice in Parliament from other communities in their places 
</p>
<p>of displacement.  
</p>
<p>52. According to principle 22, paragraph 1 (d), of the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement, IDPs have the right to vote and to participate in governmental and public 
</p>
<p>affairs, including the right to have access to the means necessary to exercise that right. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur considers this right to be essential in that it enables IDPs to participate 
</p>
<p>in, and have influence on local politics and to campaign on local issues they deem 
</p>
<p>important on equal terms with other citizens. Their inability to take part in local politics 
</p>
<p>limits their participation in, and access to local self-governance and decision-making.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>53. As emphasized by his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the need to 
increase initiatives and promote mechanisms to engage IDPs in consultative and 
</p>
<p>participatory processes on issues affecting them (A/HRC/16/43, para. 25).  
</p>
<p><b> H. Specific needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Internally displaced women 
</b></p>
<p>54. Public engagement to promote gender equality in all spheres including education, 
housing, the right to vote and livelihood opportunities is reassuring. However, in practice, 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s participation remains limited. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to continue programmes aimed at strengthening such participation including 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurship programmes launched in partnership with the European Union.25 
</p>
<p>55. On her mission to Azerbaijan in December 2013, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences reported that internally displaced women 
</p>
<p>experienced higher rates of intimate partner violence than their counterparts in the general 
</p>
<p>population (A/HCR/16/43/Add.2, para. 8). 
</p>
<p>56. In addition, women&#8217;s access to employment, their participation in public life and 
decision-making, and their access to reproductive health services remain a concern as noted 
</p>
<p>in the section on the right to health above. Men are generally considered as the main 
</p>
<p>breadwinners in IDP communities and in general internally displaced women are reported 
</p>
<p>not to take part in income-generating activities. The main reason cited is the need for 
</p>
<p>women to stay at home and take care of their children. Adult women stated that men 
</p>
<p>generally decided on the use of family resources and some women felt that that contributed 
</p>
<p>further to their marginalization and isolation from economic and social life.26 
</p>
<p>57. Women&#8217;s access to health care, and in particular to reproductive health care, has 
already been urgently called for above. Related is the issue of family planning. Concern for 
</p>
<p>the latter was raised with the Special Rapporteur by UNFPA as well as UNHCR. According 
</p>
<p>to the UNHCR participatory assessment, in all locations visited, limited access to both 
</p>
<p>reproductive health services and information about reproductive health issues was raised by 
</p>
<p>all groups of females between 14 and 60 years old as well as some of the younger men (18&#8211;
24, 25&#8211;39). In addition, internally displaced women in rural areas usually have to travel far 
to give birth owing to a lack of maternal care facilities nearby. All women interviewed also 
</p>
<p>mentioned that abortion was the only form of birth control.27 Abortion must not be a form 
</p>
<p>of birth control; it carries risks for the health, and especially the reproductive health, of 
</p>
<p>women and their psychological well-being. Adequate provision has to be made for family 
</p>
<p>planning and reproductive health care for women and men. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur adds his voice to those of the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW/C/AZE/CO/4, para. 38) and the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on violence against women28 and encourages the Government to implement 
</p>
<p>measures to improve access to education, employment and health and reproductive health 
</p>
<p>care for internally displaced women and girls, and to consult them on their specific needs 
</p>
<p>and all processes that affect them. All the necessary measures should be taken to increase 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s self-reliance, the quality of their well-being and family life and their contribution 
to the welfare of their communities.

<p><b>  Internally displaced children  
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes that since his predecessor&#8217;s last visit, discrimination 
between children of internally displaced women and internally displaced men has remained 
</p>
<p>an issue. A child whose father is registered, but whose mother is not, is eligible to be 
</p>
<p>registered as an IDP and is entitled to the benefits that registration affords. The same is true 
</p>
<p>of the children of divorced, widowed and unmarried women who are registered as IDPs. 
</p>
<p>However, a child whose mother is registered, but whose father is not, is not eligible.29 The 
</p>
<p>result is that internally displaced children are treated differently based on whether their 
</p>
<p>father has been registered or not. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government says its stance is based on the fact that when internally displaced 
women marry, they move to and are registered at their husband&#8217;s residence, as are their 
children. Men who have not been displaced have property and housing, meaning that their 
</p>
<p>children do not need to be registered as IDPs. Children born to men with IDP registration 
</p>
<p>are registered at their father&#8217;s place of origin. In fact that practice entrenches male 
patriarchy and the Special Rapporteur recommends that to avoid such discrimination 
</p>
<p>registration and treatment of IDP children should be granted according to their needs. 
</p>
<p><b>  IDPs with disabilities and others with special needs 
</b></p>
<p>61. IDPs with disabilities, older persons and those with other special needs often face 
particular challenges owing to their condition. While they are included in national 
</p>
<p>programmes, there are few targeted measures to identify and respond to their particular 
</p>
<p>situations. United Nations treaty bodies (the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination in particular) have recommended that the Government ensure timely 
</p>
<p>consultations with IDPs on its plans for them, with channels for their voices to be heard and 
</p>
<p>particular attention to women&#8217;s participation.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Search for durable solutions for internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>62. Achieving a durable solution enables IDPs to resume their normal life. Principles 
28&#8211;30 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement make provision for durable 
solutions and the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons 
</p>
<p>provides guidance on how to achieve durable solutions, which is often a complex process. 
</p>
<p>Solutions can only be considered to be &#8220;durable&#8221; if they are sustainable and a number of 
conditions are fulfilled, including enjoyment by the persons concerned of the protection of 
</p>
<p>the State of nationality (for citizens) or residence; the voluntariness of the decision to 
</p>
<p>return, integrate locally, or settle elsewhere within a country; the prevalence of safety and 
</p>
<p>security in areas of settlement or return; real prospects for restitution of or compensation for 
</p>
<p>lost property; non-discrimination in the enjoyment of rights and equal access to public 
</p>
<p>services and economic opportunities.30 
</p>
<p>63. In the current context, which has remained unchanged since the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor in 2010, the prospect of return as a durable solution for IDPs in 
Azerbaijan who wish to return to their homes or places of habitual residence remains 
</p>
<p>remote, pending the &#8220;Great Return Programme&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur therefore 
encourages dialogue on the Programme and urges the international community and all 
</p>
<p>parties to work towards reaching a peace settlement regarding the unresolved armed 
</p>
<p>conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region, with the aim of fully restoring the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 29 Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, &#8220;Azerbaijan&#8221;, p. 8.  
</p>
<p> 30 See UNHCR, Global Protection Cluster Working Group, <i>Handbook for the Protection of Internally 
</i></p>
<p><i>Displaced Persons</i> (June 2010) (www.unhcr.org/4c2355229.html). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>human rights of IDPs in Azerbaijan, in particular their right to voluntary return in safety 
</p>
<p>and dignity, if they so wish. He calls on the international community&#8217;s support to achieve 
that goal,31 while keeping open local integration and settlement elsewhere in the country as 
</p>
<p>options for those IDPs who may wish to choose those as durable solutions for themselves. 
</p>
<p>64. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, State officials extensively referred to the 
Great Return Programme announced by the Government as of 2005 and which was to assert 
</p>
<p>the principle of voluntary return in the context of an eventual settlement of the armed 
</p>
<p>conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Special Rapporteur is under the 
</p>
<p>impression that the plan is yet to be made public and shared with relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>including United Nations agencies in the country. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
</p>
<p>Government to make the plan public and to use the expertise of development organizations 
</p>
<p>and United Nations agencies to establish conditions of normality that would allow IDPs to 
</p>
<p>return voluntarily and in safety and dignity. There are complex issues about addressing 
</p>
<p>property issues, ensuring the issuance of demining certificates, increasing the capacity of 
</p>
<p>relevant actors (A/HRC/16/43/Add.2, para. 65), building all other necessary infrastructure 
</p>
<p>and facilitating the coexistence in a spirit of reconciliation between returning IDPs and the 
</p>
<p>communities living in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reiterates his offer to provide his expertise and he remains available should the Government 
</p>
<p>wish to consult him on the content of the Programme. The Government mentioned that the 
</p>
<p>Programme included a transition period of three years during which IDPs would continue to 
</p>
<p>receive social allowances and incentives to help them reintegrate and start new livelihood 
</p>
<p>opportunities.  
</p>
<p>65. While most IDPs and representatives of IDPs that the Special Rapporteur met during 
his visit did indeed mention return to their place of origin as the best option for a durable 
</p>
<p>solution, that does not provide  sufficient grounds to conclude that all IDPs wish to return 
</p>
<p>to their place of origin. The Special Rapporteur therefore insists that all durable solutions 
</p>
<p>should remain as options open to IDPs and that, as already recommended by his 
</p>
<p>predecessor, a comprehensive survey of intent of all IDPs be carried out to fully determine 
</p>
<p>their intent and which option would be most suitable for each of them. In that regard, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur insists that while the Government&#8217;s preference remains the return of 
IDPs to their place of origin, that preference does not absolve the Government from the 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure the self-reliance of IDPs and the possibility for them to integrate 
</p>
<p>locally if they so wish. 
</p>
<p>66. In line with his predecessor&#8217;s recommendation, the Special Rapporteur insists on a 
comprehensive needs assessment to differentiate between the levels of need of the persons 
</p>
<p>who have been displaced for the past 20 years. Not all IDPs have the same needs and the 
</p>
<p>only way to ensure that those who require special attention are adequately identified is 
</p>
<p>through such a comprehensive assessment. The rights, needs and legitimate interests of 
</p>
<p>IDPs must guide all future policies and decisions on internal displacement and durable 
</p>
<p>solutions, including the new State programme for IDPs for 2015&#8211;2020 so as to promote 
IDP self-reliance and full social integration while they wait to be able to return, if they so 
</p>
<p>wish. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur called the attention of the Government to the 
</p>
<p>need to adopt a development rights-based approach that includes IDPs in development 
</p>
<p>planning strategies, including the national consultation processes of the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda, in the areas of housing, education, health and employment to 
</p>
<p>strengthen their resilience, livelihood opportunities and self-reliance. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 On 30 May 2014, the Special Rapporteur addressed the Security Council in the framework of the 
</p>
<p>Arria formula. The message he conveyed was for the international community to revisit such 
</p>
<p>unresolved conflicts and for the Security Council to ensure implementation of its pertinent 
</p>
<p>resolutions, particularly Security Council resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 
</p>
<p>(1993). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>67. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur commends the Government for the efforts 
already made to ensure that IDPs have equal access to all human rights. The Government 
</p>
<p>has not only worked towards an improvement of IDP rights, especially in the areas of 
</p>
<p>housing, education, livelihood and social security, but it has also raised awareness on 
</p>
<p>displacement, collected some data, and trained officials on IDP rights. It has also adopted a 
</p>
<p>number of laws to ensure increased protection of IDPs.  
</p>
<p>68. With regard to the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur 
notes, however, that while newly built settlements offer rather stable housing conditions for 
</p>
<p>IDPs, the discourse remains that IDPs are only temporarily &#8220;hosted&#8221; in those settlements 
until they are able to return to their place of origin. In order to widen their livelihood 
</p>
<p>opportunities, the Special Rapporteur thus recommends that the Government expand the 
</p>
<p>housing options for IDPs to include purchase certificates through which IDPs could find 
</p>
<p>and buy their own accommodation, the allocation of government-purchased apartments and 
</p>
<p>houses, financial assistance to build their own housing, and rental subsidies to enable IDPs 
</p>
<p>to rent inside neighbourhoods. Those incentives will certainly reduce the feeling of 
</p>
<p>stigmatization expressed by IDPs in the recent surveys carried out by agencies such as 
</p>
<p>UNHCR and the World Bank. 
</p>
<p>69. Consultation and participation of IDPs in processes that affect them could be 
improved. The Government has not established mechanisms to ensure consultation with 
</p>
<p>IDP or their participation in decision-making, and their meaningful involvement in 
</p>
<p>reconciliation processes has not been facilitated.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons 
welcomes the continuous progress made by the Government of Azerbaijan in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>search for durable solutions for all IDPs in the country. </b>In line with his predecessor&#8217;s 
<b>observations, he commends the Government for its dedication to the issue and for 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuing to assume the primary responsibility for the protection and assistance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons internally displaced by the armed conflict in and around the Nagorno-
</b></p>
<p><b>Karabakh region. That continues to be accompanied by the necessary budget 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocations.</b> 
</p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers that further joint efforts are still necessary 
to overcome the obstacles to durable solutions. In that spirit, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>presents the following conclusions and recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p>72. <b>One of the main obstacles in the search for durable solutions for IDPs in 
Azerbaijan remains the absence of a political settlement to the unresolved armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region, as has already been observed 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the previous mandate holder in his reports. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties concerned as well as the international community to work towards such a goal.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Reaching a peaceful settlement to the unresolved conflict is critical to resolving the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protracted situation of internal displacement, which has lasted more than 20 years in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Azerbaijan.</b> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur also calls upon all parties to approach durable 
solutions from a humanitarian and development perspective and to take all the 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary measures to ensure that all IDPs can exercise their right to make a free and 
</b></p>
<p><b>informed decision as to whether to return voluntarily to their homes in safety and 
</b></p>
<p><b>dignity, to integrate locally or to resettle elsewhere in the country.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends the participation of IDPs in all 
processes that affect them. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur strongly encourages 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government to work towards strengthening the climate of greater freedom, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>consultation and participation, which are all conducive to participation in public life, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as determining processes for the achievement of durable solutions.</b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>New opportunities currently exist for the adoption of an inclusive integrated 
approach for IDPs in Azerbaijan, in accordance with the international standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>contained in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The new opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>include the Great Return Programme, yet to be shared; the next State Programme for 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs to begin in 2015 and the formulation by the Government of inclusive policies in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the fields of housing, health, land, agriculture, education and employment-generating 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government share those 
</b></p>
<p><b>draft documents and plans with interested stakeholders so as to gain support and 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable systematic and coherent approaches to durable solutions for IDPs. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration of the goals of the post-2015 agenda into durable solutions is an important 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspect as well. As mentioned during his visit, the Special Rapporteur stands available 
</b></p>
<p><b>to provide his expertise on the Great Return and the State Programmes at the 
</b></p>
<p>Government&#8217;s request. 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the continuing commitment by State 
authorities to improving the living conditions of IDPs by ensuring access to housing 
</b></p>
<p><b>for those who were displaced as a result of the armed conflict in and around the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nagorno-Karabakh region. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur commends the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government and, in particular, the Deputy Prime Minister and the State Committee 
</b></p>
<p><b>for IDPs and Refugees for the efforts made to build new settlements for IDPs.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur insists, however, that access to housing can be made 
durable only through a needs-based approach and on the basis of consultation with 
</b></p>
<p><b>those concerned. The Special Rapporteur therefore encourages the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>share information relating to the enhancement of living conditions and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>livelihood measures with IDPs, especially women, but also international partners and 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society. He advocates the importance of diversifying alternative housing 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies to include access to ownership of property or rental subsidies to facilitate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the integration of IDPs where they are if they so wish.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur further considers that there is an urgent need to 
improve the living conditions and livelihood opportunities of IDPs who are still living 
</b></p>
<p><b>in collective centres in dire conditions. </b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that most IDPs still suffer from stigma 
and do not enjoy equal access to livelihood opportunities. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government perform a countrywide needs-based assessment to 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand the causes for such inequalities and better respond to the needs of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned, including by carrying out a survey of intent on the part of IDPs. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government integrate IDPs into broader 
</b></p>
<p><b>development plans and initiatives, rather than developing a comprehensive strategy 
</b></p>
<p><b>on livelihoods for IDPs only, so as to increase their resilience and chances of 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration in society, and decrease their dependency on government assistance in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>longer run. Particular attention should be paid to specific categories of IDPs in need 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as the youth, women in general, and female-headed households in particular.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates </b>his predecessor&#8217;s recommendation that a 
<b>study on the quality of education at schools for IDPs, access to education, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>performance of students and their views on the schools would be useful in better 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding their needs and problems, with the ultimate aim of ensuring they 
</b></p>
<p><b>become integrated members of society. </b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>In the light of the efforts which still need to be made to ensure adequate access 
to health care for IDPs as well as for the overall population, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>insists on the importance of carrying out a general assessment on access to health care 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Azerbaijan to tailor the response to requirements. The Special Rapporteur also </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>reiterates his pred</b>ecessor&#8217;s recommendation to implement the recommendations of 
<b>the mental health assessment of the World Health Organization. He further 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends paying greater attention to access to reproductive health, which remains 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical in Azerbaijan. </b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that the registration system has remained 
</b>unchanged since his predecessor&#8217;s <b>last visit. He reiterates the need to change the 
current legislation so as to enable IDPs to vote in their current places of residence.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government ensure effective 
monitoring of the protection of the human rights of the IDPs who live near the Line of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Contact. Furthermore, in line with principle 2 of the Guiding Principles on Internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Displacement, he recommends that all authorities ensure the full enjoyment of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of those IDPs, including the rights relating to freedom of movement and 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to livelihoods.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that all durable solutions should remain as 
options available to IDPs. Particular attention should be paid to IDPs with specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs such as women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities, to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they are able to fully enjoy their rights concerning their protection and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures taken to assist them, including durable solutions.</b>
