SUMMARY
Gold  Standard  Ventures  Corp.’s  (“Gold  Standard”  or  the  “Company”  or  “GSV”)  Railroad  and
Pinion Project is located at the southeast end of the Carlin (Gold) Trend, a northwest alignment of
sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold  deposits  in  northeastern  Nevada.    More  than  40  separate  gold
deposits have been delineated along the Carlin Trend where past production exceeds 80 million
ounces of gold (Muntean, 2014).  The Project is centered on the fourth and southernmost dome-
shaped  window  on  the  Carlin  Trend  in  the  Piñon  Range  (Jackson  and  Koehler,  2014).  The
domes  are  cored  by  igneous  intrusions  that  uplift  and  expose  Paleozoic  rocks  and  certain
stratigraphic contacts that are favorable for the formation of Carlin-style gold deposits.
 
Gold Standard controls a significant and largely contiguous land position of about 28,553 gross
acres  (11,555  hectares)  in  Elko  County,  Nevada  referred  to  as  the  Railroad  and  Pinion
Project.  This Technical Report is intended to summarize recent work from early 2014 through to
September,  2014  at  the  Pinion  portion  of  the  Project  including  drilling,  and  other  exploration
activities  by  GSV  culminating 
the  Pinion  Gold
Deposit.  Recently (see GSV News Release dated March 5th, 2014), GSV acquired the portions
of the Pinion Gold Project that it did not control but were controlled by Scorpio Gold Corporation
(“Scorpio”).
in  a  maiden  resource  estimate
for
The  Railroad  and  Pinion  Project  are  in  the  Piñon  Range  in  the  Railroad  Mining  District  of
northeastern  Nevada.    The  Project  consists  of  28,553  gross  acres  (11,555  hectares)  of
subsurface  mineral  rights  with  a  total  of  14,588  acres  (5,904  hectares)  that  are  owned  100
percent  (%)  as  patented  or  unpatented  lode  claims,  and  a  further  13,965  gross  acres  (5,651
hectares) in subsurface mineral rights for private lands.  The private land ownership ranges from
49.2% to 100% yielding a net position of 12,031 acres (4,869 hectares) of subsurface mineral
rights for the private lands within the Railroad and Pinion Project Area. The Company is pursuing
the  minority  interests  in  the  key  private  land  parcels.    The  subsurface  minerals  rights  for  the
private  lands  are  held  under  contractual  arrangement  via  ‘Surface  Use  Agreement  with
Conditional Purchase Option’, ‘Mining Lease and Agreement’, and ‘Mineral Lease Agreement’
contracts.  The Pinion portion of the Project is comprised of a total of 8,416 gross acres (3,382
hectares) of controlled subsurface mineral interests with ownership ranging from 49.2% to 100%..
The  Railroad  Mining  District  was  intermittently  active  with  copper,  lead,  silver,  zinc,  and  gold
production from 1869 until the early 1960’s.  Modern exploration began in the late 1960’s.  Since
that time fifteen companies have  preceded  GSV  completing  district-wide  exploration  including
surface mapping, geochemical sampling and drilling at the Railroad and Pinion Project areas.
Details of this historic exploration including the collection of more than 3,500 rock samples, 6,200
soil samples and the completion of 382 drill holes is described in detail by Hunsaker  (2010,
2012a,b), Shaddrick (2012) and Koehler et al. (2014).
Exploration work completed by Gold Standard since 2010 at the Railroad Project has confirmed
and expanded previously identified zones of mineralization and has resulted in the discovery of
several new zones and styles of mineralization. Currently, the following styles of mineralization
have  been  identified  at  the  Railroad  Project:  1)  classic  Carlin-style  disseminated  gold  in
carbonate dissolution collapse breccia at the North Bullion deposit; 2) stacked, tabular oxide gold
and copper zones in quartz hornfels breccia at the Bald Mountain Target; and 3) skarn-hosted
silver, copper, lead and zinc mineralization at the Central Bullion Target (Jackson and Koehler,
2014).
Detailed discussion of the results of the exploration programs conducted by GSV at the Railroad
Project from 2010 to early 2014 are provided by Hunsaker  (2010, 2012a,b), Shaddrick (2012)
and Koehler et al. (2014). Gold Standard has collected more than 2,500 rock samples and 1,400
soil  samples,  and  has  completed  geological  mapping  along  with  extensive  gravity  and
Controlled Source Audio-Frequency Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) surveys culminating in the drilling
of  110 drill holes.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
Gold Standard’s work at the railroad Project through to early 2014 has identified thirteen target
areas that warrant further work and are primarily focused on gold, but also include silver, copper,
lead  and  zinc.    Eight  of  these  targets  have  been  drilled  by  Gold  Standard.    Although  Gold
Standard has drilled and conducted extensive work in these areas, and historic work has been
done  in  others,  sampling  and  drilling  of  sufficient  density  to  determine  the  distribution  and
continuity of gold mineralization at most of the targets at the Railroad Project is not yet sufficient
to formally establish or estimate a mineral resource any mineral resources at this time.
Drill  results  during  2012  and  2013  confirmed  and  expanded  a  significant  Carlin-style,
disseminated gold system at the North Bullion Target, and identified new mineralized zones at
the  Bald  Mountain  and  Central  Bullion  targets.  Drilling  at  North  Bullion  has  been  focused  on
expanding a zone of gold mineralization within the “lower collapse breccia” where, in the opinion
of the authors of this Technical Report,  sufficient  data  now  exists  to  warrant  an  initial  mineral
resource estimate.  Continued drilling on the Bald Mountain and Central Bullion Targets is also
warranted based on early-stage drill results.  Early-stage results from other target areas indicate
that additional geologic work and drilling is also warranted on the Railroad Project (Koehler et
al., 2014)
In January, 2014, Gold Standard announced that it entered into an agreement with Scorpio to
acquire the remaining portion of the highly prospective Pinion Project area which is contiguous to
the south end of the Company’s Railroad Gold Project. The acquisition of Scorpio’s complete
Pinion land position, where GSV previously held a minority interest in several sections including
portions of the Pinion Gold Deposit, completes the Company’s efforts to consolidate the mineral
rights for the greater Railroad District under a single operator. The acquisition of a 100% interest
in the Pinion Gold Deposit and large portions of the surrounding area represents an important
near surface exploration target.
 
The geological understanding of the Pinion mineralization from historic work indicates that the
Pinion Deposit is similar in character to Newmont’s currently producing Emigrant Mine located
approximately 11 miles (17 kilometers) to the north. The Pinion Gold Deposit occurs within the
southern portion of the Bullion Fault Corridor, which also hosts Gold Standard’s North Bullion
discovery  at  the  Railroad  Project.  Similar  to  the  Emigrant  Deposit,  the  Pinion  Deposit  gold
mineralization occurs in an oxidized collapse-style breccia developed along the contact between
Mississippian siliciclastic rocks and the underlying Devonian Devils Gate Formation limestone.
Based  upon  a  detailed  review  of  the  Pinion  drill  hole  database,  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit  has
grade  similar  in  tenor  if  not  slightly  higher  to  that  of  Newmont’s  Emigrant  Deposit,  along  with
significant amounts of silver. The Pinion Gold Deposit is significantly if not entirely oxidized in
character and the northern portion of the deposit is exposed at surface.
 
During 2014, GSV initiated a re-logging and re-sampling program of historic Pinion area reverse
circulation  (RC)  drill  hole  chips  and  historic  drill  core,  along  with  the  completion  of  a  13  hole
drilling program designed to provide confidence in the existing drill hole database as well as test
certain concepts such as the presence of faults and thickened stratabound mineralization in and
around certain fault structures.
 
The Phase 1 2014 drill program results met the three key objectives of the program: verifying
historic  drill  data,  expanding  the  previously  known  limits  of  the  gold  mineralization  and
confirming the key elements of  GSV’s new geological model for mineralization.
 
The main gold host, a multi-lithic, dissolution collapse breccia, was intersected in all 2014 drill
holes.  Gold mineralization is continuous and widespread within this highly permeable, silicified
and oxidized breccia which is favorably sandwiched between relatively impermeable silty micrite
of  the  overlying  Mississippian  Tripon  Pass  Formation  and  thick,  bedded  calcarenite  of  the
underlying Devonian Devil’s Gate Formation. Highlights of the 2014 Pinion Deposit drill holes
are provided in Table 1.1.

Results from the 2014 drilling confirm that the collapse breccia hosted oxide gold zone at Pinion
is very widespread and continuous with the system remaining open in several directions.  The
intercepts in PIN14-06 and PIN14-11 demonstrate that breccia development and mineralization
thicken and strengthen adjacent to high angle fault zones and fault intersections.
 
Based  upon  a  thorough  review  and  validation  of  the  existing  historic  drill  hole  database
combined with the 2014 drilling the authors of this Technical Report (and GSV) concluded that
the drill hole spacing, the overall density of drilling and associated drill hole data, along with the
continuity  of  intersected  gold  mineralization  is  of  sufficient  quality  to  conduct  an  NI  43-101
mineral resource estimate for the Pinion Gold Deposit
 
The  statistical  analysis,  geological  modelling  and  resource  estimation  discussed  in  this
Technical  Report  were  performed  by  Mr.  Steven  Nicholls,  BA  Sc.,  M  AIG,  under  the  direct
supervision of Mr. Michael Dufresne, M.Sc., P. Geol., P.Geo., both of whom are with APEX.  Both
are Qualified Persons as defined by National Instrument (NI) 43-101. Mineral resource modelling
and  estimation  was  carried  out  using  a  3-dimensional  block  model  based  on  geostatistical
applications  using  MICROMINE  (v14.0.6),  a  commercially  available  resource  estimation  and
mine planning software.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The Pinion Mineral Resource estimate is reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities
Administrators  NI  43-101  and  has  been  estimated  using  the  CIM  “Estimation  of  Mineral
Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practice  Guidelines”  dated  November  23rd,  2003  and
CIM “Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves” dated November 27th,
2010.  Mineral  resources  are  not  mineral  reserves  and  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic
viability. There is no guarantee that any part of the mineral resource discussed in this Technical
Report will be converted into a mineral reserve in the future.
Modeling was conducted in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate space relative to
the  North  American  Datum  (NAD)  1927  and  UTM  Zone  11.  The  Pinion  resource  modeling
utilized 392 drill holes that were completed from 1981 to 2014. Mr. Dufresne visited the property
in May, 2013, April, 2014 and October, 2014 in order to verify and validate the historic drill hole
database and to verify the drilling of the recently completed 2014 core and RC holes completed
by GSV.  Over the period of the last 8 months, APEX personnel were intimately involved in the
verification, validation, drill hole collar surveying and QA/QC analysis of the entire Pinion drill
hole database. It is the opinion of the authors of this Technical Report that the drill hole database
is  deemed  of  good  enough  quality  to  create  an  accurate  geological  interpretation  and  model,
including the construction of mineralization wireframes, and complete a statistical analysis and
resource estimate.
The predominantly oxide gold-silver mineralization has been estimated within three dimensional
solids that were created from cross-sectional lode interpretation. The upper contact has been cut
by the topographic surface.  There is little to no significant overburden present at the Pinion Gold
Deposit.  Grade was estimated into a block model with parent block size of 10 m (X) by 10 m (Y)
by  3  m  (Z)  and  sub-blocked  down  to  5  m  (X)  by  5  m  (Y)  by  1  m  (Z).    A  total  of  171  density
measurements  made  during  2014  on  diamond  drill  core  samples.  These  measurements  in
combination  with  historic  results  yield  an  average  nominal  density  of  2.58  kg/m3  for  gold
mineralization hosted in the multi-lithic collapse breccia.  Grade estimation of gold and silver was
performed using the Inverse Distance squared (ID2) methodology.  The indicated and inferred
resources are constrained within a drilled area that extends approximately 2.3 km along strike to
the north-northwest, 1.1 km across strike to the east-northeast and 400 m below surface.
The 2014 Pinion mineral resource has been classified as comprising both Indicated and Inferred
resources according to the CIM definition standards. The classification of the Pinion Indicated
and  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  was  based  on  geological  confidence,  data  quality  and  grade
continuity.  The most relevant factors used in the classification process were:
· Drill hole spacing density.
·Level  of  confidence  in  the  geological  interpretation,  which  is  a  result  of  the  extensive  re  –
logging of drill chips.  The observed stratigraphic horizons are easily identifiable along strike and
across the deposit which provides confidence in the geological and mineralization continuity.
· Estimation parameters i.e. continuity of mineralization
·  Proximity to the recently completed 2014 drill holes.
All  mineral  resources  reported  are  reported  within  an  optimized  pit  shell  using 
the
$US1,250/ounce  for  gold  and  $US21.50/ounce  for  silver.    The  volume  and  tonnage  for  the
reported resources within the $1,250/ounce of gold optimized pit shell represents approximately
82% of the total tonnage of the unconstrained block model (utilizing a lower cutoff of 0.1 g/t Au).

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The Mineral Resource Estimates are reported at a range of gold cut-offs grades in Table 1.2 and
Table 1.3 for both Indicated and Inferred categories, for gold and silver respectively.  No portion
of  the  current  mineral  resource  has  been  assigned  to  the  “Measured”  category.    The  Pinion
Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  uses  a  lower  cut-off  grade  of  0.14  g/t  Au,  which  is
constrained within an optimised pit shell and includes an Indicated Mineral Resource of 20.84
million  tonnes  at  0.63  g/t  Au  for  a  total  of  423,000  ounces  of  gold  and  an  additional  Inferred
Mineral resource of 55.93 million tonnes at 0.57 g/t Au for 1.022 million ounces of gold.  The base
case cut-off of 0.14 g/t Au is highlighted in each table.  Other cut-off grades are presented for
review ranging from 0.1 g/t Au to 1.0 g/t Au for sensitivity analysis. The current reported mineral
resource reports only oxide mineral resources.

At the Pinion Project area, further drilling is recommended in order to expand upon and upgrade
the  confidence  in  the  current  NI  43-101  oxide  mineral  resources  for  the  Pinion  Gold
Deposit.  Several areas of potential shallow oxide gold mineralization remain to be tested at the
south and southeast end of the deposit and at the north end of the deposit. Drill testing of the
Dark Star prospect and structural trend is also recommended.  Additional metallurgical test work
is  recommended  for  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit.    This  work  should  be  performed  on  materials
resulting from the recommended drill program as well as on archived drill core recently acquired
by  Gold  Standard.  Further  field  work  comprising  geological,  geochemical  and  geophysical
surveys  is  recommended  for  the  Pinion  Deposit  area  where  there  are  data  gaps  and  for  the
remainder of the Pinion Project area with particular attention paid to the Dark Star prospect east
of the Pinion Gold Deposit and the JR Butte-Papoose trend located west-southwest of the Pinion
Deposit.
At present, ground geophysical surveys are somewhat discontinuous.  Given the effectiveness of
detailed gravity, magnetic and electromagnetic techniques in identifying structures that may be
associated with gold mineralization on the property and the recent expansion of the Project area,
it is recommended that Gold Standard consider conducting a detailed magnetic and, possibly, an
electromagnetic airborne geophysical survey over the entire project area in order to assist with
the  delineation  of  structural  targets.  Further  ground  gravity  and  CSAMT  surveys  are  strongly
recommended.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The  authors  recommend  a  total  of  36,576  m  (120,000  feet)  of  a  combination  of  RC  and  core
drilling  in  phased  drilling  at  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit  and  at  a  variety  of  targets  across  Gold
Standard’s Pinion Project area for a total cost of $US7,200,000. Other recommended property
wide  activities  include  geological  mapping,  geochemical  sampling,  ground  and  airborne
geophysical surveys, further metallurgical test work along with geological modeling leading to
and  updated  resource  estimate  and  preliminary  engineering  and  environmental  studies.  The
estimated cost to conduct these studies is $US1,300,000 and along with a contingency of 10%,
yields an overall budget to complete the recommended work of $US9,350,000.

2.0           INTRODUCTION
 
2.1           General
 
Gold  Standard  Ventures  Corp.  (Gold  Standard  or  “GSV”)  is  a  Vancouver-based  mineral
exploration Company, listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange (TSX.V:GSV) in Canada and on
the New York Stock exchange (NYSE MKT:GSV) in the United States.
The Company controls a significant and largely contiguous land position of about 28,553 acres
(11,555 hectares) in Elko County, Nevada (“NV”) referred to as the Railroad and Pinion Projects
displayed on Figure 2.1 (“Railroad”, “Pinion” or the “Project”).  The Railroad-Pinion Project in its
entirety  was  the  subject  of  a  recent  Technical  Report  by  Koehler et  al.  (2014).  The  Railroad
Project has been the focus of ongoing exploration work by GSV since 2010.  Recently (see GSV
News Release dated March 5th, 2014 and the Property section of this report), GSV acquired the
portions  of  the  Pinion  Gold  Project  that  it  did  not  control  but  were  controlled  by  Scorpio  Gold
Corporation (“Scorpio”).  The Pinion Project is located immediately south of, and is contiguous
with, the Railroad Project (Figure 2.1). Any references in this report to either “the Property” or “the
Project” means the entire Railroad-Pinion Property or Project.  Any reference to “Pinion” or “the
deposit”  refers  to  the  Pinion  zone  of  gold  mineralization  that  is  the  subject  of  this  Technical
Report, which is located in the southern portion of the Railroad-Pinion Property (see the Property
section of this report for additional information).
Exploration  at  the  Pinion  project  by  GSV  commenced  in  March,  2014  and  is  ongoing.  This
Technical Report is intended to summarize recent work that was focused on the Pinion Project
including geological compilation and interpretation of historic data, re-logging and re-sampling of
historic chips and core, new geological modeling, a 13 hole confirmation drill program and an
initial resource estimate.
The  Railroad-Pinion  Project  is  being  explored  for  “Carlin-type”  sedimentary  rock  hosted  gold
mineralization by GSV and is currently at an intermediate to advanced stage of exploration. The
Project  is  hosted  within  a  favourable  structural,  geological  and  stratigraphic  setting  that  is
situated  at  the  southeast  end  of  the  Carlin  (Gold)  Trend,  for  which  the  deposit  model  type  is
named. More than 40 separate gold deposits have been delineated along the Carlin Trend where
past production exceeds 80 million ounces of gold (Muntean, 2014).
 
2.2           Terms of Reference
 
The  primary  author  of  this  report,  Mr.  Michael  Dufresne,  M.Sc.,  P.Geol.,  P.Geo.,  of  APEX

Gold Standard retained APEX in February, 2014 with the intent to oversee the 2014 work at the
Pinion Project and complete a maiden resource estimate, which is the subject of this Technical
Report. Mr. Dufresne and Mr. Turner conducted a field visit to the Pinion Project on May 1st and
2nd, 2013 and have reviewed historical data and reports and are responsible for the preparation
of all sections of this Technical Report, which has been written in compliance with the standards
set  out  in  NI  43-101,  its  Companion  Policy  43-101CP  and  Form  43-101F1  of  the  Canadian
Securities Administration (CSA).  In addition, Mr. Dufresne conducted further site visits in April
and October, 2014, during which he validated the collar locations of the 2014 Pinion drill program
and core and cuttings from the program as well as a number of historic drill holes that were part of
the extensive re-logging and re-sampling work that has been completed by GSV.
The resource estimate presented in this Technical Report was prepared by Mr. Steven Nicholls,
BA Sc., MAIG, a Senior Resource Geologist with APEX and a Qualified Person, under the direct
supervision of Mr. Dufresne and Mr. Turner, and was completed in compliance with the standards
set  out  in  National  Instrument  (NI)  43-101  and  the  standards  established  by  the  Canadian
Institute of Mining (CIM).
The  Technical  Report  is  a  compilation  of  proprietary  and  publicly  available  information.  The
authors, in writing this Report, used sources of information from previous explorers which appear
to have been completed in a manner consistent with normal exploration practices and hence they
have no reason not to rely on such historic data and information as listed in the ‘References’
section based upon the exploration conducted by Gold Standard to date and the property visits
by the authors. A large portion of the background information for prior exploration and geology
comes from work performed on and in the vicinity of the property by a number of companies and
detailed  by  Hunsaker  (2010,  2012a,b),    Shaddrick  (2012)  and  Koehler et  al.  (2014).  The
supporting  documents  which  were  used  as  background  information  are  referenced  in  the

4.0           PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
 
 
4.1           Description and Location
 
The Railroad – Pinion Project straddles the Piñon Range in the Railroad Mining District at the
southeast end of the Carlin (Gold) Trend, a northwest-southeast trending belt of gold mines and
deposits  in  northern  Nevada  (Figure  2.1).    With  the  recently  completed  acquisition  of  the
remaining portions of the Pinion Project area that GSV did not own adjoining the southern end of
the  Company’s  original  Railroad  Project  (see  GSV  press  release  dated  March  5,  2014),  the
company  now  has  effective  control  of  the  mineral  rights  for  28,553  (gross)  acres  (11,555
hectares) of land in Elko County, Nevada.  The Project is located in Elko County in sections 8,
10, 15 to 22 and 27to 35 (in Township 31N; Range 53E), sections 1 to 10, 13 to 29, 31, 33 and 35
(in Township 30N; Range 53E), sections 24 and 36 (in Township 31N; Range 52E), and section
12 (in Township 30N; Range 52E) as shown in Figure 4.1.
As of September 1, 2014, Gold Standard owns or has an option on the ownership of a total of
14,588  acres  (5,904  hectares)  of  subsurface  mineral  rights  in  the  form  of  patented  and
unpatented mineral lodes (claims) now covered by the Railroad – Pinion Project Area of Interest
as shown in Figure 4.1 and detailed in Koehler at al. (2014). Also, included in the project is a
total of 13,965 gross acres (5,651 hectares) of subsurface mineral rights secured or controlled by
a contractual interest in private surface and mineral property, held via ‘Surface Use Agreement
with  Conditional  Purchase  Option’,  ‘Mining  Lease  and  Agreement’,  and  ‘Mineral  Lease
Agreement’ contracts (Figure 4.1). The details of these contracts are beyond the scope of this
report, however, further information on these contracts can be provided by the Company. Gold
Standard holds an interest in the subsurface mineral rights for the private lands that ranges from
49.2%  to  100%  as  shown  in  Figure  4.1.  Gold  Standard’s  total  net  interest  in  the  subsurface
mineral  rights  for  the  private  lands  totals  12,031  acres  (4,869  hectares).  The  Company  is
pursuing the minority interest for a number of parcels where they hold less than a 100% interest.
Gold Standards Pinion Project area is comprised of a total of 2,945 acres (1,191 hectares) of
subsurface mineral rights in the form of unpatented mineral lodes (claims) as shown in Figure
4.2.  Also,  included  in  the  Pinion  Project  is  a  total  of  5,416  gross  acres  (2,191  hectares)  of
subsurface mineral rights secured or controlled by a contractual interest in private surface and
mineral property, held via ‘Surface Use Agreement with Conditional Purchase Option’, ‘Mining
Lease  and  Agreement’,  and  ‘Mineral  Lease  Agreement’  contracts  (Figure  4.2).  Gold  Standard
holds an interest in the subsurface mineral rights for the private lands that ranges from 49.2% to
100% as shown in Figure 4.2. Gold Standard’s total net interest in the subsurface mineral rights
for the private lands totals 3,881 acres (1,570 hectares). The Company is pursuing the minority
interest for a number of parcels where they hold less than a 100% interest.
Patented claims, private surface and private mineral property are wholly owned and subject to
lease agreement payments and property taxes (due annually) as determined by the County. The
estimated holding cost for the Patented claims and private lands controlled by Gold Standard for
the Pinion Project area is $US334,893 per annum.   Unpatented lode mining claims grant the
mineral rights and access to the surface for exploration activities which cause insignificant
surface disturbance.  The mineral right is maintained by paying a maintenance fee of $155 per
claim to the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) prior to the end of the
business day on August 31 every year.  A notice of intent to hold also must be filed with the Elko
County Recorder on or before November 1 every year. Gold Standard’s estimated maintenance
cost for their current package of unpatented lode claims within the Pinion Project area is
$US41,415 per annum. The 2014 unpatented lode claim filing is complete.  The total estimated
annual holding cost for the Pinion Project lands are $US376,398 .

4.3           Environmental Liabilities and Permits
 
The following section discusses land use permitting and other regulatory information specific to
the  Railroad  Project.    At  this  time,  having  just  completed  its  acquisition,  GSV  has  initiated
applications  for  permits  to  allow  for  the  execution  of  exploration  activities  at  the  Pinion
Project.  The authors of this report are not aware of any issues or liabilities that would prevent
GSV from obtaining the necessary permits to conduct exploration activities at the Pinion Project.
 
4.3.1           Railroad Plan of Operations
 
The  Company  states  that  the  Plan  of  Operations  (“PoO”)  for  the  Railroad  Project  has  been
approved by the BLM (Figure 4.3).  The approved PoO covers 3,169 acres (2,620 acres of public
land and 549 acres of private land; a total of 1,282 ha with 1,060 ha of public land and 222 ha of
private land) located in sections 28, 32, 33, and 34, Township 31N, Range 53E and portions of
section 3, and most of section 4 in Township 30N, Range 53E (Figure 4.3).  Within the area of the
PoO, exploration-related disturbance and reclamation bonding can be conducted in two phases
of up to 50 acres in phase I and an additional 150 acres in phase II.
The Company states that they have a obtained a PoO for the Pinion Project, The PoO allows up
to 17.16 acres of disturbance located in portions of sections 22 and 27, Township 30N, Range
53E (Figure 4.3).  This PoO provides access to multiple key exploration targets Gold Standard
intends to pursue within the Pinion Project in the next several years.
4.3.2           Notice Level
 
The  Company  currently  has  an  approved  BLM  Notice  (NVN-92017,  Section  22  NOI)  for  the
Railroad Project with a total planned disturbance of approximately 1.73 acres located in Section
22 of Township 31N, Range 53E (Figure 4.3).  Section 22 encompasses the North Bullion target
and the north to northeast extension of the Bullion Fault Corridor. Although the NOI has been
approved, the financial bond of $16,090 has yet to be posted.  Additional exploration in other
outlying  targets,  including  some  in  the  Pinion  Project,  can  also  be  addressed  under  separate
Notice Level applications with lead times ranging from two to four week required to complete the
applications and for the BLM to grant approval.
 
 
4.3.3           Private Land Disturbance
 
The Company obtained a Reclamation Permit for the railroad Project area issued by the State of
Nevada for disturbance greater than five (5) acres on private land (Figure 4.4).  The permanent
Reclamation Permit allows for up to thirty nine (39) acres of surface disturbance. The reclamation
bond for $39,388.00 has not yet been posted.
 
The Company is currently operating under an Interim Reclamation Permit for the Pinion Project
area issued by the State of Nevada for disturbance greater than five (5) acres on private land that
allows up the eleven (11) acres of surface disturbance.  The permit covers portions of sections 21
and 27 (not included in the PoO), Township 30N, Range 53E.  The Company is in the process of
applying for a permanent Reclamation Permit.
 
4.3.4           Water Pollution Control Permit

5.0           ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND
PHYSIOGRAPHY
 
5.1           Accessibility
 
The Pinion Project is located in north-central Nevada approximately 275 road miles (442 km)
west of Salt Lake City, Utah, and 290 road miles (467 km) east of Reno, Nevada.  The project is
located between 8 and 18 miles (13 and 29 km) south of Interstate 80, which is a four lane, east-
west, transcontinental highway that serves as the primary highway in northern Nevada.
from  Highway  278  along  a  gravel
Primary access to the Project area is by a series of paved and gravel roads from Elko, Nevada
(population 18,300).  The Project can be reached by travelling westbound from Elko for 20 miles
(32  km)  on  Interstate  80  to  the  town  of  Carlin  (population  2,400),  and  then  south  on  State
Highway 278 for 20 miles (32 km).  The Pinion Project area is accessed about 8 miles (13 km)
east 
immediately  north  of  Trout
Creek.    Alternatively,  the  Project  area  may  also  be  reached  during  the  summer  and  autumn
months by traveling 30 miles (48 km) southwestward from Elko, Nevada on the Bullion Road, a
dirt/gravel road. Numerous historic and/or recently-created exploration roads combined with four-
wheel drive tracks allow for access to many of the known target and prospect areas.
 
5.2           Site Topography, Elevation and Vegetation
 
Northern Nevada is within the Basin and Range physiographic province, an area characterized
by flat, lacustrine-gravel-volcaniclastic-volcanic filled valleys bounded by generally north-south
road
located
trending mountain ranges.  The Project area is located within the Piñon Mountains at elevations
spanning from 5,800 feet (1,770 m) on the north and east sides, to nearly 8,700 feet (2,650 m)
above  sea  level  in  the  central  portion  of  the  Project.    Lower  elevations  are  typified  by  gentle,
rolling hills with little to no bedrock exposure.  Higher elevations are characterized by steeper
slopes and cliffs, deeply incised drainages, and an increase in bedrock exposure. Topographic
relief  at  the  Pinion  deposit  area  is  characterized  by  moderate  to  fairly  steep  slopes  with
elevations of between 6,500 feet (1,980 m) and 7,700 feet (2,350 m).
Vegetation consistent with a high desert climate consists of sagebrush, rabbit brush, cactus, and
bunch grass communities.  Cottonwood trees are confined to drainage bottoms and near
springs.  Pinyon pine, juniper, mountain mahogany and aspen trees grow at higher elevations.
 
5.3           Climate
 
The project area has a relatively dry, “high desert” climate.  Weather records from Newmont’s
Carlin Mine indicate that from 1966 through 2002, the average January maximum and minimum
temperatures  were  34.4°  and  19.6°F,  respectively.    July  average  maximum  and  minimum
temperatures were 83.1° and 58.2°F, respectively. January and July had average precipitation
amounts  of  1.13  inches  and  0.41  inches,  while  average  total  precipitation  was  12.09  inches
(Western Regional Climate Center, 2011).  Average annual snowfall for Carlin is approximately
30 inches.  Precipitation varies dramatically due to changes in elevation and season.
Rainfall  in  the  region  is  generally  light,  infrequent  and  may  be  associated  with  dry  lightning
between May and October.  Moist airflow from the south brings ‘monsoon’ rains from July through
September.  A small number of these storms may carry heavy rains that cause localized flooding
in creeks and drainages.
Snow and spring runoff may locally limit drilling and other geological fieldwork activities between
November and April each year.

5.4           Local Resources and Infrastructure
 
Elko, Nevada has served as the northern Nevada exploration and mining center for more than
half a century.  Elko is a full service community that includes housing; motels; food / restaurants;
clinics / hospital; a regional airport with daily flights to/from Salt Lake City, Utah; transcontinental
interstate  highway  and  railway;  local,  state  and  federal  government  offices;  skilled  and
experienced  labor  for  the  exploration  and  mining  industry;  schools  (K-12  and  a  community
college).    In  this  part  of  Nevada,  there  is  a  diverse  selection  of  local/regional/international
exploration  and  mining  service  companies  including  assay  labs,  suppliers,  drilling  contractors
and heavy equipment vendors supporting the exploration and mining industry.
The  Project  is  in  the  vicinity  of  large,  active  open  pit  and  underground  mines  operated  by
Newmont and Barrick Gold Corp. These mine sites also include fully operational mill complexes
designed to treat oxide and/or carbon-sulfide refractory gold ores.
At  the  Project,  water  is  available  proximal  to  the  drilling  operations.  For  communications,  3G
cellular network is available in select locations.  High voltage electrical transmission lines are
located six miles from the Project.
The Project has sufficient and appropriate sites to accommodate exploration and potential mining
facilities, including waste rock disposal, and processing infrastructure.
 
6.0           HISTORY
 
The  Railroad  district  and  the  combined  Railroad  and  Pinion  Project  area  have  an  extensive
history  of  mineral  exploration  dating  back  to  1869  when  the  Railroad  Mining  District  was  first
established.    Historical  exploration  work  within  the  Property  area  is  summarized  in  previous
Technical Reports on the Railroad portion of the Property (Hunsaker 2010, 2012a,b;Shaddrick,
2012) and recently for the combined Railroad-Pinion Property area in Koehler et al. (2014).  The
following section is taken from Koehler et al. (2014) and summarizes historical exploration at the
Pinion portion of the Project area.
 
6.1           Pinion Historic Exploration
 
Exploration activity at Pinion Project area dates back to the discovery of the Pinion Prospect in
1980 by Newmont with the majority of the historic work being conducted in the late 1980s and
early to mid 1990s.  The exploration history for the Pinion Project overlaps somewhat with that of
the adjacent Railroad Project area as portions of the two project areas have been operated by
the same company in the past.  Historic exploration work completed at the Pinion Project area is
summarised in the following table (Table 6.1) reproduced from a previous Technical Report on
the property (DeMatties, 2003).
The historical work completed at the Pinion Project has identified a significant zone of Carlin-
type gold mineralization at the Pinion Prospect (section 22 and 27, T30N, R53E), as well as an
additional zone of mineralization at the Dark Star prospect (section 25, T30N, R53E).  Figures
6.1  and  6.2  of  this  report  illustrate  the  results  of  historical  soil  and  rock  grab  sampling  on  the
Pinion (and Railroad) Project(s).  Historical drilling and resource estimation work are discussed
below.    The  geology  of  the  Pinion  Project  and  the  mineralization  encountered  at  the  Pinion
Prospect  are  discussed  in  detail  within  the  Geological  Setting  And  Mineralization  section
(Section 7) of this Technical Report.

*The  mineral  resource  estimates  summarized  in  Table  6.1  are  non  –  NI  43-101  compliant
resources  that  were  calculated  prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  standards  set  forth  in  NI  43-
101.    The  authors  of  this  Technical  Report  have  referred  to  these  estimates  as  “historic
resources” and are not treating them, or any part of them, as current mineral resources.  There is
insufficient  information  available  to  properly  assess  data  quality,  estimation  parameters  and
standards by which the estimates were categorized.  The historic resource estimates described
above  should  not  be  relied  upon  and  have  only  been  included  to  demonstrate  the  mineral
potential of the Pinion Project.

The  majority  of  the  historic  work  completed  at  the  Pinion  Project  has  been  conducted  at  and
around the Pinion Deposit located in sections 22 and 27 of Township 30 North, Range 53 East
(Mount Diablo Meridian). Section 22 hosts the mineralized and outcropping Main Zone and North
Pod, which are the near-surface shallow portions of the Pinion Deposit (which has also been
referred to historically as the South Bullion or Trout Creek Deposit). Pinion gold mineralization
extends southeast, plunging shallowly, into section 27 following the Pinion antiform/horst and the
contact between the faulted Mississippian siliciclastics and the underlying Devonian Devils Gate
Formation  limestone.  Additionally,  historic  drilling  has  been  conducted  in  section  25  (T30N,
R53E)  at  the  Dark  Star  occurrence.  Historic  Pinion  Project  area  drillholes  are  illustrated  in
Figures 6.3 and 6.4.
In total, approximately 379 drill holes were completed at the Pinion Deposit, and immediate area,
between  1981  and  2007  (McCusker  and  Drobeck,  2012).  The  majority  of  the  holes  were
completed by reverse circulation drilling with minor diamond (core) drilling completed by Royal
Standard  in  1996  and  2007.    Table  6.2  below  (modified  after  McCusker  and  Drobeck,  2012),
provides a summary of historical drilling at the Pinion and Dark Star areas.
To date, historic exploration conducted in the Pinion Project area has identified two areas of gold
mineralization at the Pinion and Dark Star prospects (Figures 6.1 to 6.4).  The Pinion Deposit
comprises two discreet zones of mineralization (Main Zone and North Zone) with the majority of
the historic drilling having been completed at the Main Zone, which includes the jasperoid
breccia outcrops located near the southern boundary of section 22 (T30N, R53E).  Historic
drilling has intersected and extended the Main Zone gold mineralization well into section 27 to
the southeast.  Approximately 1000 ft (~300 m) north east of the jasperoid outcrops of the Main
Zone is the core area of the North Zone.

Anomalous gold mineralization has been intersected in drill holes along the Pinion Gold Deposit
Main  Zone  mineralization  over  a  strike  length  of  more  than  4,800  ft  (1.46  km)  long  (along  a
southeasterly  trend),  ranges  from  1,000  ft  to  2,600  ft  (320  to  790  m)  wide  (horizontally  across
strike) and ranges between 50 ft and 330 ft (~15 to 100 m) in vertical thickness and has been
intersected to a depth of about 1,050 ft (320 m) below surface.  The gold mineralization roughly
follows the hinge of a weak and very open anticline that is coincident with a horst. Example drill
intersections are provided in Table 6.3. Thicknesses are drill length with true thicknesses of the
mineralization  generally  in  the  range  of  75%  to  100%  due  to  the  fairly  flat  lying  nature  of  the
mineralization.  Historic  drilling  has  intersected  a  number  of  high  grade  and  thick  mineralized
zones well southeast of the main near surface hinge/horst zone at greater depths within the hinge
or axis of the main coincident antiform and horst, and to the south along the southwest limb of the
folded  contact  zone  between  the  Devils  Gate  Formation  limestone  and  the  overlying
Mississippian siliciclastics. Example intersection include 0.029 opt (1.0 g/t) Au over 205 ft (62.48
m) with a high grade zone of 0.071 opt (2.43 g/t) Au over 35 ft (10.67 m) in hole CPR-059,

The North Zone of the Pinion Deposit is approximately 1,450 ft (440 m) long (along a roughly
north-northwest  to  southeast  trend),  ranges  from  about  430  1,050  ft  (130  to  320  m)  wide
(horizontally across strike) and ranges in vertical thickness from 30 ft to 330 ft (~10 to 100 m).
Summary assay intercept highlights for the Pinion Deposit North Zone historic drilling are also
provided in Table 6.3.
Anomalous gold mineralization at Dark Star has been intersected over an area of about 2,000 ft
(610 m) long (along a north-south trend), up to 1,610 ft (490 m) wide (horizontally across strike)
and  up  to  a  depth  of    690  ft  (210  m)  below  surface.  Little  is  known  about  the  Dark  Star
mineralization  other  than  it  is  hosted  in  silicified  siliciclastics  and  limestone  of  Pennsylvanian
aged Moleen and Tomera formations. Example intersections at Dark Star include 0.021 opt (0.72
g/t) Au over 500 ft (129.54 m) with a high grade core starting at surface with 0.046 opt (1.58 g/t)
Au over  95 ft (28.96 m) in hole CDS-001, 0.018 opt (0.62 g/t) Au over 515 ft (156.97 m) with a
near surface high grade zone starting at depth of 10 ft with 0.044 opt (1.51 g/t) Au over 100 ft
(30.48 m) in hole CDS-002, and 0.036 opt (1.22 g/t) Au over 250 ft (76.2 m) with a high grade
zone of 0.061 opt (2.1 g/t) Au over 80 ft (24.38 m) in hole CDS-053 (Table 6.3).
 
6.3           Pinion Historic Resource Estimates
 
Several historic mineral resource estimates have been completed by a variety of companies over
several years for the Pinion Deposit, as well as the nearby (~2 miles east) Dark Star prospect, in
what is now referred to as GSV’s Pinion Project area. A review of the Pinion Project drill hole
database has been conducted by APEX (co-authors Mr. Dufresne and Mr. Turner), along with a
review  of  historic  reports  and  site  visit  to  the  Pinion  Project  conducted  in  May  2013.    The
database  review  and  site  visit  confirmed  a  significant  amount  of  drilling  at  the  Pinion  Project
area, including more than 24,000 gold assay results.  The majority of the work was completed
prior  to  the  implementation  of  the  standards  set  forth  in  NI  43-101,  however,  the  work  was
completed  by  reputable  companies  and  appears  to  have  been  conducted  in  accordance  with
industry standards of the time.  As a result, in the opinion of the authors of this report, the historic
Pinion  drill  data  provides  sufficient  reliability  to  warrant  the  following  discussion  of  historic
mineral resource estimates.
 
The reader is cautioned that the historic mineral resource estimates discussed in this section,
and summarized in Tables 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6, are non – NI 43-101 compliant mineral resources that
were calculated prior to the implementation of the standards set forth in NI 43-101 and are not
consistent  with  current  CIM  standards  for  mineral  resource  estimation  (as  defined  by  the  CIM
Definition Standard on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves dated November 27, 2010). The
authors of this Technical Report have referred to these estimates as “historic resources” and the
reader is cautioned not to treat them, or any part of them, as current mineral resources.  There is
insufficient information available to fully assess data quality, complete estimation parameters and
the standards by which the estimates were completed and/or categorized.  The historic resources
described below have been included simply to demonstrate the mineral potential of certain target
areas within the Railroad-Pinion Project area.  A thorough review of all historic data performed by
a Qualified Person, along with additional exploration and validation work to confirm results and
estimation parameters, would be required in order to produce a current and compliant NI 43-101
mineral resource estimate for the prospects discussed below.
 
The first documented historic resource estimate for the Pinion prospect was completed by Crown
Resources in 1991 (Calloway, 1992a) and included information from 194 drill holes in the Main
Zone and North Pod Zone and appears to have been restricted to
section  22  (T30N,  R53E).  The estimation was completed using a polygonal method based on
cross-sections, a gold cut-off grade of 0.01 oz Au/ton (0.34g Au/t) along with a tonnage factor of
13 cubic feet per ton (SG 2.464).  A “geologic” resource of 8.11 million tons of material averaging
0.026 oz Au/ton (0.89 g Au/t), containing approximately 210,000 oz Au, was calculated ( Table
6.4).  The original resource was uncategorized.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The most robust historic resource estimates calculated for the Pinion Deposit, which included the
Main  Zone  and  North  Pod  in  sections  22  and  27  (T30N,  R53E),  were  completed  in  1995  by
Cyprus  Metals.  They  comprise  a  polygonal  estimate  (Wood,  1995)  and  a  Multiple  Indicator
Kriging (MIK) estimate using Mintec’s MEDSystem software (Wells, 1995).

The 1995 Cyprus polygonal estimate incorporated both high density and low density drilling at,
and  surrounding,  the  two  zones  of  mineralization  and  utilized  a  tonnage  factor  of  12.5  cubic
feet/ton (SG 2.563).  Polygons were constructed using cross-sectional drill hole information and
were classified as “proven” in areas where drill density was high (< 100 ft, where polygons were
projected <50 ft on either side of a section). Polygons with drill hole spacing between 100 ft and
200 ft were classified as “probable” and those with relatively wide drill hole spacing >200 ft were
classified as “inferred”.  The resource was calculated by summing all polygons with an average
grade  >0.01  opt  Au  (cut-off  grade).    The  original  classification  of  the  1995  polygonal  Pinion
resource is not consistent with either NI  43-101  or  CIM  standards.    The  summary  provided  in
Table 6.5 is taken from the original report and represents a summation of all three of the historic
resource categories into a global historic “geological” resource.

The “1995 Cyprus Polygonal Resource” was calculated using a significant amount of drill data
(~350 drill holes) and was completed by reputable individuals in a manner that was consistent
with industry standards at that time.  However, the estimate incorporated very few density (SG)
measurements and a very limited amount of QAQC data.  A more thorough review of the historic
data and a rigorous application of current NI 43-101 and CIM resource estimation standards and
procedures,  along  with  possible  confirmation  exploration  work,  would  be  required  in  order  to
produce a “current” NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource for the Pinion Deposit. The authors are
of  the  opinion  that  the  drill  hole  spacing,  the  overall  density  of  drilling  and  the  continuity  of
intersected  gold  mineralization  for  the  Pinion  Deposit  is  sufficient  to  conduct  an  NI  43-101
mineral  resource  estimate  with  the  recovery  of  certain  original  drill  hole  data  and  further
validation and confidence in the drill hole database.
 
Also in 1995, Cyprus produced an MIK (Multiple Indicator Kriging) estimate for the Pinion Deposit
utilizing  a  similar  database  to  that  of  the  “1995  Cyprus  Polygonal  Resource”  described
above.  The same tonnage factor as the polygonal resource (12.5 cubic feet/ton, or SG 2.563)
was used and grade was applied to a 50 ft x 50 ft x 20 ft block model using Mintec’s MEDSystem
software  and  an  MIK  grade  estimation  algorithm.  Following  the  estimation  process,  Lerchs-
Grossman  pit  models  were  run  for  $400/oz  and  $700/oz  gold  price  scenarios  using  various
parameters  including;  45  degree  maximum  pit  slopes,  a  $2.51/ton  crushed  ore  cost  (crushing
processing, pad construction and G&A), 48% recovery for ROM material and 62% recovery for
crushed material with a 0.0143 opt Au ROM cut-off grade (~0.5 g/t Au) and a ROM/crush cut-off
grade of 0.008 opt Au (~0.27 g/t Au) for the $700/oz scenario and 0.009 opt Au (~0.31 g/t Au) for
the $400/oz scenario.  In a resource summary document by Wells (1995) it is clearly stated that
the  resource  work  relied  upon  estimations,  due  to  limited  test  work,  for  key  factors  such  as
density 
(limited  metallurgical
testing).    However,  the  assumptions  made  are  considered  reasonable  and  the  resource
estimation effort is considered acceptable for disclosure as a historic resource (Table 6.5).

In 1996, Royal Standard Minerals (RSM) contracted Bharti Engineering of Toronto, Canada, to
conduct  resource  estimation  on  the  Pinion  Main  Zone  and  North  Pod  mineralization  within
section 22 (T30N, R53E) and excluded data within section 27 (Bharti Engineering, 1996).  The
resource estimate utilized GEMCOM mining software and although not clearly stated it is thought
that the Inverse Distance Squared (ID2) grade estimation algorithm was used to apply grade to a
50 ft x 50 ft x 20 ft block model.  Samples (~5 ft average length) were uncapped but composited
(to 20 ft), with minimum 2/maximum 12 data points required for modeling.  The Bharti estimate
comprised  a  “global  resource”  without  cut-off  grade  of  10.8  million  tons  grading  0.025  opt  Au
(0.86 g/t Au), representing a total of 273,800 contained ounces of gold, which incorporated more
data but is otherwise comparable to the 1991 Crown polygonal estimate discussed above.  A
Whittle  pit  was  run  for  the  resource  using  a  gold  price  of  $390/oz,  a  recovery  of  67%,  total
operating  costs  of  $5.75/ton,  a  4%  Royalty,  50o  maximum  pit  slope  and  dilution  estimated  at
10%.  Using these values, two discreet potential pits were generated for the Main Zone and North
Pod  totaling  only  3.3  million  tons  and  averaging  0.026  opt  Au  (0.89  g/t  Au)  representing
approximately 85,750 oz of gold of which 57,400 oz would be considered “recoverable”.  As with
the previously discussed historical Pinion resource estimates, this estimate incorporated limited
SG, QC and recovery (metallurgical) information and its geographic limitation to section 22 in turn
limits the usefulness of the resource estimate as it excludes a significant amount of drill data in
the northern part of section 27.
The Bharti Engineering (1996) historical Pinion resource estimate is of interest as it compares
favorably to the 1991 Crown estimate, both of which were restricted to drilling within section 22
only.    However,  unlike  the  1991  Crown  estimate,  the  1996  Bharti  estimate  incorporated  a
significant number of silver analyses and provided an estimate for this metal (Table 6.4).  The
parameters used in the estimation of Ag in the Bharti 1996 work are uncertain and an analysis of
the Pinion database by APEX shows that silver analyses are only available for approximately
57% of the samples within the Pinion drill database.

The  1995  Cyprus  polygon  resource  estimate  also  included  data  from  the  Dark  Star  prospect,
which  is  located  approximately  2  miles  east  of  the  Pinion  prospect  on  sections  24  and  25  of
T30N, R53E.  The same parameters that were applied to the Pinion data, as described above,
were applied to the Dark Star data. The 1995 polygonal “global resource” for Dark Star (Wood,
1995)  is  considered  appropriate  for  disclosure  as  a  historic  resource  estimate  (Table
6.6).    However,  there  is  insufficient  information  available  to  properly  assess  data  quality,

7.0           GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION
 
Work  by  Gold  Standard  at  the  Railroad  Project,  recently  expanded  by  the  acquisition  of  the
Pinion  Project,  is  ongoing  and  the  prospect-scale  understanding  of  the  geology  and
mineralization thus far encountered is evolving as result of the company’s systematic approach to
exploration and data analysis.  However, the regional scale geological setting of the Railroad-
Pinion Project is relatively well understood. As a result, the regional geologic information in the
following section is largely derived from previous Technical Reports on the Railroad Property by
Hunsaker  (2010  and  2012a,b)  and  Shaddrick  (2012).    The  following  section  also  includes  a
discussion of the Pinion Project geology as well as updated information pertaining to the geology
of  the  various  prospects  located  at  the  Railroad  Project.    A  regional  geological  map  for  the
Railroad-Pinion  Project  area  is  provided  (Figure  7.1a)  along  with  its  corresponding  legend
(Figure 7.1b).
 
7.1           Regional Geology
 
The Railroad-Pinion Project is located along the Carlin Trend, a northwest-southeast alignment
of  sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold  deposits.    The  Project  is  centered  on  the  fourth  and
southernmost  dome-shaped  window  on  the  Carlin  Trend  in  the  Piñon  Range  as  shown  in  a
regional  long  section  in  Figure  7.2  (Jackson  and  Koehler,  2014).  The  domes  are  cored  by
igneous intrusions that uplift and expose Paleozoic rocks that are favorable for the formation of
Carlin-style gold deposits.
The tectonic and magmatic history of the region has produced a complex geologic framework,
many details of which remain obscure.  Of the many published studies on Carlin Trend geology,
one of the most recent and well respected is that by Teal and Jackson (2002).
The greater Carlin Trend area occupied a passive continental margin during early and middle
Paleozoic time, the time of deposition of the oldest rocks observed in the area (Stewart, 1980).  A
westward-thickening wedge of sediments was deposited at and west of the continental margin, in
which the eastern facies tend to be more silty and carbonate-rich (shelf and slope deposits,
carbonate platform deposits) while the western facies are primarily fine-grained siliciclastic
sediments (deeper basin deposits).  The Carlin Trend sits approximately at the shelf-slope break,
although this break was not static over time.

In Late Devonian and Middle Mississippian time, east-west compression of the Antler Orogeny is
traditionally believed to have caused folding and faulting, the most significant manifestation of
which is the Roberts Mountain Thrust.  This regional fault places western facies siliciclastic rocks
over  eastern  facies  carbonate  rocks  across  the  region.  In  this  report  the  western  facies  are
referred to as “allochthonous” whereas the eastern facies are “autochthonous”.  As the result of
this tectonism, the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian “overlap assemblage” of clastic rocks was
deposited across the region (Smith and Ketner, 1975).  Regional stratigraphy shows interleaved
allochthonous and autochthonous late Paleozoic sediments in the Piñon Range (Longo et al.,
2002; Mathewson, 2001; Rayias, 1999; Smith and Ketner, 1975).  Stratigraphic identification is
complicated by epigenetic dolomite alteration typically associated with Carlin- type gold deposits
overprinting the carbonate rocks (Hunsaker, 2012a,b).
Multiple igneous intrusions occur along the Carlin Trend.  The oldest igneous rocks are reported
to be Late Triassic age (Teal and Jackson, 2002).  Other igneous rocks include: a Late Jurassic
dioritic  intrusion  documented  at  the  Goldstrike  Deposit  (Bettles,  2002);  intermediate  to  mafic
dikes of Jurassic and Cretaceous age; the Cretaceous age Richmond Stock (quartz monzonite);
the  Eocene  age  Welches  Canyon  Stock;  and  hydrothermally-altered  and  locally  gold-bearing
felsic to mafic dikes/dike swarms of Tertiary (Eocene) age (Ressel, 2000).

Post-dating the Carlin-style gold mineralization are Miocene and younger volcanic rocks which
blanket large areas of the region with lava flows, tuff beds and tuffaceous sediments.  Primarily
rhyolitic in composition, the volcanic cover rocks comprise a bimodal suite including rocks as
mafic as basalt.
Tertiary crustal thinning commenced in late Eocene and Miocene, approximately coeval with the
onset of Miocene volcanism.  The extension is generally east-west directed and is manifested in
the  Basin  and  Range  physiography.    The  extensional  faulting  takes  the  form  of  normal  block
faulting which can evolve into listric normal faulting with progressively greater extension.  The
significant consequence of extensional faulting is the dismemberment and tilting of preexisting
features.

the  Roberts  Mountain  Thrust  expose  eastern
Several  aspects  of  the  geologic  setting  complicate  gold  exploration  in  northern  Nevada.    The
largest gold deposits are hosted in the carbonate-rich eastern facies of lower to middle Paleozoic
rocks,  with  much  less  mineralization  found  in  the  allochthonous,  western  facies  siliciclastic
rocks.  Because of this, most gold mineralization has been discovered where “windows” through

rocks.  Miocene volcanic rocks also obscure the underlying geology, almost certainly concealing
numerous,  to-be-discovered  deposits.    The  extensional  faulting  distorts  and  dismembers
preexisting features (including ore deposits), making the projection of mineralized trends beneath
younger cover rocks especially difficult.
 
7.2           Local Geology
 
Select portions of the Local Geology section, as previously described in the Hunsaker (2012a,b)
report, have not materially changed and are directly quoted (with minor sequence and formatting
changes) within the following section.
The core of the Pinon Range is comprised of an allochthonous and autochthonous sequence of
Ordovician  through  Mississippian  marine  sedimentary  rocks  (Smith  and  Ketner,  1975).    Minor
folds  are  present,  but  horst  and  graben  structure  developed  within  a  framework  of  high-angle
faults  dominates  the  structure  of  the  range.    Tertiary  sedimentary  rocks  deposited  in  shallow,
fresh water lakes and overlying intermediate to felsic Tertiary volcanic rocks are present on the
flanks of the range and within surrounding grabens.  A summary of the stratigraphic units and
map abbreviations is provided in Table 7.1.  The property scale geology of the Railroad-Pinion
Project  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.3a,  along  with  its  corresponding  legend  (Figure  7.3b),  and  a
detailed stratigraphic column of the project area is illustrated in Figure 7.4.
 
7.2.1           Railroad Geology
 
The following discussion of Railroad Geology includes quoted sections from a previous
Technical Report on the Railroad Project by Hunsaker (2012b) and Shaddrick (2012).
 
“The  Railroad  District  is  underlain  by  large,  Tertiary  age,  multi-phase  intrusive  complex.    The
stock is quartz monzonite with a later stage rhyolitic core and outcrops over less than a half of a
square mile (Gillerman, 1981).  Numerous dikes are found adjacent to and peripheral from the
Bullion Stock.  Gillerman (1981) obtained a K-Ar date of 36.3 to 37.8 Ma for the Bullion Stock and
suggested that it may be the upper portion of a much larger intrusion she named the Grey Eagle
pluton.  U.S. Geological Survey aeromagnetics and drilling in the 1960’s and 1970’s indicated
the Grey Eagle pluton is as close as 1,000 feet beneath the surface”

Since the Hunsaker (2012a,b) and Shaddrick (2012) reports, twenty four (24) additional samples
of igneous (intrusive and extrusive) rocks from the Railroad Project area were collected and age
dated  by  Christopher  Henry  of  the  Nevada  Bureau  of  Mines  and  Geology,  University  of
Nevada.  This work was conducted to further investigate the igneous geology at the Project and
its relationship to mineralization.  The samples were selected during a program that comprised
field work and an examination of drill core to determine rock types, relative (cross-cutting) age
relationships and spatial relationships to gold and/or base metal mineralization.  The selected
samples of igneous rocks and mineralization were sent for petrographic (thin section) analysis,
chemical analyses, and 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb zircon age dating.  The age dating work included
mineral separations of sanidine, zircon, and/or other minerals as appropriate, and was performed
at  the  New  Mexico  Geochronological  Research  Laboratory  (New  Mexico  Tech,  Socorro,  New
Mexico) and to the USGS – Stanford SHRIMP U-Pb lab (Stanford University, California).  Data
analysis and interpretation is currently in progress, however, a preliminary interpretation of the
40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb age dates suggests the following.  Igneous rocks at the Railroad Project
were emplaced and/or deposited during at least 4 distinct episodes between 38.9 and 37.5 Ma,
with two possible major pulses at 38.4 and 37.8 Ma, that have produced at least 10 distinct rocks
types (Henry pers. comm. of unpublished data, 2014).

“The northern portion of the Project is primarily covered with Mississippian Webb or equivalent
age rocks (Figures 7.3a, 7.3b and 7.4; Table 7.1 - this report).  Detailed mapping by Westmont
subdivided these units into separate lithologies (Nordquist, 1992).  Westmont mapped the units
striking  northwesterly  and  dipping  north.    Some  of  the  historic  drill  holes  were  drilled  deeper
ending in the Devonian Devils Gate Formation.  Published reports from the Rain Mine suggest
that  Mississippian  Webb  and  Chainman 
formations  occur  as  both  allocthonous  and
autochthonous units (Longo et al., 2002 and Mathewson, 2001).”
Four prominent high-angle fault directions have been identified including west-northwest, north-
south,  northwest  and  northeast-striking  faults.    The  north-south  striking  Bullion  Fault  Corridor
separates  the  Tertiary  volcanic  rocks  to  the  east  from  the  Paleozoic  sediments  in  the
range.  Northwest and west-northwest striking faults occur across the Project.  “Drilling indicates
that  low-angle  faults  have  juxtaposed  Devonian  age  carbonates  and  Mississippian  rocks  with
evidence  of  multiple  episodes  of  low-angle  faults.    These  developed  a  tectonic  stratigraphic
setting with interleaved Devonian Devils Gate Formation (Ddg) and Webb Formation (Mw) as
well as Webb age equivalent rocks (Mtp-Tripon Pass)” (Hunsaker, 2012b).
In the Central Bullion Target area is a westerly dipping sequence of Paleozoic rocks that are
offset  into  numerous  “distinct”  blocks  by  west-northwest,  north-south  and  northeast-striking
faults.    The  west-northwest  trend  appears  to  be  the  most  important  structural  trend.    Fault
bounded  blocks  appear  to  be  affected  by  intrusion  of  the  Bullion  Stock  and  collapse  of  the
magma chamber. Skarn occurs on the contact of the Bullion Stock and associated intrusive rocks
along the Standing Elko dike corridor.
 
7.2.2           Pinion Geology
 
The geological setting of the Pinion Project area is the same as that described above for the
adjacent and contiguous Railroad Project.  Thus, the stratigraphic units observed at the Pinion
Project are the same as those described above, as is the overall tectonic history. The property
scale geology of the Railroad-Pinion Project area is illustrated in Figure 7.3a, and corresponding
legend  (Figure  7.3b),  and  a  detailed  stratigraphic  column  of  the  project  area  is  illustrated  in
Figure 7.4.
The  Pinion  Project  lies  at  the  southeastern  end  of  the  Carlin  gold  trend  and  is  hosted  by  a
sequence of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks exposed within large structural horst blocks in which
the sedimentary rocks have been broadly folded into a southward plunging asymmetric anticline.
The apparent dip of the western fold limb ranges from 10 degrees to 25 degrees and the steeper
eastern  limb  dips  35  degrees  to  50  degrees.  The  Carlin-type  mineralization  occurs  at  two
prospects in the Project area referred to as the Pinion and Dark Star prospects.  Mineralization is
strongly controlled by the contact between the underlying Devonian Devils Gate Limestone (Ddg)
and the overlying Mississippian Tripon Pass Formation silty micrite (Norby et al., in Press).
The  following  information  reproduced  from  an  upcoming  paper  being  presented  at  the  2015
Geological  Society  of  North  America  annual  symposium  and  summarizes  well  the  geological
observations  that  Gold  Standard’s  geologists  have  compiled  from  their  extensive  review  of
historic and new core, re-logging of many of the historic RC hole chips, logging of new RC holes
and geological mapping at the Pinion Project by Norby et al. (in Press):
“Pinion  is  a  Carlin-type  gold-silver  deposit  at  the  south  margin  of  the  Railroad  district…….
……………”
“  Gold  and  silver  are  concentrated  within  a  multi-lithic  breccia  developed  along  the
unconformable  contact  between  underlying  Devonian  Devil’s  Gate  Formation  calcarenite
limestone (>200 meters thick) and overlying Mississippian Tripon Pass Formation silty micrite
(up to 50 meters thick). Above the Tripon Pass are Mississippian Webb Formation silty mudstone
(40 meters thick) and Mississippian Chainman Formation chert-clast sandstone to conglomerate
(>300  meters  thick).  Mississippian  Tonka  Formation  conglomerate  is  in  fault  contact  with
Chainman Formation northeast of Pinion. Tonka clasts are of all above-mentioned lithologies.
Feldspar-quartz porphyry sills are common at southeast Pinion and less so in other parts of the
deposit.
Date: October 24, 2014

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The Pinion deposit occurs within a northwest-trending horst. Faults on the northeast horst margin
are linking structures to the more northerly striking, range-bounding structures of the Bullion fault
corridor, an apparently reactivated older structural trend. The fault on the southwest horst margin
continues  northwest  across  the  south  margin  of  the  range.    The  west-northwest-striking  Main
Zone  fault  cuts  the  center  of  the  horst,  dips  moderately  northeast,  has  30  to  60  meters  of
apparent-normal  offset,  and  has  gold  concentrated  within  its  footwall.  North-northeast  striking
faults cross the horst, one with near-vertical east dip at northwest Pinion and one with moderate
west  dip  at  southeast  Pinion.  The  host  section  is  70  meters  shallower  east  of  the  fault  at
southeast Pinion.
An  east-southeast  verging,  asymmetric  anticline  occurs  at  central  Pinion.  It  is  apparently  left-
laterally  displaced  across  the  Main  Zone  and  south  horst  faults.  A  nearly  flat-lying  thrust  at
southeast  Pinion  separates  an  overlying  normal  Devil’s  Gate  to  Chainman  section  from  an
underlying  Chainman  section.  Feldspar-quartz  porphyry  sills  occupy  this  structure.  At  east
Pinion,  a  second,  more  local,  moderately  southeast-dipping  thrust  repeats  the  Tripon  Pass
through Chainman section. Throughout the Pinion deposit, gold and silver concentrations trend
along structures of north-northeast and west-northwest strike.”
 
7.3           Mineralization
 
Historic  exploration,  including  extensive  drilling,  conducted  at  the  Pinion  deposit  area  has
demonstrated the presence of Carlin-style gold mineralization.  Mineralization at Pinion occurs
mainly as finely disseminated gold in dissolution, collapse breccia developed along the contact
between  the  Mississippian  Tripon  Pass  Formation  silty  micrite  and  Devil’s  Gate  Formation
calcarenite (Norby et al., in Press; McCusker and Drobeck, 2012).  The breccia is cemented with
quartz,  barite  and  calcite.  Example  schematic  cross-sections  of  the  geology  and  gold
mineralization along with locations of the cross-sections are provided in Figures 7.8a to 7.8d.
Gold deposition is thought to have occurred during the Eocene at the same time as formation of
the dissolution collapse breccia. Mineralization also included silica flooding,  quartz veining and
deposition  of  minor  fine-grained  pyrite,  stibnite  and  barite  (Norby et  al.,  in  Press;  DeMatties,
2003).  The mineralized horizon is oxidized to depths of 1,050 ft (320 m), or more. Barite-rich
breccias can also be observed associated with jasperoid bodies at surface.  Significant control
on the distribution of gold appears to have been exerted by folding/horst development in that the
highest grades and thickest mineralization occurs in the apical hinge portion of the coincident
Pinion anticline and main horst block. Breccias and gold zones thicken noticeably towards high
angle faults, which likely acted as conduits for the gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids. The Main
Zone mineralized zone trends approximately N65ºW to N75ºW, reaches up to 4,800 ft (1.46 km)
along strike and varies from 1,000 ft to 2,600 ft (320 to 790 m) in horizontal width across strike.
Several  historic  resource  estimates  (non  –  NI  43-101  compliant)  have  been  completed  at  the
Pinion  prospect  and  are  described  in  greater  detail  within  the  History  section  of  this
report.  These historic estimates are superseded by the NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate
presented  in  section  14  below.  Historic  exploration  has  identified  two  immediately  adjacent
zones of gold mineralization identified as the North Zone and a zone event further north identified
as the North Extension Zone.
 
7.3.1           Pinion Deposit Area
 
Historic exploration, including extensive drilling, conducted by previous owners/operators at the
Pinion target area has demonstrated the presence of Carlin-style gold mineralization similar in
setting and style to that of other deposits in the area including North Bullion, Rain and Emigrant
(Koehler et  al., 2014; Norby et  al.,  in  Press;  see  Section  16  below).    Mineralization  at  Pinion
occurs mainly as finely disseminated gold in largely stratiform jasperoid (silicified) bodies that
represent dissolution, collapse breccia developed along the contact between the Mississippian
Tripon  Pass  Formation  silty  micrite  and  Devil’s  Gate  Formation  calcarenite  (Norby et  al.,  in
Press; McCusker and Drobeck, 2012).

Schematic example cross-sections of the geology and gold mineralization along with locations of
the cross-sections are provided in Figures 7.5 to 7.8 (these figures are schematic in nature as
they pre-date the final modelling but are overall in general agreement with the latest modelling).
Gold  deposition  is  thought  to  have  occurred  contemporaneous  with  breccia  development  and
with late silica flooding and quartz veining. Barite-rich breccias can also be observed associated
with  jasperoid  bodies  at  surface.  Norby et al. (in Press)  summarize  the  gold  mineralization  at
Pinion as follows:
“Gold is hosted in a persistent blanket in a stratiform multi-lithic, collapse breccia. Breccia clasts
grade from dominantly silty micrite (Tripon Pass) in the top of the breccia to calcarenite (Devil’s
Gate)  in  the  bottom,  with  lesser  clasts  of  Webb  silty  mudstone  and  Chainman  sandstone.
Thickness and gold grade of multi-lithic breccia increase markedly proximal to feeder structures.
Alteration consists of collapse breccia formation, silicification, decalcification, clay replacement,
sooty  sulfide  dissemination  (oxidized  to  iron  oxide),  and  barite  flooding.  Trace  elements
associated with gold are silver, antimony, arsenic, barium, and mercury.
A  type  of  mineralization  with  more  typically  epithermal-like  textures  is  also  present  at  Pinion.
Banded fine-grained to fine-cockscomb silica occurs throughout the deposit, locally with stibnite
(stibiconite) and elevated silver to 70 ppm.”
7.3.2           Dark Star Area
 
Historic exploration, including drilling, conducted by previous owners/operators at the Dark Star
target area has demonstrated the presence of Carlin-style gold mineralization.  The Dark Star
prospect occurs at a higher stratigraphic level than the Pinion Gold Deposit, within possibly the
Pennsylvanian  Moleen  and/or  Tomera  Formation  (Smith  and  Ketner,  1975).    Anomalous  gold
mineralization at Dark Star has been intersected over an area approximately 2,000 ft (610 m)
long (along a roughly north-south trend), up to 1,610 ft (490 m) wide (horizontally across strike)
and  up  to  a  depth  of    690  ft  (210  m)  below  surface.  Little  is  known  about  the  Dark  Star  gold
mineralization other than it is hosted in north and north-northeast-striking hydrothermal breccia
and/or  Jasperoid  which  likely  represent  silicified  siliciclastics  and  limestone.  The  sedimentary
rocks are cut by thin rhyolite dikes, part of a regional trend of faults, dikes, and silicification that
runs along the east side of the Piňon range that Crown’s geologist referred to as the “Dark Star
Structural  Trend”.  This  trend can be seen to extend to the north along a couple of north-south
ridges along strike and may extend south toward the Dixie Creek area.

8.0           DEPOSIT TYPES
 
Gold  Standard  currently  recognizes  three  styles  of  mineralization  at  the  Railroad  and  Pinion
Project areas:
·Carlin-type sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization.
 ·Skarn-type silver, copper, lead, zinc, gold mineralization.
 ·Sedimentary rock-hosted gold, silver and copper mineralization hosted in hornfelsed Paleozoic
rocks (similar to geologic patterns observed at the Mike Gold-Copper-Zinc-Silver Deposit, as
described by Norby and Orobona, 2002).
Since  mid-2012  (Hunsaker,  2012a,b;  Shaddrick,  2012;  Koehler et  al.,  2014;  Norby et  al.,  in
Press), the information on deposit types for the Railroad – Pinion Project area has evolved and
been  modified  due  to  observations  related  to  the  collection  and  interpretation  of  ongoing
additional exploration data.
 
The detailed mineralization models utilized by Gold Standard for the Pinion Project are based on
direct exploration and mine development experiences on the Carlin and Battle Mountain-Eureka
gold trends by Gold Standard geologists and include the following elements; uplifted siliciclastic
and  carbonate  rocks  favorable  for  development  of  Carlin-style  sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold
deposits; similar geologic patterns of Paleozoic host rocks; similar geologic patterns of alteration
and  mineralization  at  Pinion  with  well-documented  disseminated  gold  deposits  on  the  Carlin
Trend; the presence of collapse style breccias at Pinion that host gold mineralization; dike/sill-
filled fault corridors; and the presence of west-northwest, north-south, northeast and northwest
striking  faults.  The  identification  of  these  geologic  patterns  at  Pinion  lends  credence  to  the
mineralization models that are being used on the Project.
Geologic features that form characteristic patterns associated with Carlin-type, sedimentary rock-
hosted gold mineralization include:
 ·Gold deposition at siliciclastic rock / carbonate rock contacts.
 ·The “footwall model”, which refers to sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization occurring in
favorable Paleozoic carbonate rocks in the footwall (horst) of a normal fault that typically has
+500  feet  (+150  m)  of  normal  displacement.  Many  Carlin-type,  sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold
deposits are characterized by this model, including but not limited to:  Leeville (Jackson et. al.,
2002), Betze-Post and Meikle (Bettles, 2002 ) and Deep Star (Clode et. al., 2002).
 ·Collapse breccia developed in carbonate rocks, and in overlying siliciclastic rocks.  Collapse
breccia is one of the preferred hosts for disseminated gold mineralization.
 ·West-northwest, northwest-, northeast-, and north-south-striking high-angle faults.
 ·Anticlines  and  overturned  anticlines  are  structural  features  that  serve  as  hydrothermal  and
metal-bearing fluid traps.
 ·Alteration  types  include:    dolomitization,  decalcification,  silicification,  argillization,  oxidation,
fine-grained sooty pyrite, carbon and barite.  Teal and Jackson (1997) noted that these types of
deposits typically contain laterally and vertically continuous zones of hypogene oxidation.
 ·Proximity to a multi-phase igneous center with associated igneous dikes and sills.
 ·Microscopic  gold  associated  with  arsenic-rich  pyrite.    Associated  trace  elements  include
arsenic, mercury, antimony, thallium and zinc.
Geologic  features  and  patterns  associated  with  Carlin-type  sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold
mineralization  have  been  identified  and  verified  by  geologic  work  and  drilling  on  the  Pinion
Project.  Specific areas for this type of mineralization include the Pinion, Dark Star, Dark Star
North, JR Buttes and Papoose Canyon prospects within the Pinion Project area.
Date: October 24, 2014
Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA

Potential exists for other styles of gold mineralization at Pinion similar in style to what has been
found within the Railroad Project area including skarn-type polymetallic silver, copper, lead, zinc
and  gold  mineralization/zones  within  metamorphosed  and  metasomatically-altered  Paleozoic
limestone, dolomite, calcareous sandstone (exoskarn), and in igneous rocks (endoskarn).  At the
Railroad Project, skarn formation is related to a multi-phase igneous center known as the Bullion
Stock.    Alteration  produced  by  the  skarn  event  includes  bleaching,  andradite  and  grossularite
garnets,  pyroxene  and  a  wide  variety  of  calc-silicate  minerals.  Mineralization  forms  irregular
bodies,  chimneys,  veins,  and  manto–style  replacements  typically  within  brecciated  and
metamorphosed  Paleozoic 
to  high  angle
structures.    Mineralization  is  typically  associated  with  deep  oxidation,  argillization  and  close
proximity to igneous dikes along the west northwest-striking Standing Elk fault corridor.  Historic
underground production and historic drilling, in addition to more recent mapping, geochemical
sampling,  and  drilling  results  verify  this  style  of  mineralization  and  exploration  model  for
the  area.
rocks,  along  or  proximal
carbonate
Sedimentary rock-hosted, disseminated gold, silver, copper and zinc mineralization is found in
Paleozoic  rocks  within  the  hornfelsed  aureole  of  the  Bullion  Stock  at  the  Bald  Mountain
Target.  This style of mineralization/deposit is a hybrid of characteristics described for the Carlin-
type sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization and skarn deposit types described above. In
this  setting,  spotted  hornfels 
in  Paleozoic  siliciclastic  and  carbonate
rocks.  Hornfelsed siliciclastic rocks of the Webb Formation are the host to gold, silver, copper
and  zinc  mineralization.    The  gold  and  copper/zinc  intercepts  are  tabular  and  are  spatially
separate, with the gold zone occurring in the upper portion of the breccia and the copper/zinc
zone located in the lower part of the breccia above the Devils Gate Formation marble (Jackson
and  Koehler,  2014).  Alteration  features  include:  vertically-extensive  oxidation,  argillization,
silicification, quartz veining and bleaching.  Quartz porphyry and dacite dikes, filling northwest-
is  developed
and west northwest-striking faults, occur in this setting. These geologic characteristics are similar
to mineralization at the Mike Deposit on the Carlin Trend (Norby and Orobona, 2002).  This type
of target could exist in areas of increased igneous intrusions within the Pinion Project area.
 
9.0           EXPLORATION
 
The Railroad – Pinion Project is being explored on an ongoing basis by Gold Standard through
the execution of a systematic, geologic model-driven and aggressive exploration program that
includes  geological  mapping,  geochemical  and  geophysical  surveying  and  drilling.  Details  of
past  and  more  current  exploration  at  the  Railroad  –  Pinion  Project  are  provided  in  reports  by
Hunsaker (2010; 2012a,b), Shaddrick (2012) and Koehler et al. (2014). This Technical Report is
intended as a summary of exploration conducted by GSV in 2014, including drilling, along with
the presentation of a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate, which is provided below in Section 14.
The following section summarizes recent surface exploration work as part of an ongoing program
by GSV from early 2014 through to September, 2014 at the Pinion Project in support of the 2014
drilling  and  maiden  resource  estimate.    Recently  (see  GSV  News  Release  dated  March  5th,
2014), GSV acquired the remaining portions of the Pinion Project that it did not already own from
Scorpio Gold Corporation (“Scorpio”).  The Pinion Project is located immediately south of, and is
contiguous  with,  Gold  Standard’s  Railroad  Project.  Surface  exploration  during  2014  is  in
progress with work to date including geological mapping, channel rock and soil sampling along
with ground gravity and CSAMT surveying. Gold Standard has not performed any exploration at
the Pinion Project area prior to 2014.
 
9.1           Geologic Mapping
 
Previous exploration companies and government employees have conducted geologic mapping
of the Railroad – Pinion Project at a variety of scales and by a variety of methodologies.  To
improve  and  expand  upon  the  surface  geologic  data  base,  Gold  Standard  geologists
implemented a factual-based format of mapping (“Anaconda Style”) using multiple map layers to
record, illustrate and synthesize geologic data at a common scale.  Geologic maps are created
and compiled at either at 1:6,000 or 1:2,400.
Date: October 24, 2014
48
Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The Anaconda-style mapping has contributed significantly to the understanding of the complex
lithologic,  tectonic  and  mineral  setting  of  the  Project.    The  mapping,  compilation  and
interpretation remain in progress.  Mapping refinements based on systematic data collection and
illustration has allowed Gold Standard geologists to recognize multiple exploration opportunities
on the Project. Figure 9.1 shows the current status for mapping at the Pinion Project, along with
some digitized historic mapping from the mid-1990’s. Geological mapping is ongoing during the
current field season.
 
9.2           Geophysics
 
Gold Standard collected/acquired 2,808 gravity readings at the Railroad – Pinion Project during
2009 to 2011 which are presented on Figure 9.2 in Koehler et al. (2014).  Magee Geophysical
Services  Corp.  of  Reno,  NV  collected  the  gravity  data  under  contract  to  Gold  Standard
(Hunsaker,  2012b).  Wright  Geophysics  Inc.  designed,  supervised  and  interpreted  the  gravity
surveys  (Wright,  2009,  2010,  2012c  and  2013b).    An  additional  79  gravity  readings  were
acquired from Newmont Mining Corporation from a 2002 survey (Wright, 2013b).  These surveys
were  designed  to:  identify  structures,  rock  types  and  hydrothermal  alteration  related  to
mineralization  associated  with  Carlin-type,  sediment-hosted  gold  systems  and  skarn  hosted
precious metal/base metal mineralization; and refine target areas for drill hole placement. Gold
Standard collected an additional 578 gravity readings during 2012 and 2013 the location and
results of which are displayed with the prior readings on Figures 9.2 and 9.3 in Koehler et  al.
(2014). The gravity survey data covers not only the Railroad Project but also a significant portion
of the Pinion Project area particularly in the area of the Pinion Deposit. Wright Geophysics Inc.
designed, supervised and interpreted the gravity surveys (Wright, 2012c and 2013b).
In addition to the gravity surveys, Gold Standard collected 28.8 line miles (46.3 line km) of ground
CSAMT data during 2012 and 2013 in the railroad Project area (Wright, 2012a, 2012b, 2013a).
The  CSAMT  survey  lines  cover  a  portion  of  the  Railroad  Project  area  down  to  the  south
boundary of the Project. No survey coverage has yet been obtained for the Pinion Project area. A
summary map with the results of the CSAMT survey is presented as Figure 9.4 in Koehler et al.
(2014).  Wright  Geophysics  Inc.  designed,  supervised  and  interpreted  the  CSAMT  surveys
(Wright, 2012a, 2012b, 2013a).  Gold Standard has engaged Wright Geophysics Inc. to complete
a CSAMT survey for Pinion during 2014, however the survey results are not yet available.
 
 9.2.1           Gravity
 
Four separate gravity surveys were completed over parts of the Railroad – Pinion Project area
from 2009 to 2013 (Wright, 2009, 2010, 2012c and 2013b).  The gravity surveys were designed to
delineate structures – particularly those that are in areas lacking bedrock exposures and/or those
areas covered by post mineralization cover; and identify rock types and alteration related to gold
(sediment-hosted  deposit  type)  and  base/precious  metal  mineralization  (skarn  type)  (Wright,
2013b).    Since  mid-2012  (Shaddrick,  2012),  an  additional  578  gravity  readings  were
collected.   Collectively among the four surveys, the gravity data set totals 3,386 gravity stations
and reading (Wright, 2013b).
During 2014, GSV collected an additional 200 gravity readings in the Pinion Project area to help
refine the Pinion portion of the survey area (Wright 2014). The updated gravity results for the
Pinion Project area along with data reduction and interpretation are provided by Wright (2014)
and are presented in Figure 9.2.

The results and initial interpretations of the gravity data include:
·Identification  of  a  major  north-south  striking,  6  mile  (10  km)  long  structural  zone,  the  Bullion
Fault Corridor (BFC).  The gravity data show a distinct gravity break on either side of the BFC
between more dense carbonate rocks in the foot wall, versus less dense volcanic rocks in the
hanging wall (Figure 9.2 herein and Figure 9.3 in Koehler et al., 2014). This explanation and
relationship  for  the  gravity  results  has  been  confirmed  by  Gold  Standard’s  drilling  at  North
Bullion.    The  Bullion  Fault  is  one  of  several  faults  that  control  sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold
mineralization at the North Bullion Deposit.
·A southeast oriented tabular-shaped gravity high corresponds with the sedimentary rock-hosted
Main  Gold  Zone  at  Pinion  and  corresponds  to  a  near  surface  horst  that  is  coincident  with  a
northwest-southeast oriented anticline (Figure 9.2).  The gravity high appears to be influenced
by  two  factors  –  uplifted  carbonate  rocks  in  the  core  of  the  horst/anticline  and  widespread
dolomitic alteration. The dolomitization is not apparent in the stratigraphic section drilled to date
at Pinion.
·The  existence  of  numerous  west-northwest  striking  fault  zones  that  occur  at  regular  intervals
across the Railroad and Pinion Project some of which are visible as breaks in the gravity pattern
and are visible on Figure 9.2.  Geologic mapping and to a degree drilling has verified these
faults and their periodicity on the Project.
·The identification of northwest, north-south and northeast-striking faults.
·A distinct and likely major north-south gravity break in the vicinity of the Dark Star Prospect,
which likely represents an underlying fault zone that juxtaposes Pennsylvanian siliciclastic and
limestone rocks with Eocene volcanic rocks (Figure 9.2).
9.3           Geochemistry
 
Gold Standard has initiated a sizeable soil survey at the Pinion Project during 2014. To date, a
total of 3,051 soil samples have been collected or are in the process of being collected to fill in
gaps and expand the existing historic coverage for the Pinion Project area (locations are shown
on Figure 9.1). No assay results were available for the 2014 sampling at the time of this report.
 
During  2014  mapping,  Gold  Standard  personnel  have  identified  significant  Jasperoid  type
alteration  in  outcrop  along  a  north-south  ridge  that  parallels  and  sits  west  of  and  above  the
existing known northernmost extent of Pinion gold mineralization from drilling (Figure 9.1). The
Jasperoid  alteration  is  developed  in  Devils  Gate  Formation  carbonates  and  in  the  overlying
Mississippian siliciclastics that are exposed at surface. Significant amounts of multi-lithic breccia
are also present. A contiguous set of channel samples collected by GSV personnel across one of
the Jasperoid altered Devils Gate outcrops from roughly southwest to northeast returned 1.05 g/t
Au (0.031 oz/t) over 27.43 m (90 feet) as shown in Table 9.1 and on Figure 9.1. Further sampling
is in progress.

9.4           2013 Pinion Field Visit and Confirmation Sampling
 
Two of the co-authors, Mr. Michael B. Dufresne, M.Sc., P.Geol., P.Geo. and Mr. Andrew J. Turner,
B.Sc.,  P.Geol.,  both  with  APEX  Geoscience  Ltd.  (APEX)  of  Edmonton,  Alberta,  Canada,
conducted a visit to the Pinion Project on May 1 and 2, 2013.  The visit was conducted on behalf
of the Property’s previous owner, Scorpio and was restricted to the Pinion Project. Gold Standard
has only just begun its exploration activities at the Pinion Project and thus, without a material
change, the site visit is considered to be “current”. Mr. Dufresne also visited the Pinion Project in
April and October, 2014.
 
During  the  Pinion  site  visit,  evidence  of  historical  exploration  work,  including  drilling  and
trenching, was observed and several drill roads and numerous drill collars (marked by cement
plugs, exposed PVC casing and occasional wooden stakes) were informally surveyed by hand-
held GPS for data confirmation purposes.  In general, there is a very good correlation between
the drill road and collar data collected in the field during the site visit and the Pinion drill hole
database.  During the site visit, three (3) rock grab samples were collected across the jasperoid
breccia  that  is  exposed  in  the  Main  Zone  of  the  Pinion  Deposit.    In  addition,  the  co-authors
conducted a visit to Scorpio’s Gold Wedge Property near Manhattan, NV on May 3, 2014 where
RC  chips  and  select  drill  cores  from  historic  Pinion  drill  programs  were  being  stored.  Two
samples of drill core material were collected by the co-authors.  The Pinion Project confirmation
samples are described in Table 9.2.

finish  (FA-AA)  and  multi-element  Inductively  Couple  Plasma  (ICP)  geochemical  analysis
(following  4-acid  digestion)  at  ALS  Laboratories  in  Vancouver,  BC,  Canada  (analytical
certificates are provided in Appendix 3).  All of the samples assayed above detection and were
thus  found  to  contain  gold.    All  five  samples  comprised  siliceous,  brecciated,  red-brown  iron
stained  (oxidized)  jasperoid  or  possible  fine  grained  Tripon  Pass  or  Webb  Formation
siltstones.    The  degree  of  brecciation,  as  determined  by  fragment  size,  varied  slightly  and  all
samples were observed to contain secondary silica (+/- barite) lining breccia fragments and one
sample  was  found  to  contain  carbonate  (sample  13ATP004).    The  two  drill  core  samples
comprised selectively sampled pieces of breccia that remained from previous sampling over 5 ft
intervals within drill holes SB-96-141 and 146. The samples yielded values of 0.17 and 0.48 ppm
Au, respectively.  The three rock grab samples (13ATP003-005) were collected from west to east
across the Main Zone jasperoid outcrops at Pinion and returned assay values of 0.63, 2.33 and
7.64 ppm Au, respectively.  Sample 13ATP005, which returned the highest gold assay of 7.64
ppm Au, was collected from the edge  of  a  large  barite  vein  but  comprised  primarily  jasperoid
material (4,260 ppm Ba) but also contained the highest antimony value of 1,825 ppm, although
no obvious sulphide minerals were observed in the sample or in the adjacent barite vein.  Of note
in the geochemical data from the confirmation samples was generally elevated Ba (3,450 ppm to
7,620 ppm) in all samples, and relatively low As (159 to 482 ppm) and Fe (0.72 to1.54%). All
three rock samples contained elevated silver values ranging from 12.1 ppm to 17.5 ppm.

10.0           DRILLING
 
Following  the  acquisition  of  the  remaining  portions  of  the  Pinion  property  not  owned  by  Gold
Standard in early 2014, GSV initiated a compilation and validation program of the Pinion Gold
Deposit drill database followed by a confirmation drill program.  The Company planned a multi-
phase  drill  program  at  Pinion  with  the  initial  phase  intended  to  support  ongoing  geological
modeling work that also included historic drill database validation and the re-logging of available
historic drill core and RC chips.  The goal of this work was to complete geological modeling and
database validation in order to allow for an initial resource estimate for the Pinion Gold Deposit,
which is the subject of this report, and would lead to additional phases of drilling based upon
recommendations stemming from the modeling work.
 
During 2014, Gold Standard completed a total of 5,630 ft (1,716 m) of RC drilling in 9 holes and
1,584 ft (483 m)  in 4 core holes.  The bulk of this drilling was focused on the North Zone and
northern part of the Main Zone mineralization within the Pinion Gold Deposit.
The following is taken from a GSV News Release (Dated May 22, 2014) and summarizes the
goals of the Phase 1 Pinion confirmation drill holes:
 
“Core A and Core B will test for vertical extensions to mineralization in favorable stratigraphy and
structure  beneath  existing  holes  which  bottomed  in  gold.    At  these  locations,  historic  drilling
ended in Chainman Formation sandstone, stratigraphically above the favorable collapse breccia
host.
 
Core C and Core D are designed to twin and verify existing gold intercepts in historic reverse
circulation holes, test the lower limits of gold mineralization and confirm geology.
 
RC-1 is designed to expand the collapse breccia hosted mineralization to the west of the Main
Zone.
 
RC-2, RC-3, RC-4, RC-5, RC-6, RC-8 and RC-9 are designed to expand the collapse breccia
hosted  mineralization  between  the  Main  and  North  Zones,  in  areas  of  wider-spaced  historic
drilling.  Sites RC-8 and RC-9 are positioned along fault zones identified during recent re-logging
and cross sectional interpretation of geology.
 
RC-7 is designed to expand the collapse breccia hosted mineralization to the east of the North
Zone.
 
 
10.1           Phase 1 Drilling and Drill Collars
 
The  procedures  used  by  Gold  Standard  for  surveying  drill  collars  have  been  consistent
throughout their drilling campaigns.  All drill holes are marked at the collar with the hole name on
a wooden lath or a wire/aluminum tag placed in the cement collar plug.  All collar coordinates are
referenced to the UTM NAD 1927, Zone 11 Grid Datum (Table 10.1).  All drill holes are set out in
the field using a hand-held GPS unit by Gold Standard geologic staff.  Final collar locations are
surveyed  in  using  a  differential  GPS  by  Professional  Land  Surveyors  working  for  Apex
Surveying, LLC of Spring Creek, Nevada.
Drill hole azimuths are set out using a Brunton compass, surveyors flagging, and wooden lath for
a  front  site  and  back  site.    The  inclination  (dip)  of  the  drill  hole  is  set  by  the  driller  using  a
clinometer (Table 10.1).  The azimuth and inclination are field checked and verified by a Gold
Standard geologist prior to the drill collar being set.

The  Pinion  Phase  1  confirmation  and  exploration  drill  program  was  conducted  by  contractor
Redcor Drilling of Winnemucca, NV, utilizing a skid-mounted Boart Longyear LF70 and a truck-
mounted  Atlas  Copco  3000.    The  2014  core  holes  produced  standard  NQ  (2  inch  diameter)
core.    Down-hole  gyroscopic  surveys  were  completed  on  all  of  the  holes  by  contractor
International Directional Services (IDS) using a Stockholm Precision ToolsTM (SPT) GyroTracer
DirectionalTM North Seeking continuous gyro instrument.  Drill collars were surveyed following
the conclusion of the drill program by Apex Surveying, LLC of Spring Creek, NV using Trimble
differential GPS (DGPS) equipment.
 
The drill program was initiated on May 22, 2014 and was completed on July 17, 2014.  A total of
13 holes were completed totaling 2,199 m (7,214 ft).  The program included 4 core holes for a
total of 483 m (1,584 ft) and 9 RC holes for a total of 1,716 m (5,630 ft).  Collar information for the
2014  Pinion  drill  holes  is  provided  in  Table  10.1  and  their  locations  are  illustrated  on  Figure
10.1.  The core and RC chips were logged by GSV geologists at their secure facility in Elko,
NV.    Core  was  cut  and  sampled,  along  with  the  collection  of  RC  chip  samples,  and  were
delivered  to  ALS  laboratories  sample  preparation  facility  also  located  in  Elko,  NV.    QAQC
samples were inserted into the sample stream (see the Data Validation section of this report) and
all samples were analyzed by 30g FA/AA for gold with a wet chemical (Atomic Absorption) finish
as well as ICP geochemical analysis.

10.2           Down Hole Surveys
 
Due to the potential deviation of vertical and angled drill holes, a down hole survey is completed
in each drill hole near or at the completion of the hole.  International Directional Services of Elko,
NV is contracted to complete gyroscopic surveys in each drill hole. During the 2014 drill program,
down  hole  gyroscopic  surveys  were  completed  on  all  of  the  holes  by  IDS  using  a  Stockholm
Precision ToolsTM (SPT) GyroTracer DirectionalTM North Seeking continuous gyro instrument.

10.3           Geological Logging
 
All  geological  logging  was  completed  by  Gold  Standard  geologists  who  are  familiar  with  the
project  and  local  geology.    Geological  logs  were  recorded  directly  onto  paper  logging  forms
developed specifically for the Railroad Project.  These data were entered into a digital format by
Gold Standard geologists and data entry staff.  The drill logs recorded rock percent recovery (for
core holes only), lithology, interpreted formation, hydrothermal alteration, oxidation, structure –
faults/fractures/folds with respect to the core axis, breccia type, veins, geological comments and
sample intervals.
 
10.4           Drilling Results
 
Drill assay results for the 2014 program are summarized below in Table 10.2.  Length-weighted
averaging has been used to calculate all reported summary intersection intervals.  The reported
gold  intervals  below  are  ‘down-hole’  intervals  and  thus  they  may  or  may  not  represent  true
thicknesses  and/or  true  widths.  In  general,  the  gold  distribution  within  these  large,  complex
breccia  bodies  tends  to  be  irregular,  however,  many  of  the  zones  are  somewhat  flat  lying.
Therefore, most of the intersections, which are all in vertical drill holes, are likely to be in the
range of 75% to 100% of true width based upon the current updated geological model.
The  2014  Phase  1  program  consisted  of  13  vertical  drill  holes  (Figure  10.1  and  10.2).    The
results  to  date  met  the  three  key  objectives  of  the  drill  program:  verifying  historical  drill  data,
expanding  the  known  limits  of  the  gold  mineralization  and  demonstrating  the  predictability  of
GSV’s new geological model. In addition to the objectives noted above, the program resulted in
the collection of material for density and metallurgical testing in advance of the initial NI-43-101
resource estimate, reported herein, and future resource and economic studies.
 
Drilling highlights are shown on Figure 10.2 and in Table 10.2 and include:
 
 ·PIN14-01 (core hole) contains a zone that assays 0.89 g/t Au over 69.80m beginning essentially
at surface, which successfully twined and verified the results from historical RC hole TCT-017
(0.92 g/t Au over 68.6m).
·PIN14-02 (RC hole), a 60m step-out west from the limit of the Main Zone, contains a zone that
assays 0.44 g/t Au over 15.24m, indicating a potential for further deposit expansion in this area.
·PIN14-05 (RC hole) contains a zone that assays 1.01 g/t Au over 39.62m and a second deeper
zone  that  assays  0.39  g/t  Au  over  53.34m  in  a  lower  breccia  zone,  which  represents  a
significant new target.
·PIN14-06 (core hole) is located in the North Zone of the deposit and contains three zones of
gold mineralization including an interval assaying 1.30 g/t Au over 30.18m.
·PIN14-07 (RC hole), a 35m step-out to the southeast from historic drillhole SB-073 (1.64 g/t Au
over 18.3m), contains a zone that assays 1.23 g/t Au over 12.19m.
·PIN14-08 (core hole) contains a zone that assays 1.23 g/t Au over 36.58m, including a higher
grade interval of 5.63 g/t Au over 5.03m.  The hole successfully twinned and verified the results
from historical RC hole TC-008 (1.13 g/t Au over 42.6m).
·PIN14-09 (RC hole) is an infill hole between historic RC holes TCX-017 (0.21 g/t Au over 9.1m)
and SB-123 (1.00 g/t Au over 9.1m) and contains a zone that assays 0.42 g/t Au over 15.24m.
 
 ·PIN14-10 (RC hole) is an infill hole between historic RC holes SB-123 (1.00 g/t Au over 9.2m)
and SB-072 (0.44 g/t Au over 18.3m) and contains a zone that assays 0.57 g/t Au over 25.91m.
·PIN14-11 (RC hole) contains a zone that assays 0.89 g/t Au over 65.53m, including 2.51 g/t Au
over 13.72m.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
·PIN14-12 (core hole) is located in the North Zone and contains a zone that assays 0.77 g/t Au
over 48.31m.  This hole successfully twinned and verified the results from the historical RC hole
CPR-30 (0.74g/t Au over 51.8m).
·PIN14-13 (RC hole), is a step-out hole 65m east from the historical hole SB-073 (1.64 g/t Au
over  18.3m)  and  contains  a  zone  that  assays  0.81g/t  Au  21.34m  including  a  an  interval  that
assays 1.66 g/t Au over 6.10m.  This oxidized mineralization remains open in multiple directions

Key Observations:
 
 ·The  targeted  multi-lithic,  dissolution  collapse  breccia  host  was  intersected  in  all  drill
holes.  Gold mineralization is continuous and widespread within this highly permeable, silicified
and  oxidized  breccia  which  is  favorably  sandwiched  between  relatively  impermeable  silty
micrite of the overlying Mississippian Tripon Pass Formation and thick, bedded calcarenite of
the underlying Devonian Devil’s Gate Formation.
·Gold-bearing intercepts in PIN14-03 and PIN14-04 expanded mineralization 60 meters to the
west along a north-northeast-striking fault, adding to the evidence of an emerging connection
between the historical North and Main Zones.
Date: October 24, 2014
59
Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
·PIN14-05  intersected  two  separate  intervals  of  oxidized  gold  mineralization  in  the  North
Zone.  The lower gold intercept represents a new target, not identified by historic drilling, which
lies  along  a  northwest-striking  fault.  Immediately  below  the  lower  gold  intercept,  PIN14-05
intersected  a  quartz-sericite-pyrite  altered,  quartz  porphyry  dike-filled  fault  before  ending  in
Chainman sandstone.  The presence of Chainman sandstone indicates that additional, untested
collapse breccia targets could exist at depth, underlying the Devil’s Gate Formation – Tripon
Pass Formation contact—a typical occurrence on the Carlin Trend.
·Gold  bearing  intercepts  in  PIN14-06  and  PIN14-11  confirm  additional,  vertically  continuous
zones of mineralization that include higher grade intervals exceeding 2.0g/t Au.
·Gold bearing intercepts in PIN14-07 and PIN14-09 expanded the lateral extent of the breccia
hosted  gold  zone  and  demonstrate  the  upside  exploration  potential  for  continuous  gold
mineralization  between  the  North  and  Main  Zones.    This  area  between  the  zones  is
characterized by a limited number of widely-spaced historic drill holes that tested the multi-lithic,
dissolution collapse breccia host.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
Results from the 2014 drilling, confirm that the collapse breccia hosted oxide gold zone at Pinion
is very widespread and continuous with the system open in several directions.  The intercepts in
PIN14-06 and PIN14-11 demonstrate that breccia development and mineralization thicken and
strengthen adjacent to high angle fault zones and fault intersections.
 
Based upon the results of the historic chip and core re-logging program combined with the 2014
drilling program, mineralization related to the multi-lithic collapse breccia at the contact between
Devonian  Devils  Gate  calcarenite  and  the  overlying  Mississippian  Tripon  Pass  silty  micrite  is
open in a number of lateral directions and is commonly thickened in the vicinity of certain faults.
In addition, a number of the historic holes at Pinion were either not drilled deep enough through
the contact zone due to local faulting or due to the presence of a thickened sequence of Tripon
Pass  Formation    micrite,  which  was  possibly    mistaken  for  Devils  Gate  limestone,  thereby
opening up the potential to hit multi-lithic collapse breccia in areas where it was considered thin,
weakly mineralized or non-existent. In addition, hole PIN14-05 along with a number of historic
holes  have  been  observed  to  go  through  the  multi-lithic  collapse  breccia  at  the  Devils  Gate
contact and then through a thrust fault and back into younger Mississippian Chainman Formation
sediments. This then opens up the potential for repeated intervals at depth of the critical Devils
Gate  -  Mississippian  contact,  the  primary  host  to  multi-lithic  collapse  breccia  and  gold
mineralization.
 
10.5           Re-logging of Historic RC Chips and Drill Core
 
During 2014, GSV personnel spent several months re-logging all available historic drill core and
a number of historic holes with RC chips. In total, more than 215 of the 379 historic Pinion area
drill holes were re-logged and re-interpreted. Re-logging is continuing and will continue until the
entire database of historic drill holes that have available material are re-logged. The objectives of
the re-logging program were to put GSV’s direct experience and knowledge from many years of
work  at  the  Railroad,  North  Bullion  and  other  Carlin-type  gold  deposits  to  work  reviewing  the
details  of  the  stratigraphy,  the  mineralization,  the  presence  of  “reduced”  sulphide  vs  oxide
mineralization  and  the  presence  of  faults,  including  those  that  represent  hard  boundaries  for
mineralization and those that may have be important feeder zones with accompanying thickened
mineralization around them. The overall intent was to interpret on a consistent and systematic
basis  these  and  other  geological  elements  in  order  to  construct  a  concise  and  accurate
geological model in preparation for resource modelling.
 
To this end, a series of east-west and north-south sections spaced 50 to 100 m apart on regular
UTM eastings and northings were picked for cross-section geological interpretation. The sections
chosen  are  illustrated  in  Figure  10.3  below.  All  core  holes  available  were  re-logged  and  RC
holes  close  to  or  along  each  of  the  sections  were  chosen  for  re-logging.  All  the  interpreted
sections were scanned and rectified in the three dimensional commercial mine planning software
MICROMINE (v14.0.6). The pertinent geological units were then digitized in the software for use
in modelling applications. Specific geological units that were logged and modelled include the
following:
 
Devils Gate Formation Limestone and Calcarenite (Ddg)
 
This Devonian limestone unit is usually the uppermost Devonian unit in the district. It is mostly a
calcarenite, with lesser micrite layers. In the vicinity of the Pinion Gold Deposit, the upper part of
this unit is often brecciated and is a favourable host to gold mineralization.

Multi-lithic Breccia (Mlbx)
 
This is a solution collapse breccia, which is the main host to gold mineralization, at the contact
between  the  Devils  Gate  (Ddg)  and  the  overlying  Tripon  Pass  (Mtp)  Formation  silty  micrite  to
calcareous mudstone (Mtp). It often contains clasts of each of Ddg, Mtp, and locally Webb and
Chainman  Formation  lithologies  and  is  therefore  designated  as  a  multi-lithic  breccia.  It  is
commonly  decalcified,  silicified,  and  iron  oxide  enriched.  Quartz  veins  are  common,  with
cockscomb  to  crustiform  to  colloform  textures  likely  indicative  of  a  low  to  modest  temperature
epithermal environment. Typical textures for the multi-lithic breccia in core are shown in Figure
10.4.
 
There  are  minor,  separate  thinner  multi-lithic  breccia  units  higher  in  the  section  that  can  be
present in the upper Webb and in the Chainman formations. Some of these are continuous and
can be modeled locally.
 
Tripon Pass Formation Micrite (Mtp)
 
Tripon Pass Formation is a silty micrite that occurs above the Devils Gate and is considered an
important component to the overall geological model for mineralization. It was not logged and
modeled separately by previous companies. Locally there is thin limey sandstone between this
micrite and the Devils Gate calcarenite. This unit is considered the cap rock for the hydrothermal
fluids that migrated up along structures and then out along the contact between the Devils Gate
Formation and the overlying Mississippian siliciclastics forming the main gold-bearing solution
collapse breccia. It is often carbonaceous and sulphidic, and is almost always “reduced”.
 
In some holes there is gold mineralization in reduced Tripon Pass micrite. Gold mineralization
associated with this “reduced” unit can occur near surface or at depth. Gold mineralized multi-
lithic breccia beneath this unit is consistently oxidized at all depths it has been intersected to
date. The “reduced” zones, where present, were interpreted and modeled throughout the Pinion
Deposit. Gold associated with “reduced” sulphidic and carbonaceous Tripon Pass silty micrite
amounted to less than 2% of the total modeled gold and less than 1% of the total modeled host
rock volume. Gold associated with the “reduced” Tripon Pass Formation micrite is a very minor
component of the mineralization system at the Pinion Gold Deposit
 
Webb Formation Silty Mudstone (Mw)
 
The Webb Formation is comprised of a laterally extensive, thin to moderately thick silty mudstone
layer. There are thinner and much less laterally consistent silty mudstone layers higher in the
section, but they are modelled as part of the Chainman Formation.
 
Chainman Formation Sandstone and Conglomerate (Mc)
 
The Chainman Formation occurs above the Webb Formation and is predominantly a sandstone
unit  that  grades  up  into  conglomerate.  Local  silty  mudstone  is  present.  Sandstone  layers  are
often calcareous at the base of the Chainman section.
Most of the rocks intersected below the thrust fault drilled in the southeast part of the Pinion Gold
Deposit are Chainman Formation.
 
Second Micrite
 
A second micrite occurs in the Chainman section on the northeast side of the Main Zone, at its
southeast half. This micrite may be a thrust repeat. There is a thinner multi-lithic breccia below
this upper micrite that locally contains significant gold.

In this area, the normally single gold zone of the Pinion Gold Deposit separates into two zones
with the main zone below the Tripon Pass micrite associated with the main Mlbx unit, and an
upper Mlbx layer (beneath the upper micrite) in this area.
 
Tonka Formation Calcareous Conglomerate (Mt)
 
Southeast of Main Zone, there is Tonka logged in the tops of drill holes CPR-121, -114, -120, and
-123. Also, about 600 meters east of the North Zone, Tonka was logged in CPR-122.
 
Tonka is a conglomerate containing clasts of mostly Chainman lithologies. It also contains clasts
· Main Zone fault
· Thrust fault at SE Pinion
of Webb, Tripon Pass and Devils Gate formations. It is a calcareous, less lithified conglomerate.
 
Complete examples of the digitized detailed cross section interpretation along with the drillholes,
assays and interpreted faults are provided in Figures 10.5 to 10.7.
 
Faults
 
Based upon the detailed geological interpretation utilizing the re-logged holes and the new drill
hole data, a total of seven moderate or high angle cross faults were identified and modeled. A
further three thrust faults were also interpreted and modeled. The surface trace of these faults at
the Pinion Gold Deposit is shown on Figure 10.8. The following faults were wireframed and form
hard boundaries for the mineralized gold zone:
 
  · N10E fault at southeast Pinion
 
 
 
 ·N40W fault along the northeast margin of the Pinion horst
 
  · N50W fault on the southwest side of the Pinion horst
 
Other faults that do not form hard boundaries for the gold zones are as follows:
 
 
 
  · Secondary N30W fault at North Zone
 
 ·N10E fault that is northwest of Main Zone and west of North Zone.
 
Oxidation
 
All  of  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit  holes  that  were  re-logged  by  Gold  Standard  personnel  were
reviewed for the oxidation state of the gold intervals. Reduced rock that is not gold bearing was
not  addressed.  At  the  time  of  the  construction  of  the  models  for  resource  estimation
approximately 190 historic drill hole core or chips had been re-logged from across the deposit
area and are considered representative of the entire deposit. To date, a further 25 holes have
additionally been re-logged with similar observations.
 
The gold zones at Pinion are overwhelmingly oxidized. There are local settings of incompletely
oxidized gold horizons, however, these are rare and considered minor. Criteria for the logging of
the oxidation state of the gold mineralized intervals were as follows:
 
“Reduced”      Logged sulfide and/or carbon. No logged iron oxide.
 
“Mixed”           Logged iron oxide, along with some sulfide and/or carbon. Or zone of mixed thin
interbeds of reduced and oxidized.
 
“Oxidized”       Logged iron oxide. No sulfide or carbon

Only  a  single  area  to  date  has  yielded  a  significantly  mappable  area  of  gold  associated  with
“reduced” Tripon Pass silty micrite and Webb silty mudstone. In three holes at southwest Pinion,
gold extends up into the reduced Tripon and Webb, but remains oxidized in underlying multi-
lithic breccia and Devils Gate. This distribution of reduced and oxidized intervals is logged in
reverse-circulation hole SB-136, inferred in adjacent core twin SB-162, and inferred in nearby
RC  hole  SB-154.  The  latter  two  holes  do  not  have  available  drill  core/chips  or  old  drill  logs.
Those two holes do have trace-element geochemistry from which the intervals of Webb, Tripon,
multi-lithic breccia and Devils Gate were estimated. Gold in the geochem-indicated Webb and
Tripon Pass in SB-162 and SB-154 is inferred to be reduced, like in SB-136.  The reduced area
was interpreted, mapped and modeled so that resource blocks within the mapped “reduced” zone
could be flagged and eventually removed from the resource.
 
Other gold intervals in deeper holes at south and southwest Pinion are interpreted to be oxide.
Many have chips that were available for re-logging. Others with hole numbers higher than SB-
152 did not have chips. Most of those holes were near enough to other holes with information that
their oxidation states could be estimated.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
Based on re-logging to date along the Main Zone, five small, isolated areas were identified that
contain incompletely oxidized gold intervals. They average about 30 meters by 10 meters in plan.
Holes  in  these  areas  mostly  have  one  and  locally  two  incompletely  oxidized  intercepts  that
average 25 to 100 feet in thickness. These intercepts occur within significantly thicker intercepts
of  gold  in  oxidized  multi-lithic  breccia.  Adjacent  holes  in  these  areas  of  mixed  oxide-reduced
mineralization were re-logged and limit the extent of the incompletely oxidized intervals. These
areas were mapped and modeled and due to their limited extent and size were not removed from
the resource as the total volume that could be attributed to these zones was insignificant in the
context of the Pinion Gold Deposit.
Overall,  re-logging  in  the  Pinion  North  and  Main  Zones  indicates  they  are  overwhelmingly
oxidized.
 
There were some re-logged holes in the Main Zone that have minor banded quartz veins with
pyrite  and  stibnite.  Silver,  but  not  lead,  is  associated  with  these  veins.  These  veins  cross  cut
oxidized  multi-lithic  breccia.  The  pyrite  is  coarse.  Stibnite  is  bladed.  Pyrite  and  stibnite  in  the
veins are locally not completely oxidized, but the host rock is oxidized. The veins cut the more
classic Carlin-type alteration. They cross cut silicified, decalcified collapse breccia. The Carlin-
type alteration is oxidized.
 
11.0           SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY
 
The  following  summarizes  the  procedures  employed  by  Gold  Standard  with  respect  to  the
handling and sampling of core and reverse-circulation (RC) cuttings.
 
11.1           Core
 
Drill  core  is  collected  from  the  drill  rig  by  Gold  Standard  personnel  and  transported  to  GSV’s
Elko,  Nevada  office  on  a  daily  basis.    At  the  secure  Elko  facility,  Gold  Standard  personnel
conduct geological logging on the whole core.  Logs illustrate core recovery, sample intervals,
lithologic data, hydrothermal alteration and structural features (relative to the core axis, core is not
oriented).  The whole core is marked/tagged for sampling, and digitally photographed with high
resolution  images  (JPG  files)  archived  for  future  reference.    The  core  is  cut  in  half  using  a
standard  rock  saw  by  contractors  working  at  Gold  Standard’s  Elko  office.    Cut  core  sample
intervals are recorded on daily “cut core” sheets for review each day.  Half of each core sample
interval  is  retained  in  the  original  core  box  while  the  other  half  is  bagged  for  shipment  to  a
laboratory for analysis. Standard reference material samples (Standards and Blanks) are inserted
into  the  sample  stream  at  a  frequency  of  1  every  10  to  15  samples  as  part  of  GSV’s
comprehensive Quality Control program.  In addition, core duplicate samples are occasionally
collected and added to the sample stream by quartering the archived half of core.
 
The 2014 Pinion drill core samples were submitted to ALS Minerals (“ALS”), an internationally
accredited  independent  analytical  company  with  ISO9001:2008  certification.    ALS  personnel
collect  the  core  samples  from  GSV’s  Elko  office  and  transport  them  to  their  Elko,  Nevada
preparation facility.  At the ALS preparation facility the samples are logged into a computer-based
tracking system, weighed and dried.  The entire sample is crushed so that +70% passes a 6 mm
screen, then it is finely crushed so that +70% passes a 2mm screen.  A 250 g (~0.5 pound) spilt
(original  pulp)  is  then  selected  and  pulverized  to  better  than  85%  passing  a  75  micron
screen.    From  Elko  the  pulp  samples  are  shipped  to  Reno,  Nevada  or  Vancouver,  British
Columbia for geochemical analysis.
 
At Reno or Vancouver, a 30 g aliquot is extracted from the pulp and is analyzed for gold using a
fire  assay  fusion  and  an  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  (AAS)  finish.    Samples  were  also
analyzed  for  a  suite  of  30  other  “trace  elements”  by  ICP-AES  (Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  –
Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) following aqua regia digestion.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
11.2           Reverse-circulation cuttings
 
Reverse-circulation drill samples were collected by the drilling contractor using a dry and/or wet
sample  splitter  on  the  drill  rig.    Samples  typically  range  from  5  to  20  pounds.    Geochemical
standards and/or blanks are inserted by GSV geologists every 15 to 20 samples.  The samples
were picked up at the drill sites by ALS personnel and were prepared and analyzed in the same
manner as described above for drill core samples.
 
The  procedures  followed  by  GSV  with  respect  to  sample  collection,  security,  transportation,
preparation and analysis are considered by the authors of this report to be appropriate for the
type  of  deposit  being  examined  and  are  in  accordance  with  industry  norms  and  best
practices.    Furthermore,  these  procedures  are  considered  adequate  to  insure  sample  security
and data integrity.
 
The sample collection, security, transportation, preparation, insertion of geochemical standards
and  blanks,  and  analytical  procedures  are  within  industry  norms  and  best  practices.    The
procedures  utilized  by  Gold  Standard  are  considered  adequate  to  insure  that  the  results
disclosed are accurate within scientific limitations and are not misleading.
 
12.0           DATA VERIFICATION
 
Gold Standard employs a comprehensive set of Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC)
protocols and procedures with respect to all of its exploration activities including its work at the
Railroad-Pinion Project.  The Company’s QAQC program includes measures for both analytical
and  non-analytical  data.    A  thorough  review  of  the  QAQC  program  related  to  recent  work
conducted by GSV at the Railroad portion of the Project is provided in a recent technical report
by  Koehler, et  al.  (2014).    The  following  section  describes  the  results  of  the  QAQC  program
related to recent work at the Pinion Gold Deposit and the data verification work that has been
completed by APEX and GSV personnel, with respect to the validation of the historical drilling
database for the Pinion Project.
 
12.1           Non-Analytical Data Verification and QAQC
 
APEX was initially retained by the previous owner of a portion of the Pinion Project, Scorpio Gold
Corporation,  in  early  2013  and  immediately  began  the  process  of  compiling  and  validating
historical data (including drill data) for the Property.  As a result, this work had progressed well
when Scorpio’s portion of the Property was acquired by GSV and merged with its existing Pinion
Property in early 2014.
12.1.1           Collar Locations and Elevations
 
Gold Standard’s practice with respect to drill collar locations is to use a hand held GPS to locate
the initial drill hole location for pad building and direction planning. Once the hole is completed,
GSV contracts Apex Surveying LLC of Spring Creek, Nevada to come in and survey the actual
collar with a differential GPS (DGPS), which provides accuracy to about 10 cm in UTM NAD1927
for  easting,  northing  and  elevation.  The  surveyed  elevations  are  checked  against  the  Pacific
Geomatics Ltd. (PacGeo) orthophoto derived digital elevation model (DEM), which is constructed
to an accuracy of 3 feet (1 m) for eastings, northings and elevations.
The main issue with the historic drill hole database was the confirmation of drill collar locations
including  not  only  UTM  eastings  and  northings  but  also  for  elevations.    The  majority  of  the
historic drilling at the Pinion Project was conducted relative to local grids that no longer exist on
the ground and were not well located in real world UTM coordinates.  A large number of holes
showed very poor correlation for elevations to any government derived DEM products, which for
flat to moderately dipping mineralization would present a large problem for interpretation in the
area of the Pinion Gold Deposit where significant surface elevation changes are present.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
During the initial property visit conducted by APEX in May of 2013, two of the authors of this
report  (Mr.  Dufresne  and  Mr.  Turner)  located  a  number  of  historic  drill  collars  (>50)  that  were
unmarked  but  were  recognized  mainly  as  PVC  casings  and  occasionally  as  cemented  steel
collars along roads and trails. Hand-held GPS units were utilized to record the locations of these
drill  collars  along  with  the  historic  drill  roads  that  remain  on  the  Property.    A  properly
georeferenced and orthorectified satellite image for the Pinion Gold Deposit area was obtained
from PacGeo in 2013. The road and trail GPS tracks (along with drill collar waypoints) collected
in the field during the site visit by the authors were overlaid on the satellite image and were found
to match very closely with the roads and trails observed on the orthophoto.  Historic drill hole
location maps were scanned and overlaid on the new satellite orthophoto and were compared
with the roads and collar locations identified in the field, which allowed for the historic drill maps
to be georeferenced.  The observed collar locations in the field were found to match very well
with historic drill collar locations, once the maps were properly georeferenced.  As a result, APEX
was  able  to  confirm  the  accuracy  of  historic  drill  collar  surveys  and  locate  them  in  real  world
coordinates (UTM NAD27).
 
12.1.2           Drill Logs
Upon  completing  the  acquisition  of  the  Pinion  Property,  GSV  took  possession  of  all  historical
documents and materials for the property including a collection of RC chips and cores from most
of the historic drill holes.  Having completed a significant amount of work at its adjacent Railroad
Project, GSV geologists have obtained a detailed understanding of the stratigraphy of the region
and thus undertook a program of re-logging in order to validate and, if necessary, update historic
logging data.  In total 12 core holes and 203 RC holes were re-logged by GSV and the resulting
information  was  added  to  the  Pinion  hole  database.    In  addition,  APEX  undertook  a  data
validation effort that comprised the checking of geological units and interval assay data for all of
the 379 historic drillholes in the Pinion drill database. All significant issues that were identified
were validated and then fixed.
 
12.1.3           Down Hole Surveys
 
All of Gold Standard’s 2014 drill holes were surveyed down hole after the hole was completed
using  a  Stockholm  Precision  ToolsTM  (SPT)  GyroTracer  DirectionalTM  North  Seeking
continuous gyro instrument completed by survey contractor International Directional Services of
Elko, Nevada. The survey instrument employs real time GPS positioning at the collar and returns
continuous down hole dip and azimuth information with final readings produced for every 50 feet
(15.24 m).
There is a very limited number of down hole orientation data for the historic Pinion drill holes.  Of
the 379 historical holes, only 97 have down hole orientation data.  However, the majority of the
drill holes were drilled as vertical, relatively shallow holes and therefore deviation is expected to
not be a major issue.  APEX conducted a review of the geological information in the historical
drilling  during  the  geological  modeling  process  and  found  that  the  drill  density  allowed  for
excellent correlation between holes and thus have concluded that no significant issues with drill
hole location and orientation are likely to be present.
With respect to the 2014 drilling conducted by GSV at the Pinion Property, the company followed
its normal QAQC protocols and procedures to insure the integrity of all non-analytical data.  This
mainly comprises continuous examination to insure the accurate recording of all non-analytical
data and is considered to be reasonable for insuring data integrity.

12.2           Analytical QA/QC Program
 
12.2.1           Standard Reference Materials
71
The primary goal of the GSV QA/QC program is to monitor the assaying of drill core and RC chip
samples by providing a basis for measuring the accuracy and precision of assay results.  To this
end,  GSV  personnel  insert  standard  reference  materials  and  blank  samples  into  the  sample
sequence.    The  analytical  quality  control  measures  employed  are  consistent  with  industry
standards and sufficient to properly monitor analytical accuracy and precision.
For the 2014 Pinion Project drill program, certified blank and standard reference materials were
obtained  from  Shae  Clark  Smith  MEG  Inc.  in  Reno,  NV  (SCS).  A  review  of  the  sample
preparation  and  certification  information  provided  for  the  SCS  standard  reference  materials
utilized  by  GSV  indicates  that  they  are  produced  according  to  industry  standards  to  insure
reasonable homogeneity and are sufficiently tested to establish accurate expected values and
acceptable  ranges.    The  certified  values  and  acceptable  analytical  ranges  for  the  standard
materials used by GSV during the 2014 Pinion drill program are tabulated below (Table 12.1).

12.2.2            2014 QAQC Data
 
The  2014  Pinion  drill  program  and  historical  core/RC  chip  sampling  program  resulted  in  the
collection of some 2,095 drill core and RC chip samples that were sent for gold assaying and
geochemical  analysis.  This  total  includes  sampling  conducted  on  several  historical  Pinion
Drillholes where previously unsampled core with mineral potential was identified by GSV as well
as  samples  from  13  hole  2014  confirmation  drill  program,  as  well  as  the  inserted  QAQC
samples.  A breakdown of the Phase 1 drill samples is provided in Table 12.2. In total, there were
182 QAQC samples (not including duplicate samples) that were inserted on a regular basis into a
sample  stream  comprising  1909  core  and  RC  chip  samples,  which  represents  a  frequency  of
approximately 1 QAQC sample for every 10 actual drill sample, which is a reasonable frequency
to  allow  for  a  thorough  evaluation  of  laboratory  assay  procedures.    This  section  includes  a
discussion of the results for each of the QAQC sample types.

A total of 85 blank pulp samples was inserted in the sample stream during the Phase 1 2014
Pinion drill program.  There were no coarse blank samples inserted into the sample stream. The
blank pulp materials are certified by SCS to comprise material that should assay <0.003ppm Au
(<3ppb Au).  All of the blanks were analyzed by 30 g fire assay with a wet chemical finish with a
lower  detection  limit  0.005  ppm  Au  (5ppb  Au).    Only  one  blank  sample  assayed  above  the
detection  limit  and  returned  a  value  of  8ppb  Au.    One  sample  returned  a  value  equal  to  the
detection limit (5ppb Au) and the remaining samples all assayed below the 5ppb Au detection
limit.  The 2014 blank sample data is illustrated in Figure 12.1, which illustrates that there were

no  issues  with  the  assay  results  for  blank  samples  inserted  into  the  2014  Pinion  drill  sample

The analytical data for each of the eight (8) Standards inserted into the 2014 Pinion drill sample
stream was examined by APEX and no significant issues were identified.  Only two (2) results
were found to lie outside of the acceptable assay range for the Standard samples (one “0.07ppm”
standard and one “2.1ppm” standard) representing an acceptable “failure rate” of only 1.1%. As a
result,  the  2014  QAQC  samples  have  demonstrated  acceptable  accuracy  and  precision  with
respect to the 2014 Pinion drill samples. The assay results for the five (5) Standards with more
than 10 analyses in 2014 are illustrated in Figures 12.2 to 12.6.

13.0           MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
 
To  date,  a  reasonable  amount  of  preliminary  metallurgical  test  work  has  been  conducted  on
mineralized material from a number of historic drill holes and surface composites from the Pinion
Gold Deposit.  The following section discusses the results of the historic work that has thus far
been completed.  Gold Standard has not conducted any metallurgical test work to date.
 
13.1           1987-1990 Teck Test Work
 
In 1987 through 1990, Teck completed limited metallurgical test work on composited samples
collected  from  holes  TC-1  to  3  and  TCT-2,  7  and  8.    The  work  was  conducted  at  Bateman
Metallurgical  Laboratories  (Sparks,  NV),  McClelland  Laboratories  (Sparks,  NV)  and  Extractive
Technologies. The samples were subjected to simple bottle roll tests.  The results of the testing
are presented in Table 13.1.  In general, gold recovery was poor (averaging approximately 55%)
but TC-1 exhibited an apparent 78.2% Au recovery.  Silver recoveries were also low (averaging
37.7%) but also had an outlier high of 76.4% Ag recovery in hole TCT-8.  Reagent consumption
(NaCN and lime) was variable. Additional test work, including grinding tests, was recommended.

13.2           1992 Crown Resources Test Work
 
In 1992, Crown Resources engaged McClelland laboratories to conduct bottle roll tests on a total
of  59  composite  pulp  samples.    The  1992  test  work  again  comprised  bottle  roll  tests  and
measured  the  recoveries  of  both  gold  and  silver.    The  samples  comprised  composites  of
mineralized  intervals  ranging  from  15’  to  165’  in  length  that  were  collected  from  each  of  35
drillholes. Low grade composites were also tested from 14 additional drillholes.  The remaining
10  composites  tested  comprised  pairs  of  samples  from  different  zones  from  5  of  the  35
mineralized drillholes where the different zones had been composited into a single sample.  The
detailed  results  for  this  test  work  are  provided  in  Macy  (1992).    The  35  mineralized  drill  hole
composite  samples  averaged  0.052opt  (1.783  ppm)  Au  and  0.30  (10.3  ppm)  Ag  and  returned
average  recoveries  of  76.9%  for  gold  and  63.5%  for  silver.  The  14  ‘low  grade’  composite
samples, which averaged 0.017opt (0.579ppm) Au and 0.15opt (5.15ppm) Ag, returned average
recoveries of 79.7% for Au and 68.1% for Ag.

13.3           1994 Cyprus Test Work
 
Additional metallurgical test work was completed in 1994 by Cyprus Minerals, also at McClelland
Laboratories (McPartland, 1995; DeMatties, 2003). Bottle roll and column percolation leach tests
were performed on 35 RC drillhole cuttings composites, comprising material from 529 individual
RC drill cuttings samples, as well as an 880lb bulk sample collected from a surface exposure of
the main Pinion breccia zone. Additional column percolation leach testing at various grind sizes,
along with mineralogical testing, was recommended.
 
The  results  for  column  leach  testing  conducted  on  the  Pinion  (surface)  bulk  sample  are
summarized below in Table 13.4 and indicate that gold recoveries increase with finer grinding up
to  80.6%  by  column  leaching  on  material  ground  to  100  mesh.    It  was  concluded  from  the
simulated heap leach cyanidation testing completed on the Pinion (referred to as “South Bullion”)
bulk sample material was amenable to leaching at 62% - 2” and 82% - ¾” feed sizes.

With respect to the bottle roll testing of the 35 composited cuttings samples, the data indicates
that  the  samples  are  amenable  to  direct  cyanidation  at  a  nominal  grind  of  10  mesh  with
recoveries averaging 66.1%.  Ten of the 35 composites were subjected to further grinding to 80%
passing 65 mesh and resulted in an average increase in recovery of 13.7% from 60.6% to 68.0%,
with 5 of the 10 samples averaging a 25% increase in recovery.  Further grinding to 200 mesh
had little effect on recoveries, which increased by an average of 3.8%.  Leaching was fairly rapid,
cyanide consumption was considered low and lime requirements were moderate.  There was no
strong  correlation  between  composite  depth  and  gold  recovery,  recovery  rate  or  reagent
requirements.

6 bulk (or composite) samples (each collected in a single 55 gallon drum) from 6 trenches at the
deposit with metallurgical testing completed on 5 of the samples and several grab samples from
the trenches.
Metallurgical tests, including bottle rolls and column leach tests, were completed on an equal
weighted composite of the 5 bulk trench samples. A cyanide bottle roll leach test was completed
on a composite sample that ran for a period of 72 hours.  Gold extraction from the pulverized
material was 78% after 72 hours of leaching based upon a calculated head grade of 0.048 oz/ton
Au. Silver extraction was 54% based upon a calculated head grade of 0.67 oz/ton Ag. Sodium
cyanide consumption for the test was 63 lbs NaCN/ton. Hydrated lime consumption was 4.00 lbs
Ca(OH)2/ton (Kappes, Cassiday and Associates, 2004).

Three  (3)  separate  column  leach  tests  were  conducted  on  the  composite  sample  comprising
material from five of the trenches completed at the Pinion Project. These tests were conducted at
crush  sizes  of  100%  minus  1  ½”,  minus  ½”  and  minus  ¼”.  The  gold  extractions  from  the  PC
Composite  sample  were  57%,  59%  and  69%  for  these  crush  sizes,  respectively.  The  silver
extractions from the PC Composite sample were 31%, 33% and 62% for the same crush sizes,
respectively.    Sodium  cyanide  consumption  averaged  1.44  lb  NaCN/ton  and  hydrated  lime
consumption averaged 2.00lb Ca(OH)2/ton. The minus ¼” crush column leach test required 2.00
lb cement/ton.
In addition, 76 hand samples from the 6 Pinion trenches were measured for specific gravity using
the  wax  coated  water  displacement  technique.    The  average  of  the  76  analyses  was  2.65
g/cm3.  However, this value was skewed slightly by an unusually high average SG value of 3.20
g/cm3 returned from one trench (see Figure 13.1).  The average SG value for the remaining 5
trenches  was  2.55g/cm3,  which  is  very  close  to  (98.8%  of)  the  value  of  2.58  g/cm3  that  was
determined from the 171 SG measurements made on the 2014 Pinion drill core samples (see
Section 10 of this report).  The average trench sample SG value excluding both the highest and
the  lowest  individual  trench  averages  (3.03  g/cm3  and  2.41  g/cm3),  then  the  average  of  the
remaining trench averages is 2.58g/cm3, which is equal to the SG value determined form the
Pinion deposit determined from 2014 drill core samples.

14.0           MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
 
14.1           Introduction
 
The statistical analysis, geological modelling and resource estimation discussed in this section
of the Technical Report was performed by Mr. Steven Nicholls, MAIG, with APEX Geoscience
Ltd. (APEX)  under the direct supervision of Mr. Dufresne, P. Geol., also with APEX.  Both are
Qualified  Persons  as  defined  by  National  Instrument  43-101.  Mineral  resource  modelling  and
estimation  was  carried  out  using  a  3-dimensional  block  model  based  on  geostatistical
applications using commercial mine planning software MICROMINE (v14.0.6).
Modeling was conducted in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate space relative to
the North American Datum (NAD) 1927 and UTM Zone 11. A parent block size of 10 m (X) x 10
m (Y) x 3 m (Z) with sub-blocking down to 5 m x 5 m x 1 m was applied. The Pinion resource
modeling utilized 392 drillholes that were completed from 1981 to 2014. Mr. Dufresne, P.Geol
visited the property in May, 2013, April, 2014 and October, 2014 in order to verify and validate the
historic drillhole dataset and to verify the drilling of the recently completed 2014 diamond and RC
drilling  campaign  completed  by  GSV.    Over  the  period  of  12  months,  APEX  personnel  were
intimately involved in the verification, validation, drill hole collar surveying and QA/QC analysis of
the Pinion drill hole database. The current drill hole database is deemed to be in good condition
and suitable to use in ongoing resource estimation studies.
The Pinion mineral resource estimate is reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities
Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated using the CIM “Estimation of
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines” dated November 23rd, 2003
and CIM “Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves” dated November
27th, 2010.
 
14.2           Data
 
14.2.1           Drillhole Database Validation
 
The  GSV  database  has  undergone  extensive  validation  prior 
the  2014  resource
estimation.  Historic drilling was largely conducted relative to local grid(s) and the relationship
between the grid coordinates and world coordinates was not well documented.  The confirmation
and validation of historical drillhole collar locations was addressed initially during the May 2013
to
site visit conducted by Mr. Dufresne. During the visit, approximately 40 historical drill collars were
located  and  recorded  using  a  hand-held  GPS,  along  with  tracks  representing  drill  roads  and
trails.  Although unmarked in the field, the identity of several drill collars were ascertained due to
their  unique  location.    A  comparison  between  the  field  GPS’s  locations  and  their  database
coordinates indicated a small error (50 to 70 m) but suggested that their relative positions were
accurate relative to each other.  GSV then completed formal surveying of the identified historic
drill collars along with a number of others they were able to find using a differential GPS.  This
survey confirmed a systematic shift and, more importantly, it confirmed that the relative positions
for several of the historic phases of drilling were consistent with historic surveying as recorded in
the drill database. The remaining drill collars were located by matching drill collars and drilling
roads and trails with surveyed collars and the roads and trails visible in a high-resolution geo-
rectified aerial photomosaic for the Pinion area that was obtained by GSV from Pacific Geomatics
Ltd.    It  is  important  to  note  that  the  majority  of  the  historic  drill  holes  at  Pinion  were  formally
surveyed at the time of their drilling and thus the problem was simply related to confirming the
real  world  coordinates  for  the  collars  given  their  accurate  historic  recording  in  local  grid
space.    As  a  result  of  the  collar  surveying  and  validation  work  discussed  above,  APEX  is
confident  that  the  locations  of  the  historic  drill  holes  at  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit  are  now  well
established  and  are  considered  validated.    This  was  further  reinforced  when  GSV  drilled  a
number of holes designed to twin historic drill holes and an excellent correlation was observed
both geologically and geochemically between the twinned holes.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
The largest problem with the historic drill hole database centered around collar elevations, which
initially  provided  a  number  of  obvious  errors.  With  near  flat  lying  mineralized  zones  it  was
determined to be imperative to obtain a reliable dataset of collar elevations that were internally
consistent from one hole to the next. Once accurate real world coordinates were obtained for the
historic Pinion collars, elevations for the drill holes were generated by using the digital elevation
model that was generated by Pacific Geomatics from its ortho-rectified aerial photography that
had a 1m (~3 foot) resolution.
All  available  sources  of  information  were  searched  with  respect  to  identifying  down-hole
orientation survey data for the historical Pinion drill holes. However, down hole orientation survey
information was only identified for 97 of the 379 historic drill holes in the Pinion drill database.
The 2014 drill holes were all down-hole surveyed. The remaining holes only had initial collar
orientations.  The down hole surveys that were collected averaged orientations at 15 m down
hole spacing.  The variation in the recorded dip readings ranged from 0° to 9.8°, with an average
of  0.9°.    As  such,  it  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  little  deviation  in  the  drill  holes  that  have
down-hole  orientation  surveys.    Based  on  these  observations  APEX  has  assumed,  for  the
purposes  of  the  current  geological  modeling  and  mineral  resource  estimation  effort,  that  the
remaining holes are not likely to have experienced significant down-hole deviation.
The assay portion of the Pinion drilling database has also undergone rigorous examination and
validation.  All available assay certificates were cross checked with the assay values recorded in
the  database.    Along  with  this,  routine  validation  checks  were  performed  on  the  database
including checks for overlapping sample intervals, sample intervals extending beyond the end of
the drillhole, “from” depths equaling “to” depths, “to” depths less than “from” depths, and drillholes
with  no  (missing)  assays.      Where  missing  assay  intervals  were  identified  and  that  data  was
located  and  verified,  then  it  was  added  to  the  database.  Of  the  samples  located  within  the
mineralized  envelope  over  99%  of  the  samples  were  assayed  for  gold  but  only  roughly  half
(45.2%) of the samples in the gold mineralized envelope have been assayed for silver.  Further
validation work on the historic silver analyses and methodology is required along with additional
infill sampling in order to increase the confidence in the silver model in order to bring it up to the
standard of the gold model.
In  order  to  understand  the  geological  model  and  place  the  mineralization  in  context  with  the
geology, GSV personnel initiated a large scale re-logging program using archived RC drilling
chips  and  drill  cores  from  historic  drill  holes.    This  has  resulted  in  an  increased  level  of
confidence  in  the  geological  controlled  mineralization  model.    Out  of  the  235  drill  holes  with
geological  logs,  215  to  date  have  been  “re-logged”  by  GSV  personnel.    At  the  time  of  model
construction a total of 201 holes had been re-logged. The re-logging program by GSV is ongoing.
The revised logs were entered into a database and imported into Micromine where modeling was
initially conducted in cross-sectional view (Figure 14.1). Geological units defined in cross-section
were then connected laterally to form a true 3-dimensional geological model, which was used to
guide the resource estimation effort.
The  extensive  historical  data  compilation  and  data  validation  process  described  above  has
resulted in a validated drill database for the Pinion prospect that is considered by APEX to be
sufficiently reliable for use in the mineral resource estimation effort described below.
 
14.2.2           MICROMINE Database
 
The  drilling  database  used  is  current  as  of  August  1,  2014.  The  database  incorporates  all
available diamond drilling and Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling completed to date. All data for
the  mineral  resource  estimation  was  copied  from  excel  spreadsheets  into  the  Micromine
program. The seven main Micromine .DAT files that were generated and utilized in the mineral
estimation include;

There were a total of 392 drill holes within the export that guided the geological interpretation and
estimation of the Pinion resource. This total comprises 16 diamond drill holes and 376 RC drill
holes that were completed from 1981 to 2014.  Spacing between drillholes varies from 1 m to 580
m.  Over the life of the project, drilling has been completed on various grids, with line spacing
varying  from  20  m  to  200  m.      All  of  the  drill  holes  were  used  to  guide  the  geological  and
mineralization model that was ultimately used in the resource estimation calculation.
The Pinion assay file comprised 28,130 analyses of variable length from a variety of sampled
lithologies. Of the 28,130 samples in the Pinion database, roughly one third (9,255 assays) are
situated  within  the  gold  mineralized  lodes.    Within  the  original  assay  database  there  were  a
number of assay intervals with either blank gold or silver grades, or a code describing the interval
as a “missing sample” (e.g. MS, NS, NA).  Many of these missing sample intervals were found to
be located within mineralized zones, which is believed to be the result of poor recovery and/or
poor drilling conditions within mineralized breccia zones.  It was decided to assign a grade of
0.05  g/t  Au  and  0.25  g/t  Ag  to  these  intervals,  as  more  than  likely  they  would  be  in  fact
mineralized.  The grade of 0.05 g/t Au is deemed suitable as it is half of the lower grade cut off
that was used for interpretation and modelling purposes.  For gold, 234 “no sample” intervals (of
the total 9,235 assay intervals within the mineralized lodes) were assigned a grade of 0.05 g/t
Au.  For silver, 205 “no sample” intervals were assigned a grade of 0.25 g/t Ag. In the database
there a large number (nearly half) of the drill holes do not contain silver analyses. These holes
were not assigned any dummy silver values, they were left blank.

The  drillhole  database  was  validated  using  the  validation  functions  within  the  Micromine
modeling software.  No significant errors or issues were noted.
 
14.3           Lithological Model/Lode Interpretation
 
Following  the  acquisition  of  the  Pinion  property  in  early  2014,  GSV  personal  began  work
compiling  all  of  the  available  geological  information  for  the  project  in  order  to  understand  the
geological and mineralization model at the Pinion property.  APEX had already started this work
in  early  2013  having  been  retained  by  the  property’s  previous  owner,  but  the  work  was
suspended while the transaction was completed.  Following the initial phase of data compilation,
GSV  and  APEX  concluded  that  some  additional  work  was  required  in  order  to  evaluate  and
confirm some of the features of the evolving geological model.  A large scale re-logging program
of the historic drill hole chip trays and diamond drill core was initiated.  Of the 392 drill holes
present at the Pinion property, 201 of these had new geological logs completed as of completion
of  the  modelling  in  mid  August  2014.  This  information  was  then  transferred  onto  paper  cross
sections and individual formations were interpreted.  The major stratigraphic formations that were
interpreted comprise:
·  Mississippian Chainman formation (Mc)
·  Mississippian Webb formation (Mw)
·  Mississippian Tripon Pass Formation (Mtp)
·  Devonian Devil’s Gate Formation (Ddg)
·  Multi-lithic Breccia (Mlbx)
The examination of regional and local geological (surface) mapping, along with the subsurface
geological data, indicated that the Pinion property has undergone a complex structural history.  A
total of seven high angle cross cutting faults and three thrust surfaces have been mapped and
interpreted.    There  are  four  main  normal  faults  that  bound  the  area.    The  amount  of  offset
observed from the high angle cross faults is variable and ranges from <10 m to > 100m.
The “new” (revised) geological information from the re-logged Pinion drill holes, and the major
faults  from  surface  mapping  and  modelling,  were  examined  in  cross-sectional  views  and
interpretations of the stratigraphic formations and fault extensions were completed by the onsite
geologists.  A number of systematic 50 m to 100 m spaced cross-sections were then scanned
and sent to APEX where they were digitized and entered into the Micromine 3-D software.  An
example of one of these sections is shown in Figures 10.5 to 10.7 and 14.1.
Upon completing the geological interpretation of the Pinion Deposit it became clear that the bulk
of the mineralization is hosted in a multi-lithic, dissolution collapse breccia.  Gold mineralization
exhibits predictable lateral and strike continuity within this silicified and oxidized breccia which
appears  to  have  developed  preferentially  between  relatively  impermeable  silty  micrite  of  the
overlying Mississippian Tripon Pass Formation and thick bedded limestone or calcarenite of the
underlying Devonian Devil’s Gate Formation (Figure 14.1). As a result, it became necessary to
develop  “mineralization”  envelopes,  based  upon  the  new  Pinion  geological  model,  for  the
purpose of completing resource estimation.
In  order  to  construct  mineralized  envelopes  for  resource  estimation,  gold  assay  data  from  the
Pinion drill database was examined relative to the geological model. Again, a sectional approach
was utilized for the initial examination of the data with a 50 m spacing through the more densely
drilled Main Zone of the Pinion Deposit and a 100 m spacing for the southern and northern ends
of  the  deposit.  The  interpretation  of  the  mineralized  horizons  was  guided  by  the  revised
geological model and restricted, where necessary, by late cross-cutting faults (e.g. the N50W and
N10E structures illustrated in Figure 14.1).

Gold  is  the  main  commodity  of  interest  in  the  Pinion  Deposit  with  silver  treated  as  a  by-
product.  The gold mineralization model was used to capture the silver grade.  An examination of
gold deposits with similar grade and size to that of Pinion was conducted and it was decided that
0.1 g/t Au could be used as a lower cut-off grade for interpretation and modelling purposes.  A
total of 9 different mineralized zones (lodes) were interpreted and constructed as displayed in
Figure 10.9.  Some of these lodes (i.e. Lodes 01 to 03) simply represent a single mineralized
horizon (body) that has been offset by faulting (Figure 10.9).
The interpretation of mineralized lodes was initiated in the approximate center of the deposit and
extrapolated  to  the  next  cross-section.    If  a  zone  of  mineralization  was  not  present  on  the
adjacent section, then the interpretation was extended half way to the next section the lode was
closed.  Mineralization was either extended east or west to the next fault or half way to the next
drill hole, which ever was closest.  Where there was no fault terminating the edges of the lode,
the edge was extrapolated 70 to 140 m from the closest drill hole. The drill holes located on the
sections to the north and south were used to help determine the distance the lode should be
extrapolated.
Due to the topographic relief over the Pinion deposit, there is little to no overburden present.  As
such the surface produced from the ortho-rectified photo with 3ft contours was used to cut the
lodes at surface.
With the overall plan of identifying a deposit amenable to heap leaching, the degree of oxidation
within mineralized zones was a key aspect of the re-logging program conducted by GSV.  The
bulk of the mineralized intersections in the Pinion Deposit are classed as oxidized with only very
limited  areas  exhibiting  mixed  mineralization  (oxide  and  sulphide  mineralization)  or  reduced
mineralization (sulphide mineralization only).  These areas of reduced mineralization while being
isolated in nature were still modelled with the aim of removing them from the final resource due to
expected poor leaching characteristics, although little or no metallurgical work has been done on
these intervals to confirm this.
14.3.1           Data Summary and Histograms
 
The Pinion mineral resource estimate was calculated utilizing the gold (Au) and silver (Ag) assay
grades.  Thorough documentation of the analytical methodologies adopted for all assays was not
always recorded, but the available information indicates that gold analyses are the result of fire
assaying  with  variable  aliquot  size  and  finishing  technique,  whereas  the  silver  analyses  are
mainly by ICP. Further work on compiling the meta data associated with the assay database is
recommended.  This, and the fact that the Pinion assay database is incomplete with respect to
silver analyses, is reflected in the classification of silver as only inferred.
Histograms, probability plots and summary statistics for the Pinion un-composited samples that
are situated within the interpreted mineralized lodes are presented in Figures 14.2 to 14.5, and
tabulated in Table 14.1.  Overall, the Pinion gold and silver samples exhibit a single population
of  data.    Mineralized  wireframes/solids  have  been  constructed  to  separate  the  different
mineralized horizons that have been offset by a number of faults. Even though the mineralization
has been offset by several faults, the mineralization is believed to represent a single event. The
single  mineralizing  event  is  supported  by  the  log  normal/single  population  present  in  the
histograms  and  probability  plots.    Due  to  the  single  population  present  linear  estimation
techniques are suitable for statistical estimation use for the Pinion Deposit.

14.3.2           Data Type Comparison
The  drilling  completed  to  date  at  the  Pinion  property  comprises  multiple  phases  of  drilling
conducted  by  several  companies  between  1981  and  2014  (see  the  “History”  and  “Drilling”
sections of this report).  In order to assist with the validation of the project’s historic dataset and
the  new  geological  model  for  the  Pinion  deposit,  GSV  competed  a  13  hole  drill  program  in
2014.  A comparison of the mineralization intersected in the new 2014 drill holes and the historic
drilling was performed.  All pre-2014 drill hole samples located within 25 m of the 2014 drill holes
were  flagged  for  comparison.    A  quartile-quartile  (Q-Q)  plot  which  shows  the  grades  of  the
different percentiles for each dataset is shown in Figure 14.6.  A diagram showing two of the
2014 twin holes is shown in Figure 14.7.
Examination of the Q-Q plot shows that the 2014 drilling intersected similar grades as the historic
pre-2014 drill holes.  The Q-Q plot generally shows a good comparison between the two datasets
with the percentile grades following to slightly above the parity line.  The Q-Q plot shows that the
pre 2014 drilling reported/intersected mineralization that is slightly higher in grade than the 2014
holes.  This is considered acceptable when the inherent variability in gold deposits in taken into
account.  Overall the 2014 twin drilling has confirmed and reproduced the mineralization reported
in the pre-2014 database.
The  other  comparison  shown  in  Figure  14.7  confirms  the  location  of  the  ore  zones  and,  in
particular, the location of the different higher and lower grade zones of mineralization.  In both
images the two comparison drill holes are supposed to be within 2 m of each other.  Table 14.2
provides a comparison of the mineralized intervals in the twinned holes and indicates excellent
correlation.  Overall 
the
location/contacts of the mineralization present in the historic database and as such the historic
data is considered to be sufficiently validated of a quality suitable for resources estimation.

14.4           Quality Control (2014 Drilling)
 
A  thorough  discussion  of  the  Quality  Control  and  Quality  Assurance  (QAQC)  protocols  and
procedures employed by GSV during the 2014 drill program at Pinion is discussed in the “Data
Verification” section of this report.  Briefly, GSV employs a comprehensive QAQC program with
respect to all analytical and non-analytical data.  With respect to analytical data, GSV geologists
routinely  insert  certified  standard  reference  materials  (standards  and  blanks)  into  the  drilling
sample stream and examine their results for signs of issues.  A total of 182 standards and blanks
were inserted into the 2014 Pinion drill sample stream comprising 85 blank pulp samples and 97
samples  from  8  different  standards.    An  examination  of  the  analytical  results  for  these  QAQC
samples relative to their expected values and acceptable ranges was conducted and no issues
were noted.

14.5           Drillhole Flagging and Compositing
 
Drillhole samples situated within the mineralized wireframes/solids were selected and flagged
with the wireframe name/code. The flagged samples were checked visually next to the drillhole
to check that the automatic flagging process worked correctly. All samples were correctly flagged
and there was no need to manually flag or remove any samples.
A  review  of  the  sample  lengths  was  conducted  on  the  samples  that  were  situated  within  the
mineralized wireframes.
 
The drillhole sample width analysis results showed a variable sample length from 0.15 m to 3.18
m  in  length  (Table  14.3  and  Figure  14.8).  Looking  at  all  of  the  sample  widths,  there  is  one
dominant sample length population, this being 1.5 m (5 feet).  In order to honour the selected
mining unit (SMU) with an anticipated open pit bench height of approximately 2.5 to 3.0 m, it was
decided  to  composite  the  assay  intervals  up  to  a  3  m  composite  size.    Of  the  9,235  un-
composited samples 96.9% of the samples were less than 3.0 m in size.  The next dominate
population was the 3.05 m (10 feet) sample size, with all but one sample being less than or equal
to 3.05 m.

Length  weighted  composites  were  calculated  for  all  of  the  Pinion  assay  samples.  The
compositing  process  starts  from  the  first  point  of  intersection  between  the  drillhole  and  the
mineralized wireframe, and is stopped upon the end of the mineralized wireframe.
Upon completion of the 3.0 m compositing process, both the 3.0 m composites and the 3.0 m
composite with “orphans” (sub 3.0 m composites) were examined to determine any noticeable
bias applied to the gold grades during the compositing process (Table 14.4). There was little to
no change in the gold grade for the Pinion sample file.   It was decided to remove all composites
less  than  3  m  in  size  (N=393).    The  composited  samples  were  used  for  all  sample  statistics,
capping, estimation input file and validation comparisons.

In looking at Table 14.1, the number of samples that were assayed for silver compared to gold
was approximately one half.  With this in mind, a separate silver composite file was produced for
the estimation of silver.  The holes that did not have silver analysis completed were removed
from  the  composite  file.    Leaving  these  in  place  would  artificially  decrease  the  grade  of  the
silver.  Once again the samples were composited to 3 m in size.  It should be noted that not all of
the interpreted gold lodes had samples that had silver analysis completed
Upon completion of the 3.0 m compositing process for silver, both the 3.0 m composites and the
3.0  m  composites  with  the  orphans  (sub  3.0  m  composites)  were  examined  to  determine  any
noticeable bias applied to the silver grades during the compositing process (Table 14.5). Overall
there was a slight increase in grade when the orphans were removed, when compared to the
original un-composited silver dataset.  As such it was decided to leave the orphans (N=194) in
the  final  composite  dataset.  The  composited  samples  were  used  for  all  sample  statistics,
capping, estimation input file and validation comparisons.

14.6           Top Cut Capping
 
Both the gold and silver composite files were used for the capping analysis.  The gold composite
file was examined first.  The composited gold grades were displayed using a log probability plot
and  a  log  histogram  (Figures  14.9  and  14.10).    Both  of  these,  in  conjunction  with  the  actual
composite file, were used to assess the need for capping.   Both of these plots show that the gold
values belong to one single population.  This is evident from the straight nature of the line in the
log  probability  plot  below.    Inflection  points  along  this  line  are  normally  used  to  govern  an
appropriate capping level to apply.  There is no significant inflection points present in this data
suggesting that no capping need be applied.  This is also shown in the log histogram, with no
clear high grade outliers being present.  As a result, no capping of the gold samples is required
or recommended.

The silver composite file was also examined for outlier high grade values that could potentially
bias the estimation of the silver grade.  As with the gold composite grades, log probability and log
histogram plots for the silver composites were examined (Figures 14.11 and 14.12).  Similarly,
the silver composite grades exhibit a linear probability plot representing a single population of
data.  There are no significant inflection points along the log probability plot until about the 99.9th
percentile,  where  there  is  a  clear  inflection  in  the  line  suggesting  a  need  for  capping  at  this
level.    The  log  histogram  also  shows  this  isolated  sample.    An  examination  of  the  silver
composite file identified one composite in need of capping, with a grade of 779 g/t Ag, which was
capped to 100g/t Ag.

14.7           Grade Continuity
 
Variography to examine grade continuity was conducted on the Pinion composite assays located
within  the  mineralized  wireframes  and  spherical  semi  variogram’s  were  produced.  As  all  nine
lodes  have  similar  orientations  and  grade  characteristic’s  it  was  deemed  appropriate  to  treat
them all as one domain.  Both the variography of the gold and silver was examined separately.
The variography of the gold composites suggested a maximum continuity of grade along a 176°
strike orientation, with a -1° plunge to the north and finally a -9° dip to the west.  This is in line
with the geological model.  The ranges of the gold mineralization continuity in all three directions
are shown in Table 14.6 and the individual variograms are shown in Figure 14.13.

Variography performed on the silver composites suggested a maximum continuity of grade along
a  similar  orientation  of  166°  strike  and  a  4°  plunge  to  the  south.  The  ranges  of  the  silver
mineralization  continuity  in  all  three  directions  are  shown  in  Table  14.6  and  the  individual
variograms are shown in Figure 14.14.

14.8           Search Ellipsoids
 
The  search  orientations  and  size  of  the  an-isotropic  ellipsoids  used  in  the  Pinion  resource
estimation  were  largely  based  on  a  combination  of  the  variography  and  the  geological
interpretation of the individual lodes (Table 14.7).  Each of the nine lodes had an individually
tailored search ellipsoid created for the estimation of grade within that lode. The exception of this
was lode02 where there were four search ellipsoids used to estimate grade.  This was to honour
the folded nature of the Lode02 mineralization.  Essentially there were two fold noses present,
one in the main zone and one on the north zone.  A search ellipsoid was created for each limb of
the two fold axis.  The range of the search ellipsoids were largely governed by the variography.

14.9            Bulk Density (Specific Gravity)
 
A total of 171 bulk density measurements were collected from the 2014 diamond drill core using
the weight in air/weight in water methodology. The selection of samples was completed on all of
the stratigraphic horizons.  The calculation used is shown below.
Density = weight of sample in air / (weight of sample in air – weight of sample in water)
The water displacement density measurement technique can be affected by porosity in the drill
core.    Because  a  significant  portion  of  the  Pinion  mineralization  comprises  multi-lithic  breccia
which often includes voids, an examination of the effect of sample porosity was conducted.  To
this  end,  21  of  the  original  171  samples  for  which  water  displacement  densities  had  been
measured were selected for wax (sealed) density measurement.  These 21 samples were coated
with wax to prevent water from entering void spaces and potentially positively biasing standard
water  displacement  density  measurements.    A  comparison  of  the  wax  and  no  wax  water
displacement densities for these 21 samples showed good correlation between the two datasets
with little to no noticeable difference observed with the waxed samples.  This data is illustrated in
Figure  14.15.    Thus,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  porosity  of  the  samples  did  not  appear  to
significantly  affect  their  density  measurements  and  thus  the  original  171  (non-wax)  density
measurements are suitable for use in determining a bulk density value for the mineralization.
The 171 density samples were examined by formation (geological unit) and also with respect to
whether the samples were mineralized or not.  One outlier of 3.93 kg/m3 was identified, which in
turn was capped to the next highest density value of 3.31 kg/m3.    As  the  vast  majority  of  the
mineralization is situated within the multi-lithic breccia unit it was decided to examine the density
by stratigraphic formation.  Table 14.8 shows a breakdown of density by formation.  As such it
was decided that a density of 2.58 kg/m3 is representative of the Pinion mineralization and was
assigned to all mineralized blocks in the block model.

A breakdown of each stratigraphic formation was also completed to see if there were any large
differences between mineralized (>0.1 g/t Au) samples versus un-mineralized samples.  There
was a slight difference observed between mineralized and un-mineralized sample densities, but
it was determined not to be of significance and it was decided that the 2.58 kg/m3 density (multi-
lithic  breccia  and  the  overall  mean)  would  be  used.  Additional  density  determinations  are
recommended going forward.

14.10           Block Model Extents and Block Size
 
A parent block size of 10 m x 10 m x 3 m was chosen for the Pinion block model.  This is deemed
appropriate based on the current level of drillhole spacing which ranges from 2 m to 500 m. The
block model extents were extended beyond the mineralized wireframe to encompass the entire
domain.  The coordinate ranges and block size dimensions used to build the Pinion 3D block
model from the mineralization wireframes are presented in Table 14.9. Sub-blocking was used to
more effectively honour the volumes and shapes created during the geological interpretation of
the mineralized wireframes or lodes. Grade was interpolated for the parent blocks and assigned
to the sub-blocks.  A comparison of wireframe volume versus block model volume was performed
for each of the estimations to ensure there was no under- or overestimation of tonnages (Table
14.10). Each block was coded with the lode number so that grade could be estimated as hard
boundaries.

14.11           Grade Estimation
 
The Indicated and Inferred Pinion Resource estimation of gold and silver was calculated using
inverse distance squared (ID2) for each of the nine lodes.  Initially, both inverse distance and
ordinary kriging was used for resources estimation but due to the resultant validation of the block
models it was decided to use the inverse distance estimation technique as it best honoured the
input composite grades.   Estimation was only calculated on parent blocks. All sub-blocks within
the parent block were assigned the parent block grade. A block discretization of 3 x 3 x 3 was
applied to all blocks during estimation.   Each lode was estimated with ‘hard boundaries’, which
means that only composite assays located within each lode were used to estimate the grade of
the blocks within that lode.
There were four passes of estimation performed for each lode. The size of the an-isotropic search
ellipsoid  was  based  on  the  suggested  ranges  obtained  from  the  variography.  The  maximum
range of the gold variography suggested an anisotropic search radius of 220 m x 175 m x 15
m.    As  such  the  search  ellipsoids  used  in  the  estimation  of  the  blocks  was  incrementally
increased  with  each  run  to  a  final  search  range  which  was  similar  to  the  maximum  range
observed in the variography.  The criteria for the number of composites to be selected from the
number of drill holes decreased with each run, as the search ellipsoid size increased.  This was
designed  to  ensure  that  the  highest  confidence  blocks  got  estimated  in  the  first  couple  of
runs.  The estimation criteria for each pass are provided in Table 14.11.

14.12         Expected Recovery and Metal Prices
 
The metallurgical test work completed to date on samples of Pinion mineralization is discussed
in  section  13  above  in  this  report.    In  general,  the  overall  metallurgical  data  compiled  to  date
indicates a general suitability of the Pinion gold and silver mineralization to cyanide leaching
methods.
Teck  Resources  initiated  metallurgical  test  work  on  the  Pinion  property  between  1987  and
1990.    Six  drill  hole  samples  were  submitted  to  Extractive  Technologies,  Bateman  Labs  and
McClelland laboratories for bottle roll analysis (Extractive Technologies, 1990; Woods, 1987; and
Sheerin,  1988).    Recovery  results  ranged  from  47.4  to  78.2  %  (N=6)  for  gold  and  the  silver
recoveries ranged from 24.0 to 34.2 % (N=3). Head grades for gold ranged from 1.1 to 3.7 g/t and
the silver head grades for these samples 1.23 to 3.15 g/t.
Crown  Resources  submitted  59  Pinion  drill  hole  cuttings  composite  samples  to  McClelland
Laboratories in 1992 for cyanide bottle roll tests.  Analysis revealed gold recoveries ranging from
36.5% to 100% with an average recovery for 35 mineralized drillhole composites of 76.9% (Macy,
1992).
In  1994,  Cyprus  conducted  a  significant  metallurgical  test  work  program  at  McClelland
Laboratories  involving  agitated  cyanide  (bottle  roll)  and  column  percolation  leach  tests.    The
bottle roll gold recoveries ranged from 42.9% to 84% with an average of 60 to 70%. The head
grades of these samples range from 0.34 to 2.74g/t Au (DeMatties, 2003). No silver recoveries
were reported.
In  2004,  Royal  Standard  Minerals  submitted  six  bulk  trench  samples  to  Kappes,  Cassiday  &
Associates (2004) of Reno, NV for rock density determinations, gold and silver grade analysis by
fire  assay  and  cyanide  solution  methods,  screen  fire  analysis  and  whole  rock  ICAP
analysis.  Results of the density determinations varied from 2.42 to 3.2 kg/m3.  The bottle roll
leach work showed gold recoveries of 78% after 72 hours. The column leach test work for gold
showed recoveries ranging from 57 to 69% with increased crushing.  For silver the column leach
test work showed recoveries of 31 to 62% with increased crushing.
The test work indicated that recoveries of gold could range from 41.7 to 84%, with coincident
recoveries of silver ranging from 24 to 62%.Further metallurgical test work is planned but these
initial results are encouraging and warrant further investigation. Initial results have shown that the
oxidized  Pinion  mineralization  is  amendable  to  heap  leach  extraction  techniques  which  is
common for Nevada Carlin-style deposits.

14.13.1          Visual Validation
 
The blocks were visually validated on cross-sections comparing block grades versus the sample
grades for all sections and drill holes (Figures 14.16 to 14.17). In addition, the block and sample
data were compared by lode, easting and northing. These comparisons are presented in Figures
14.18 to14.20 and Table14. 12.

14.13.3        Northing Comparison
The input sample composite average and the calculated block model grade were calculated on
200 m composite sections along northings (Figure 14.19). This is along the strike of the Pinion
deposit.  The purpose was to compare the input sample file with the resulting block model data to
make  sure  there  was  no  gross  over  or  under  estimation  occurring.  The  northing  composites
generally compare quite well. There is some local over and under estimation observed but this is
to be expected with the estimation process and the selection of the composite level relative to the
parent block centroids. Overall the block averages follow the general trend of the input sample
data.

The input sample composite average and the calculated block model grade were calculated on
200 m composite sections across eastings (Figure 14.20). This is across the strike of the Pinion
deposit.  The purpose was to compare the input sample file with the resulting block model data to
make sure there was no gross over or under estimation occurring. The east composites generally
compare quite well. There is some local over and under estimation observed but this is to be
expected  with  the  estimation  process  and  the  selection  of  the  composite  level  relative  to  the
parent block centroids. Overall the block averages follow the general trend of the input sample
data.

14.14           Resource Classification
 
The Pinion mineral resource estimate discussed in this report has been classified in accordance
with guidelines established by the CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
Best Practice Guidelines” dated November 23rd, 2003 and CIM “Definition Standards for Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves” dated November 14th, 2004.
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or
quality,  densities,  shape,  physical  characteristics  are  so  well  established  that  they  can  be
estimated  with  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the  appropriate  application  of  technical  and
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of
the  deposit.  The  estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable  exploration,  sampling  and  testing
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches,
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade
continuity.
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on
detailed  and  reliable  exploration  and  testing  information  gathered  through  appropriate
techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and  drillholes  that  are
spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or
quality  can  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  geological  evidence  and  limited  sampling  and
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes.
The  2014  Pinion  Mineral  Resource  has  been  classified  as  comprising  both  Indicated  and
Inferred  Resources  according  to  the  CIM  definition  standards.  The  classification  of  the  Pinion
Indicated and Inferred Resource was based on geological confidence, data quality and grade
continuity (Table 14.13).  The most relevant factors used in the classification process were:
Date: October 24, 2014
107
Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
· Drill hole spacing density
· Level of confidence in the geological interpretation, which is a result of the extensive re –
logging of drill chips.  The observed stratigraphic horizons are easily identifiable along strike
and across the deposit which provides confidence in the geological and mineralization
continuity.
· Estimation parameters i.e. continuity of mineralization
· Proximity to the recently completed 2014 drill holes.
For the classification of “Indicated”, the blocks that had been estimated in estimation runs 1 or 2
utilizing a search ellipsoid of a third of the suggested range identified in the variographic analysis
were  used  as  a  guide.    As  such,  these  blocks  exhibited  a  high  level  of  confidence.  This,  in
conjunction  with  the  proximity  of  the  2014  drilling  and  level  of  confidence  in  the  geological
interpretation, aided the decision to assign this area of the resource to the “Indicated” category.
All blocks with an Indicated classification were assigned with a code of two (2).  The remaining
resource situated within the optimized pit shell was classified as “Inferred”.  All blocks with an
“Inferred” classification were assigned a code of three (3).
It should be noted that only the gold estimation was assigned the indicated classification.  The
silver resource has been classified as entirely inferred. Further validation work on the historic
silver  analyses  and  methodology  is  required  along  with  additional  infill  sampling  in  order  to
increase  the  confidence  in  the  silver  model  in  order  to  bring  it  up  to  the  standard  of  the  gold
model.

*The  reader  is  cautioned  that  mineral  resources  are  not  mineral  reserves  and  do  not  have
demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the Indicated and
Inferred Pinion mineral resource discussed in this report will be converted into a mineral reserve
at any point in the future. However, while the project is at an early stage of resource evaluation, it
is the opinion of the authors of this report that the collective work completed to date at the Pinion
prospect has identified a mineral resources of sufficient size and grade (with respect to gold and

better define the Pinion mineral resource.
 
14.15           Evaluation of Reasonable Prospects for Economic Extraction
 
In order to demonstrate that the Pinion Gold Deposit has potential for future economic extraction,
the  unconstrained  resource  block  model  was  subjected  to  various  preliminary  pit  optimization
scenarios.  The criteria used in the Whittle pit optimizer were considered reasonable for Nevada
heap leach deposits and were run at gold prices (in US dollars) of $1,250/ounce, $1,400/ounce
and $1,550/ounce along with prices for silver at $21.50/ounce, $24/ounce and $26.50/ounce. All
mineral  resources  reported  below  are  reported  within  the  optimized  pit  shell  using  the
$1,250/ounce  for  gold  and  $21.50/ounce  for  silver  optimization.    The  criteria  used  for  the
$1,250/ounce pit shell optimization is shown in Table 14.14. The volume and tonnage for the
reported resources within the $1,250/ounce optimized pit shell represents approximately 82% of
the total volume and tonnage of the unconstrained block model (which utilized a lower gold cutoff
of 0.1 g/t Au).
Overall,  the  authors  of  this  Technical  Report  consider  that  these  assumptions  are  considered
reasonable for the purpose of determining reasonable prospects for future economic extraction of
the  Pinion  Deposit  for  the  purpose  of  providing  an  initial  resource  estimate.  The  resources
presented  herein  are  not  a  mineral  reserve  and  they  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic
viability. There has been insufficient exploration to define the resources as a measured mineral
resource,  and  it  is  uncertain  if  further  exploration  will  result  in  upgrading  them  to  a  measured
resource category and there is no guarantee that any part of the resources identified herein will
be converted to a mineral reserve in future.

14.16          Mineral Resource Reporting
 
The Pinion Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate is reported in accordance with the
Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated using
the CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines” dated
November  23rd,  2003  and  CIM  “Definition  Standards  for  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral
Reserves”  dated  November  27th,  2010.  This  is  the  first  NI  43-101  compliant  resource  for  the
Pinion Project.
The resource has been estimated within three dimensional solids that were created from cross-
sectional lode interpretation. The upper contact has been cut by the topographic surface.  There
is little to no overburden present at the Pinion property.  Grade was estimated into a block model
with parent block size of 10 m (X) by 10 m (Y) by 3 m (Z) and sub-blocked down to 5 m (X) by 5 m
(Y) by 1 m (Z).  A total of 171 density measurements were made on diamond drill core samples
using  the  air/water  displacement  method,  which  allowed  for  the  determination  of  a  nominal
density of 2.58 kg/m3  that  was  assigned  to  the  mineralization.    Grade  estimation  of  gold  and
silver was performed using the Inverse Distance squared (ID2) methodology.  The Indicated and
Inferred Mineral Resources are constrained within a drilled area that extends approximately 2.3
km  along  strike  to  the  north-northeast,  1.1  km  across  strike  to  the  east-southeast  and  400  m
below surface.
The Mineral Resource estimates are reported at a range of gold cut-offs grades in Table14.15
and Table 14.16 for both Indicated and Inferred categories, for gold and silver respectively.  No
portion  of  the  current  mineral  resource  has  been  assigned  to  the  “Measured”  category.    The
Pinion  Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  uses  a  cut-off  grade  of  0.14  g/t  Au,  which  is
constrained within an optimized (the $1,250/ounce for gold and $21.50/ounce for silver) pit shell
and includes an Indicated Mineral Resource of 20.84 million tonnes at 0.63 g/t Au for 423,000
ounces of gold and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 55.93 million tonnes at 0.57 g/t Au for 1.022
million ounces of gold.  The base case cut-off of 0.14 g/t Au is highlighted in each table.  Other
cut-off  grades  are  presented  for  review  ranging  from  0.1  g/t  Au  to  1.0  g/t  Au  for  sensitivity
analyses. Resource blocks flagged as “reduced” were removed from the overall resource. The
block modeled resource is shown with the $1,250/ounce for gold and $21.50/ounce for silver pit
shell in Figure 14.21 below.

15.0           ADJACENT PROPERTIES
The Railroad and Pinion Projects are situated along the southeastern portion of the Carlin Gold
Trend.    The  Rain  Mining  District,  which  is  largely  controlled  by  Newmont  Mining  Corporation
(Newmont), is located only 17 km (11 miles) north of the Pinion Gold Deposit (Figures 2.1 and
7.3a).  The Rain District has been an active exploration and mining area for several decades and
is the location for Newmont’s current mining activities at the Emigrant Mine.  The Rain – Emigrant
series of deposits has seen extensive exploration over the last three decades. To the south of the
Railroad and Pinion Projects, several exploration areas have received sporadic exploration over
the past three to four decades.  These areas include Pony Creek and the Dixie Creek Properties.
Adjacent properties with bearing or influence on the Railroad and Pinion Projects are described
below. The authors of this Technical Report have not visited or worked at any of these projects
and where references are made to past production and/or historic or current mineral resources
the authors have not verified the information.
 
15.1           Rain
 
Rain  is  a  Carlin-style,  sedimentary  rock-hosted  gold  deposit  that  is  located  approximately  10
miles (16 kilometers) north of Gold Standard’s Pinion Gold Deposit.  Newmont operated the Rain
open pit mine, the Rain Underground mine and the SMZ open pit mine from 1988 to 2000 and
produced  approximately  870,000  ounces  of  gold  (Longo et  al., 2002).    Longo et  al. (2002)
summarized a number of mineral resources for the three deposits as follows:  Rain open pit 15.5
million tons (14.1 million tonnes) at 0.066 oz Au/st (2.3 g/t) for a total of 1,017,300 ounces of gold;
Rain Underground 1.154 million tons (1.04 million tonnes) at 0.23 oz Au/st (7.9 g/t) for a total of
265,000 ounces of gold and the SMZ open pit 1.5 million tons (1.4 million tonnes) at 0.019 oz
Au/st (0.65 g/t) for a total of 30,000 ounces of gold. No mining has been conducted at these Rain
deposits since the date of the Longo et al. (2002) report. The resources pre-date NI 43-101 and
little or no detailed information such as potential resource category or number of drill holes etc. is
presented  for  the  estimates  or  how  the  resources  were  arrived  at,  therefore  the  estimates  are
considered  historic  in  nature  and  should  not  be  relied  upon.  None  the  less,  the  information
provides an indication of the potential size of the gold mineralized system and deposits held by
Newmont immediately north of Gold Standard’s Railroad and Pinion Project.

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
Along strike to the northwest of the Rain Project and likely on the same structure are the Saddle
and Tess gold deposits. The mineralized zones are roughly 17 km (11 miles) north-northwest of
the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit.  Longo et  al.  (2002)  states  that  Newmont  identified  a  primarily
underground high sulphide resource of 1.37 million tons (1.23 million tonnes) at 0.572 oz Au/st
(19.6 g/t) for a total of 782,000 ounces of gold at Tess and 3.99 million tons (3.59 million tonnes)
at 0.37 oz Au/st (12.7 g/t) for a total of 1,475,000 ounces of gold at Saddle. The project was part
of a joint venture between Premier Gold Mines and Newmont, but Premier recently relinquished
all of its South Carlin land holdings to Newmont in favour of a 1.5% NSR and certain rights from
Newmont for another project. No mining has been conducted at the two deposits. The resources
pre-date NI 43-101 and little or no detailed information such as potential resource category or
number of drill holes etc. is presented for the estimates or how the resources were arrived at,
therefore the estimates are considered historic in nature and should not be relied upon.
The Rain trend of mineralization is characterized by disseminated gold mineralization hosted in
dominantly  oxidized,  silicified,  dolomitized  and  barite  rich  collapse  breccia  with  rare  sulfides,
developed along the Webb Formation mudstone/Devils Gate Formation limestone contact and
along  the  Rain  Fault.    Important  ore-controlling  features  at  Rain  include  the  west-northwest
striking Rain fault, the Webb/Devils Gate contact, collapse breccia and northeast striking faults.
As at the Saddle and Tess deposits along the trend, shallow oxide zones give way to deeper
sulfide and carbon rich zones of substantial size and grade.
West-northwest striking structures, possibly similar in nature to the Rain Fault, are present at the
Railroad targets and the Pinion Gold Deposit within the Railroad - Pinion Project area. The west-
northwest structure at Railroad appears to control the spatial distribution of the breccia and gold
mineralization.  At Pinion, a number of west-northwest structures appear to separate and partially
control gold mineralization of the North Zone and the Main Zone.
 
15.2           Emigrant
 
Emigrant is a Carlin-style, sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposit that is located approximately 10
miles  (16  kilometers)  north-northeast  of  Gold  Standard’s  Pinion  Gold  Deposit.    Newmont  is
currently mining the deposit through open pit methods and processing the ore at an onsite, run of
mine  heap  leach  operation.  Disseminated  gold  mineralization  is  hosted  in  oxidized,  silicified,
dolomitized and barite rich collapse breccia developed within the Mississippian siliciclastic rocks
and the underlying Devils Gate limestone. Important ore-controlling features at Emigrant include
the north-south striking Emigrant Fault, solution collapse breccia and the Northeast Fault.
Open  pit,  oxide  resource  and  reserve  calculations  for  Newmont’s  Carlin  Trend  operations  are
typically  commingled  into  a  single  heading  of  “Carlin  open  pits,  Nevada”  category.    In  2003,
reserves at Emigrant were published at 1,200,000 ounces (Newmont, 2003).  No details were
provided by Newmont as to the quality of the reserves. The mine is expected to produce roughly
80,000 ounces of gold over a plus ten year mine life and has recently commenced production
(Harding, 2012).

15.3           Pony Creek Property
 
Pony Creek is located approximately six miles (10 kilometers) south of Gold Standard’s Pinion
Gold  Deposit.    Gold  mineralization  is  hosted  in  north  to  northeast-trending  shears  in  rhyolite
intrusive  and  Mississippian  to  Permian  age  sediments  proximal  to  the  intrusive  (Russell,
2006).   A total of 175 drill holes were completed on the project from 1981 through 2004, and in
these holes, 88 contained gold intercepts of at least 5 ft (1.5 m) of 0.010 oz/t Au (0.34 g/t). Russell
(2006) reports the presence of an NI 43-101 compliant resource, however, little or no information
is provided on how the resource was calculated. Russell (2006) reports the presence of 48 out of
a total of 151 holes in the resource area that yield a minimum of 20 feet (6.1 m) at a lower cutoff of
0.015 oz/t (0.51 g/t) Au. The resource estimate appears to be based on the average grade and
thickness of these 48 drill hole intercepts and a very simple polygonal area calculation rather
than a proper modern resource estimate complete with geological and wireframe interpretation
followed by block modeling and statistical estimation. The authors have not visited the property
nor reviewed the data in any detail. Based upon the information provided by Russell (2006), the
resource presented should not be relied upon.
 
15.4           Dixie Creek Property
 
Dixie  Creek  is  an  early  stage  exploration  target  located  approximately  two  miles  (three
kilometers)  south  of  Gold  Standard’s  Pinion  Gold  Deposit.    At  surface,  the  Diamond  Peak
Formation is silicified, argillized, contains barite and is locally cut by altered felsic dikes (Redfern,
2002).  At least 40 drill holes were completed on the property (Redfern, 2002).  These historic
holes  are  reported  to  have  ended  in  mudstone  and  sandstone  of  the  Chainman  Formation
(Redfern, 2002).  A carbonaceous siltstone horizon within the Chainman Formation contained
gold  mineralization  with  “values  of  to  nearly  1  g/t  Au  over  a  drill  length  of  100  ft  (30.5  m)”
(Redfern, 2002).  No NI 43-101 compliant resource has been disclosed at Dixie Creek.
 
16.0           OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
 
There  are  no  additional  data  for  the  Railroad  Pinion  Project  beyond  that  discussed  in  the
preceding sections.
 
17.0           INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
 
Gold  Standard’s  Railroad-Pinion  Project  is  located  at  the  southeast  end  of  the  Carlin  (Gold)
Trend, a northwest alignment of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits in northeastern Nevada
where more than 40 separate gold deposits have been delineated with production exceeding 80
million ounces of gold (Muntean, 2014).  The Project is centered on the fourth and southernmost
dome-shaped window along the Carlin Trend in the Piñon Range (Jackson and Koehler, 2014).
The  domes  are  cored  by  igneous  intrusions  that  uplift  and  expose  Paleozoic  rocks  that  are
favorable for hosting Carlin-style gold deposits.
 
The  Railroad-Pinion  Project  area  covers  a  significant  portion  of  the  southernmost  structural
window within the Carlin Trend that exposes prospective Paleozoic units that host mineralization
elsewhere  in  the  district  and  comprises  two  significant  gold  target  areas.  Historic  work  and
exploration conducted by GSV since 2010 has identified several significant zones of gold and
base  metal  mineralization  within  the  Railroad  Project.    In  early  2014,  GSV  increased  its
ownership of the Pinion Project, which adjoins the southern boundary of the Railroad Project and
is host to the Pinion Gold Deposit as well as the Dark Star and other prospects.  The combined
Railroad-Pinion Project was the subject  of  a  recent  Technical  Report  (Koehler et al.,  2014)  in
which detailed Recommendations were outlined for both the Railroad and Pinion Project areas.
Recent work completed at the Railroad-Pinion Project by GSV has been focused on the Pinion
Gold Deposit, which is the subject of this Technical Report.

In January 2014, Gold Standard announced that it had entered into an agreement with Scorpio
Gold Corporation to acquire the remaining portion of the highly prospective Pinion Project area
which is contiguous with the south end of the Company’s Railroad Gold Project (Gold Standard
Ventures  News  Releases  January  28  and  March  5,  2014).  The  acquisition  of  the  remaining
portions of the Pinion property, where GSV previously held a minority interest along with other
lands, completes the Company’s efforts to consolidate the mineral rights for the greater Railroad
District under a single operator.
 
A significant amount of exploration work has been conducted at the Pinion Gold Deposit since its
discovery in 1980 by Newmont.  Prior to 2014, the historic drilling database for the Pinion deposit
area comprised some 379 holes that were drilled between 1981 and 2007.  Upon completing the
acquisition  of  the  property  in  early  2014,  GSV  immediately  commenced  a  program  of  data
compilation and validation for the Pinion property that included the re-logging, and in some cases
the  sampling,  of  archived  drill  core  and  RC  cuttings  for  historical  Pinion  area  drill  holes  and
conducted a 13 hole (7,214 ft/2,199 m) drill program.  The 2014 Pinion work program comprised
the following;
 
-  the  compilation  and  validation  of  geological,  analytical  and  non-analytical  (i.e.  collar  and
survey) data for the 379 historical drillholes in the Pinion drilling database,
-  the re-logging of 215 historical drillholes from archived RC chips and core,
 
-  the collection of 394 samples of previously unsampled core from 11 historic drill holes,
 
-  the completion of 9 new RC holes (5,630 ft/1,716 m) and 4 new core holes (1,584 ft/483 m) from
which 1,515 new samples were collected,
-  the collection of 171 new specific gravity (SG) measurements from various lithologic units using
the water displacement technique, including a comparison of wax coated and non-wax coated
sample measurements, and
-  the  construction  of  a  new  geological  model  for  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit  based  upon  all
available historical and recent (2014) information.
-  A maiden resource estimate for the Pinion Gold Deposit.
The geological understanding of the Pinion mineralization from historic work indicated that the
Pinion Deposit was similar in character to Newmont’s currently producing Emigrant Mine located
about 11 miles (17 kilometers) to the north. The Pinion Gold Deposit occurs within the southern
portion of the Bullion Fault Corridor, which also hosts Gold Standard’s North Bullion discovery at
the  Railroad  Project.  Similar  to  the  Emigrant  Deposit,  the  Pinion  Deposit  gold  mineralization
occurs  in  an  oxidized  solution  collapse-style  breccia  developed  along  the  contact  between
Mississippian siliciclastic rocks and the underlying Devonian Devil’s Gate Formation limestone.
Based upon a detailed review of the Pinion drill hole database, the Pinion Deposit has grade
similar in size and tenor to that of Newmont’s Emigrant Deposit, along with significant amounts of
silver. The Pinion Deposit appears to be significantly, if not entirely, oxidized in character and the
northern portion of the deposit is exposed at surface.

Exploration and, in particular, drilling by GSV during 2014 met the three key objectives of their
exploration  program:  verifying  historical  drill  data,  expanding  the  known  limits  of  the  gold
mineralization and demonstrating the predictability of a new, comprehensive geological model.
Gold Standard personnel were able to refine the stratigraphy of the deposit area, which in turn
led to a more detailed interpretation of the stratigraphy and structure of the deposit.  With respect
to the Pinion stratigraphy, the dominant mineralized horizon is the multi-lithic breccia sandwiched
between the Tripon Pass silty micrite and the top of the Devil’s Gate Formation. Thickened zones
of mineralization occur in the vicinity of certain important structures/faults interpreted to be feeder
zones. The main “Pinion Horst” was defined and it appears to control mineralization and may be
coincident  with  a  shallow  plunging  open  anticline  structure  that  strikes  roughly  southeast-
northwest.    In  addition,  a  low  angle  thrust  fault  and  several  higher  angle  normal  faults  were
recognized.  Gold  mineralization  and  alteration  thicken  toward  several  of  the  high  angle  cross
cutting faults, with the Main Zone fault the best example, indicating that they were active during
mineralization and may have acted as feeders for the hydrothermal fluids. Some of the cross-
cutting faults appear to display some late, post mineralization movement as they have broken up
and offset the Pinion mineralized zone.  The low angle thrust fault, particularly well defined in the
southeastern  portion  of  the  property,  has  the  potential  to  repeat  the  mineralized  portion  of  the
stratigraphy both at depth and along strike.  Additionally, intrusive rocks occur within the Pinion
Deposit area comprising thin porphyritic dykes, which usually occupy important older structures
and may or may not have played a role in the mineralizing event.
 
The Pinion drill hole database validation and geological modeling work completed by GSV and
APEX  personnel  in  2014,  resulted  in  a  dataset  that  was,  in  the  opinion  of  the  authors  of  this
report,  sufficiently  validated  for  the  purposes  of  completing  an  initial  resource  estimate  for  the
Pinion  Gold  Deposit.  The  statistical  analysis,  geological  modelling  and  resource  estimation
discussed in this Technical Report was performed by Mr. Steven Nicholls, BA Sc, M AIG, under
the direct supervision of Mr. Michael Dufresne, M.Sc., P. Geol., P.Geo. both of whom are with
APEX Geoscience Ltd. and are Qualified Persons as defined by National Instrument 43-101. Mr.
Dufresne visited the property in May, 2013 and again in April and October, 2014 in order to verify
and  validate  the  historic  drill  hole  dataset  and  to  verify  the  recently  completed  2014  drilling
campaign completed by GSV.
 
Mineral resource modelling and estimation was carried out using a 3-dimensional block model
based on geostatistical applications utilizing MICROMINE (v14.0.6) mine planning software. The
resource modeling utilized a database comprising 392 drillholes that were completed between
1981 to 2014 and included 379 historic holes and 13 2014 holes in the immediate area of the
Pinion Gold  Deposit. The data set comprises 28,130 (gold) sample analyses of variable length
that  were  composited  to  3.0  m  resulting  in  a  total  of  4,573  composites  for  gold  and  2,316
composites for silver.
 
The  resource  was  estimated  within  three  dimensional  solids  that  were  created  from  cross-
sectional lode interpretation. The upper contact has been cut by the topographic surface.  There
is little to no overburden present at the Pinion property.  Grade was estimated into a block model
with a parent block size of 10 m (X) by 10 m (Y) by 3 m (Z) and sub-blocked down to 5 m (X) by 5
m (Y) by 1 m (Z).  A total of 171 density measurements were made on diamond drill core samples
using water displacement method, which allowed for the determination of a nominal density of
2.58 kg/m3  that  was  assigned  to  the  mineralization.    Grade  estimation  of  gold  and  silver  was
performed using the Inverse Distance squared (ID2) methodology.  The indicated and inferred
resources are constrained within a drilled area that extends approximately 2.3 km along strike to
the north-northeast, 1.1 km across strike to the east-southeast and 400 m below surface.
 
The Mineral Resource Estimates are reported at a range of gold cut-offs grades in Table 17.1
and Table 17.2 for both Indicated and Inferred categories, for gold and silver respectively.  No
portion  of  the  current  mineral  resource  has  been  assigned  to  the  “Measured”  category.  The
Pinion Indicated and Inferred mineral resource uses a lower cut-off grade of 0.14 g/t Au, which is
constrained within an optimized pit shell that includes an Indicated Mineral Resource of 20.84
million tonnes at 0.63 g/t Au for 423,000 ounces of gold and an Inferred Mineral Resource of
55.93 million tonnes at 0.57 g/t Au for 1.022 million ounces of gold (Table 17.1).  The Inferred
Mineral Resource for silver was constrained within the gold block model and consists of 76.77
million tonnes at 3.82 g/t Ag for 9.43 million ounces of silver and utilized the lower cutoff grade for
gold (Table 17.2).  The base case cut-off of 0.14 g/t Au is highlighted in each table.  Other cut-off
grades are presented for review ranging from 0.1 g/t Au to 1.0 g/t Au for sensitivity analyses. All
mineral  resources  reported  below  are  reported  within  an  optimized  pit  shell  using
$US1,250/ounce  for  gold  and  $US21.50/ounce  for  silver.  The  volume  and  tonnage  for  the
reported resources within the $US1250/ounce for gold pit shell represents approximately 82% of
the total tonnage of the unconstrained block model (which utilized a 0.1 g/t Au lower cutoff).

18.0           RECOMMENDATIONS
 
Gold  Standard’s  Railroad-Pinion  Project  is  located  at  the  southeast  end  of  the  Carlin  (Gold)
Trend in northern Nevada, which comprises a northwest alignment of sedimentary rock-hosted
gold deposits with total gold production through 2012 exceeding 80 million ounces (Muntean,
2014).  The project area covers a significant portion of the southernmost structural window within
the  Carlin  Trend  that  exposes  prospective  Upper  Paleozoic  –  Mississippian  units  that  host
mineralization elsewhere in the district and comprises two significant gold target areas. Historic
work and exploration conducted by GSV since 2010 has identified several significant zones of
gold and base metal mineralization within the Railroad Project and in early 2014 GSV increased
its ownership of the Pinion Project, which adjoins the southern boundary of the Railroad Project
and is host to the Pinion Gold Deposit.  The combined Railroad-Pinion Project was the subject of
a  recent  Technical  Report  (Koehler et  al.,  2014)  in  which  detailed  Recommendations  were
outlined for both the Railroad and Pinion areas. Recent work completed at the Railroad-Pinion
Project by GSV has been focused on the Pinion Gold Deposit and thus the recommendations
made  in  Koehler et al. (2014) pertaining to the Railroad target areas remain valid.  This report
describes an initial NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate for the Pinion Gold Deposit
and  the  following  section  discusses  recommendations  for  future  work  specific  to  the  Pinion
Project area.
Date: October 24, 2014

Technical Report Maiden Resource Estimate Pinion Project, Elko County, Nevada USA
Based upon the results to date, APEX Geoscience Ltd. recommends an aggressive exploration
program  for  the  Pinion  Project  area  involving  surface  exploration,  additional  exploration  and
resource  expansion  drilling  and  continued  metallurgical  test  work.    With  respect  to  fieldwork,
APEX  recommends  additional  soil  sampling  to  expand  upon  and  fill  in  gaps  to  the  existing
database for the Pinion Project area and cover potential strike extensions of the mineralization to
the northwest and southeast.  Additional geophysical surveying (including one or more of Gravity,
IP, CSAMT and airborne surveys) for the deposit and project area is strongly recommended to
provide  data  to  assist  the  targeting  of  both  infill,  step-out  and  exploration  drilling.  Continued
surface geological mapping and rock sampling is recommended to add to help refine the new
geological model for the deposit area that has been developed largely from sub-surface drillhole
information.
With  respect  to  drilling,  APEX  recommends  a  significant  drill  program  intended  to  a)  infill  the
current Pinion resource area and b) test for addition zones of mineralization and extensions to
existing zones, along with c) exploration drilling.  Specifically, a Phase 1 follow-up 50 hole drill
program is recommended that would comprise primarily RC drilling but would also include some
core drilling in order to confirm and expand the evolving geological model for the Pinion Gold
Deposit area.  Specifically, targeted infill drilling is recommended at several locations throughout
the southeastern portions of the current Pinion resource area where drill density is limited and
where several historical drill holes either terminate in mineralization or appear not to have been
drilled deep enough to have intersected the main multi-lithic breccias zone. Step-out drilling is
recommended along strike both to the north and south of the current resource area and drilling is
also  recommended  for  several  previously  untested  geochemical  and  geophysical  (gravity)
anomalies  in  proximity  to  the  current  Pinion  resource.  A  Phase  2  exploration  focused  drilling
program is also recommended in order to step out from pinion and identify further near surface
oxide  resources  at  targets  such  as  Dark  Star,  JR  Buttes  and  other  prospects.  Although  not
discussed in detail in this report, drilling is recommended at the Dark Star gold prospect that is
also located within the Pinion Project area approximately 2 miles (3km) east of the Pinion Gold
Deposit.    The  reader  is  referred  to  the  recent  Railroad-Pinion  Project  Technical  Report  by
Koehler et  al.  (2014)  for  additional  information  regarding  the  Dark  Star  prospect,  however,
historical drill results are sufficiently encouraging to warrant new drilling as there is significant
potential to outline additional near surface oxide resources in this area.
The  budget  presented  below  in  Table  18.1  is  intended  to  summarize  estimated  costs  for
completing the recommended work program described above for the Pinion Project area. The
authors recommend a total of 36,576 m (120,000 feet) of a combination of RC and core drilling in
phased  drilling  at  the  Pinion  Gold  Deposit  and  at  a  variety  of  targets  across  Gold  Standard’s
Pinion Project area for a total cost of $US7,200,000. Other recommended property wide activities
include geological mapping, geochemical sampling, ground and airborne geophysical surveys,
further metallurgical test work along with geological modeling leading to an updated resource
estimate and preliminary engineering and environmental studies. The estimated cost to conduct
these studies is $US1,300,000 and along with a contingency of 10%, yields an overall budget to
complete the recommended work of $US9,350,000 (Table 18.1).
It  is  the  opinion  of  the  authors  of  this  Technical  Report  that  all  of  the  recommended  work  is
warranted at this time and none is contingent upon the results of any other part of the program.
