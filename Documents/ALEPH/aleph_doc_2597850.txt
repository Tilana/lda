Operating and financial review
Group overview
The Company began the year with three strategic goals, namely:
1.
2.
3.
During the course of the year, it became clear that the best return for shareholders was likely to be
gained by pursuing the first of these as a priority, simply because, without a wharf (and ideally a
wharf of its own) the Company would remain beholden to others and unable to monetize its
substantial timber holdings. Accordingly, the Company committed to developing, as rapidly as
possible, into a sustainable timber-growing business with harvest income, gained from exports
across a wharf, ideally at its Smith Bay site.
The Company now considers the development of wharf infrastructure that allows exploitation of the
substantial standing timber resource to be virtually inevitable.
Even so, the Company has maintained its policy of valuing its standing timber at $0, primarily on
the basis that there is currently no deep-water wharf on Kangaroo Island, through which the timber
could be exported to markets in Asia, and neither is there yet a single proposal and a firm timetable
for the permitting and construction of such a wharf.
The valuation basis for the Company’s land is on the basis of its non-forestry (i.e. agricultural) use.
In the event that the Board considers that the situation has altered materially, such that a deep
water wharf with known costs and with a high probability of approval and construction is more likely
than not, the Board will review its valuation approach.
The Company continues to work on wharf development and believes the time is approaching when
it will no longer be appropriate to use its present valuation basis.

Diversity Report
Introduction
The following is the Diversity Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 for Kangaroo Island
Plantation Timbers Ltd ("the Company") prepared for the purposes of the Company's Annual Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016.
Diversity Policy
The ASX introduced a requirement for all listed companies to adopt a Diversity Policy and a Diversity
Strategy by no later than 30 June 2011, to disclose those documents to the shareholders, and to
report to the shareholders each year on the current diversity position in the Company including
culture, gender and age, and the progress towards achievement of the strategy objectives.
P a g e | 7
Directors’ Report (continued)
Diversity Report (continued)
The Diversity Policy is based upon the recommendations of the ASX and the Australian Institute of
Company Directors ("AICD") and as such will include requirements that may not be appropriate for
a small company such as Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd. As with all matters included in
the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations, any recommendation that is not
considered appropriate for the Company will be disclosed on an "if not why not" basis. The Policy
is outlined in the Statement of Corporate Governance which is available on the Company's web
site.
Responsibility
The Remuneration Committee (if formed, otherwise the Board) is charged with the responsibility for
implementation of the Diversity Policy and the oversight of the Diversity Strategy progress and
delegates that responsibility to the CEO. The Company Secretary is charged with the responsibility
for reporting to the Committee each year in accordance with the requirements of the Policy.
Current Position
As at 30 June 2016 there is an aggregate of 8 staff including Directors, employees and contractors
(full and part time) in the Company. Of the aggregate 3 are female (including a non-Executive
Director and the Chief Financial Officer), 1 is of different ethnic or cultural background, and nil are
mature age. Consequently, it could be said that the Company is already harnessing the benefits of
a diverse workforce. A number of diversity objectives were not implemented by the Group at this
stage given its size and low staff numbers. These are set out in the table below.
Diversity Strategy
The Diversity Strategy is also based upon the recommendations of the ASX and the AICD and sets
various strategies, initiatives and programs designed to as far as possible achieve the aims and
objectives of the Diversity Policy.
The current position with each of the strategy items and the time frame for achievement or otherwise
is listed in the following Table 1:

It should be noted that the ASX recognises that there is an historical "skewed' pipeline of
qualified and experienced personnel in the market and accordingly the gender diversity targets
must be regarded as "soft" and subject to the overriding caveat stated at Item 8 in the Diversity
Policy. The gender diversity targets are detailed at Item 2(c) of the Diversity Strategy.
"Since good governance principles require independence, transparency, diversity and
flexibility, the Board acknowledges the importance of Board structure and, as a
consequence, the Board seeks to use the following provisions as guidance when
implementing an effective governance structure in the Company.”
Board Skills
The Board should contain a relevant blend of expertise and diversity attributes (refer to
corporate governance statement for further information) as appropriate for a Company of its
size in:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Forestry
Accounting;
Finance;
Business;
Financial instruments;
Legal matters (especially when not present in the Company Secretary); and
Marketing.
Diversity at Board Level and Generally
The Board respects the values and the competitive advantage of culture, gender, ethnicity and age
"diversity", and the benefits of its integration throughout the Group. The Board has adopted a
specific Diversity Policy in order to enrich the Group's perspective, improve corporate performance,
increase shareholder value, and enhance the probability of achievement of the Group's objectives.
When addressing Board succession planning (and other appointments throughout the Company)
the Board has ensured that the Diversity Policy is respected, efforts are made to identify prospective
appointees who have Diversity attributes and efforts are made for any short list of prospective
appointees to include at least one male and one female candidate."
Compliance
Having regard to the size of the Group and the nature of its business, it is considered that the
Company complies as far as possible with the spirit and intentions of
the ASX Corporate
Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations in respect to
diversity.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Environmental regulation and performance
The Group’s operations are subject to environmental regulations pursuant to the conditions of tree
farm planning permissions and the requirements of planning and regulatory approvals of local
government councils. The Group also operates under environmental legal and licence requirements
governing its sawmill. To the best of the directors’ knowledge, the Group has complied with all
environmental regulations relating to its activities during the year.
Indemnification and insurance of directors and officers
During the financial year the controlled entity, on behalf of the Group, paid insurance premiums in
respect of directors' and officers' liability insurance against liability, except wilful breach of duty, of
a nature that is required to be disclosed under section 300(8) of the Corporations Act 2001. In
accordance with the insurance policy, further details of the nature of the liabilities insured against
and the amount of the premium are prohibited from being disclosed.
Proceedings of behalf of the Company
No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to
bring proceedings on behalf of the Company, or to intervene in any proceedings to which the
Company is a party, for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Company for all or part
of those proceedings.
Directors’ meetings
The number of meetings of directors held during the year and the number of meetings attended by
each director were as follows:

Committee membership
As at the date of this report, the Company had an Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors. Mr Holdaway is the Chair and the majority of members are independent non-executive
directors.
In view of the size of the parent entity, the directors have considered that establishing a nomination
and remuneration committee would contribute little to its effective management and accordingly all
directors participate in decisions regarding the nomination and election of new Board members.
Rounding
The amounts contained in this report and in the financial report have been rounded to the nearest
$1,000 (where rounding is applicable) under the option available to the Company under ASIC Class
Order 2016/191. The Company is an entity to which the Class Order applies.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Auditor independence and non-audit services
The directors have received the auditor’s independence declaration, which is included on page 20
of this report. The declaration forms part of the Directors’ report.
No director of the Group is currently or was formerly a partner of Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd.
Non-Audit Services
Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd were appointed as auditors on 28 August 2013 and the appointment
confirmed by shareholders at a General Meeting held on 28 August 2013.
During the year, Grant Thornton, the Company’s auditors, performed certain other services in
addition to their statutory audit duties.
The Board has considered the non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor and, in
accordance with written advice provided by resolution of the Audit and Risk Committee, is satisfied
that the provision of those non-audit services during the year is compatible with, and did not
compromise, the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following
reasons:
All non-audit services were subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the
Company and have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee to ensure they do not impact
upon the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor; and
The non-audit services do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as
set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing
or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the
Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards.

Remuneration committee
In view of the size of the parent entity, the directors have considered that establishing a nomination
and remuneration committee would contribute little to its effective management and accordingly all
directors participate in decisions regarding the nomination and election of new Board members.
The Board of Directors of the company is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration
arrangements for the directors and executives.
The Board of Directors assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of
executives on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the
overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality, high
performing director and executive team.
Company Secretary, Chief Financial Officer
The Board of Directors met once during the year to consider specific remuneration matters; the
Board did not use the professional services of Remuneration Consultants during the year.
Remuneration philosophy and structure
The Company has structured remuneration packages for its executives and directors in order to
attract and retain people with the necessary qualifications, skills and experience to assist the
Company in achieving its desired results.
The following table shows the net tangible asset per share, earning per share and share price of
the Group for the past 6 years:

Directors’ Report (continued)
Remuneration report (audited) (continued)
A review of the amount of remuneration has not been conducted in the period of this annual report.
The Board are of the opinion that remuneration should only be changed once the Group’s strategic
plans are further developed, as a result the next AGM will see a proposed change in the structure
of remuneration to allow flexibility when the Company’s strategic plans are advanced. The Board
will request shareholders approval at the next AGM to pay directors fees in cash rather than partly
in shares. In addition, the Company announced a Performance Rights Plan in January 2016, this
together with a proposed increase in the total Non-Executive Remuneration cap to $400,000, will
be subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM. However, the Board has no intention to
increase either the size of the board or the level of non-executive directors’ remuneration until there
are material changes in the Company’s circumstances.
Overall performance of the directors and the two executives of the Company are considered against:
Timely production of Company accounts and records;
the portfolio of
loans against acceptable write off and performance
•
• Management of
standards;
• Maintenance/improvement of the Net Tangible Assets of the Company;
• Control of costs;
Investor relations
•
Assessment of new opportunities; and
•
• Employee performance.
Performance is reviewed on an annual basis; the last review was undertaken in July 2016.
Remuneration reviewed by the Board (unless a Remuneration Committee is established) and is set
at around the mid-point for professional personnel as measured by knowledge of the members of
the Remuneration Committee and augmented by reference to reports produced by professional
Human Resources consultants.

approval. The Rights have been valued based on AASB 2 Share-based Payment, further
details are set out below.
(9)
No options were granted as part of remuneration during the year.
Performance Rights Plan
In January 2016 the Board determined that, at the next general meeting of the Company, it would
seek Shareholder approval to augment directors’ existing remuneration through the issue of
performance rights, triggered by meeting the following two conditions:
Condition 1.
Condition 2.
a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) threshold of the Company’s Shares; and
the share price must be equal to or greater than the original VWAP threshold share
price (being $15.00, $20.00 and $25.00 as set out below) at the date the shares
are issued.
A summary of the Performance Rights proposed is shown below:

The terms of the proposed Performance Rights Plan (“Plan”) involves the issue of Shares that will
rank equally with all other existing Shares in all respects including voting rights and entitlement to
participate in dividends and in future rights and bonus issues.
In addition, a Plan participant must not dispose of any Shares acquired under the Plan before the
end of the restriction period (if any) which are subject to the Plan rules and the terms of the specific
offer from time to time
The Plan was developed by the Board and their intentions were announced to the market on 18
January 2016. The Board have included the additional Condition 2 over the terms announced in
January 2016 in order to protect shareholders if the share price falls, subsequent to the VWAP
threshold being met.
The rationale for the Plan was, and is, to provide the Managing Director and the Non-Executive
Directors of the Company with increased remuneration in recognition of the additional duties of the
respective directors, and to incentivize them to align their interests more closely with those of
shareholders. While the Company's share price had begun to better reflect the underlying value of
its assets, there remained a substantial valuation gap that might be realised if a sustainable forestry
industry structure could be created on Kangaroo Island
P a g e | 15
Directors’ Report (continued)
Remuneration report (audited) (continued)
At the time the proposed Plan was announced, there were two fundamental uncertainties facing the
Company:
• Could a wharf allowing cost efficient export of forest products be built anywhere on
Kangaroo Island? and
If the wharf were to be built by a party other than the Company, could it obtain access on
fair and reasonable terms?
•
The Directors had in place strategies aimed at resolving each of these questions in a way that
optimises benefits to Shareholders, but the resolution of these matters remained highly uncertain.
The Plan was aimed at motivating efforts to resolve these matters to the Company's advantage.
The Directors considered calling an immediate Extraordinary General Meeting to have the Plan
approved by Shareholders.
It decided that the cost of doing so was not justified and determined to
take the Plan to the AGM in October. The objective of the Plan and the Rights announced on 18
January 2016 is to create a stronger link between executive and employee performance and reward
and increasing shareholder value through the provisions of the plan.
On the 18th January 2016 the Company’s share price was $12.60.
Since then (and as at the date of this notice), the $15.00 and $20.00 20-day VWAP share price
Condition 1 hurdles have been met, resulting in the following 130,001 performance rights to be
issued, subject to Shareholder approval of the Plan and the share price being equal to or greater
than the VWAP threshold value at the date the shares are issued, being Condition 2:

Valuation of Performance Rights
AASB 2 Share-Based Payment requires that the Company record the cost of all forms of Director
remuneration in the Company's accounts and sets out parameters for determining this cost. Refer
to Note 28 for further details
AASB 2 sets the valuation date (termed as Grant Date) as the date at which such a right has been
finally approved. Because the Directors did not seek immediate ratification of the Plan this approval
date will be 5 October 2016 - the date of the AGM.
This produces an unusual set of circumstances, in that the triggers for two of the tranches have
already been met and some of the uncertainty that existed when Directors settled on the Plan has
subsequently been resolved. The effect of this is that the recorded value is very much higher than
it would have been if the Grant Date had been when the Directors advised the market of the
proposed Plan. The two valuations are set out in the table below.

Remuneration report (audited) (continued)
The Directors believe the January 2016 valuation more correctly reflects the cost to the Company
of the Plan, but accepts that use of Accounting Standards is a fundamental requirement of Listed
companies and has used the AASB 2 valuation in its Annual Report.
Non-executive director remuneration
Objective
The Board seeks to set aggregate remuneration at a level that provides the Company with the ability
to attract and retain directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost that is acceptable to
shareholders.
Structure
The total amount paid to non-executive directors is determined by the Board from time to time for
presentation to and resolution by shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting. The current
maximum aggregate remuneration paid to non-executive directors is fixed at $300,000 pa. The
Board propose an increase in the maximum aggregate remuneration paid to non-executive directors
to $400,000, which will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM
The non-executive directors are paid a set amount per year. They are not eligible for any additional
payments, other than reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of the Group. No director is
employed under contract.
In the year ended 30 June 2016, non-executive fees amounted to $50,000 for each director (prior
to 17 March 2015: $50,000 for each director and Chair $75,000). The fees are all paid 50% in cash
and 50% by shares in lieu of cash.
During the year, the directors signed contracts setting out their obligations and remuneration. In
addition, a Performance Plan was announced in January 2016, subject to security holders’ approval.
Director performance reviews are in the form of informal annual self-review and discussion with the
other directors led by the Chairman.

their position and responsibilities with the Company so as to:
•
•
Align the interest of executives with those of shareholders; and

discretion.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Corporate information
The financial report for Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd for the year ended 30 June 2016
was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 29 August 2016.
Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd is a company incorporated and domiciled in Australia and
limited by shares, which are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors’
report.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies
Basis of preparation
2.
a)
The financial report is a general-purpose financial report, which has been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards and other
authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board. The financial report
has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties and freehold land
that have been measured at fair value. Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd is a for-profit entity
for the purposes of preparing the financial report.
The financial report is presented in Australian dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest
thousand dollars ($’000) unless otherwise stated under the option available to the Company under
ASIC Class Order 2016/191. The Company is an entity to which the class order applies.
Compliance with IFRS
b)
The financial report complies with Australian Accounting Standards as issued by the Australian
Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board.
There is no impact of new accounting standards and interpretations applied during the year.
New accounting standards and interpretations
c)
A number of new and revised standards became effective for the first time for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 July 2015. Information on the more significant standards is presented below.
AASB 2015-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Financial Reporting
Requirements for Australian Groups with a Foreign Parent
AASB 2015-4 amends AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures to ensure that its
reporting requirements on Australian groups with a foreign parent align with those currently available
in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements for such groups. AASB 128 will now only require
the ultimate Australian entity to apply the equity method in accounting for interests in associates
and joint ventures, if either the entity or the group is a reporting entity, or both the entity and group
are reporting entities.
AASB 2015-4 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015. The
adoption of this amendment has not had any impact on the Company.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material
impact on the company in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future
transactions.
Accounting standards issued but not yet effective and not been adopted early by the Company:

In May 2015, the AASB decided to

Basis of consolidation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
d)
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Kangaroo Island
Plantation Timbers Limited and its subsidiaries and as at and for the period ended 30 June each
year (the Group).
The Parent controls a subsidiary if
it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
subsidiary.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent
company, using consistent accounting policies. In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
all intercompany balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-Group
transactions and dividends have been eliminated in full.
All controlled entities have a June financial year-end.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and
cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries held by Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd are accounted for at
cost in the parent entity less any impairment charges. Dividends received from subsidiaries are
recorded as a component of other revenues in the separate income statement of the parent entity,
and do not impact the recorded cost of the investment. Upon receipt of dividend payments from
subsidiaries, the parent will assess whether any indicators of impairment of the carrying value of
the investment in the subsidiary exist. Where such indicators exist, to the extent that the carrying
value of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. See
Note 27 for parent entity information.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The
acquisition method of accounting involves recognising at acquisition date, separately from goodwill,
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are measured at their
acquisition date fair values.
The difference between the above items and the fair value of the consideration (including the fair
value of any pre-existing investment in the acquiree) is goodwill or a discount on acquisition.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For
the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit
from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned
to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit
disposal of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed
of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and
the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Non-controlling interests are allocated their share of net profit after tax in the statement of
comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial
position, separately from the equity of the owners of the parent.
Losses are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. A change
in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control, is accounted for as
an equity transaction.

Segment reporting
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
e)
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it
may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions
with other components of the same entity), whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the
entity's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the
segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available. This
includes start up operations, which are yet to earn revenues. Management will also consider other
factors in determining operating segments such as the existence of a line manager and the level of
segment information presented to the board of directors.
The group aggregates two or more operating segments when they have similar economic
characteristics, and the segments are similar in each of the following respects:
• Nature of the products and services
• Nature of the production processes
•
• Methods used to distribute the products or provide the services, and if applicable
• Nature of the regulatory environment
Type or class of customer for the products and services
Operating segments that meet the quantitative criteria as prescribed by AASB 8 are reported
separately.
However, an operating segment that does not meet the quantitative criteria is still reported separately
where information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements.
Information about other business activities and operating segments that are below the quantitative
criteria are combined and disclosed in a separate category for “all other segments”.
There have been no changes from prior period in the measurement methods used to determine
reported segment profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
f)
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an
original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and
cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables
g)
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for
any uncollectible amounts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts that are known to be
uncollectible are written off when identified. An impairment allowance is recognised when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the receivable. Financial difficulties of
the debtor, default payments or debts more than 60 days overdue are considered objective evidence
of impairment. The amount of the impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to
the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Biological Assets
h)
Timber plantations
Biological assets which include mature and immature radiata pine and eucalypt plantations are
stated at fair value less estimated point of sale costs. The Board has estimated this as $nil as at 30
June 2016. Refer to Note 14 for further details. The land element of the Biological Asset is disclosed
separately as freehold land in Note 12
P a g e | 32
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
The fair value is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of the asset
in an active and liquid market less the costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of
such disposal.
Net movement in fair value less estimated point of sale costs of biological assets are included in
profit or loss in the year they arise.
The change in estimated fair value is recognised in the income statement and is classified
separately.
The Company has a comprehensive risk management strategy in place to monitor and oversee its
timber plantations. The policy framework is set by the Board, with risk management addressing via
fire risk management, plantation management practices, and experienced staff and board.
Investments and other financial assets
i)
Investments and financial assets in the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets. The classification
depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Designation is re-evaluated at
each financial year-end, but there are restrictions on reclassifying to other categories.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of
investment not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Recognition and Derecognition
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i.e. the
date that the Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases
or sales of financial assets under contracts that require delivery of the assets within the period
established generally by regulation or convention in the market place. Financial assets are
derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or been
transferred.
(i) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are
derecognised or impaired. These are included in current assets, except for those with maturities
greater than 12 months after balance date, which are classified as non-current.
(ii) Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale investments are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as
available-for-sale or are not classified as any of
the three preceding categories. After initial
recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being
recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the
investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously
reported in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
The fair values of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets are determined
by reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. For
investments with no active market, fair values are determined using valuation techniques. Such
techniques include: using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current market
value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis and option
pricing models making as much use of available and supportable market data as possible and
keeping judgemental inputs to a minimum.

Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
j)
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Such cost includes the cost of replacing parts that are eligible for capitalisation
when the cost of replacing the parts is incurred. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised
in profit or loss as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as
follows:
Plant and equipment
Mobile plant and vehicles
Buildings
Straight Line
6-33%
20%
3%
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if
appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Freehold land and buildings
Freehold land is measured at fair value, less any impairment losses recognised at the date of
revaluation. Valuations are performed frequently to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset
does not differ materially from its carrying amount. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Building are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Any revaluation increment is credited to the asset revaluation reserve in equity, except to the extent
that it reverses a revaluation decrement for the same asset previously recognised in profit and loss,
in which case the increment is recognised in profit or loss.
Any revaluation decrement is recognised in the profit and loss, except to the extent that it offsets a
previous revaluation increment for the same asset, in which case the decrement is debited directly
to the asset revaluation reserve to the extent of the credit balance existing in the revaluation reserve
for that asset.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in profit or loss within other income or expenses.
Upon disposal or derecognition, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold
is transferred to retained earnings.
Certain leasehold land, held under perpetual crown leases, is treated in the same manner as
freehold land.
Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Investment properties
k)
Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying
amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is
incurred if the recognition criteria are met, and excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an
investment property. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value,
which reflects market conditions at the balance date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the
fair values of investment properties are included in the profit and loss in the year in which they arise.
Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when the
investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected
from its disposal. Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are
recognised in the profit and loss in the year of retirement or disposal.
P a g e | 34
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
Transfers are made to investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use,
evidenced by ending of owner-occupation, commencement of an operating lease to another party
or ending of construction or development. Transfers are made from an investment property when,
and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by commencement of owner-occupation or
commencement of development with a view to sale.
For a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property or inventories, the deemed cost
of property for subsequent accounting is its fair value at the date of change in use. If the property
occupied by the Group as an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the Group
accounts for such property in accordance with the policy stated under Property, plant and equipment
up to the date of change in use. For a transfer from inventories to investment property, any
difference between the fair value of the property at that date and its previous carrying amount is
recognised in profit or loss. When the Group completes the construction or development of a self-
constructed investment property, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date
and its previous carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment of non-financial assets
l)
Non-financial assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels of which there are separately identifiable cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-
generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are tested for possible reversal of
the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may
have reversed.
Trade and other payables
m)
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised cost due to their short-term nature
they are not discounted. They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group
prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to
make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. The amounts are
unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
Provisions and employee leave benefits
n)
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable than an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the profit
or loss net of any reimbursement.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the present obligation at the balance date. If the effect of the time value of money
is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of
money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision
resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
Employee Leave Benefits
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating
sick leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in respect
of employees’ services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be
paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when
the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
P a g e | 35
Revenue recognition
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Contributed equity
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
o)
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
p)
Revenue is recognised and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable
to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be
reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is
recognised.
Timber sales
Timber sales are recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risk and
reward of ownership, generally when the customer has taken delivery of the goods.
Interest
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method, which is the rate
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial
instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Operating leases
The Group also earns rental income from operating leases of its property plant and equipment (see
Note 6 and 12). Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Financial Instruments
q)
Recognition, Initial Measurement and Derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the financial instrument, and are measured initially at fair value adjusted
by transactions costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or loss, which are
measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities
are described below.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial
asset expire, or when the financial asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A
financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets other than those designated and
effective as hedging instruments are classified into the following categories upon initial recognition:
• Loans and receivables
• Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (‘FVTPL’)
• Financial assets at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (‘FVTOCI’)
• Held-To-Maturity (‘HTM’) investments; or
• Available-For-Sale (‘AFS’) financial assets
All financial assets except for those at FVTPL are subject to review for impairment at least at each
reporting date to identify whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group
of financial assets is impaired. Different criteria to determine impairment are applied for each
category of financial assets, which are described below.
All
income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are
presented within finance costs, finance income or other financial items, except for impairment of
trade receivables which is presented within other expenses.
P a g e | 36
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the
effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash and cash equivalents, trade and most other
receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when
other objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are
not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, which are
determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other shared credit risk
characteristics. The impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default
rates for each identified group.
Financial Assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets that are either classified as held for trading or
that meet certain conditions and are designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition. All derivative
financial instruments fall into this category, except for those designated and effective as hedging
instruments, for which the hedge accounting requirements apply (see below).
Assets in this category are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss.
The fair values of financial assets in this category are determined by reference to active market
transactions or using a valuation technique where no active market exists.
HTM Investments
HTM investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturity other than loans and receivables. Investments are classified as HTM if the Group has the
intention and ability to hold them until maturity. The Group currently does hold not HTM investments.
HTM investments are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, determined by reference to external
credit ratings, the financial asset is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Any changes to the carrying amount of the investment, including impairment losses, are recognised
in profit or loss.
AFS financial assets
AFS financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category
or do not qualify for inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s AFS
financial assets include freehold land held for sale.
All other AFS financial assets are measured at fair value. Gains and losses are recognised in other
comprehensive income and reported within the AFS reserve within equity, except for impairment
losses and foreign exchange differences on monetary assets, which are recognised in profit or loss.
When the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired the cumulative gain or loss
recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from the equity reserve to profit or loss
and presented as a reclassification adjustment within other comprehensive income.
Interest
calculated using the effective interest method and dividends are recognised in profit or loss within
‘finance income’.
Reversals of impairment losses for AFS debt securities are recognised in profit or loss if the reversal
can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For AFS
equity investments impairment reversals are not recognised in profit loss and any subsequent
increase in fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and derivative financial
instruments.
P a g e | 37
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
Financial
liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, except for financial liabilities held for trading or designated at FVTPL, that are carried
subsequently at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. All derivative financial
instruments that are not designated and effective as hedging instruments are accounted for at
FVTPL.
All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument's fair value that are reported
in profit or loss are included within finance costs or finance income.
r)
The employee and officer share scheme allows Company employees to acquire shares of the
Company. The fair value of options or rights granted is recognised as an employee expense with a
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking
into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where
forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The fair value of the right granted is measured using the share price at the grant date, taking into
account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted. The amount recognised as
an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of rights in the period in which they are issued.
Share-based payment transactions
Non-current assets classified as held for sale
s)
When the Group intends to sell a non-current asset or a group of assets (a disposal group), and if
sale within twelve (12) months is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is classified as ‘held
for sale’ and presented separately in the statement of financial position. Liabilities are classified as
‘held for sale’ and presented as such in the statement of financial position if they are directly
associated with a disposal group.
Assets classified as ‘held for sale’ are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately
prior to their classification as held for sale and their fair value less costs to sell. However, some
‘held for sale’ assets such as financial assets or deferred tax assets, continue to be measured in
accordance with the Group's accounting policy for those assets.
Income tax
t)
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the current period’s
taxable income. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance date.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance date between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
•
when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
when the taxable temporary difference associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates
or interests in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.
•
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will
be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused
tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
P a g e | 38

•
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
•
when the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or
loss; or
when the deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates or interests in joint ventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is only recognised
to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable
future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or
part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred
tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply
to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit
or loss.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Tax consolidation legislation
Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have
implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of 1 July 2004.
The head entity, Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd and the controlled entities in the tax
consolidation Group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The Group
has applied the Group allocation approach in determining the appropriate amount of current taxes
and deferred taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated Group.
In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd
also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused
tax losses and tax credits assumed from controlled entities in the tax consolidation Group.
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are
recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group. Details of the tax
funding agreement are disclosed in Note 7.
Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax
funding agreement are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax
consolidated entities.
Other taxes
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
• when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the
taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of
the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.
•
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part
of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
P a g e | 39
Earnings per share
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component
of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable
to, the taxation authority are classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or
payable to, the taxation authority.
u)
Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted
to exclude any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends,
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to member of the parent adjusted
for:
•
•
Costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends;
The after tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary
shares that have been recognised as expenses; and
Other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would
result from the dilution of potential ordinary shares;
•
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares,
adjusted for any bonus element.
Comparative figures
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
v)
Where necessary, comparatives have been reclassified and repositioned for consistency with
current year disclosures.
w)
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management
continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent
liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements and estimates on historical
experience and on other various factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
result of which form the basis of the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions and conditions.
Management has identified the following critical accounting policies for which significant judgements,
estimates, and assumptions are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect financial results or the financial
position reported in future periods.
Valuation of biological asset
The Company has, in recent years, maintained a policy of valuing the standing timber element of
its biological asset at $nil, primarily on the basis that there was no immediate prospect of a deep-
water wharf on Kangaroo Island, through which the timber could be exported to markets in Asia
However, over the past two years, the Company has acquired a deep-water wharf site in close
proximity to its plantations, commissioned bathymetric analysis of
the adjoining seabed,
commissioned a report yielding a costed design for a wharf and has been working with local and
state governments and with other timber owners on Kangaroo Island to develop an affordable route
to market, by the construction of a deep-water berth.
The Company now considers the development of wharf infrastructure that allows exploitation of the
substantial standing timber resource to which be virtually inevitable. What is not yet certain is the
form and location of the wharf and the terms on the Company may be able to obtain access. As a
result the Company believes it does not yet have sufficient certainty about the form and quantum of
future cash flows to justify a change in valuation approach.
P a g e | 40
Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued)
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2.
The Company continues to work on wharf development and believes the time is approaching when
it will no longer be appropriate to use its present valuation basis.
Valuation of investment properties and freehold land
Investment properties and freehold land are stated at the Board’s estimate of fair value, based on
an assumed average value of $2,329 (2015: $2,329) per arable hectare for Kangaroo Island
farmland, discounted for remoteness and soil quality. Uncleared land and structural and other
improvements are carried at zero. The figure of $2,329 is derived from sales of similar land on the
Island. When the basis of valuation of the Company’s standing timber alters the fair value basis for
the valuation of land will be based on plantation land.
Recovery of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences if management considers
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise those temporary differences.
Fair value of Performance Rights
The fair value of the performance rights granted is measured using significant estimates in relation
to the share price at the grant date, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the
rights were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense for the 2016 financial year is calculated using estimations
for the expected vesting periods, fair value of the performance rights at grant date and remaining
uncertainties about the satisfaction of performance conditions. Refer to Note 28 for further details.
Going concern assumptions
x)
This financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates the
continuity of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the
normal course of business.
During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group incurred a net loss after tax of $2,831,000 a net
cash outflow used in operating activities of $713,000. The cash and cash equivalents balance, as
at 30 June 2016 was $895,000. The consolidated entity’s net current asset position at 30 June 2016
was $307,000.
The Group’s primary focus is on development of the Group’s operations on Kangaroo Island. To
date this has primarily been funded through the sale of non-core assets. As the Group's plans
progress it will be necessary to raise further capital to enable, for example, the construction of a
deep water wharf at Smith Bay.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial position and are of the opinion that the use of
the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate as they believe the Group will be successful
in securing the additional funds both through the raising of equity and debt capital and through the
previously announced sale of non-core asset at Lycurgus $200,000. The sales agreement was
signed prior to period end and the completion is expected in 2016.
Should the Group not achieve the plans set out above, there is uncertainty whether the Group can
continue as a going concern and therefore whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its

Financial risk management objectives and policies
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
3.
Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluation of conditions
specific to the Group and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. If an impairment trigger
exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. Management has considered the triggers
for impairment and concludes that no impairment is required for year ended 30 June 2016.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise receivables, payables, cash and short-term
deposits.
The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks in accordance with the Group’s financial risk
management policy. The objective of the policy is to support the delivery of the Group’s financial
targets whilst protecting future financial security.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised
below.
Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks is shared between the board
members and executive management.
Categories of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in each category are as follows:

Risk Exposures and Responses
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s
interest bearing liabilities and short-term deposits.
At balance date, the Group had the following mix of financial assets and liabilities exposed to

The Group has no outstanding debt exposed to variable rates of interest.
The following sensitivity analysis is based on the interest rate risk exposures in existence at the
balance date.
At 30 June 2016, if interest rates had moved, as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables
held constant, post tax profit and equity would have been affected as follows:

Judgements of reasonably possible
movements:
Consolidated
-
+1%
-0.5%
-
The movements in profit are due to higher/lower interest costs from variable rate debt and cash
balances.
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents
and trade and other receivables. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from potential default
of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Exposure at balance date is addressed in each applicable note.
The Company aims to minimise concentrations of credit risk in relation to trade receivables and
loans to growers by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers.
Cash at bank is held at the National Australia Bank, which has an S&P (Standard & Poors) rating
of AA.
Credit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:
•
•
•
payment terms are 30 days for receivables other than loans to growers
a regular risk review takes place on all receivables and loan balances
a thorough assessment process is used for all growers loans
The Chief Financial Officer has direct responsibility of the recovery of outstanding accounts. All
overdue accounts are now sent directly to the Group’s lawyers for legal action after other avenues
of recovery have been exhausted.
Legal action on those particular accounts where the matter is being defended are dealt with directly
by the Chief Financial Officer and the lawyers involved.
The Chief Financial Officer regularly reports to the Board of Directors on these matters.
Refer to Note 10 for ageing analysis of receivables.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through
the use of bank loans and other available credit lines.
The table below reflects all contractually fixed settlements and receivables for settlement,
repayments and interest resulting from recognised financial assets and liabilities as of 30 June 2016.
Cash flows for financial assets and liabilities without fixed amount or timing are based on the
conditions existing at 30 June 2016.
The remaining contractual maturities of the Group’s financial liabilities are:

Maturity analysis of financial assets and liability based on management’s expectations
Trade payables and other financial liabilities mainly originate from the financing of assets used in
our ongoing operations. These assets are considered in the Group’s overall liquidity risk. To monitor
existing financial assets and liabilities as well as to enable an effective controlling of future risks,
Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd has established risk reporting covering its business that
reflects expectations of management of expected settlement of financial assets and liabilities.

Fair value of the Group’s main property assets is estimated by the directors with reference to the
average selling price of arable and pasturable land on Kangaroo Island in the last two years. See
Note 13 for further details. The significant inputs and assumptions are developed in consultation
with management. The valuation processes and fair value changes are reviewed by the Board of
Directors and Audit Committee at each reporting date. Further information is set out below.
Land held for production in Australia (Level 3)
The review was carried out using a market approach that reflects observed prices for recent market
transactions for similar properties and incorporates adjustments for factors specific to the land in
question, including plot size, location, encumbrances and current use.
The significant unobservable input is the adjustment for factors specific to the land in question. The
extent and direction of this adjustment depends on the number and characteristics of the observable
market transactions in similar properties that are used as the starting point for valuation. Although
this input is a subjective judgement, management considers that the overall valuation would not be
materially affected by reasonably possible alternative assumptions.
Assets classified has held for sale (Level 3)
Arable land properties with a fair value of $200,000 (2015: $367,293) have been sold for $200,000
(2015: $385,000), contracts were exchanged in March 2015 and settlement is expected subsequent
to balance date.
In the prior year, an investment property with a fair value of $170,000 was sold for $170,000,
contracts were exchanged in June 2014 and completion occurred in August 2015.

Tax effect accounting by members of the tax consolidated Group
Members of the tax consolidated Group have entered into a tax funding agreement. The tax funding
agreement provides for the allocation of current taxes to members of the tax consolidated Group.
Deferred taxes are allocated to members of the tax consolidated Group in accordance with a Group
allocation approach which is consistent with the principles of AASB 112 Income Taxes.
The allocation of taxes under the tax funding agreement is recognised as an increase/(decrease) in
the member entities’
intercompany accounts with the tax consolidated Group head company,
Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Ltd. In this regard the Company has assumed the benefit of
tax losses from the member entities as of the balance date. The nature of the tax funding agreement
is such that no tax consolidation contributions by or distributions to equity participants are required.
Tax losses not recognised
The gross value of tax losses not recognised at 30 June 2016 amount to $6,056,650 (2015:

Freehold land revaluations
b)
Freehold land acquired is carried at fair value, which has been determined by the Directors with
reference to the average sale price of arable land on Kangaroo Island in the last three years. See
Note 13 for further commentary on the determination of fair value.
If the cost model had been used, the carrying amounts of the re-valued land would be $3,078,076
(2015: $3,078,076).
During the year the Company signing of an agreement with Primary Securities to remove an
encumbrance on freehold land. The fair value of this land has been adjusted by $302,966 (June
2015: $nil). Under the agreement 8,670 of shares were issued on 14 January 2016 at $12.60 per
share (being the quoted share price on date of issue), total $109,242, resulting a fair value gain of
$193,724 (refer to Notes 18 and 28 for further details).
c) Operating lease
The Group also earns rental income from operating leases of its investment properties (see Note
6).

Investment properties are carried at fair value, which has been determined by the Directors with
reference recent land sales on Kangaroo Island. This approach has been based on the expectation
of the properties eventually returning to non-forestry agricultural use. As noted in the Directors’
Report and in Note 14 below the Company continues to work on wharf development and believes
the time is approaching when it may no longer be appropriate to use its present valuation basis for
its timber assets. At that time it will be necessary to also change the basis for valuation of the
Company’s land which will be, at that time, expected to remain in forestry use.
The fair value represents the amount at which the assets could be exchanged between a
knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller at an arm’s length transaction at the
date of valuation.
In determining fair value for the Kangaroo Island land, the following main inputs have been used:
•
•
Plantation land has been assessed at $2,329 (2015: $2,329) per arable or pasturable
hectare (after allowances for fencing and other costs); and
No value has been ascribed to uncleared land under natural vegetation unless specifically
subdivided for the purpose of sale.
These inputs have been referenced to market information.

Standing timber at fair value
0
0
The Company has, in recent years, maintained a policy of valuing its standing timber at $0, primarily
on the basis that there was no immediate prospect of a deep-water wharf on Kangaroo Island,
through which the timber could be exported to markets in Asia.
However, over the past three years, the Company has acquired a deep-water wharf site in close
proximity to its plantations and commissioned the following reports:
•
•
•
• wave, current and tide report
bathymetric analysis of the adjoining seabed,
a costed design for a wharf;
two separate ecological studies; and
P a g e | 53
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
14. Biological assets (continued)
The Company has been working with local and state governments and with other timber owners on
Kangaroo Island to develop an affordable route to market, by the construction of a deep-water berth.
The Company now considers the development of wharf infrastructure that allows exploitation of the
substantial standing timber resource to be virtually inevitable. What is not yet certain is the form and
location of the wharf and the terms on which the Company may be able to obtain access. As a
result, the Company believes it does not yet have sufficient certainty about the form and quantum
of future cash flows to justify a change in valuation approach.
The Company continues to work on wharf development and believes the time is approaching when
it will no longer be appropriate to use its present valuation basis.
During the prior year, the Company commissioned and received a report and valuation model from
Geddes Management Pty Ltd (Geddes), a reputable and experienced firm of consultant foresters.
The valuation model used by Geddes allows the Company to estimate the value of its timber under
various scenarios, and to consider the impact of variables within and outside the Company’s control,
such as harvesting costs, internal road construction costs, haulage, wharf charges, exchange rates
and international timber prices. Like any forward-looking valuation, the outputs are sensitive to the
choice of assumptions. Geddes’ report valued the Company’s timber at $22.3m.

The Board seeks Shareholder approval to augment directors’ existing remuneration through the
issue of performance rights, triggered by meeting the following two conditions:
Condition 1.
Condition 2.
a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) threshold of the Company’s Shares; and
the share price must be equal to or greater than the original VWAP threshold share
price (being $15.00, $20.00 and $25.00 as set out below) at the date the shares are
issued.

On the 18th January 2016 the Company’s share price was $12.60.
Since then (and as at the date of this notice) Condition 1, the $15.00 and $20.00 20-day VWAP
share price hurdles have been met, resulting in 130,001 performance rights being issued after the
Annual General Meeting, subject to Shareholder approval of the Plan and Condition 2, the issue
price being equal to or higher than the VWAP threshold share price on the date of issue.
Valuation of Performance Rights
AASB 2 Share-Based Payment requires that the Company record the cost of all forms of Director
remuneration in the Company's accounts and sets out parameters for determining this cost.
AASB 2 sets the valuation date (termed to Grant Date) as the date at which such a right has been
finally approved. Because the Directors did not seek immediate ratification of the Plan this approval
date will be 5 October 2016 - the date of the AGM.
This produces an unusual set of circumstances, in that the triggers for two of the tranches have
already been met and some of the uncertainty that existed when Directors settled on the Plan has
subsequently been resolved. The effect of this is that the recorded value is very much higher than
it would have been if the Grant Date had been when the Directors advised the market of the
proposed Plan. Refer to the Remuneration Report and Note 28 for further information.

consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the 
year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the 
Company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the

Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true

AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, the financial statements comply with

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
Company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion.
Independence 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.
Auditor’s opinion 
In our opinion: 
a
the financial report of Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers Limited is in accordance with 
the Corporations Act 2001, including:
i
ii
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 
2016 and of its performance for the year ended on that date; and
complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 
2001; and
b
the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Material uncertainty regarding continuation as a going concern 
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2(x) in the financial report which 
indicates that the consolidated entity incurred a net loss of $2,831,000 and net cash outflows 
from operating activities of $713,000 during the year ended 30 June 2016. These conditions, 
along with other matters as set forth in Note 2(x), indicate the existence of a material uncertainty 
which may cast significant doubt about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its 
liabilities in the normal course of business, and at the amounts stated in the financial report.
