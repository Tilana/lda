end of the armed conflict that took place from 12 July to 14 August 2006. 
 
</p>
<p>The present report contains the findings of the four special procedures mandate holders 
concerning how the conduct of the hostilities by Israel and Hezbollah affected the rights to life, 
health and housing of the civilian population in Lebanon and Israel, as well as the rights of 
persons internally displaced by the armed conflict.  The report also examines the major 
challenges to the enjoyment of these rights in the aftermath of the conflict. 
 
</p>
<p>On the basis of their findings, the four mandate holders address recommendations to the 
Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to Hezbollah, to the Human Rights Council, to the 
Commission of Inquiry established by Council resolution S-2/1 and to the international 
community. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston; 
the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt; the Representative of the Secretary-General 
on human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin; and the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, Miloon Kothari, 
visited Lebanon from 7 to 10 September and Israel from 10 to 14 September 2006 at the 
invitation of the two Governments and in accordance with their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p>2. The main objectives of the mission were (i) to assess, from the perspective of 
international human rights and humanitarian law as covered by their respective mandates, the 
impact on the civilian populations of the armed conflict that affected southern Lebanon and other 
parts of the country and northern Israel between 12 July and 14 August 2006; (ii) to advise the 
authorities on fulfilling their responsibility to protect and assist affected civilians in accordance 
with their human rights obligations and in light of the challenges faced by the respective 
Governments; and (iii) to make recommendations to United Nations agencies and other relevant 
actors on how best to address the protection needs of the people concerned, especially the most 
vulnerable among them. 
</p>
<p>3. The mission was undertaken by the four mandate holders on their own initiative in 
response to a suggestion by the President of the Human Rights Council.  The mission was 
entirely independent of the Commission of Inquiry established on the basis of Council 
resolution S-2/1.  
</p>
<p>4. In Lebanon, the mission met with President Lahoud, Prime Minister Siniora, and the 
Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Health, the Interior, Justice, and Social Affairs as well as with 
representatives of several governmental agencies and the Parliamentary Human Rights 
Committee, the Lebanese Armed Forced and international agencies.  It visited the southern 
suburbs of Beirut and travelled to the south, including Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Shab.  In 
Israel, the mission met with the Chief Justice and government officials, including the Minister of 
Tourism, the senior Media Adviser to the Prime Minister, senior officials of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health, the former Intelligence Research Chief, and the Head 
of the control department in the operations division and officers of the Home Front Command of 
the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), the parliamentary commission on human rights as well as the 
legal advisers to IDF and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The mission also travelled to the 
north of the country, including Mrar, Kiriat Shmona, Majd al Krum, Nahariya, Haifa and 
Nazareth.  In both countries, the mandate holders met with representatives of civil society 
organizations as well as victims of the conflict.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>5. The members of the mission express their appreciation for the full cooperation of the 
relevant authorities and for the open and constructive manner in which discussions took place in 
both countries.  They are also very grateful to members of civil society for the meetings held and 
information provided, and to the many individual victims who shared their stories.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.</b>  <b>GENERAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>6. The<b> </b>history of Lebanon and Israel is marked by tensions and a succession of conflicts, 
notably in 1978 and 1982.  In May 2000, the Government of Israel withdrew its troops from 
Lebanon as requested by the Security Council in resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978).  On 
2 September 2004, the Council adopted resolution 1559 (2004) in which it reiterated its strong 
support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon and called 
upon all remaining forces to withdraw from Lebanon, and for the disbanding and disarmament of 
all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias.  In April 2005, the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic withdrew its troops from Lebanon which had been present on Lebanese territory 
since 1976.  Despite the continuing dialogue on the issue within Lebanon, Hezbollah has not yet 
disarmed despite the Lebanese Cabinet decision stipulating that &#8220;there will be no weapons or 
authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese State&#8221;.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>7. On 12 July 2006, Hezbollah fighters crossed the border into Israel, attacked an Israeli 
patrol near the village of Zarit, killed eight Israeli soldiers and returned to Lebanon with 
two captured Israeli soldiers.  This triggered a major armed conflict between Hezbollah and 
Israel.  Lebanon suffered air, sea and land attacks, and Hezbollah launched thousands of rockets 
on northern Israel.  
</p>
<p>8. The conflict had far-reaching effects on the civilian population.  In Lebanon, 
1,191 people were reportedly killed and 4,405 wounded.<b>3</b> Children accounted for one third of 
casualties and deaths and an estimated 45 per cent of internally displaced persons (IDPs).<b>4</b>  Tens 
of thousands of homes and much public infrastructure were damaged or destroyed and up to an 
estimated 1 million persons were displaced.  Humanitarian access to those who were unable or 
unwilling to leave endangered areas became difficult and limited, and some communities were 
isolated for prolonged periods of time. 
</p>
<p>9. In Israel, Magen David Adom statistics indicate that 43 civilians were killed, including 
seven children.  One third of those killed were Arab Israelis.  Seventy-five civilians were 
seriously injured, 115 suffered moderate wounds and 807 suffered light wounds.<b>5</b>  Several 
hundred thousand persons were displaced and many more forced to live for some of the time in 
shelters.<b> 6</b>  
</p>
<p>10. On 11 August 2006, the Security Council adopted resolution 1701 (2006) in which the 
Council, inter alia, called for &#8220;a full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the 
immediate cessation by Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all 
offensive military operations&#8221;, emphasized &#8220;the importance of the extension of the control of the 
Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory&#8221; and expanding the United Nations Interim 
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and its mandate. 
</p>
<p>11. On the same day, the Human Rights Council convened its second special session.  In 
resolution S-2/1 the Council strongly condemned the grave Israeli violations of human rights and 
breaches of international humanitarian law in Lebanon.  It further decided to establish and 
immediately dispatch a high-level commission of inquiry to investigate, inter alia, the systematic 
targeting of civilians by Israel in Lebanon and to assess the impact of Israeli attacks on human 
life, property, critical infrastructure and the environment. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. While the fighting continued after the adoption of Council resolution 1701 (2006) and 
even intensified up to the last moment, the cessation of hostilities took effect on 14 August 2006 
at 8 a.m.  Immediately afterwards, in both countries persons displaced by the conflict began 
returning in large numbers to their areas of residence.  The homes of many returnees to southern 
Lebanon had been destroyed, and they faced shortages of water and electricity as well as very 
limited access to health and other public services damaged during the conflict.  Unexploded 
ordnance, especially cluster bomblets, also presented great dangers to the civilian population, 
particularly in southern Lebanon.  Returning Israelis found homes and other amenities destroyed 
and damaged.  
</p>
<p>13. While this report considers these matters from the perspectives of the authors&#8217; mandates, 
strict space and other constraints preclude an exhaustive analysis of all of the relevant issues.  
These include, for example, questions relating to the <i>jus ad bellum, </i>the killing of four 
United Nations military observers by IDF,<b>7</b> humanitarian corridors, post-ceasefire incursions by 
Israel into Lebanon and the relationship between Hezbollah, Lebanon and other States.  Each of 
these, and a range of other issues, pose important questions which go beyond the scope of the 
present report.  While comparisons of the respective impacts of the conflict on the two sides are 
often made, the purpose of this report is to provide detailed legal and factual information and 
analysis as to the human rights consequences of the conflict.  It is for the Council and others to 
whom the report is directed to draw appropriate conclusions from the data and the analysis 
provided. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>14. Both Israel and Lebanon are parties to the major human rights treaties relevant to the 
current situation.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>15. Human rights law does not cease to apply in times of war, except in accordance with 
precise derogation provisions relating to times of emergency.<b>9</b> More specifically, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and other international human 
rights instruments allow for the possibility, in circumstances that threaten the life of the nation, 
to derogate from certain of its guarantees provided that the measures are strictly necessary and 
are lifted as soon as the public emergency or armed conflict ceases to exist.<b>10</b>  Certain 
guarantees, in particular the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
the right to life, are non-derogable<b>11</b> Lebanon has not declared an emergency in accordance with 
ICCPR article 4, but it did proclaim a national state of emergency on 12 July 2006.  Israel 
remains in a state of public emergency proclaimed on 19 May 1948, four days after its 
Declaration of Establishment.<b>12</b>  Upon ratifying the Covenant, it made a declaration regarding the 
existence of this state of emergency and noted a reservation to article 9 (liberty and security of 
person).<b>13</b>  As regards economic, social and cultural rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) does not explicitly allow for derogations in 
time of public emergency, but the guarantees of the Covenant may, in times of armed conflict, be 
limited in accordance with its articles 4 and 5 and because of the possible scarcity of available 
resources in the sense of article 2, paragraph 1.<b>14</b>   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. Human rights law and international humanitarian law are not mutually exclusive but exist 
in a complementary relationship during armed conflict, and a full legal analysis requires 
consideration of both bodies of law.<b>15</b> In respect of certain human rights, more specific rules of 
international humanitarian law may be relevant for the purposes of their interpretation.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>17. The international human rights regime, consisting of the full range of economic, social 
and cultural rights (such as those pertaining to the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health and adequate housing), as well as civil and political rights, thus applies to the 
analysis of this conflict.  
</p>
<p>18. As regards the territorial scope of application, ICCPR article 2 obliges each State party 
&#8220;to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction&#8221; the 
rights recognized within it.  The International Court of Justice concluded that ICCPR &#8220;is 
applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own 
territory&#8221;.<b>17</b>  ICESCR and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (CEDAW) contain no provision limiting their application to the territory of 
States parties.  Articles 2 (1) and 16 (1) of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) refer to each State party&#8217;s obligation to 
prevent acts of torture &#8220;in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8221;.   
19. Although Hezbollah<i>, </i>a non-State actor, cannot become a party to these human rights 
treaties, it remains subject to the demand of the international community, first expressed in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that every organ of society respect and promote human 
rights.  The Security Council has long called upon various groups which Member States do not 
recognize as having the capacity to do so to formally assume international obligations to respect 
human rights.<b>18</b>  It is especially appropriate and feasible to call for an armed group to respect 
human rights norms when it &#8220;exercises significant control over territory and population and has 
an identifiable political structure&#8221;.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>20. This report focuses not only on violations of the right to life and related civil and political 
rights, but also specifically on the rights to health and housing<b>20</b> and the plight of IDPs. 
</p>
<p>21. As citizens of their respective countries, IDPs are entitled to enjoy the protection of all 
guarantees of international human rights and humanitarian law subscribed to by the State 
concerned or applicable on the basis of customary international law.  At the same time, they have 
specific needs distinct from those of the non-displaced population which must be addressed by 
specific protection and assistance measures.  These rights are reflected and detailed in the 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.<b>21</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>22. Both Israel and Lebanon are parties to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.  
Lebanon is a party to Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions.  All of the parties 
to the conflict are also subject to customary international humanitarian law.<b>22</b>  
23. The mission was informed by representatives of IDF that decisions were taken on the 
basis of the law on international armed conflicts, in particular the Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 (Fourth Geneva </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Convention), and those provisions of the Additional Protocol I that are declaratory of customary 
international law.  While the qualification of the conflict as international or non-international is 
complex, this report is mainly based on international customary law applicable in both forms of 
conflict.   
</p>
<p>24. Of the rules applicable to attackers, the most relevant relate to the principle of distinction, 
the principle of proportionality, and the obligation to take precautionary measures.  These 
obligations are cumulative:  an attack must comply with all of the rules in order to be lawful.    
</p>
<p>25. First, under the principle of distinction, the parties to a conflict must at all times 
distinguish between civilians and combatants,<b>23</b> and attacks may be directed only at military 
objectives, defined as those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an 
effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or 
neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.<b>24</b>  The 
only circumstance in which civilians may be targeted is for such time as they take a direct part in 
hostilities.<b>25</b> Thus, attacks on civilian objects<b>26</b> are unlawful unless at the time of the attack they 
were used for military purposes and their destruction offered a definite military advantage. 
</p>
<p>26. Indiscriminate attacks are similarly prohibited.<b>27</b>  They are those which (i) are not 
directed at a specific military objective; (ii) employ a method or means of combat which cannot 
be directed at a specific military objective; or (iii) employ a method or means of combat the 
effects of which cannot be limited as required by international humanitarian law; and 
consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or 
civilian objects without distinction.<b>28</b> Attacks by bombardment, including with rockets, which 
treat as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives 
located in an urban area or rural village are prohibited.<b>29</b> The prohibition of indiscriminate 
attacks must not only determine the strategy adopted for a particular military operation but also 
limit the use of certain weapons in situations where the civilian population will be affected. 
</p>
<p>27. Second, under the principle of proportionality, attacks on legitimate military objectives 
which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to 
civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage anticipated, are prohibited.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Third, an attacker must take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to 
minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.<b>31</b>  A 
number of specific precautionary measures are prescribed by humanitarian law in relation to the 
planning and conduct of attacks.<b>32</b>  In addition, an attacker is required to give effective advance 
warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not 
permit.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>29. International humanitarian law also imposes obligations on defenders.  The use of human 
shields is prohibited.<b>34</b>  Violation of this rule may be understood to require the defender&#8217;s 
specific intent to use civilians to immunize otherwise legitimate military objectives from lawful 
attack.<b>35</b>  In addition to this prohibition, the defender also has affirmative obligations to protect 
civilians by keeping them away from military targets.<b>36</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. A violation of the obligation to take precautionary measures vis-&#224;-vis the civilian 
population or their use as human shields by one side to a conflict does not change the obligations 
incumbent on the other party to the conflict to weigh what constitutes an excessive attack in 
relation to concrete and direct military advantage.  
</p>
<p>31. Because of time, informational and other constraints, the mission was not in a position to 
evaluate the responsibility of individuals for crimes under national or international law.  
However, serious violations mentioned above and other principles of international humanitarian 
law by individuals constitute war crimes.  States must investigate war crimes allegedly 
committed by their nationals or armed forces, or on their territory, and, if appropriate, prosecute 
the suspects.<b>37</b>  They must also investigate other war crimes over which they have jurisdiction 
and, if appropriate, prosecute the suspects.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> <b>THE PROTECTION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION  
DURING THE CONFLICT39 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Lebanon 
</b></p>
<p>32. During &#8220;Operation Change of Direction&#8221; from 13 July to 14 August 2006, IDF undertook 
two parallel efforts, an &#8220;air war&#8221; involving attacks on Hezbollah fixed and mobile targets and 
Lebanese infrastructure and private homes, and a &#8220;ground war&#8221; involving the invasion of 
Lebanon and direct engagements with Hezbollah fighters.  
</p>
<p>33. In the conduct of the air war - which had a greater impact on the civilian population 
compared to the limited ground invasion - Israel used air, naval and army forces.  The Israeli 
Air Force flew some 15,500 sorties over Lebanon, attacking more than 7,000 &#8220;targets&#8221;.<b>40</b>  The 
Israeli Navy conducted over 2,500 bombardments of targets within range of the Lebanese coast.  
The Israeli Army fired tens of thousands of artillery shells and multiple launch rockets.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>34. In the conduct of the hostilities, Israel is accused of having violated the principle of 
distinction between military and civilian targets, the principle of proportionality, and the 
prohibition of indiscriminate attacks.  Hezbollah is accused of having used the civilian 
population of Beirut&#8217;s southern and eastern suburbs (<i>Dahiye</i>) and of towns and villages in 
southern Lebanon as &#8220;human shields&#8221;.  These alleged violations need to be discussed because of 
their impact on human life, housing, health and internal displacement covered by the mandates 
of the four independent experts. 
</p>
<p><b>1.</b> <b> Precautionary measures and principled limits  
to the conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>35. Both for principled and pragmatic reasons, Israel set certain limits on the conduct of its 
hostilities with Hezbollah.<b>42</b> The mission was informed by IDF representatives that Israel 
followed its practice of drawing up lists of potential targets, with each individual target, as well 
as the type of weapon to be used, being reviewed by an IDF expert in humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>36. Israel made extensive use of leaflets dropped from the air and of telephone calls to warn 
civilians of impending attacks, an obligation which applies unless circumstances do not permit.<b>43</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>While the mission found some aspects of the warnings to be highly problematic (see para. 66 
below), they certainly saved many lives, both in south Beirut and south of the Litani river. 
</p>
<p>37. But despite Israel&#8217;s stated goal of conducting hostilities within the parameters set by 
international humanitarian law,<b>44</b> the actual practice fell short in various respects, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A refusal to consistently distinguish Hezbollah fighters from civilians, including 
civilian members of Hezbollah (see paras. 38-48 below); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An approach to vetting targets that appears to have treated entire categories of 
dual-use objects as legitimate military objectives (see paras. 49-51 below); and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The reckless, perhaps even deliberately reckless, use of cluster munitions (see 
paras. 52-57 below).  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Attacks on Hezbollah and the principle of distinction 
</b></p>
<p>38. One well-informed analysis of Israel&#8217;s targeting policies concluded that they were 
premised upon the permissibility of targeting the whole of Hezbollah&#8217;s infrastructure: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Targets belonging to the Hezbollah infrastructure which support the terrorist-operative 
apparatus in the Shi&#8217;ite neighborhoods of south Beirut (e.g., Dahiya) and other locations 
in Lebanon [are]:  headquarters, offices, buildings serving Hezbollah&#8217;s various branches, 
leaders&#8217; residences and the bunkers they are hiding in, as well as the organization&#8217;s 
&#8216;information&#8217; infrastructure (Al-Manar TV) and offices of the organization&#8217;s social and 
financial infrastructure.&#8221;<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Such an enumeration of permissible targets is inconsistent with the principle of 
distinction. 
</p>
<p>40. While Hezbollah was in conflict with Israel, it does not follow that every member of 
Hezbollah could be justifiably targeted.  Individuals do not become legitimate military objectives 
unless they are combatants or civilians directly participating in hostilities.  Many members and 
supporters of Hezbollah do not meet either criterion.  Similarly, not every building owned by or 
associated with Hezbollah  constituted a legitimate military objective.  Hezbollah is, in addition 
to being an organization using violence, a political movement and social services enterprise, 
particularly in the <i>Dahiye </i>and the areas of southern Lebanon with a Shiite majority population.  
It runs medical facilities, schools, groceries, an orphanage, a garbage service and a 
reconstruction programme for homes damaged during Israel&#8217;s invasion.  It is the country's 
second-largest employer,<b>46</b> holds 14 seats in parliament and, since 2005, is part of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>41. Various Israeli targeting decisions operationalized this failure to distinguish military from 
civilian objectives.  For example, some of the warnings stated that, &#8220;[a]ny vehicle of any kind 
travelling south of the Litani River will be bombarded, on suspicion of transporting rockets, 
military equipment and terrorists&#8221;.<b>47</b>  Israel&#8217;s responsibility to distinguish between combatants 
and civilians is in no way discharged by warning civilians that they will be targeted.  Warnings 
are required for the benefit of civilians, but civilians are not obligated to comply with them.  A </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>decision to stay put &#8212; freely taken or due to limited options &#8212; in no way diminishes a civilian&#8217;s 
legal protections.  It is categorically and absolutely prohibited to target civilians not taking a 
direct part in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>42. As regards the destruction of high-rise buildings in the south-eastern suburbs 
(<i>Dahiye</i>) of Beirut, Israeli bombing destroyed about 150 apartment buildings and damaged 
approximately the same number.  Because the buildings, which would normally have 
housed between 30,000 and 60,000 persons,<b>48</b> had been nearly entirely evacuated before 
they were struck, the loss of life was limited.  Because the mission was not able to obtain 
from the Lebanese authorities disaggregated data about the geographical distribution within 
Lebanon of the overall 1,191 deaths, a more precise statement is not possible at this stage.  
It also remains, moreover, unclear how many of those killed were Hezbollah fighters.<b>49</b>  
</p>
<p>43. The IDF position is that each building targeted constituted a specific military target 
according to the definition of Hezbollah  infrastructure outlined above, the most important 
being the Hezbollah  headquarters and the bunkers with alleged long-range rocket launch 
sites.  They argue that the fact that individual buildings remain standing next to others 
completely destroyed shows that IDF targeting was appropriately selective.  The mission&#8217;s 
requests for specific information as to the military objective pursued with the destruction of 
each building and the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated at the time of 
attack, however, remained unanswered on the grounds that such information must remain 
classified.  This response is inadequate, however, in light of the evidence available.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>44. In South Lebanon,<b>51</b> thousands of buildings were destroyed and many others damaged by 
IDF attacks.<b>52</b> The mission did not obtain any precise data as to the overall number of persons 
killed in South Lebanon during the conflict although it is clear that a great many civilians were 
killed.  As to the number of Hezbollah fighters among the dead, figures contained in Hezbollah 
statements vary widely from those provided by the Government of Israel.<b> 53</b>   
</p>
<p>45. The mission drove through a stretch of South Lebanon from Tyre to Ayta ash-Shab 
through Qana and Bint Jbeil and its members witnessed the destruction of hundreds of houses, 
some of which had been bulldozed. 
</p>
<p>46. According to Israel, buildings were targeted in the &#8220;air war&#8221; primarily on the basis that 
they served as launching or storage sites for rockets or other materiel, and secondarily on the 
basis that they hosted Hezbollah fighters.  Video footage provided by Israel shows instances of 
rockets being fired from residential buildings and thus confirms instances of Hezbollah abusing 
civilian objects in its military operations.  But this cannot be dispositive justification for the 
destruction of hundreds of civilian houses in South Lebanon, nor other distant houses or 
infrastructure.  In order to show that the attacks did not violate the principles of distinction and 
proportionality and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks Israel would need to provide 
substantially more and qualitatively different information relating to questions such as the kind 
of information on the basis of which specific houses and villages were targeted, the time lapse 
between the firing of a rocket from a house or village and the IDF attack in response, and the 
estimate by IDF of civilian presence in and around the target at the time of the strike.  In the 
absence of such information the mission cannot conclude that the widespread targeting of 
civilian houses by IDF complied with international humanitarian law.  In the absence of  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>systematic evidence of any type, however, it is impossible to confirm the validity of the claim 
that every target was a legitimate military objective or that the principle of distinction was 
respected.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The same conclusion must be drawn regarding the reports of 12 destroyed 
and 38 severely damaged health facilities, notably in Bent Jbeil, Marjayoun and Nabatieh.<b>55</b> 
Ambulances and medical convoys were, according to ICRC, also hit during the conflict.<b>56</b> In the 
absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that the health facilities and 
ambulances attacked were not legitimate targets.  In this context it is important to stress that 
killing persons placed <i>hors de combat</i> is prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever.<b>57</b>   
</p>
<p>48. There are well-documented reports of IDF strikes on civilian convoys fleeing villages in 
the South as a result of IDF warnings, including that which killed 21 civilians fleeing 
Marwahin.<b>58</b> Israel has generally not disputed that these strikes occurred or that deaths resulted, 
but it has argued that if civilian convoys were attacked it was justified by Hezbollah&#8217;s abuse of 
civilian convoys to move around fighters and materiel.  The mission could not carry out any 
significant fact-finding to assess whether Hezbollah did in fact misuse the Marwahin or other 
convoys in this way.  But it is important to note that the answer to this question would not by 
itself resolve the matter.  To do so Israel would need to detail how many fighters were estimated 
to be among the civilians, the kind of materiel they were transporting, what precautions were 
taken to limit the impact of the strike on the civilians in the convoy, the concrete and direct 
military advantages anticipated at the time of attack and how did they outweighed the 
expected civilian casualties, and whether full consideration was given to other options designed 
to obtain the desired military effect. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Attacks on dual-use objects 
</b>49. The conflict was characterized, inter alia, by large-scale aerial attacks on parts of the 
Lebanese infrastructure, in particular roads and bridges.<b>59</b> The mission notes that such attacks on 
the transportation infrastructure had a particularly debilitating effect on the safe transportation of 
IDPs, the provision of humanitarian assistance and access to medical care, and thus raises 
questions from a human rights perspective.  Israel justifies these attacks with reference to the 
military use of these objects, turning them into so-called dual-use objects that can be legitimately 
attacked. 
</p>
<p>50. In characterizing objects, in particular objects that serve primarily civilian purposes, as 
legitimate military objectives (see para. 38 above), Israel relies heavily on the &#8220;list of categories 
of military objectives&#8221; included in the ICRC Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers 
Incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956).  The list is relevant, but it cannot be 
seen as the end point of an analysis.  The current legal rule, adopted in Additional Protocol I and 
recognized as customary, not only requires that the targeted objects, due to &#8220;their nature, 
location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action&#8221;,  but also demands 
that their &#8220;partial or total destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the 
time, [offer] a definite military advantage&#8221;.<b> 60</b>  The law in force thus imposes a test that requires 
an object-specific and context-specific assessment of each target rather than a test based on an 
object&#8217;s generic classification. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. The distinction between a categorical and a context-specific approach is crucial to 
evaluating Israel&#8217;s targeting practice during this conflict.  For example, a road connecting 
southern Lebanon to the rest of the country could be considered to contribute to Hezbollah&#8217;s 
military action and a bridge along such a road may thus be a legitimate military objective.<b>61</b>  But 
no such justification is plausible for most other areas, including targets in areas inhabited by 
populations with no links to Hezbollah.  The mission notes that such attacks on the transportation 
infrastructure have a particularly debilitating effect on the safe transportation of IDPs, the 
provision of humanitarian assistance and access to medical care. 
</p>
<p><b>4.</b> <b> The use of cluster bombs in southern Lebanon 
</b></p>
<p>52. The principal concern of many of the mission&#8217;s interlocutors in Lebanon was the massive 
use by IDF of cluster munitions and the ongoing impact of unexploded sub-munitions (bomblets) 
on the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>53. The United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre (UNMACC) in Tyre had, as 
of 23 September 2006, recorded and confirmed 590 individual cluster bomb strike locations,<b>62</b> 
mainly in built-up<b>63</b> and agricultural areas, and UNMACC was continuing to discover additional 
strike locations.  These unexploded bomblets are small, often difficult to spot and highly volatile.  
Between the end of the armed conflict and 26 September 2006, unexploded cluster bomb 
sub-munitions killed 14 and injured 90. 
54. The available information is not sufficient to estimate the total number of bomblets with 
confidence or precision.  The total number of bomblets - exploded and unexploded - could 
conceivably be as low as 158,000 or as high as 1,170,000.  However, on the basis of the 
information available about the type of cluster munitions used by IDF, about the overall quantity 
of such weapons expended and the strike sites and bomblets found and destroyed, the mission 
finds the most likely estimate to be that between 850,000 and 1 million bomblets were expended.  
Depending on the failure (dud) rate, which appears to have been particularly high in this 
campaign, it is likely that between 170,000 and 340,000 unexploded bomblets were left in 
southern Lebanon.  Some 15,000 bomblets had been found and eliminated at the time of the visit. 
</p>
<p>55. The justification given by the Government of Israel for the use of cluster bombs is that 
they were the most effective weapon against Hezbollah rocket launch sites.  This argument is, in 
the abstract, compatible with a military rationale for the use of anti-personnel cluster bombs, as 
the radius of damage extends to the size of a football field and thus is able to neutralize mobile 
rocket launchers.  The IDF interlocutors of the mission did not provide any information that 
would confirm that these weapons were in practice used in a manner consistent with this military 
rationale. 
</p>
<p>56. Regardless of whether the military rationale was sound, the use of cluster munitions was 
inconsistent with principles of distinction and proportionality.  Israel could not reasonably have 
been ignorant of the fact that the sub-munitions dispersed by cluster munitions have a high 
failure (dud) rate.  In effect, then, the decision was taken to blanket an area occupied by large 
numbers of civilians with small and volatile explosives.  The impact of these bomblets would 
obviously be indiscriminate and the incidental effects on civilians would almost certainly be 
disproportionate.  Nothing the mission heard from IDF suggests that their long-term effects on 
the civilian population was considered problematic before the decision to use cluster munitions </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>was made.  The mere fact that cluster munitions are not a banned weapon should not have led 
Israel to overlook other requirements of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>57. Moreover, one government official acknowledged that cluster bombs were used in part to 
prevent Hezbollah fighters from returning to the villages after the ceasefire.  As these sites were 
often located in civilian built-up or agricultural areas, the long-term effect on the civilian 
population should have been obvious.<b>64</b>  This rationale would be consistent with reports from 
UNMACC and other sources that the majority of the cluster munitions were delivered in the final 
72 hours of the conflict, when a ceasefire was imminent.  While some Government of Israel 
interlocutors denied the allegation, others spoke of a gradual crescendo in the use of cluster 
bombs during the last 10 days of the conflict.  
</p>
<p><b>5.  Use by Hezbollah of civilian sites for military activities 
</b></p>
<p>58. It is clear that Hezbollah made at least some use of houses and other civilian sites to hide 
or conceal military activities.  Although systematic evidence was not presented to the mission in 
this regard, the Government of Israel has provided it with video material unmistakably showing 
rockets being launched from civilian residential buildings in South Lebanon.  This conduct was a 
violation of international humanitarian law obligations.  The question of whether Hezbollah used 
human shields is more complicated, and the mission did not receive clear evidence on that issue.  
Under international law, the term &#8220;human shield&#8221; is appropriate when there is &#8220;an intentional 
collocation of military objectives and civilians or persons <i>hors de combat</i> with the specific intent 
of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives&#8221;.<b>65</b> This relatively precise definition 
of the term should be maintained, especially in light of the distinction between war crimes and 
other violations of humanitarian law.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p><b>6.</b> <b> Impact on the civilian population 
</b></p>
<p>59. During the 34 days of the conflict, the population in the affected areas suffered violations 
of a broad range of their human rights.  Many lost their lives, homes and livelihoods.  While 
many civilians were physically injured, many more suffered intense distress, in some cases 
amounting to post-traumatic stress disorder.  By hitting hardest the most disadvantaged members 
of society, including the elderly, children, households headed by women and those living in 
poverty, the conflict deepened pre-existing inequalities.    
</p>
<p>60. The destruction of homes in villages of the south of the country is said to have been the 
main cause of civilian deaths during the conflict.  According to UNIFIL, on 15 August 2006, in 
Tayyabah, 80 per cent of the civilian houses were destroyed, 50 per cent in the villages of 
Markaba and Qantarah, and 30 per cent in Mays al Jabal.<b>67</b>In the <i>Dahiya</i>, some 150 apartment 
buildings were destroyed and approximately the same number damaged.  Between 
30,000 and 60,000 persons are left without homes.<b>68</b> The death of at least 28 civilians due to the 
collapse of a three-storey residential building hit by Israeli missiles in Qana on 30 July 2006,<b>69</b> 
underscores the relevance of destruction of buildings as a cause of death of civilians.  A 
significant number of deaths were also reported in areas outside Beirut and the south of Lebanon 
such as in the Bekaa Valley.<b>70</b> 
</p>
<p>61. The demolition of homes in violation of international humanitarian law (see para. 46 
above) and subsequent displacement<b>71</b> amounts to forcible eviction and calls into question </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>numerous international human rights requirements.  As stated by the Commission on Human 
Rights in its resolution 1993/77, forced evictions constitute &#8220;gross violations of human rights, in 
particular the right to adequate housing&#8221;.<b>72</b>  
</p>
<p>62. The destruction of thousands of homes forced many displaced families to live in 
situations marked by high density, lack of access to water, sanitation, electricity, health care and 
generally insecure housing and living conditions.<b>73</b>  Others were forced to live in the open in 
places such as the Samaya Garden.  This impacted on the well-being of individuals and families 
and contributed to mental health problems, especially among women and children. 
</p>
<p>63. One of the requirements of the right to the highest attainable standard of health is that 
health care be accessible to all, including children, the elderly, women, people with disabilities, 
and other especially vulnerable individuals and groups.<b>74</b>  During the conflict, the remaining 
inhabitants of a number of villages in South Lebanon became extremely isolated, seriously 
jeopardizing their access to elementary health care.  While many inhabitants fled, most of those 
remaining were elderly or people with disabilities.<b>75</b>  Their acute vulnerability was compounded 
by the security situation, which made it dangerous for anyone to travel.<b>76</b>  The destruction of 
roads and bridges made it very difficult for the villages to be reached by emergency medical and 
other services.  If pre-packaged emergency medical kits reached the isolated communities, the 
contents of the kits did not always cater for the distinctive chronic health problems of the elderly 
(e.g. hypertension and diabetes), although agencies tried to supplement the kits as necessary.  
Inhabitants who were able to leave their villages to seek medical care often found the local 
health clinics destroyed, damaged or closed (see para. 47 above).  During hostilities, access to 
mental health care became a major issue:  in the last week of the conflict, M&#233;decins sans 
Fronti&#232;res reported that 20-30 per cent of all its consultations related to mental health 
problems.<b>77</b>  These isolated communities of especially vulnerable people also suffered from a 
lack of other elements of the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including access to 
water (see para. 89 below).  Although the problem of access to basic health care was especially 
grave in relation to these isolated rural communities, the problem extended beyond these 
villages.  
</p>
<p>64. The same communities also suffered from severe problems relating to denials of the right 
to adequate housing, such as access to potable water, sanitation and electricity. 
</p>
<p>65. The military operations caused large-scale displacement.  According to official 
government figures, 974,184 persons were displaced by the conflict, an estimated 128,760 of 
whom were accommodated in schools and other public buildings.  An estimated 220,000 fled to 
the Syrian Arab Republic and other countries while the rest remained in Lebanon.  A total 
of 128,760 IDPs were accommodated in schools or with families or friends<b>78</b> and 200,000 remain 
displaced because Israeli military operations damaged or destroyed their homes.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p>66. While some IDPs left on their own initiative, others were warned by IDF which dropped 
leaflets from planes or made individual telephone calls (see para. 41 above).<b>80</b>  International 
human rights law prohibits arbitrary displacement - a notion which includes displacement in 
situations of armed conflict - which is not warranted by the need to ensure the security of the 
civilians involved or imperative military reasons.<b>81</b> The principle of precaution requires each 
party to the conflict to give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>population, and give it enough time and the opportunity to evacuate safely, unless circumstances 
do not permit.<b>82</b> Reported cases of civilians attacked while fleeing cast doubt as to whether these 
obligations were always met. <b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>67. As regards protection and assistance for the displaced persons, one has to note that, while 
Lebanon has experienced displacement before, it was caught unprepared by the magnitude of the 
recent displacement.  The intensity of the conflict affecting large parts of the country, the degree 
of destruction of civilian infrastructure and the far-reaching limitations on humanitarian access 
exacerbated the crisis.  Despite an unprecedented degree of support and solidarity by 
non-governmental organizations and civil society and the population at large, many IDPs were in 
desperate need of assistance, especially the elderly, ill and poor, often consisting of large 
families with small children.  While maternal mortality and morbidity rates did not deteriorate 
among the IDPs, the mission was informed that maternal health and the health of newborns were 
compromised.<b>84</b> The Lebanese authorities, other Lebanese actors and the international 
community managed to avoid a large-scale humanitarian crisis among the IDPs despite very 
difficult circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> <b>The conduct of hostilities by Hezbollah  
</b></p>
<p>68. The public statements of the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, 
explicitly reject the requirements of international humanitarian law, and Hezbollah&#8217;s conduct 
appears to reflect this lawless approach to the conduct of armed conflict.  While many of his 
statements do recognize that there are valid distinctions between civilians and combatants and 
between civilian and military objects,<b>85</b> they argue that Hezbollah has a right, and even a duty to 
disregard these distinctions in the pursuit of victory. 
</p>
<p>69. First, these statements reject the absolute character of the principle of distinction.<b>86</b>  
Second, these statements argue that Hezbollah  has a right to violate humanitarian law in so far 
as Israel does so:   when &#8220;the Zionists&#8221; in their conduct abandoned all rules, red lines and limits 
of engagement, it became Hezbollah&#8217;s right to respond in like fashion.  This analysis leads to 
the conclusion that so long as Hezbollah&#8217;s violations of the law are &#8220;reactions&#8221; to Israeli 
excesses - whether violations of the law or of otherwise defined limits of engagement - they are 
justified.<b>87</b> 
70. The notion that one party&#8217;s violation of humanitarian law may justify the other party&#8217;s 
violation is called reprisal.  Leaving aside the question of requirements for a reprisal to be 
legitimate, reprisals against civilians are absolutely prohibited.<b>88</b> 
</p>
<p>71. Hezbollah&#8217;s actual conduct was consistent with Mr. Nasrallah&#8217;s public statements.  Of 
the 4,000-4,500 rockets fired, about 900 hit built-up areas, i.e. villages, towns, and cities; the 
remainder landed in &#8220;open areas&#8221;, according to Israeli sources.<b>89</b>  The vast majority of rockets 
(more than 50 per cent) landed in three areas:  Kiryat Shmona, Nahariya and Tzfat (Safed).  
Other hard-hit towns include Karmiel, Akko (Acre), Haifa, and Tiberias.  Although IDF 
provided no evidence that military installations had been hit, the number of Israeli soldiers killed 
and wounded would seem to indicate that a significant number of Hezbollah attacks did hit 
military targets. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>72. The vast majority of rockets fired by Hezbollah were 122-mm &#8220;Katyushas&#8221;, some of 
them with a larger warhead and modified to increase the range up to 50 km.  But a variety of 
other weapons were also used, including 220-mm mobile rockets modified to carry thousands of 
small ball bearings, which spray out over a radius of up to 300 m when the rocket strikes and 
thus maximize harm to persons.<b>90</b> 
</p>
<p>73. The Katyushas and 220-mm mobile rockets have an accuracy of 300-400 m when used at 
maximum range.  As a consequence, when they hit civilian targets such as hospitals or villages 
which are more than 1 km away from a military target, it is reasonable to assume that they have 
either targeted the object in question or that their use is indiscriminate. 
</p><p>74. Thus, for example, some 20 rocket strikes reportedly hit the immediate vicinity of the 
Nahariya Hospital (located 6 km from the Lebanese border).  They included one direct hit on 
28 July which caused major damage to an ophthalmology ward.  In the absence of a plausible 
military target within 1 km of the hospital, this would seem to suggest illegal targeting of a 
civilian building. 
</p>
<p>75. Overall, there emerges a clear picture of Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and 
civilian buildings and infrastructure in violation of the applicable norms of international 
humanitarian law, and in many instances of the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks and of the 
principle of distinction. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Impact on the civilian population 
</b></p>
<p>76. It is estimated that 300,000 individuals fled or were evacuated from the dangers of 
Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel,<b>91</b> a region with a population of more than 
2 million.<b>92</b> They found refuge in safe parts of the country, renting private accommodation in 
hotels and guesthouses, staying with family and friends, or provided with shelter by private 
individuals or non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>77. Those who did not leave had to seek refuge in air-raid shelters under ground.  In Israel, 
these shelters, which can be private or public, constitute an essential part of the civilian 
population protection system.  In Kiryat Shmona, for instance, 5,000-10,000 residents who 
remained in the city lived in shelters.  The living conditions in these shelters were said to be 
appalling, with people suffering from overcrowding, very high temperatures and lack of hygiene 
and fresh air.<b>93</b>  In some parts of the north, children and adults remained in the shelters almost 
24 hours a day for approximately one month.  Magen David Adom personnel treated and 
evacuated over 2,500 casualties, including 1,500 suffering from &#8220;anxiety attacks&#8221;.<b>94</b>  In 
particular, women and children were reported to have suffered from acute stress arising from the 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>78. A large number of houses were destroyed.  According to official figures, Hezbollah 
attacks damaged up to 12,000 buildings, including some 400 public buildings.  In Kiryat 
Shmona, about 2,000 apartments were estimated to have been damaged.<b>95</b>  The conflict also had 
important consequences on the business sector and a correlative impact on the livelihoods of 
large parts of the population of northern Israel.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>79. Many interlocutors felt that despite the good efforts by competent authorities - 
particularly the Home Front Command and the local authorities - the overall humanitarian 
response was often inadequate to respond to the needs of IDPs and those remaining in northern 
Israel.  Reportedly, many persons remained in northern Israel involuntarily, in particular because 
they lacked the financial means to leave, or because they were too old, infirm or sick.<b>96</b>  Because 
no domestic &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; - provided for by law to trigger additional humanitarian 
assistance - was declared, local authorities were not provided with the necessary means to 
respond to all needs.  Many of the displaced did not receive sufficient assistance from the 
authorities.  To a large extent, humanitarian assistance was provided by civil society 
organizations and private individuals.  While medical services for both IDPs and those in shelters 
came from a variety of sources, there were reports that the services were uneven, varying from 
one locality and provider to another.<b>97</b> During the conflict, hospitals were damaged in Nahariya, 
Haifa, Tzfat and Mizra.<b>98</b> One of them - a psychiatric hospital - had to be evacuated.<b>99</b> 
Additionally, some 300 mental health patients living in the community had to be removed from 
the north to hostels in central Israel.<b>100</b> 
</p>
<p>80. The situation of the Arab communities, 60 per cent of which live in the Northern District 
and Haifa, raises particular concern.  Some individuals, including local authorities, have 
complained about alleged negligence towards Israeli-Arab communities.  According to a survey 
carried out in Israel, only 41 per cent of the Arab Councils have emergency alarm systems and 
only 46 per cent have shelters - all in schools.<b>101</b> It was reported that emergency instructions for 
residents were provided in Hebrew and, exceptionally, in Russian.  Moreover, on several 
occasions Arab Israelis stated that before, during and after the conflict, their communities did not 
have the same access to health services, including for mental health, as Jewish Israelis.<b>102</b>  It was 
also noted that since many Arab Israelis are among the poorer population in Israel, it was 
difficult for many to flee the area.<b>103</b> All interlocutors who referred to the specific difficulties 
faced by Arab Israelis during the conflict insisted on the need to analyse this situation in light of 
the historic discrimination suffered by these communities in Israel.<b>104</b>  
</p>
<p>81. It was also alleged that the Israeli Army had installed rocket launching bases near towns 
and villages in the north, in some cases only a few metres away, such as in the towns of Fassuta, 
Tarsheeha and 'Arab al-'Aramshe.<b>105</b>  In the town visited by the mission, Majd-al-Krum residents 
testified that Israeli artillery was located near the town during the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>V.</b>  <b>THE PROTECTION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b> <b>Lebanon 
</b></p>
<p>82. Lebanese Government figures seem to indicate that 200,000 of the original 974,184 IDPs 
still had not returned to their pre-conflict place of resident as of 24 September 2006.<b>106</b>  
</p>
<p>83. Internally displaced persons have a right to voluntary return in safety to their homes or 
places of habitual residence as soon as the reasons for their displacement cease to exist,<b>107</b> or, as 
citizens of the country they are living in, to remain or resettle in another part of the country.<b>108</b>  
Limitations on this right are not subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by 
law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (<i>ordre public</i>), public health or 
morals, or the rights and freedoms of others.<b>109</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>84. While each category of person faces specific problems, the main obstacles to the 
resumption of a life in safety and dignity are to a large extent shared by persons still displaced, 
returnees, and those who did not leave their homes in South Lebanon during the conflict.  In 
Lebanon, the major obstacles to resumption of normal life in the affected areas are the violations 
of the right to adequate housing and health, including the destruction of housing, lack of access 
to water, electricity and sanitation, and the dangers of unexploded ordnance. 
</p>
<p>85. Tens of thousands of persons were left homeless in the <i>Dahiye</i> and in South Lebanon as a 
result of the Israeli bombing.<b>110</b> The mission witnessed efforts to remove the rubble<b>111</b> and 
rebuild destroyed and damaged housing.  These efforts are led by Hezbollah, and in particular its 
construction arm Jihad al-Bina.<b>112</b> Reports indicate that, in addition to serving Shiite areas, 
Jihad al-Bina is also working in predominately Sunni areas, like the northern area of Akkar, 
where it recently repaired some 200 houses in 13 villages.<b>113</b> Hezbollah&#8217;s apparent efficiency 
constitutes a considerable challenge to the Government&#8217;s role and calls for more coordination in 
post-conflict work than is currently the case.<b>114</b>  
</p>
<p>86. The Government has been successful in raising funds for reconstruction.<b>115</b> It has also 
announced that it would pay US$ 33,000 to each family whose home had been destroyed,<b>116</b> but 
it yet has to make such payments and generally to prove its effectiveness in the reconstruction.  
In the end, the reconstruction process in Lebanon will probably involve a triangular 
configuration of private owners, Government and Jihad al-Bina,<b>117</b> which will require 
considerable coordination to avoid some victims falling through the cracks.  As winter with its 
cold rains approaches, time is of the essence. 
</p>
<p>87. The existence of highly volatile, unexploded cluster bomb sub-munitions constitutes a 
threat to clearing building rubble and, more generally, to the rights to life and health of the 
population, as evidenced by the 104 casualties they caused as of 23 September 2006, 14 of which 
were fatal.<b>118</b> Until the identification of cluster bomb strike locations and the clearance of the 
sites are completed, or at least significant progress made (a process which UNMACC estimates 
will take 12-15 months<b>119</b>), people will not be able to go back to their homes, children will not be 
able to go to school and returnees previously active in agriculture will be deprived of a 
livelihood.<b>120</b> 
</p>
<p>88. A further complication to the return and reconstruction process is the insecurity 
surrounding the legal status of a significant portion of the real estate involved.  In South Beirut 
and parts of southern Lebanon, many destroyed buildings reportedly had been constructed 
illegally and on land owned by the Lebanese State, religious endowments and individuals 
displaced during the 1975-1989 civil war.  There is therefore a real risk of property-related 
disputes delaying or impeding the reconstruction and return process. 
</p>
<p>89. Damage to medical facilities combined with shortages of fuel, power, water and supplies 
have had a major impact on service delivery throughout the districts affected by the conflict.<b>121</b> 
There is a serious gap, for example, in maternal and child care services.  Just one in four primary 
health care facilities are able to provide pre-natal care, and just one in 10 can support proper 
delivery and emergency obstetric care.  One third are able to store vaccines and just 13 per cent 
are able to provide some mental health services.  Normally, all of these facilities should be able 
to provide all of these services.<b>122</b> The situation remains particularly acute in those communities  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in the south that were badly damaged during the conflict (see para. 63 above).  The conflict is 
likely to have deepened pre-existing inequalities in the delivery of health care services in 
Lebanon.<b>123</b> 
</p>
<p>90. The right to the highest attainable standard of health not only encompasses health care, 
but also access to the underlying determinants of health, such as adequate water and 
sanitation.<b>124</b> Access to water, sanitation and electricity are also essential elements of the right to 
adequate housing.  In Lebanon, inadequate access to water, sanitation and electricity remain 
among the most serious problems arising from the recent conflict.  Local distribution networks 
(i.e. pipes) have been badly damaged and sewage and garbage collection systems have been 
interrupted, leading to an increased risk of waterborne diseases.<b>125</b>  Isolated enclaves in the south 
continue to have limited access to safe water, mainly because of the destruction of many private 
and community-owned water tanks,<b>126</b> the damage to the distribution system and the disrupted 
electricity supply.  The Stockholm Conference for Lebanon&#8217;s Early Recovery estimated the 
damage to the water sector at US$ 81 million, more than a quarter of which will be required for 
South Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>91. Although frequently neglected, mental health is an integral element of the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health.<b>127</b> The recent conflict poses a profound and continuing 
challenge to the mental and psychosocial well-being of many.<b>128</b> Women, children and the 
disabled suffer particular stress.  Often struggling to care for their families, women may be at 
increased risk of domestic violence.  Behavioural and emotional difficulties are a common and 
normal reaction to events such as the recent hostilities.  Some individuals are suffering from 
disabling post-traumatic stress disorder and in some cases this condition will continue for the rest 
of their lives.  
</p>
<p>92. The rights to health and adequate housing also encompass a safe and healthy 
environment.<b>129</b> The conflict damaged the environment in a number of ways, not least following 
the attack on the Jiyyeh power plant.<b>130</b> Some 30 km south of Beirut on the Mediterranean coast, 
Israeli bombs hit Jiyyeh on 13 and 15 July.  Storage tanks caught fire and burnt for some weeks.  
Also, 10,000-15,000 tons of heavy fuel spilled into the sea and spread northwards.  About 
150 km of coastline are affected.  The Stockholm Conference for Lebanon&#8217;s Early Recovery 
estimated the clean-up costs to be US$ 50 million.<b>131</b> It is premature to assess the long-term 
impact of the oil spill on, inter alia, human health.  While some local health professionals are 
reporting an increase in asthmatic and skin complaints that may be attributable to smoke and 
other pollution since the attacks in mid-July, at present these reports are unsupported by firm 
scientific evidence. 
</p>
<p><b>B.</b> <b> Israel 
</b></p>
<p>93. In Israel, the number of those who are unable to return to their homes because they have 
not yet been rebuilt or repaired is reported to be very low.  During their visit to the north, the 
members of the mission could see that the reconstruction was advancing quickly.  The Israeli 
Tax Authority, under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, administers a fund financed by 
a percentage of the property tax.<b>132</b>  The Director of the Tax Authority announced in an interim 
report on 23 September 2006 that the Authority had settled some 10,000 claims for direct 
damage and 25,000 claims for indirect damage suffered during July.  Overall, 60,000 claims had 
been filed.  The Tax Authority also announced that it would support 100 families whose homes </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>are no longer habitable due to extensive damage.  Of these, 400 people are still residing in 
hotels.<b>133</b>  The Government will also compensate those who suffered bodily injury as a result of 
the conflict, e.g. due to rocket shrapnel.  
</p>
<p>94. In the course of the visit, however, the mission heard persistent complaints that affected 
members of the Arab Israeli community were discriminated against and disadvantaged in the 
payment of compensation for their damages incurred during the war.  The perception among 
some of the mission&#8217;s interlocutors was that the Tax Authority&#8217;s assessors would systematically 
underestimate the property damage suffered by them.  Challenging the Authority&#8217;s assessment 
requires means which Arab Israelis often lack and delays the payment process, which many 
cannot afford.  Similarly, with regard to claims arising from injuries, the mission heard 
allegations of health officials unjustly denying claims on the basis that the injury was not proven 
to be related to the war.  Where an injury requires long-term treatment, including for mental 
health patients, the grave effects of such a determination on the access to health care of the 
victim and the financial situation of the family are obvious.  The mission could neither 
investigate individual cases of alleged unjust denial, nor of course the alleged systemic and thus 
discriminatory dimension of such denials. 
</p>
<p>95. In order to ensure better protection for the civilian population in the future there is a clear 
need for the authorities to build, repair and upgrade shelters throughout the country, in particular 
in towns and villages with Arab populations.  There is also a need to be better prepared to 
provide adequate humanitarian assistance in possible future armed conflicts, in particular to the 
poor, children, the sick and the elderly.  
</p>
<p>96. An official assessment of the environmental damage caused by the conflict in the north 
confirms, inter alia, that sewage plants were damaged and, in some cases, effluent had to be 
released into the sea and atmosphere (by burning).<b>134</b> The mission was also informed that 
unexploded ordnance remains a problem over a wide area.  
</p>
<p>97. While medical services have resumed their activities, there is a need to better prepare and 
equip hospitals for possible future attacks (e.g. fully equipped underground facilities).  As in 
Lebanon, the recent conflict poses a profound and continuing challenge to the mental and 
psychosocial well-being of the Israeli population, especially women and children and the elderly, 
giving rise to many cases of post-traumatic stress disorder.<b>135 </b>  Four weeks after hostilities ended, 
an Israeli mental health specialist reported that hospitals were receiving &#8220;late reactions&#8221; to the 
conflict.  He estimated that these amounted to &#8220;a few hundreds&#8221;, but he expected they would 
climb to &#8220;a few thousands&#8221;.  In both countries, health professionals emphasized the high level of 
stress disorders, observed that it is much too early to assess the full impact of the conflict on 
individuals&#8217; mental and psychosocial health, and urged that more resources be made available on 
an equitable basis for these extremely important issues.<b>136</b> 
</p>
<p><b>VI.</b> <b> CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In addition to human rights law, the principles of humanitarian law are entirely 
applicable to this conflict and deviations from these principles cannot be justified on the 
basis of the alleged novelty or distinctiveness of this conflict.</b> </p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>The mission concludes that serious violations of both human rights and 
humanitarian law have been committed by Israel.  Available information strongly indicates 
that, in many instances, Israel violated its legal obligations to distinguish between military 
and civilian objectives; to fully apply the principle of proportionality; and to take all 
feasible precautions to minimize injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.  
</b>100. <b>In many instances, Hezbollah violated the applicable principles of humanitarian 
law, in some cases by targeting the civilian population in northern Israel and in others by 
disregarding the principle of distinction. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Violations of international human rights and humanitarian law caused many deaths 
and injuries, displaced enormous numbers of persons, resulted in the large-scale 
destruction of homes and infrastructure including medical facilities, and severely 
interrupted health-related services.  The civilian population of southern Lebanon, both 
those who have now returned and those still unable to return, continue to suffer as a result 
of the large-scale destruction and the acute danger still posed by unexploded ordnance. </b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>Future rehabilitation, rebuilding and reconstruction activities must pay particular 
attention to the most vulnerable and marginalized groups within both countries.  They 
suffered disproportionately during the conflict and their needs and rights are still not 
adequately reflected in post-conflict plans. </b> 
</p>
<p>103.<b> The mission makes the following recommendations to the Government of Israel: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government should provide the full details of its use of cluster munitions 
in order to facilitate the destruction of the unexploded ordnance and to minimize civilian 
casualties.  Despite claims that the relevant &#8220;maps&#8221; have been provided to the Lebanese 
authorities, the evidence indicates that the information provided has been inadequate and 
largely unhelpful.  The Government should immediately provide comprehensive 
information, including the grid references of the targets, and should cooperate fully in the 
programme to eliminate the remaining unexploded bomblets; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The mission accepts that the Government has devoted considerable 
professional resources to vetting targets for compliance with international humanitarian 
law.  In the absence of systematic evidence of any type, however, it is impossible to accept 
the validity of the claim that every target was a legitimate military objective or that the 
principle of distinction was respected.  The mission calls upon the Government to provide, 
in relation to all attacks on prima facie civilian targets, a statement as to the alleged nature 
of the target and the anticipated collateral or incidental effects;137 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Government should take appropriate measures to investigate whether 
equal treatment of Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel, in particular regarding 
compensation for damaged or destroyed property, access to free medical services and the 
construction of new and the upgrading of existing shelters and alarm systems, is ensured; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) While Israel indicated that it had a policy not intentionally targeting water 
and power installations, such objects were nevertheless damaged by Israeli attacks.  Given 
the extremely damaging effects on the civilian population of such attacks, the mission urges 
the Government, as a matter of priority, to formalize its policy in this respect; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) A key gap in post-conflict reconstruction activities in the housing, health and 
other sectors is consultation with those affected.  Mechanisms should be devised to remedy 
this situation and ensure appropriate consultation and participation; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) The mission welcomes the establishment of the Governmental Investigative 
Committee to investigate the management of the campaign.  The mission recommends that 
the mandate of the Committee be interpreted to include the issue of whether violations of 
human rights and humanitarian law, as well as war crimes, were committed. 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The mission makes the following recommendations to the Government of Lebanon: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) In carrying out the reconstruction process, the Government should establish 
a Ministry of Housing with overall responsibility for housing-related issues, given the 
critical importance of the right to adequate housing to the Lebanese population in the 
post-conflict and recovery phases.  There is an urgent need to tackle the issues of safety due 
to the existence of a large number of damaged homes, the affordability and availability of 
housing, and speculation in land and property that is making it difficult for low-income 
families - the majority of the affected - to find a place to live;  
 (b) The Government should carefully reconsider its policy of providing large 
numbers of prefabricated housing units for those affected by the conflict.  International 
experience, including the extensive experience of UNHCR, has shown that relying solely on 
prefabricated housing can have deleterious effects on sustainable housing solutions for the 
affected; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) In an effort to remedy the shortcomings experienced so far, all key domestic 
and international actors involved in assessing needs and providing housing solutions to 
people and communities affected by the conflict should seek to coordinate their efforts 
more effectively.  A Ministry of Housing could play an important role in this regard; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The conflict highlighted serious flaws in Lebanon&#8217;s health system, such as the 
absence of an adequate health information system, as well as striking inequalities in access 
to a uniform package of health care.  Because these deficiencies impede the population&#8217;s 
ability to recover from the conflict, the Government is urged to work vigorously towards 
establishing an effective, integrated, responsive health system accessible to all, especially 
children, women, the elderly, people with disabilities and those living in poverty.  The 
immediate challenge is to meet the health needs of those who are displaced, as well as those 
who have lost their homes and livelihoods.  In the medium term, the priority is to 
re-establish and improve the medical, water, sanitation and electrical facilities in the areas 
most affected by the conflict; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) A key gap in post-conflict reconstruction activities in the housing, health and 
other sectors is consultation with those affected.  Mechanisms should be devised to remedy 
this situation and ensure appropriate consultation and participation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Government should develop, in cooperation with the international 
community, a comprehensive strategy to assist internally displaced persons and returnees 
taking into account the most vulnerable groups such as women heads of household and 
children or elderly people without family support.  Such a strategy should use a 
rights-based approach, in line with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, and 
urgently address the following protection challenges:  (i) access to basic services (in 
particular shelter, water, sanitation, education and health) for returnees and for the poor 
and vulnerable among those who continue in displacement; (ii) access to livelihoods, in 
particular in farming areas affected by UXO; (iii) protection in cases of domestic violence, 
which are likely to increase in situations of stress and cramped housing and living 
conditions; and (iv) access to courts and other conflict resolution mechanisms in the context 
of property disputes that might occur in South Beirut and parts of southern Lebanon.   
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The mission makes the following recommendations to Hezbollah: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Hezbollah should publicly affirm that it is bound by international 
humanitarian law and should renounce the targeting of civilians in all circumstances; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Hezbollah should train its fighters in the requirements of international 
humanitarian law, inform its fighters of the possibility of criminal prosecution for serious 
violations thereof, and take all other necessary measures to ensure future compliance. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The mission makes the following recommendations to the Human Rights Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Having addressed the conduct of Israel in its resolution S-2/1, the Council 
should also ensure that Hezbollah&#8217;s attacks are thoroughly investigated because of their 
serious consequences for the civilian population in northern Israel; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Hezbollah&#8217;s extensive use of Katyusha rockets loaded with lethal 
anti-personnel ball bearings fired towards heavily populated civilian areas constitutes a 
clear violation of humanitarian law.  Whether it also amounts to a war crime is a 
determination to be made upon the basis of more detailed evidence as to intent than the 
mission was able to obtain, but the prima facie case is nevertheless a powerful one, and the 
matter warrants careful investigation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) It is clear that Hezbollah made at least some use of houses and other civilian 
sites to hide or conceal military activities, although the evidence presented to the mission in 
that regard was far from systematic.  Any further inquiries undertaken by the Council 
should consider whether such practices violated humanitarian law rules and whether any 
instances amounted to the use of human shields; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Human Rights Council should request the relevant international bodies - 
including the Meetings of States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions 
on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and to the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their 
Destruction - to take urgent action to add cluster munitions to the list of weapons banned 
under international law. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The mission makes the following recommendations to the international Commission 
of Inquiry: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Within the framework of resolution S-2/1, the Commission should examine a 
cross-section of Israeli attacks to evaluate whether they were directed against legitimate 
military objectives and respected the principle of proportionality.  It should also investigate 
reported attacks against fleeing civilians, ambulances and health facilities, large-scale 
displacement and the destruction of housing and property, and determine whether any 
such acts amounted to war crimes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) While cluster munitions do not per se violate international law, the manner 
in which they were used by Israel appears to have been inconsistent with the principles of 
distinction and proportionality.  If proven, the widely reported claim that the great 
majority of these bombs were dropped in the final 72 hours of the campaign, when a 
ceasefire was imminent, would indicate an intention to inhibit and prevent the return of 
civilians and a reckless disregard for the predictable civilian casualties that have occurred.  
These issues warrant in-depth analysis by the Commission. 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> The mission makes the following recommendations to the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The international community should ensure that necessary support continues 
to be provided to the Lebanese authorities in the reconstruction process; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The international community, including all relevant United Nations agencies, 
is encouraged to increase its support to the health and housing sectors in Lebanon; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The international community should significantly increase funding for 
UNMACC in order for it to more expeditiously complete the destruction of unexploded 
ordnance and allow the population to return to normal life; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The international community &#8211; especially donors, United Nations agencies 
and relevant international non-governmental organizations &#8211; must attach a high priority to 
addressing, in close cooperation with the Governments of Lebanon and Israel and with 
their respective domestic civil societies, the mental and psychosocial health impacts of the 
conflict.

was concentrated in two bands away from the border area:  from southeast of Rashidiyah on the 
coast (south of Tyre) to the northeast of Tyre; with a second band from southwest of Brashit and 
south of Tibnin extending northwards through Qabrikha into the Bekka valley to the west of

Bint Jbeil and opposite (west of) the Israeli town of Metula.

<p>  One of the Rapporteurs visited Tibnine Governmental Hospital.  During the conflict, this 
hospital provided medical services, shelter for 1,800 IDPs, and support (e.g. food) for over 
10,000 transiting IDPs.  The Rapporteur was informed that, in the last days of the conflict, 
between 50-100 cluster bomb sub-munitions hit the hospital and fell in the hospital grounds or 
the immediate vicinity; some exploded, some did not.  Two unexploded bomblets hung in trees 
within the hospital grounds.  One exploded within three or four metres of the door to the 
emergency clinic.  A hospital fuel tank was hit (it did not explode) and windows broken.  
Installed on the roof, the systems for air conditioning and lifts were hit and malfunctioned.  More 
than ten cars, parked within a few metres of the hospital, were hit and burnt, blackening the 
hospital&#8217;s wall.  The hospital&#8217;s occupants were sheltering in an underground floor at the relevant 
times and none was injured.  UNMACC has now cleared the hospital and its immediate environs 
of unexploded ordinances.

demographic realities, the quantification method applies a multiplication factor of 4.7 for family

states (para. 5) that &#8220;Although the practice of forced evictions might appear to occur primarily in 
heavily populated urban areas, it also takes place in connection with forced population transfers, 
internal displacement, forced relocations in the context of armed conflict, mass exoduses and 
refugee movements.  In all of these contexts, the right to adequate housing and not to be 
subjected to forced eviction may be violated through a wide range of acts or omissions 
attributable to States parties.  Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations 
on such a right, full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations 
imposed must be &#8220;determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of 
these (i.e. economic, social and cultural) rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the

<p>  &#8220;On the first day our missiles were focused on shelling military sites only, excluding Israeli 
settlements and colonies in north occupied Palestine.  Yet, the enemy army, unable to confront 
our warriors, started from the first day targeting towns, villages, civilians, civilian installations 
and infrastructure.&#8221; 
<b>86
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;[O]ur battle is against the military, even though we consider everyone in &#8216;Israel&#8217; partner in 
their crime, but so long as there was no need to attack civil targets, we will not.&#8221;  Speech by 
HassanNasrallah, 16 July 2006, 
http://www.shiachat.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=87647&amp;st=25.  The rules of humanitarian 
law already reflect the requirements of military necessity; there is no &#8220;necessity&#8221; exception to 
these rules.  The targeting of civilians not directly participating in hostilities is, without 
exception, a violation of international humanitarian law. 
<b>87
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;[W]ith the Zionists carelessly exceeding the proper limits of engagement, their inability to 
read current events has pushed them to continue their extensive assaults of South Lebanon and 
Bakaa, especially the cities of Baalbek and Hermel, and to take the choice of hitting the newly 
built infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we were left with no choice but to deliver on the promise of shelling the city of 
Haifa.  We know the importance and the gravity of this city.  Had we aimed missiles at the 
chemical plants, a major disaster would have struck that region, but we deliberately spared these 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>plants from our missile-range in the interests of restraint rather than pushing matters into the 
unknown.  To make certain, our weapon is not one of revenge but deterrence, to inject some 
reason and deliberation back into the heads of the lunatics in the Olmert Government, and rid 
them of hang-ups of arrogance and tyranny, even idiocy, their specialty. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just avoiding such targets does not mean we will continue down this course of response.  
We may, at any moment, consider it our duty to protect our homeland, people and families and 
resort to any means possible to provide such protection. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as the enemy practices this level of aggression without hindrance or restraint, 
we will therefore go to the same level in our defence, relinquishing limits and red lines.&#8221; Speech 
by Hassan Nasrallah, 16 July 2006, ibid.   
</p>
<p>It was also stated:  &#8220;Fourth, regarding the rockets and the settlements, I would like to 
confirm that our shelling of the settlements, in the north or beyond Haifa or Tel Aviv, and since 
the issues are now clearer, is a reaction and not an action.  If you attack our cities, villages and 
capital, we will react.  And any time you decide to stop your attacks on our cities, villages and 
infrastructure, we will not fire rockets on any Israeli settlement or city.  Naturally, we would 
rather, in case of fighting, fight soldier to soldier on the ground and battlefield.  We are worthy 
of this battle and we are its men.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>In a speech at the beginning of the fourth week of the conflict, Nasrallah announced that 
&#8220;the missile shelling of the settlements in north Palestine reaching after Haifa will continue; 
rather, it will continue with a higher rhythm pertaining to quality and quantity.  Yesterday, the 
Islamic Resistance fired more than 300 rockets into the northern settlements and shelled the 
settlement of Beit Shan or Beesan and the city of Afoula in the [heart of Israel beyond Haifa] &#8230; 
using Khaibar [missiles]&#8221;.  He stressed again, however, that &#8220;our shelling of the settlements, in 
the north or beyond Haifa or Tel Aviv, &#8230; is a reaction and not an action&#8221;.  Speech by Sayyed  
assan Nasrallah, 7 August 2006, http://www.islamicdigest.net/v61/content/view/1887/0/).  In a 
televised speech two days later, Nasrallah urged the Arab population of Haifa to flee the city in 
order to &#8220;relieve&#8221; him of his remaining hesitations in targeting Haifa (and its non-Arab civilian 
population).  Speech broadcast by Al-Manar TV station, 9 August 2006.  Arabic text:

bearings, which spray out over a radius of up to 300 meters when the rocket strikes.  Harm to

16 July 2006.  A 220m rocket attack (or the similar 302mm rocket with ball bearings) on an IDF

<p>  Note of 14 August 2006 from Renee Jacqueline Brown, International Department, Magen 
David Adom.  One senior Israeli mental health specialist working for the government reported 
that approximately 4,000 civilians had been given treatment in hospital for mental health 
problems.  After a few hours, most were discharged.  He emphasized the anxiety generated by 
internal displacement and acknowledged that, although arrangements were well organized, there 
were some problems of drugs, alcohol, sexual abuse and domestic violence among IDPs.  He 
also emphasized the stress on those living in shelters.

<p>  In Kiryat Shmona, the authorities organized temporary evacuation for people to respite from 
the difficult conditions and fear.  However, they had to return few days later in order to allow 
another group to rotate out for a temporary trip, creating distress and fear for those who were 
obliged to return.  See ibid.  According to Deputy Isra&#235;l Hasson, resident of Tivon, near Haifa, 
during the war, the population was divided in two:  those who had the means to go south and 
those &#8211; poor, handicapped, or isolated elderly &#8211; were left there without help (<i>Le Monde</i>, &#8220;Les 
Isra&#233;liens fustigent l&#8217;&#8221;incurie&#8221; du gouvernement&#8221;, 18 August 2006,

<p>  The variation included type of medical service and frequency of delivery.  Also, some 
services were not free of charge, such as emergency dental care.  Note, too, that in the north a 
community&#8217;s primary health clinic remained open if it had a shelter.  However, it is not clear that 
primary health clinics with shelters are equitably distributed across the country and its different 
population groups, leaving the possibility of discriminatory access to primary health care during 
the conflict.

hostilities, patients and staff returned to Mizra.

<p>  Numerous concluding observations of United Nations treaty bodies , e.g. CESCR in 1998 
and 2003, CERD in 1998 and CRC, refer to the policy and legislative steps necessary to 
overcome the discrimination suffered by the Arab minority in Israel.  The Israeli 
Government-commissioned &#8220;Or Commission report&#8221; of 1993 also makes recommendations (see

<p>  The situation regarding the livelihood of the affected populations in particular in the south of 
the country raises important concerns.  According to the <i>Rapid Preliminary Damage Assessment</i>, 
see note 52 above, the armed conflict resulted in the destruction of 545 cultivated fields in 
South Lebanon, with an overall 10.6 ha of land damaged.  Additionally, and possibly more 
seriously, access to agricultural land is hampered due to the high number of road sections 
destroyed or damaged in rural areas.  The most serious problem for the resumption of 
agriculture, and thus for the livelihood of returnees, is however represented by the hundreds of 
thousands of unexploded cluster bomb sub-munitions, a good portion of which lies in fields and 
olive groves. 
<b>121

<b>123
</b></p>
<p>  According to the draft health chapter in the United Nations Common Country Assessment for 
Lebanon (dated July 2006), a flourishing business-oriented, high technology private sector is 
&#8220;driving the health sector towards favoring large cities, high income communities, at the expense 
of smaller cities in peripheral areas, and the poorer population groups.&#8221; The private market 
provides about 90 per cent of the health services and &#8220;poorer population groups will not be able 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>to have prompt and timely access to health care&#8221;, while recent evidence suggests that &#8220;some 
families are getting impoverished by emerging health costs.&#8221; 
<b>124

<p>  For example, see CRC article 24 (2) (c).

<b>126
</b></p>
<p>  To replace those that Israel destroyed, the population of South Lebanon urgently needs 
5,000&#8211;10,000 water tanks for residences.  However, the local market has been able to provide 
only 1,000.  Consequently, even with the best efforts, some displaced persons can be rehoused, 
but cannot access potable water.  As an interim measure, relief services, like that of Jihad 
al-Bina, are transporting water tanks to the needy communities (see Post-Conflict Mission 
Report, Housing and Land Rights Network, Habitat International Coalition, September 2006,

<p>  Deaths and injuries, destruction of homes and communities, widespread displacement, and 
exposure to terrifying events, can lead to intense psychological distress, involving fear, a sense 
of hopelessness and helplessness, great anger and frustration.  Other effects of the conflict also 
risk undermining mental health and psychosocial well being, such as increased poverty and 
dependency, disruption of community structures, and separation of children from their usual 
caregivers.  Individuals not directly exposed to the violence are also affected through living 
under fear of attack, concern for family members, hosting displaced families, and viewing the 
local conflict through the media.  See <i>Mental Health and Psychological Protection and Support 
for Adults and Children Affected by the Middle East Crisis:  Inter-Agency Technical Advice for

they should not focus on a single diagnosis, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.  The human
