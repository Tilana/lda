<p><b>25/&#8230;  Mandate of the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt 
and other related international financial obligations of States on 
the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and other relevant international 
human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Human Rights Council on the effects of structural adjustment and economic 
reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> Human Rights Council resolution S-10/1 of 23 February 2009 on 
the impact of the global economic and financial crises on the universal realization and 
effective enjoyment of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or 
humanitarian character, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the 
international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of 
developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such 
countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their 
people,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income 
developing countries through various national and international measures designed to make 
their debt sustainable in the long term,  
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the role, mandate and activities of other United Nations agencies, funds 
and programmes in dealing with the issues of foreign debt and international financial 
obligations, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced 
by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is 
unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-
centred sustainable development and poverty eradication, and that, for many developing 
countries and countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely 
constrained their capacity to promote social development and provide basic services to 
create the conditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing 
countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official 
development assistance, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing 
developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable 
human development, and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recalls</i> that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the 
economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and 
responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to 
external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> that structural adjustment reform programmes and policy 
conditionalities limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give 
inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries 
manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Also recognizes</i> that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that 
should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and 
development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of development goals, 
including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that 
debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, 
ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are 
accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Recalls once again</i> the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the 
Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the 
heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official </p>


<p>bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to 
poverty reduction; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> the international community, including the United Nations system, the 
Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions 
for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of major 
United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World 
Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable 
Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular 
those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in 
particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with 
economies in transition; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its request</i> to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in 
particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures 
arising from foreign debt; 
</p>
<p>7.<i> Welcomes</i> the work and contributions of the Independent Expert on the 
effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, and 
takes note with appreciation of his latest report to the Council;1 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Independent Expert on the effects of 
foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, for a period 
of three years, and requests the Independent Expert to pay particular attention to: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The effects of foreign debt and the policies adopted to address them on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, economic, social and cultural rights in 
developing countries; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The impact of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations on the capacity of States to design and implement their policies and 
programmes, including national budgets that respond to vital requirements for the 
promotion of the realization of social rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international 
financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest 
and heavily indebted countries; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international 
financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations with respect to economic reform policies and human rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Quantification of minimum standards to support the realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Enhancement of consultations with all relevant stakeholders in the fulfilment 
of this mandate; 
</p>
<p>9.<i> Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Independent 
Expert in the discharge of his or her mandate, to provide him or her with all the necessary 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>information requested by him or her, and to give serious consideration to responding 
favourably to his or her requests to visit their countries in order to enable him or her to 
fulfil his or her duties effectively; 
</p>
<p>10<i>. Urges</i> international organizations, international financial institutions, non-
governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the Independent 
Expert in the discharge of his or her mandate; </p>
<p>11. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to provide all the necessary human and 
financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate by the Independent Expert;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to report regularly to the Human Rights 
Council and the General Assembly in accordance with their respective programmes of 
work; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter at its twenty-eighth 
session under the same agenda item.
