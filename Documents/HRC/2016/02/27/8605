<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/26 the Human Rights Council welcomed the report of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism (A/HRC/13/36), as well as the work to 
implement the mandate given to her by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 
2005/80 and the General Assembly in its resolution 60/158, and requested the High 
Commissioner to continue her efforts in this regard. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted in accordance with Council resolution 13/26. In it the 
High Commissioner highlights relevant developments that have taken place since the 
submission of her last report, notably through initiatives adopted by the General Assembly 
at its sixty-fifth session, including following the review of the United Nations Global 
Counter-Terrorism Strategy; recent activities of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation 
Task Force, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) 
concerning counter-terrorism (Counter-Terrorism Committee) and its Executive 
Directorate; and other developments related to the regulation of private military and security 
companies. 
</p>
<p>3. While recognizing the immense, persistent challenges faced by Member States in 
combating terrorism and safeguarding the security of individuals within their jurisdiction, 
the High Commissioner continues to be deeply concerned at the erosion of respect for due 
process, including the right to a fair trial, in the context of counter-terrorism policies and 
practices. In the present report, the High Commissioner identifies issues of concern 
including ongoing challenges to human rights and due process guarantees in relation to the 
Security Council individual sanctions regime, as well as other practices which impede the 
right to a fair trial in the context of counter-terrorism, such as the use of intelligence in 
criminal justice processes. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Activities of the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 3 September 2010, the General Assembly adopted resolution 64/297.1 In this 
resolution, four years after the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy (the &#8220;Global Strategy&#8221;)2, the General Assembly reaffirmed the Global Strategy and 
its four pillars, which constitute an ongoing effort, and called upon Member States, the 
United Nations and other appropriate international, regional and subregional organizations 
to step up their efforts to implement the Global Strategy in an integrated manner and in all 
its aspects. The resolution signalled a clear re-endorsement by all Member States that 
human rights are the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism, and that human rights 
and countering terrorism are not conflicting goals but are mutually reinforcing.  
</p>
<p>5. Through this resolution, the General Assembly also called upon United Nations 
entities involved in supporting counter-terrorism efforts to continue to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 This resolution was adopted following General Assembly resolution 62/272 of 5 September 2008, 
</p>
<p>which called for, inter alia, an examination in two years of progress made in the implementation of the 
Strategy and for consideration to be given to updating it to respond to changes, as also provided for in 
General Assembly resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006. 
</p>
<p> 2 Resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006. </p>


<p>promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as due 
process and the rule of law, while countering terrorism. The General Assembly reaffirmed 
the primary responsibility of Member States to implement the Global Strategy, but also 
recognized the need to enhance the important role that the United Nations, including the 
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, plays in facilitating and promoting 
coordination and coherence in the implementation of the Global Strategy at the national, 
regional and global levels and in providing assistance, upon request by Member States, 
especially in the area of capacity-building.  
</p>
<p>6. In a resolution adopted on 20 December 2010,3 the General Assembly again 
reaffirmed that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies 
with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, 
refugee and humanitarian law. It also urged States, inter alia, to safeguard the right to 
privacy in accordance with international law, and take measures to ensure that interferences 
with the right to privacy are regulated by law, subject to effective oversight and appropriate 
redress, including through judicial review or other means. The General Assembly also 
requested the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force to continue its efforts to 
ensure that the United Nations can better coordinate and enhance its support to Member 
States in their efforts to comply with their obligations under international law, including 
international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, while countering terrorism, and 
to encourage each working group of the Task Force to incorporate a human rights 
perspective into its work. It also encouraged relevant United Nations bodies and entities, in 
particular those participating in the Task Force, to step up their efforts to ensure respect for 
international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, as well as the rule of law, as an 
element of technical assistance, including in the adoption and implementation of legislative 
and other measures by States.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Activities of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force  
</b></p>
<p>7. The Secretary-General highlighted in his report to the General Assembly that the 
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, its working groups and entities should 
continue to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law as the fundamental basis for 
their work in assisting Member States in implementing the Global Strategy (A/65/224, 
para. 36). Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism encouraged the Task Force to 
take into account human rights considerations in all aspects of its work, in line with the 
Global Strategy, and ensure that each working group incorporates a human rights 
component and perspective (A/65/258, para. 73). It is also my view that as the key 
comprehensive framework document at the international level for countering terrorism, the 
Global Strategy should inform the work and approach of the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force. I encourage the Task Force, its working groups and its 
initiatives to incorporate a human rights approach to, and address human rights issues and 
concerns in, their work, in line with the approach mandated by Member States in the Global 
Strategy and to ensure that the assistance provided by the Task Force to respond to 
terrorism is both effective and sustainable. 
</p>
<p>8. The working group on protecting human rights while countering terrorism issued its 
first two Basic Human Rights Reference Guides: <i>The Stopping and Searching of Persons</i> 
and <i>Security Infrastructure</i> in September 2010, and is developing guides on detention in the 
context of counter-terrorism, the principle of legality in national counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See A/65/456/Add.2 (Part II), sect. III, draft resolution XVI.  </p>


<p>legislation and the proscription of organizations at the national level. These tools aim to 
provide guidance on how measures compliant with human rights can be adopted in a 
number of counter-terrorism areas and will be useful instruments in assisting Member 
States in strengthening the protection of human rights while countering terrorism. In 
addition, the working group will organize a series of international meetings, held at the 
regional level on a rotating basis, which will focus on issues related to the protection of 
human rights in the context of countering terrorism, with a view to developing 
recommendations based on international standards. The first meeting will take place in early 
2011 in South-East Asia, and will address the issue of the right to a fair trial in the context 
of countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>9. In addition to chairing the working group on protecting human rights while 
countering terrorism, my Office is an active member of a number of other Task Force 
working groups and initiatives, including the working group on preventing and resolving 
conflicts, the Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism (I-ACT) Initiative, the 
working group on countering the use of the Internet for terrorism purposes, the working 
group on supporting and highlighting victims of terrorism, and the newly founded working 
group on border management. In all of these working groups, my Office aims to 
mainstream human rights concerns and issues in the work of the Task Force, as per the 
framework provided by the Global Strategy. In this context, in January and February 2010, 
my Office took part in meetings of the working group on countering the use of Internet for 
terrorist purposes, in Berlin and in Seattle. 
</p>
<p>10. In its Presidential statement of 27 September 2010 (PRST 2010/19), the Security 
Council recognized, inter alia, the importance of civil society for increasing awareness 
about the threats of terrorism and more effectively tackling them. Through the Global 
Strategy, the General Assembly also stressed the need to further encourage non-
governmental organizations and civil society to engage, as appropriate, on how to enhance 
efforts to implement the Strategy.4 Further, the Secretary-General has noted that Member 
States have highlighted the need to engage more closely with civil society and to provide 
better linkage between the activities of the Task Force and civil society entities.5 It is my 
view that engagement with civil society is a necessary element of any assistance provided to 
Member States to implement the human rights aspects of the Global Strategy. The Task 
Force should, as a whole, including under the leadership of the working group on protecting 
human rights while countering terrorism, step up its engagement with civil society, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights defenders. Such engagement can 
inform any assistance provided by the Task Force and its working groups, and lead to a 
response that is both effective and compliant with international human rights law.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Activities of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee and 
Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive 
Directorate continue to take relevant human rights concerns into account in their work 
programmes focused on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) 
and 1624 (2005). Under the chairmanship of Turkey, the Committee has held thematic 
discussions on issues mentioned in the resolutions, all of which have referred to relevant 
human rights aspects, such as ensuring respect for the right to seek asylum while denying 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Para. 3 (d) of resolution A/62/288, as reaffirmed in resolution 64/297, para. 6.  
 5 &#8220;United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy: activities of the United Nations system in 
</p>
<p>implementing the Strategy&#8221; (A/64/818), para. 19. </p>


<p>safe haven, and including rule of law programmes in recommendations for technical 
assistance. In addition, the Committee held a discussion on 7 October 2010 that focused 
entirely on human rights in the context of resolution 1373. These discussions were later 
presented as briefings to the wider United Nations membership, bringing greater 
transparency to the Committee&#8217;s attention to human rights. At a Security Council briefing 
by chairs of the subsidiary counter-terrorism bodies on 15 November 2010, the Committee 
chair reiterated that effective counter-terrorism measures and respect for human rights, 
fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are complementary and mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p>12. In line with General Assembly resolution 64/168 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 13/26, the Committee and its Executive Directorate continued to liaise with the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, and other human rights entities. The Special Rapporteur briefed 
the Committee in New York on 28 October 2010, where he addressed issues related to the 
legal basis of the Security Council&#8217;s counter-terrorism regime. The Executive Directorate 
organized a regional workshop for senior law enforcement and prosecution officials from 
South Asia, with the participation of OHCHR, in Semarang, Indonesia, from 9 to 11 
November 2010, including for the purpose of visiting the Jakarta Centre for Law 
Enforcement Cooperation. It also continued its active participation in the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force working group on the protection of human rights while 
countering terrorism, chaired by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Other developments: regulation of private military and security 
companies 
</b></p>
<p>13. In accordance with the request made by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 
10/11 with regard to the elaboration of a possible draft convention on private military and 
security companies and following regional consultations and meetings with experts, the 
Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the right of peoples to self-determination presented the full text of the possible 
draft convention to the Council at its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/25, annex). The Working 
Group also presented elements for the possible draft convention to the General Assembly at 
its sixty-fifth session (A/65/325, annex). As highlighted by the Working Group, the aim of a 
new binding legal instrument would be to establish minimum international standards for 
States parties to regulate the activities of the companies and their personnel, and to set up an 
international oversight mechanism in the form of a committee (ibid., para. 54). The draft 
convention also proposes that the committee establish and maintain an international register 
of private military and security companies operating on the international market based on 
information provided by States parties (ibid., para. 54 (i)). 
</p>
<p>14. On 1 October 2010, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 15/26 in which it 
decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group to consider the 
possibility of elaborating an international regulatory framework, including, inter alia, the 
option of elaborating a legally binding instrument, on the regulation, monitoring and 
oversight of the activities of private military and security companies, including their 
accountability. The Council noted that the open-ended intergovernmental working group 
should take into consideration the principles, main elements and draft text proposed by the 
Working Group on the use of mercenaries.  
</p>
<p>15. In a parallel development, on 9 November 2010, 58 private security companies 
signed on to the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers. The 
Code of Conduct endorses the principles of &#8220;respect, protect, remedy&#8221; developed by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and </p>


<p>transnational corporations, and welcomed by the Human Rights Council, and affirms the 
responsibility of signatory companies to respect the human rights of, and fulfil humanitarian 
responsibilities towards, all those affected by their business activities, including the 
population of the area in which services are provided. The Code also envisages the 
establishment of an independent governance and oversight mechanism whose mandate is 
still to be determined.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Issues of concern: due process in the context of counter-
terrorism 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Due process and targeted sanctions</b>6<b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. The international sanctions regime for individuals linked to Al-Qaida and the 
Taliban was established by Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) and modified by a 
series of subsequent resolutions, which together require all States, in connection with any 
individual or entity associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban as 
designated by the 1267 Committee, to implement sanctions measures including asset 
freezes, international travel bans, and arms embargoes.7 The Consolidated List maintained 
by the 1267 Committee differs from other sanctions lists in that it targets individuals and 
entities that do not necessarily have any links to a State or government. 
</p>
<p>17. Targeted sanctions are widely recognized as a significant preventive tool for 
effectively combating terrorism. While the objective of the sanctions imposed under the 
1267 regime is preventive, their impact on the individuals and entities targeted is clearly 
punitive. I have repeatedly expressed my concern over the impact of the listing and de-
listing regime established by the Security Council, and of related national procedures for its 
implementation, on the human rights of those affected and their families. Sanctions imposed 
under the 1267 regime, including international travel bans and asset freezes, can result in a 
denial of access by listed individuals to their own property, limitations on their ability to 
work and restrictions on their ability to travel and may therefore unjustifiably infringe, for 
example, on the right to freedom of movement, the right to property, and the right to 
privacy. The reputational cost to those affected as a result of the suggested association with 
terrorism or terrorist groups is immeasurable. Moreover, as individual listings under the 
current regime are open-ended in duration, they may result in a sanction measure effectively 
becoming permanent.  
</p>
<p>18. The serious potential repercussions of targeted sanctions for the human rights of 
those affected underline the importance of ensuring that the procedures for the listing and 
de-listing of individuals and entities comply strictly with due process requirements. Yet the 
procedures established under the 1267 regime lack the judicial safeguards necessary to meet 
internationally recognized standards of due process including the right to a fair hearing, the 
right to judicial review and the right to an effective remedy. The sanctions regime 
established under resolution 1373 pose similar challenges. Since the 2005 call by the 
General-Assembly for the Security Council to ensure &#8220;fair and transparent procedures&#8221; for 
</p>
<p>  
 6 In its resolution 13/26 the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights &#8220;to contribute further appropriately to the ongoing discussion regarding the efforts of Member 
States of the United Nations to assure adequate human rights guarantees to ensure fair and clear 
procedures, in particular with regard to placing on, reviewing and removing individuals and entities 
from terrorism-related sanctions lists&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 7 Security Council resolutions 1333 (2000), 1390 (2002), 1452 (2002), 1455 (2003), 1526 (2004), 1617 
(2005), 1735 (2006), 1822 (2008) and 1904 (2009). </p>


<p>its international sanctions regime of individuals, a number of improvements have been 
made to the 1267 regime in an effort to address these weaknesses. These include the 
establishment by the Council of a focal point for de-listing,8 the requirement that Member 
States provide a detailed statement of case prior to listing,9 and a requirement that the 
Committee make accessible a narrative summary of reasons for listing, make further efforts 
to try to inform the individual of the listing, and conduct a review of all names on the list by 
30 June 2010.10  
</p>
<p>19. The latest measure towards the improvement of the Security Council&#8217;s listing and 
de-listing procedure lies in the adoption on 17 December 2009 of resolution 1904. Through 
the resolution, the Security Council established an Office of the Ombudsperson to receive 
requests from individuals and entities seeking removal from the Consolidated List. The 
General Assembly has recognized the need to continue ensuring that fair and clear 
procedures under the United Nations terrorism-related sanctions regime are strengthened in 
order to enhance their efficiency and transparency, and has welcomed and encouraged the 
ongoing efforts of the Security Council in support of these objectives, including by 
establishing an Office of the Ombudsperson and continuing to review all the names of 
individuals and entities in the regime.11 I commend the efforts of the Security Council to 
improve the sanctions regime through procedural reforms, including the adoption of 
resolution 1904 and the appointment in July 2010 of the first Ombudsperson, as a 
significant step towards ensuring fair and clear procedures and preventing further human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>20. Resolution 1904 provides for a strict timetable for the review procedure once the 
Office of the Ombudsperson has received a de-listing request, with an initial information-
gathering phase which requires the Ombudsperson, inter alia, to acknowledge the receipt of 
the de-listing request; inform the petitioner of the general procedure for processing 
de-listing requests; answer specific questions from the petitioner about 1267 Committee 
procedures; and forward the de-listing request to the 1267 Monitoring Team for additional 
information. The process then involves a two-month period of engagement including the 
possibility for dialogue between the Ombudsperson, the petitioner and Member States. The 
Ombudsperson must then submit a comprehensive report to the Committee, which lays out 
the principal arguments concerning the request and summarizes and, &#8220;as appropriate&#8221;, 
specifies the sources of, all information. The resolution also states that de-listing petitions 
not returned to the petitioner will be forwarded to, inter alia, relevant United Nations bodies 
which, in the light of the important human rights issues related to de-listing, I trust will 
include OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>21. While the newly-established de-listing procedures represent an important step 
towards fair and clear procedures, the gulf between the 1267 regime and due process-related 
requirements in international human rights law and the need for more comprehensive 
reform remain. There is still no recourse to independent judicial or quasi-judicial review 
either of a decision to list or denial of a request to de-list. In addition, there is no obligation 
to publish in full the Ombudsperson&#8217;s report, nor is the petitioner entitled to know entirely 
the information available to the Ombudsperson or the Committee. Furthermore, although 
the powers given to the Ombudsperson include access to some information provided by the 
petitioner and the Monitoring Team, in practice the Ombudsperson may still depend in large 
measure on the willingness of individual States to provide the non-redacted information 
necessary to produce a full analysis of de-listing requests. The decision to de-list will 
</p>
<p>  
 8 Security Council resolution 1730 (2006). 
 9 Security Council resolution 1735 (2006). 
 10 Security Council resolution 1822 (2008). 
 11 See A/65/456/Add.2 (Part II), sect. III, draft resolution XVI. </p>


<p>continue to be taken by the 1267 Committee, which is under no obligation to provide 
reasons for its decision and the extent to which the reasons will be communicated to the 
petitioner in practice is unclear. Finally, the Office of the Ombudsperson lacks the authority 
to grant appropriate relief in cases where human rights are violated, whilst the ability of 
individuals and entities to challenge their listing and seek relief at national level is 
constrained by the obligation on Member States to implement Security Council sanctions 
imposed under Chapter VII.12 
</p>
<p>22. These and other human rights concerns have fuelled challenges to the targeted 
sanctions regime and implementing measures in regional and national courts by political 
bodies at regional and national levels, by international human rights treaty bodies and 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council, and in other forums.13 For instance, the 
Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter-Terrorism and Human Rights of the 
International Commission of Jurists has referred to the &#8220;virtually uniform criticism of the 
system as it presently operates&#8221; and noted the difficulties the regime poses for Member 
States faced with abiding by their obligations to implement sanctions while meeting their 
domestic and international human rights obligations.14 While the procedural improvements 
established under resolution 1904 and the recent appointment and ongoing work of the 
Ombudsperson are positive and significant developments, they fail to adequately address 
the structural, due process-related concerns which have prompted these criticisms and 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>23. The recent decision of the European General Court in <i>Kadi v. European Commission 
</i>provides practical illustration of these challenges. The Court annulled the European 
Commission regulation implementing the Security Council resolutions and decisions related 
to the targeted sanctions regime insofar as it applied to the applicant, Mr. Kadi, on grounds 
that the regulation violated his right to defence. The Court stated that Mr. Kadi&#8217;s right to 
effective judicial review had been violated due to the lack of proper access to the 
information and evidence used against him, noting in particular that:  
</p>
<p>  
 12 Individual cases have nonetheless been heard in national courts in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, 
</p>
<p>the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland and the United States of America. One example is the decision by the Supreme Court of the 
United Kingdom in January 2010 which struck down the domestic legislation implementing the 1267 
regime in that country (consolidated cases <i>HMT v. Mohammed Jabar Ahmed and others</i>; <i>Mohammed 
al-Ghabra and HMT v. Hani El Sayed Sabaei Youssef</i>).  
</p>
<p> 13 See Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly resolution 1597 which found the 1267 sanctions 
regime to &#8220;violate the fundamental principles of human rights and the rule of law&#8221;; Council of Europe, 
Commissioner for Human Rights, &#8220;Arbitrary procedures for terrorist black-listing must now be 
changed&#8221; (2008), available from www.coe.int/t/commissioner/viewpoints/081201_en.asp; Case T-

At the national level see the resolution adopted by the Parliament of Switzerland, which provides for 
notification to the Security Council that the Government of Switzerland will not apply the sanctions 
required under the 1267 regime against individuals who have not been &#8220;brought to justice&#8221; after three 
years of being placed on the Consolidated List; who do not have the right of judicial review of their 
listing; who have not been charged by any judicial authority; and against whom no new evidence has 
been produced since being included on the List: <i>Les fondements de notre ordre juridique court-
circuit&#233;s par l&#8217;ONU</i> (adopted 4 March 2010).  
</p>

Panel on Terrorism, Counter-Terrorism and Human Rights</i> (Geneva, International Commission of 
Jurists, 2009), pp. 116&#8211;117. </p>


<p>the Security Council has still not deemed it appropriate to establish an independent 
and impartial body responsible for hearing and determining, as regards matters of 
law and fact, actions against individual decisions taken by the Sanctions Committee. 
Furthermore, neither the focal point mechanism nor the Office of the Ombudsperson 
affects the principle that removal of a person from the Sanctions Committee&#8217;s list 
requires consensus within the committee. Moreover, the evidence which may be 
disclosed to the person concerned continues to be a matter entirely at the discretion 
of the State which proposed that he be included on the Sanctions Committee&#8217;s list 
and there is no mechanism to ensure that sufficient information be made available to 
the person concerned in order to allow him to defend himself effectively (he need not 
even be informed of the identity of the State which has requested his inclusion on the 
Sanctions Committee&#8217;s list).15 
</p>
<p>24. The Court stated that the considerations of the earlier decision by the European 
Court of Justice remain valid despite the creation by the Security Council of a focal point 
and an Office of the Ombudsperson, as these &#8220;cannot be equated with the provision of an 
effective judicial procedure for review of decisions of the Sanctions Committee&#8221;. The Court 
also found an infringement of the applicant&#8217;s right to property as a result of the general 
application and duration of the freezing measures. 
</p>
<p>25. Concerns similar to those addressed by the European General Court also have been 
raised by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, including in his report to the sixty-fifth 
session of the General Assembly. While welcoming the adoption of resolution 1904 and 
related procedural improvements, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Security 
Council adopt a widespread reform of its sanctions regime and replace resolutions 1373 
(2001), 1624 (2005) and 1267 (1999) (as amended) with a single resolution, not adopted 
under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, in order to systematize the States&#8217; 
counter-terrorism measures and reporting duties of States under one framework with 
explicit human rights provisions, using the Global Strategy as a basis (A/65/258, para. 75). 
</p>
<p>26. The Security Council has reiterated its commitment &#8220;to ensure that fair and clear 
procedures exist for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists and for removing 
them, as well as for granting humanitarian exemptions&#8221; (PRST/2010/19, p. 4) and to review 
the 1267 sanctions measures &#8220;with a view to their possible further strengthening&#8221; at latest 
by mid-2011.16 Importantly, the Security Council also has expressed its strong support for 
the Global Strategy, which recognizes respect for human rights and the rule of law as the 
fundamental basis for the fight against terrorism, and has reaffirmed that Member States 
&#8220;must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations 
under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian 
law&#8221;, noting further that &#8220;effective counter-terrorism measures and respect for human 
rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are complementary and mutually 
reinforcing and are an essential part of a successful counter-terrorism effort&#8221; 
(PRST/2010/19, p. 2). 
</p>
<p>27. I welcome the renewed commitment of the Security Council to ensuring that 
measures for countering terrorism are adopted in compliance with international law and 
commend in particular its strong support for the Global Strategy. I urge the Security 
Council in this spirit to explore every avenue of possibility in order to ensure that sanctions 
imposed against individuals and entities are accompanied by rigorous procedural safeguards

<p>which guarantee minimum due process standards, for both listing and de-listing decisions. 
This should include ensuring full support to the office of the newly-established 
Ombudsperson, as well as monitoring and reviewing its practices as necessary, while 
developing additional mechanisms to enhance due process protections for listing and de-
listing procedures, such as further steps to increase transparency of the listing process and 
the establishment of clear time limits for listing. It should also include the establishment of 
an independent, quasi-judicial procedure for review of listing and de-listing decisions. I also 
urge Member States to ensure that implementation at the national level is done in a manner 
consistent with their international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Due process and the right to fair trial in the context of counter-
terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>28. In the Plan of Action under the Global Strategy, States undertake to &#8220;make every 
effort to develop and maintain an effective and rule of law-based national criminal justice 
system that can ensure, in accordance with &#8230; obligations under international law, that any 
person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist 
acts or in support of terrorist acts is brought to justice, on the basis of the principle to 
extradite or prosecute, with due respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;.17 
States are under the obligation to ensure that all guarantees of due process are respected 
when persons who are alleged to have committed terrorism-related offences are arrested, 
charged, detained and prosecuted. Guaranteeing due process rights, including for 
individuals suspected of terrorist activity, is also critical for ensuring that anti-terrorism 
measures are effective, respect the rule of law and are seen to be fair.  
</p>
<p>29. Due process-related rights for persons accused of acts of terrorism include various 
interrelated aspects. Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 14 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which both aim at ensuring the 
proper administration of justice, set out the bedrock norms applicable in all trials, whether 
of alleged terrorists or otherwise. Persons charged with criminal offences, including 
terrorism-related crimes, are entitled to guarantees including: the guarantee of equality of all 
persons before the courts and tribunals; the right to be presumed innocent; the right to a 
hearing with due process guarantees, including the right to be tried within a reasonable time 
and by a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal; and the right to have a 
conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher court or tribunal in conformity with 
international human rights law.18 Ensuring the right to a fair trial in the context of counter-
terrorism necessarily includes the protection of a number of other human rights, such as the 
absolute prohibition of torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>30. International humanitarian law provides for substantially similar protections for the 
trial of persons in the context of armed conflicts.19 Given that the right to a fair trial is

 18 Human Rights Committee general comment 32 (2007) on the right to equality before courts and 
</p>
<p>tribunals and to a fair trial. See also the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism (A/63/223, para. 7). 
Guidance on the right to fair trial also is reflected in the International Commission of Jurists Berlin 
Declaration on Upholding Human Rights and the Rule of Law in Combating Terrorism (28 August 
2004). 
</p>
<p> 19 Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, art. 84; Geneva Convention relative

to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>explicitly guaranteed under international humanitarian law during armed conflict, the 
Human Rights Committee has stated that the requirements of fair trial in human rights law 
also must be respected during a state of emergency.20  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Challenges to due process and the right to a fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>31. In their fight against terrorism, some States have adopted measures or conducted 
activities which infringe on basic standards of fair trial or otherwise limit access to the 
judicial process. For example, some States have extended the maximum limit of pre-charge 
detention, limited the possibility of a review of the legality of detention, broadened the kind 
of evidence that can be withheld from the defence, taken measures that directly impact on 
the presumption of innocence, made an overly broad use of anonymous witnesses, rendered 
assistance by counsel extremely difficult, or used evidence such as a confession obtained 
through physical or undue psychological pressure, including torture or ill-treatment. A 
number of countries also have established specialized chambers within the ordinary courts, 
made use of military courts to try civilians, or created special courts to deal with terrorism-
related cases, in some cases in a manner that is inconsistent with human rights standards. 
Exceptional courts such as these often lack independence and impartiality of the judiciary, 
and do not provide for sufficient guarantees for the accused.  
</p>
<p>32. I continue to be deeply concerned by policies and practices such as these, and am 
pleased that the working group on protecting human rights while countering terrorism, 
which is chaired by my Office, will host an expert symposium in early2011 specifically to 
address these and other challenges to the right to a fair trial in the context of counter-
terrorism. The objectives of the expert symposium will be: to assess and analyse the 
obstacles and challenges to implementing the requirements for fair trial as set out in 
international human rights standards; to identify other key rights to secure the fundamental 
requirements of a right to a fair trial in the context of counter-terrorism; and to exchange 
experiences regarding good practices with respect to protection on human rights in this 
regard. A report on the outcome of the expert symposium will be produced with a view to 
providing guidance to Member States on how the right to fair trial and other related human 
rights can best be protected in the context of countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Specific challenges: the use of intelligence in the context of criminal justice processes 
</b></p>
<p>33. For the purposes of the present report, I wish to highlight some of the specific 
challenges to due process raised by the increased reliance by States on intelligence 
information in the context of counter-terrorism, all of which require a more in-depth and 
comprehensive analysis, and greater attention by the international community. The use of 
accurate intelligence is indispensible to preventing terrorist acts and bringing individuals 
suspected of terrorist activity to justice. However, the increased reliance on intelligence for 
countering terrorism and the advent of &#8220;intelligence-led law enforcement&#8221; in many 
countries, particularly in the decade since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, has led 
to the expansion of intelligence authority, often without adequate consideration for the due 
process safeguards necessary to protect against abuses.  
</p>
<p>34. In addition to the challenges to human rights raised by the extension of traditional 
law enforcement powers and functions to intelligence services, the increased reliance on 
intelligence has had a deleterious effect on criminal justice in many countries. Policies and 
practices such as the broad application of the national security or &#8220;State secrets&#8221; doctrine to 
</p>
<p>  
International Armed Conflicts, art. 75; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 
1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, art. 6. 
</p>
<p> 20 Human Rights Committee general comment 29 (2001) on states of emergency, para. 15. </p>


<p>prevent disclosure of information in the context of criminal trials, the use of secret 
information as evidence, and the use of anonymous witnesses too often have resulted in a 
lack of justice for victims of terrorism (for instance where problems associated with 
intelligence-related evidence result in the dismissal of judicial proceedings against 
individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity), denial of the right to a fair trial 
for individuals accused of terrorist activity (for instance in cases where a civil proceeding, 
investigation and/or prosecution is halted on grounds of State secrecy) or both. 
</p>
<p>35. While the legitimate use of a State secrets privilege &#8211; as in cases where it is invoked 
to exclude specific evidence, the exposure of which would necessarily harm national 
security &#8211; can be critical to considerations of national security, its overly broad application 
by some States has resulted in a lack of accountability including for serious human rights 
violations.21 Non-disclosure of information and evidence deemed prejudicial to security 
interests has hampered investigations and prosecutions in relation to the alleged complicity 
of a number of States in the practice of renditions, for instance. The European Parliament 
has emphasized the need for accountability in this regard, deeming it necessary to &#8220;review 
by limiting and restrictively defining the exceptions that flow from the notion of &#8216;State 
secret&#8217; [&#8230;] to avoid abuses and deviations that [&#8230;] contradict human rights obligations&#8221; 
and &#8220;establish specific mechanisms to allow for access to secret information by parliaments 
and judges, as well as for the release of the information after a certain period of time&#8221;.22  
</p>
<p>36. Following on the reports of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights on 
secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees, the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe has called for the elaboration of guidelines on human rights and the fight 
against impunity which would &#8220;stress that state secrecy and immunities do not prevent 
effective, independent and impartial investigations into serious human rights violations [&#8230;] 
and that those responsible should be held to account&#8221;.23 The forthcoming Committee report 
on &#8220;Abuse of state secrecy and national security: obstacles to parliamentary and judicial 
scrutiny of human rights violations&#8221; will be an important further step. While some action 
has been taken by individual Member States of the Council of Europe in follow-up to the 
recommendations flowing from these investigations, a great deal more is needed in order to 
combat impunity and ensure accountability, including through investigations and 
prosecutions at national levels. 
</p>
<p>37. Serious concerns have been raised in the course of legal proceedings regarding the 
broad use of State secrecy in several countries.24 For instance, in October 2009 the 
</p>
<p>  
 21 The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism also has raised concerns over the increasing use of State-secrecy provisions 
and public interest immunities by certain States, including Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United Kingdom or the United States &#8220;to conceal illegal 
acts from oversight bodies or judicial authorities, or to protect itself from criticism, embarrassment 
and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; liability&#8221; (A/HRC/10/3, para. 59).  
</p>
<p> 22 European Parliament resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the 
transportation and illegal detention of prisoners (2006/2200(INI)) of 14 February 2007, para. 194, and 
in particular paras. 202 &#8211; 206 on secret services. See also European Parliament resolutions 
2006/2027(INI) of 6 July 2006 and 2008/2179(INI) of 19 February 2009. The Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe has also recognized the problems caused by the invocation of 
State secrecy, and has called on Council of Europe Member State governments to make available to 
their national parliaments all relevant information held by them on the State&#8217;s role in renditions and 
secret detentions (Parliamentary Assembly resolution 1562, para. 18.1.2).  
</p>
<p> 23 Recommendation 1876 (2009), para. 2.2.  
 24 See for example <i>El</i>&#160;<i>Masri v. Tenet</i>, 437 F. Supp. 2d 530 (E.D. Va. 2005) (No. 1:05cv1417); <i>aff&#8217;d, </i>479 
</p>
<p>F. 3d 296 (4th Cir. 2007). Applications are pending before the European Court of Human Rights 
against the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for its role in the 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Government of the United States of America introduced a new policy on the use of State 
secrets in order to &#8220;strengthen public confidence&#8221; and &#8220;provide greater accountability and 
reliability in the invocation of the state secrets privilege in litigation&#8221;, including more 
rigorous procedures for evaluating assertions of the State secrets privilege.25 The full 
practical implications of the new policy are not yet clear. Furthermore, State secrecy has 
continued to be invoked by the Government of the United States in cases since the policy 
came into effect, including as grounds for dismissal of legal proceedings.26 In Germany, the 
Constitutional Court ruled in July 2009 that the Government&#8217;s refusal to provide testimony 
and access to information to the Parliamentary Inquiry into alleged cooperation of its 
intelligence services in renditions was unconstitutional, in the absence of detailed reasons 
for the non-disclosure, and that a general risk of impeding relations with other States alone 
without detailed substantiation could not be a basis for refusing Parliament access to the 
information.27  
</p>
<p>38. As States rely increasingly on intelligence for counter-terrorism purposes, the 
importance of intelligence sharing and cooperation among States has become ever more 
important to national security interests. The increase in the sharing of information between 
law enforcement and intelligence agencies in different jurisdictions, however, raises risks 
that the information may have been obtained by illegal means by another State and poses 
challenges to accountability.  
</p>
<p>39. Legally obtained evidence enables the criminal justice system to work effectively to 
counter terrorism, while ensuring respect for human rights protections. Under international 
human rights law the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment to elicit 
information from terrorist suspects is absolutely prohibited, as is the use in legal 
proceedings of evidence obtained by torture or ill-treatment, whether at home or abroad. 
States must ensure that the full range of legal and practical safeguards to prevent torture is 
available, including the right for anyone arrested or detained on criminal charges to be 
brought promptly before a judge and to be tried within a reasonable amount of time or to be 
released, and the right to challenge promptly the lawfulness of one&#8217;s detention before a 
court. National legislation should explicitly prohibit the use of evidence obtained by torture 
or ill-treatment. Evidence obtained in violation of other human rights must not be used in 
legal proceedings if the violation casts serious doubts on the reliability of the evidence, or 
the admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the 
integrity of the proceedings.28 In addition to ensuring domestic safeguards, States must

Commission on Human Rights against the United States. See also <i>Arar v. Ashcroft</i>, 414 F. Supp. 2d 
250, (E.D. N.Y. 2006); and <i>Binyam Mohamed et al. v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc.</i>, 539 F. Supp. 2d 1128

of the State secrets privilege<i>,</i> 23 September 2009. The policy provides that the Department of Justice 
&#8220;will not defend the invocation of the privilege in order to: (i) conceal violations of the law, 
inefficiency or administrative error; (ii) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency of 
the United States government; (iii) restrain competition; or (iv) prevent or delay the release of 
information which would not reasonably be expected to cause significant harm to national security&#8221;.

<p>ensure that regulatory frameworks are in place to ensure compliance with international 
human rights law in intelligence cooperation.29 
</p>
<p>40. Other concerns related to the reliance on intelligence for the purposes of criminal 
justice include differences in evidentiary standards, as the procedures for the gathering of 
intelligence are subject generally to lower legal thresholds than those which normally 
govern the collection of evidence for use in criminal proceedings. In some cases, States by-
pass criminal law channels by using intelligence warrants to obtain evidence for use in legal 
proceedings, in particular where the threshold for obtaining a warrant for criminal purposes 
is not met. At the same time, the reliability of intelligence for purposes of criminal justice is 
questionable as it may include rumours or hearsay, yet the inherently secretive nature of 
intelligence means that it may not be subject to testing in the context of criminal legal 
proceedings.30 Furthermore, the disclosure of intelligence submitted as evidence may be 
suppressed, thereby denying the right of the accused to review and challenge the evidence. 
In some cases the suppression of intelligence may lead to dismissal of proceedings 
altogether and the frustration of otherwise legitimate prosecutions. These practices can be 
detrimental to human rights and the rule of law, including the right to fair trial for the 
accused, as well as to the effective prosecution of individuals suspected of terrorist activity.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The reaffirmation by the General Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy is a clear re-endorsement by all Member States that respect for human rights 
for all and the rule of law are the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism, and 
that human rights and countering terrorism are mutually reinforcing goals. There can 
be no security without human rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>42. <b>My Office is committed to its continued contribution to the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force, which plays a crucial role in facilitating and promoting 
coordination and coherence in the implementation of the Global Strategy at the 
national, regional and global levels. I urge the Task Force, its working groups and its 
initiatives to incorporate a human rights approach and address human rights issues 
and concerns in all aspects of their work, in line with the approach mandated by 
Member States participating in the Global Strategy, and to ensure that the assistance 
provided by the Task Force to respond to terrorism is both effective and sustainable. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The activities of civil society are vital for increasing awareness about the threats 
of terrorism and more effectively tackling them, and for ensuring respect for human 
rights and the rule of law. I encourage the Task Force as a whole, including under the 
leadership of the working group on protecting human rights while countering 
terrorism, to step up its engagement with civil society, NGOs and human rights 
defenders. Such engagement can inform any assistance provided by the Task Force

<p>  
 29 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism (A/HRC/14/46). 
 30 The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism has noted with concern that in different courts &#8220;the line between [] 
strategic intelligence and probative evidence has become blurred to the advantage of different forms 
of &#8216;national security imperatives&#8217;&#8221; and stressed that &#8220;[j]udicial approval for a special investigative 
technique must be given in order to make permissible the use of the fruits of the technique as evidence 
in court&#8221; (A/HRC/10/3, para. 29). He further notes that intelligence collected for use in depriving an 
individual of his or her liberty must be converted into evidence which can be subject to challenge by 
the accused in a criminal proceeding (ibid., para. 37). </p>


<p><b>and its working groups, and lead to a response that is both effective and compliant 
with international human rights law.</b> 
</p>
<p>44. <b>I commend the renewed commitment of the Security Council to: ensuring that 
measures for countering terrorism are adopted in compliance with international law; 
supporting the Global Strategy; and improving the 1267 sanctions regime through 
procedural reforms. I urge the Council to continue to explore every avenue of 
possibility in order to ensure that sanctions imposed against individuals and entities 
are accompanied by rigorous procedural safeguards which guarantee minimum due 
process standards, for both listing and de-listing decisions. This should include 
ensuring full support to the Office of the Ombudsperson, as well as monitoring and 
reviewing its practices as necessary, while developing additional mechanisms to 
enhance due process protections for listing and de-listing procedures. It should also 
include the establishment of an independent, quasi-judicial procedure for review of 
listing and de-listing decisions. At the national level, Member States must ensure that 
implementation is done in a manner consistent with their international human rights 
obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>Effective criminal justice systems based on respect for human rights and the 
rule of law, including due process guarantees, continue to be the best means for 
effectively countering terrorism and ensuring accountability. In line with the Global 
Strategy, States should make every effort to develop and maintain an effective and 
rule of law-based national criminal justice system and ensure that individuals 
suspected of terrorist activity are brought to justice in line with due process 
guarantees, including the right to a fair trial, in compliance with international human 
rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The use of accurate intelligence is indispensible to preventing terrorist acts and 
bringing individuals suspected of terrorist activity to justice. However, the collection 
and use of intelligence must include due process safeguards necessary to protect 
against abuses and ensure accountability. The challenges to human rights posed by the 
increased reliance by States on intelligence, including the abuse of the State secrecy 
doctrine in the context of legal proceedings, the use in legal proceedings of evidence 
obtained by illegal means, whether at home or abroad, and the use of secret evidence, 
all require greater attention by the international community. In the meantime States 
must ensure that regulatory frameworks are in place to guarantee compliance with 
international human rights law, both domestically and through intelligence 
cooperation with other States.
