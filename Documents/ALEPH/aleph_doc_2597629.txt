Commentary on Results
Background
On 21 April 2015, the Company completed its legal acquisition of 100% of shares in Stellar Group Companies (“Stellar Films Group Pty Ltd
and Stellar Films (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd”). The acquisition was treated as a “reverse acquisition” in accordance with AASB 3 “Business
Combinations” whereby Stellar was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the consolidated Group.
Accordingly, within the financial statements and for analysis of the above results, it should be noted that the comparatives information in the
preliminary consolidated statement of Profit or Loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2015 represent results of
Stellar Group Companies for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 (representing 12 months trading) and the results of Cardia Bioplastics
Limited (“Cardia) for the period 22 April 2015 to 30 June 2015 (representing 2 months and 8 days trading).
For the year ended 30 June 2016, the financial statements and above results present the activities of the merged group for full 12 months
period to June 2016.

Revenue
Revenue for the current reporting period has increased by 19.90% to $21,532,187 as compared to revenue of previous corresponding period.

June 2016 as compared to 2.5 months of Cardia’s revenues included in the corresponding previous period.
Loss Position

APPENDIX 4E
Revenue
Revenues from ordinary activities on a “like for like” basis (including Cardia‘s revenues for the previous corresponding period) has decreased
by 13.12% or $3,252,808.
Sales generated by the Group during the current reporting period were lower than that of the previous corresponding period. Detailed analysis
indicates that, in part, the lower sales resulted from a strategic re-positioning of Cardia and Stellar’s business operations which included:


Closure of Cardia’s Brazilian operation. Cardia Brazil’s sales were $387,611 in the previous corresponding period reducing to NIL in the
current reporting period.
Reduction in government sales by Cardia Nanjing, again, as part of Cardia’s strategy to replace low margin business with Cardia’s
strategically focused sustainable waste diversion products.
Other contributing factors to lower sales generated in the current reporting period include:


Reduction of other low contribution customer sales to improve the Group’s gross margin performance.
Supply of below specification polymer to Stellar Malaysia’s plant resulted in a slowing of production which, in turn, impacted on sales
performance.
Loss from continuing operations
Loss position on a like for like basis (including Cardia Bioplastics’ results for the previous corresponding period) has improved by 15.12% or
$821,439
The reduced level of trading losses is attributable to the following:



Improved gross profit margin (from 3.44% to 6.72%) resulting from the Group’s focus on achieving greater production efficiency, and
favourable foreign exchange management and lower polymer prices.
The result for the current reporting period has also improved due to cost reductions resulting from the restructure of Stellar Australia’s
operations.
Reduction in abnormal costs such as merger transactions and impairment costs.

controlled entities (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Company’s interest in associates and joint venture entities.
SECOS Group Limited is a listed public company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The Company is for-profit entity for accounting

NOTE 2- BASIS OF PREPARATION
Reporting Basis and Conventions
The preliminary final report has been prepared on an accruals basis and are based on historical costs modified by the revaluation of selected
non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value basis of accounting has been applied.
On 21 April 2015, the Company completed its legal acquisition of 100% of shares in Stellar Group Companies. The acquisition was treated as
a “reverse acquisition” in accordance with AASB 3 ”Business Combinations” whereby Stellar was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of
the consolidated Group.
Accordingly, within the financial statements and for analysis of the above results, it should be noted that the comparative information in the
preliminary consolidated statement of Profit or Loss and other comprehensive income and preliminary consolidated statement of cash flows
for the year ended 30 June 2015 represent results of Stellar for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 and the results of Cardia for the
period 22 April 2015 to 30 June 2015. For the year ended 30 June 2016, the financial statements and above results present the activities of
the merged group for full 12 months period to June 2016.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency of each of the group’s entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that
entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which is the parent entity’s functional and
presentation currency.

NOTES TO THE PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 10 OPERATING SEGMENTS
Segment Information
Operating segments are premised on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors in assessing performance and
determining the allocation of resources.
The Group is managed primarily on the basis of product category and service offerings as the diversification of the Group’s operations
inherently have different risk profiles and performance assessment criteria. Operating segments are therefore determined on the same basis.
Reportable segments disclosed are based on aggregating operating segments where the segments are considered to have similar economic
characteristics and are also similar with respect to the following:
-the products sold and/or services provided by the segment;
-the manufacturing process;
-the distribution method; and
-any external regulatory requirements.
The following operating segments have been identified
(i)
(ii)
Manufacturing Division
Distribution Division
Types of products and services by segment
(i) Manufacturing Division
The manufacturing segment develops and manufactures sustainable resins derived from renewable resources for the global packaging
and plastic products industries and also manufactures high quality cast films for the personal care, hygiene, pet care and medical product
industries.
The Manufacturing segment, which includes the manufacturing units in China, Malaysia and Australia is responsible for distribution and
sales of products locally and overseas.
The manufacturing segment also sells products to the distribution segment.
(ii) Distribution Division
Distribution segment includes the Group’s cash generating unit that is designated to develop and distribute the Group’s strategic products
both locally and overseas.
Basis of accounting for purposes of reporting by operating segments
Accounting policies adopted
Unless stated otherwise, all amounts reported to the Board of Directors, are determined in accordance with accounting policies that are
consistent to those adopted in the annual financial statements of the Group.
Inter-segment transactions
An internally determined transfer price is set for all inter-segment sales. This price is based on what would be realised in the event the sale
was made to an external party at arm’s length. All such transactions are eliminated on consolidation of the group’s financial statements.
Inter-segment loans payable and receivable are initially recognised at the consideration received/to be received net of transaction costs. If
inter-segment loans receivable and payable are not on commercial terms, these are not adjusted to fair value based on market interest rates.
Corporate charges are allocated to reporting segments based on the segments’ overall performance of revenue generation within the Group.
The Board of Directors believes this is representative of likely consumption of head office expenditure that should be used in assessing
segment performance and cost recoveries.
Segment assets
Where an asset is used across multiple segments, the asset is allocated to that segment that receives majority economic value from that
asset. In the majority of instances, segment assets are clearly identifiable on the basis of their nature and physical location.
Segment liabilities
Liabilities are allocated to segments where there is a direct nexus between the incurrence of the liability and the operations of the segment.
Segment liabilities include trade and other payables.
