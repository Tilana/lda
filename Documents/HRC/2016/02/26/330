<p><b>  29</b>/&#8230;  <b>Situation of human rights in Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other relevant international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> resolution 91 and decisions 250/2002 and 275/2003 of the African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> its resolution 5/1, on institution-building of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
</p>
<p>Council, both of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or 
</p>
<p>her duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> its resolutions 20/20 of 6 July 2012, 23/21 of 14 June 2013 and 
</p>
<p>26/24 of 27 June 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Commending</i> the commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea for completing 
</p>
<p>its work in a transparent, impartial and consultative manner, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply regretting</i> the lack of cooperation by the Government of Eritrea with the 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Eritrea, including the lack of access to the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of the first-hand accounts of victims and witnesses who 
</p>
<p>delivered testimonies at the confidential interviews held by the commission and through 
</p>
<p>written submissions, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that everyone has the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs 
</p>
<p>of his or her country, directly or through freely chosen representatives, and expressing 
</p>

<p>grave concern that national elections in Eritrea have not been held since 1993 and that the 
</p>
<p>Constitution of 1997 has never been implemented, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating its deep concern</i> at the ongoing reports of grave violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights by the Eritrean authorities against their own population and fellow citizens, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at the commission&#8217;s findings that systematic, widespread 
</p>
<p>and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed by the Government 
</p>
<p>of Eritrea, and that the violations in the areas of extrajudicial executions, torture and ill-
</p>
<p>treatment, including sexual violence and abuse, national service and forced labour may 
</p>
<p>constitute crimes against humanity, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with grave concern</i> the continued use by the Government of Eritrea of 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrest and detention, including incommunicado detention and in life-threatening 
</p>
<p>conditions, of persons for suspected of evasion of national service, attempting to flee the 
</p>
<p>country or having a family member who has fled, inability to produce identity documents, 
</p>
<p>being a journalist, exercising the right to freedom of religion, being perceived as critical of 
</p>
<p>the Government, and of those who return to the country, as well as those detained in the 
</p>
<p>aftermath of the takeover on 21 January 2013 of the building housing the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Information, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at the widespread use of indefinite conscription into 
</p>
<p>national service, a system that constitutes forced labour, and the reported forced 
</p>
<p>conscription of children under the age of 18 into military service, and regretting that the 
</p>
<p>fear and experience of a lengthy national service causes large numbers of Eritreans to leave 
</p>
<p>the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern also</i> at reports that the Government of Eritrea is also 
</p>
<p>forcing persons to participate in its citizen militia, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that the situation of human rights in Eritrea incites an ever-
</p>
<p>increasing number of Eritreans to leave their country, often facing risks of abduction, 
</p>
<p>abhorrent physical and mental abuse and other ill-treatment on their migration path, abused 
</p>
<p>by smugglers and human traffickers, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his or her 
</p>
<p>own, and to return to his or her country, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the participation of Eritrea in the second cycle of the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review as well as its approval of several recommendations, while regretting the lack of 
</p>
<p>implementation by Eritrea of the recommendations made at its first review, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the obligations of Eritrea under the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,

</p>
