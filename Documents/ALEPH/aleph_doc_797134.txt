CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
AND STRATEGY
 
The Company is a growth focused company that seeks to
acquire gold purchase agreements (“Gold Streams”) from
companies that have advanced stage development projects or
operating mines. In return for making upfront payments to
acquire a Gold Stream, Sandstorm receives the right to
purchase, at a fixed price per ounce, a percentage of a mine’s
gold production for the life of the mine. Sandstorm helps other
companies in the resource industry grow their businesses, while
acquiring attractive assets in the process. The Company is
focused on acquiring Gold Streams from mines with low
production costs, significant exploration potential and strong
management teams. The Company currently has six Gold
Streams.
 
Effective February 17, 2011, the Company changed its name
from Sandstorm Resources Ltd. to Sandstorm Gold Ltd.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 03
AURIZONA GOLD STREAM
The Company has a Gold Stream agreement to purchase 17% of the life of mine gold produced from Luna Gold Corp.’s
(“Luna”) open-pit Aurizona mine, located in Brazil (the “Aurizona Mine”). On February 9, 2011, the Aurizona Mine reached full
commercial production.
Current activities at the Aurizona Mine include:
Gold production for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was approximately 4,800 ounces.
Gold production for November and December 2010 and January 2011 totaled 10,905 ounces.
Combined 90-day average throughput rate in excess of 3,615 tonnes per day, including peak daily throughputs as
high as 5,000 tonnes.
Additional plant modifications to be completed in early 2011 are expected to increase productive capacity.
Expected full production ramp-up to consistently produce an average of 4,500 tonnes per day capacity is scheduled
to begin April 2011.
Exploration activities have recently returned trenching results of 81.5 meters of 1.18g/t at Boa Esperanca in a newly
discovered mineralized area near the Aurizona Mine.
·
·
·
·
·
·
During 2010, the Company purchased approximately 2,017 ounces of gold from the Aurizona Mine.
SANTA ELENA GOLD STREAM
The Company has a Gold Stream agreement to purchase 20% of the life of mine gold produced from SilverCrest Mines
Inc.’s (“SilverCrest”) open-pit Santa Elena mine, located in Mexico (the “Santa Elena Mine”). During the fourth quarter of
2010, SilverCrest began production and commission phase activities at the Santa Elena Mine. Approximately 371,000
tonnes of lower grade ore were mined during 2010 from the open pit. SilverCrest has been mining lower grade tonnes to
provide working space for equipment in the initial cut and to create a lower angle for the ultimate pit high wall. The lower
grade material is considered pre-strip for the higher grade Main Zone which is currently being mined and will provide the
majority of the ore to be mined in 2011.
Current activities at the Santa Elena Mine include:
The crusher is operating at near design throughput capacity of approximately 2,500 tonnes per day with an estimated
336,500 tonnes of ore crushed in 2010.
The heap leach pad currently holds an estimated 336,500 tonnes of ore containing approximately 6,800 ounces of
gold that are under leach. In the first 30 days of the leach cycle for current ore on the pad, recovery was estimated
at 25% to 35% for gold.
The Merrill Crowe recovery unit, refinery and on-site lab are all performing as designed and expected.
As of December 31, 2010 approximately 2,140 ounces of gold have been produced as doré with a significant amount
of gold still in solution for processing and recovery.
·
·
·
·
During 2010, the Company purchased approximately 187 ounces of gold from the Santa Elena Mine.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 04
SUMMIT GOLD STREAM
The Company has a Gold Stream agreement to purchase 50% of the first 10,000 ounces of gold produced, and 22% of the
life of mine gold produced thereafter, from Santa Fe Gold Corporation’s (“Santa Fe”) Summit mine, located in the United
States of America (the “Summit Mine”).
In March 2010, Santa Fe began commissioning the Lordsburg milling operations. Since then, Santa Fe has begun shipping
concentrate to a European smelter for recovery of gold and silver. In addition to concentrate sales, bulk flux shipments have
been made to smelters located in Arizona. The Summit Mine and the Lordsburg Mill are expected to attain commercial
production during the second half of 2011. A new internal ventilation shaft was completed and is being equipped with an
upgraded fan system. This central ventilation shaft will be extended as deeper levels of the Summit Mine are reached. The
improved ventilation will allow the Summit Mine to operate additional equipment underground, which Santa Fe is purchasing.
It will also enable additional shifts to be added.
During 2010, the Company purchased approximately 118 ounces of gold from the Summit Mine.
MING GOLD STREAM
On March 4, 2010 and amended on August 31, 2010, the Company entered into a Gold Stream agreement to purchase
approximately 25% of the first 175,000 ounces of gold produced and 12% of the life of mine gold produced thereafter, from
Rambler Metals & Mining plc’s (“Rambler”) Ming mine, located in Canada (the “Ming Mine”). In the event that the
metallurgical recoveries of gold at the Ming Mine are below 85%, the percentage of gold that Sandstorm shall be entitled to
purchase shall be increased proportionally.
For consideration, the Company paid $5.0 million on March 10, 2010, $2.0 million on September 7, 2010, $7.0 million on
January 6, 2011 and a further instalment of $6.0 million will be paid to Rambler upon receipt of all necessary permits
required to construct and operate the Ming Mine, which is expected in the first half of 2011. The Company will not make
ongoing payments per ounce of gold.
Rambler has provided to the Company the following completion guarantees: (i) that the Ming Mine will begin gold production
by September 4, 2011 or Rambler will be required to fully refund the $20.0 million upfront deposit plus 8% interest,
compounded annually, (ii) that within 24 months of commencement of production, Rambler will have produced and sold a
minimum of 24,000 ounces of payable gold or the Company will have the option to require a partial refund of the upfront
deposits, and (iii) that the Company will receive minimum cash flows from the contract of $3.6 million in the first year of
production, $3.6 million in the second year of production, and $3.1 million in the third year of production.
The Ming Mine is a past-producing underground massive sulphide copper-gold mine located in Newfoundland and contains
the former producing Ming and Ming West copper-gold mines.
Current activities at the Ming Mine include:
·
·
·
The contractor has completed the Nugget Pond foundation for the mill add on.
Financing and delivery terms have been negotiated for all underground equipment and all major components for a
new concentrator.
New exploration development has begun to the top of the 1807 zone via the 1600 feet level. This new development
will also be used for ore access.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 05
Early construction permits have been received from the Department of Natural Resources for office/dry facility and
fresh water supply. Construction is well underway with all foundation work completed. The anticipated completion
date is March 2011.
Refurbishment of mine ventilation infrastructure has begun including replacement of the building and heating units.
·

BLACK FOX GOLD STREAM
On November 9, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Brigus Gold Stream”) to purchase 12% of the life of
mine gold produced from Brigus Gold Corp.’s (“Brigus”) open pit and underground Black Fox mine, located in Canada (the
“Black Fox Mine”) and 10% of the life of mine gold produced from Brigus’ Black Fox extension, which includes a portion of
Brigus’ Pike River concessions, for $56.3 million as an upfront payment plus ongoing per ounce payments equal to the
lesser of $500 (subject to an inflationary adjustment beginning in 2013, not to exceed 2% per annum) and the then prevailing
market price per ounce of gold.
Brigus has the option until January 1, 2013 to repurchase 50% of the Brigus Gold Stream by making a $36.6 million
payment to the Company, upon receipt of which, the percentage of gold the Company is entitled to purchase will decrease
to 6% for the Black Fox Mine and 4.5% for the Black Fox extension.
The Black Fox Mine is located outside of Matheson, Ontario, Canada in the Timmins Gold District and has been in
commercial production since May 2009. It is currently operating as an open pit mine, but since mid-2010, began
development of an underground mine which it expects to begin production in early 2011. At this time, both open pit and
underground operations are expected to run concurrently. Commercial production on the underground mine is expected
during the second quarter of 2011. The Black Fox mineralization is an Archean age, lode gold deposit located within the
Abitibi greenstone belt along with several other producing gold mines and gold camps. Exploration is ongoing with a drill
program being pursued at the mine.
Current activities at the Black Fox Mine include:
·
·
A NI 43-101 technical report on the Black Fox Mine was released January 6, 2011 and was based on mine
operations and reserves as of October 31, 2010. Estimates from the report for the Black Fox Mine include a mine life
of 8.6 years, a processing rate of 730,000 tonnes per annum with a recovery rate of 94%, average annual production
of 104,000 ounces of gold over the next five years of production, and indicated resources inclusive of reserves of
1,031,500 ounces of gold.
The new vent raise has been completed and the completion of the new portal is targeted for March 2011.
Construction and relocation of the new vent raise and portal continue to result in logistical issues that have
significantly restricted ore production from the open pit. During this transitional period the Black Fox Mill has
continued to operate at 2,000 tonnes per day by drawing down low-grade stockpiles held in inventory.
The Company did not purchase any gold from the Black Fox Mine in 2010.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 06
EQUITY FINANCING
On October 19, 2010, the Company completed a public offering of 78,768,100 units at a price of C$0.73 per unit for gross
proceeds of C$57.5 million ($55.8 million). Each unit was comprised of one common share of the Company and one-quarter
of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant is exercisable into one common share at a price of $1.00 until
October 19, 2015. The Company paid underwriter fees of C$4.0 million ($3.9 million) representing 7% of the gross proceeds.
The net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to purchase the Black Fox Gold Stream.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
BACHELOR LAKE GOLD STREAM
On January 17, 2011 the Company entered into a Gold Stream agreement with Metanor Resources Inc. (“Metanor”) to
purchase 20% of the life of mine gold produced from Metanor’s Bachelor Lake Gold Mine located in Quebec, Canada (the
“Bachelor Lake Mine”) for an upfront payment of $20.0 million plus ongoing per ounce payments equal to the lesser of $500
and the then prevailing market price per ounce of gold. Upon signing the Bachelor Lake Gold Stream Sandstorm made a
$5.0 million payment and will make further upfront payments of $9.0 million once Metanor has achieved certain funding
conditions and a final payment of $6.0 million on September 1, 2011. Metanor has provided a guarantee that Sandstorm will
receive a minimum of $20.0 million in pre-tax cash flow over the first six years of the Bachelor Lake Gold Stream.
The Bachelor Lake Mine is a greenstone hosted gold mine located outside of Val d’Or in Quebec, Canada. On January 4,
2011, Metanor released the findings from a pre-feasibility study at Bachelor Lake showing underground production of
approximately 200,000 ounces over an initial three and a half year mine life. Production is expected to begin during 2012
with a ramp up to full commercial production by the end of 2012.
The Bachelor Lake Mine is projected to produce an average of 60,000 ounces of gold per year and will be utilizing the low
cost, long-hole mining method along with an existing, and fully functional, operating mill and surface infrastructure.
SPIN-OUT OF SANDSTORM METALS & ENERGY
On May 13, 2010 Sandstorm transferred its option agreement on the Eagle Lake property owned by Eagle Plains Resources
Ltd. located in Saskatchewan, Canada and working capital of C$500,000 to its wholly-owned subsidiary Sandstorm Metals &
Energy Ltd. (“Sandstorm Metals & Energy”) in exchange for 6,836,810 common shares of Sandstorm Metals & Energy.
Sandstorm thereafter distributed all of its common shares held in Sandstorm Metals & Energy to Sandstorm shareholders.
As a result, Sandstorm Metals & Energy is no longer a subsidiary of Sandstorm. Sandstorm will focus on Gold Streams and
Sandstorm Metals & Energy will focus on base metal and energy streams.

SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 08
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Company earned $2.4 million of net income during the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to earnings from
operations of $1.9 million from the Company’s first gold sales from the Aurizona Mine, the Santa Elena Mine, and the
Summit Mine. The Company earned $1.0 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a foreign
exchange gain of $2.5 million from the Company holding a portion of its cash in Canadian dollars while the Canadian dollar
appreciated in value against the U.S. dollar, the Company’s functional currency. Offsetting this foreign exchange gain in
2009 were other expenses which comprised mainly of stock—based compensation of $0.5 million and general &
administration of $0.7 million. The Company did not have a significant level of activity prior to the acquisition of the Aurizona
Gold Stream and the Santa Elena Gold Stream in 2009, therefore the twelve months ended March 31, 2009 results are not
comparable to the subsequent financial years.

The quarter ended March 31, 2009 has been restated and translated from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars as the Company
changed its reporting currency to the U.S. dollar starting April 1, 2009.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 09
THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO THE THREE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010
The Company earned net income of $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to a net loss of
$0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the
Company earned $3.7 million of net income primarily due to earnings from operations of $1.6 million from the sale of 1,939
ounces of gold and a foreign exchange gain of $1.4 million from the Company holding a portion of its cash in Canadian
dollars while the Canadian dollar appreciated in value against the U.S. dollar, the Company’s functional currency. During the
three months ended September 30, 2010, the Company incurred a net loss of $0.2 million primarily due to lower earnings
from operations of $0.2 million from the sale of 257 ounces of gold as the Aurizona Mine, Santa Elena Mine, and Summit
Mine began initial production.
THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO REMAINING
QUARTERS
During the three months ended June 30, 2010, the Company incurred a net loss of $0.4 million primarily due to lower
earnings from operations of $0.1 million from the sale of 126 ounces of gold, compared to earnings from operations of $1.6
million, from the sale of 1,939 ounces of gold during the three months ended December 31, 2010. The Company did not
have any gold sales prior to the three months ended June 30, 2010. Therefore previous quarter results are not comparable to
the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and thereafter.
CHANGE IN TOTAL ASSETS
Total assets at December 31, 2010 increased primarily due to the equity financing completed on October 19, 2010 where net
proceeds of $51.4 million were raised. Total assets increased during the three months ended December 31, 2009, compared
to prior periods, due to the Company completing an equity financing on October 14, 2009 for net proceeds of $32.8 million.
In addition, total assets increased during the three months ended June 30, 2009 due to the Company completing an equity
financing on April 23, 2009 for net proceeds of $35.3 million.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company has included in this MD&A a non-GAAP performance measure of total cash costs. This non-GAAP measure
does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable with similar measures
provided by other companies. Cash costs are presented as they represent an industry standard method of comparing certain
costs on a per unit basis. The Company believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s
performance. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s total cash costs were
equivalent to the Company’s costs of sales in accordance with GAAP.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 10
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had cash of $28.5 million (December 31, 2009 - $36.7 million) and working capital
of $27.9 million (December 31, 2009 - $36.2 million). Cash decreased from December 31, 2009 due to Sandstorm making
payments of $7.0 million to Rambler and $56.3 million to Brigus as upfront payments in connection with their respective
Gold Streams, which was partially offset by Sand-storm completing an equity financing for net proceeds of $51.4 million.
Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company paid Rambler $7.0 million and paid Metanor $5.0 million for partial upfront
payments. Of the remaining working capital on hand, the Company has further upfront payment commitments to Rambler of
$6.0 million and to Metanor of $15.0 million which are due in 2011. The commitments will use up working capital on hand as
of December 31, 2010 and the Company plans on funding the remaining commitments using working capital generated
during 2011 from gold sales.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
In connection with the Aurizona Gold Stream, the Company has committed to purchase 17% of the life of mine gold
produced by the Aurizona Mine for a per ounce cash payment of the lesser of $400 (subject to a 1% annual inflationary
adjustment beginning on February 9, 2014) and the then prevailing market price of gold.
In connection with the Santa Elena Gold Stream, the Company has committed to purchase 20% of the life of mine gold
produced by the Santa Elena Mine for a per ounce cash payment of the lesser of $350 (subject to a 1% annual inflationary
adjustment beginning 3 years after the mine achieves commercial production (an “Inflationary Adjustment”)) and the then
prevailing market price of gold.
In connection with the Summit Gold Stream, the Company has committed to purchase 50% of the first 10,000 ounces of
gold produced, and 22% of the life of mine gold produced thereafter, by the Summit Mine for a per ounce cash payment of
the lesser of $400 (subject to an Inflationary Adjustment) and the then prevailing market price per ounce of gold.
In connection with the Ming Gold Stream, the Company has committed to make additional upfront payments totalling $13.0
million once certain funding conditions have been achieved. Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company paid Rambler
$7.0 million and is committed to make the remaining payment of $6.0 million once Rambler receives all necessary permits
required to construct and operate the Ming Mine. There are no ongoing per ounce payments in connection with this Gold
Stream.
In connection with the Brigus Gold Stream, the Company has committed to purchase 12% of the life of mine gold produced
by the Black Fox Mine for a per ounce cash payment of the lesser of $500 (subject to an inflationary adjustment beginning
in 2013, not to exceed 2% per annum) and the then prevailing market price of gold.

The Company issued 7,014,574 compensation warrants (the “Compensation Warrants”) to agents in 2009. Each
Compensation Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one unit comprised of one common share of the Company and one-half
of a share purchase warrant. Each Compensation Warrant has an exercise price of $0.33 and all of the Compensation
Warrants were outstanding as of March 3, 2011. Each whole share purchase warrant issued upon exercise of the
Compensation Warrants will entitle the holder to purchase one common share at a price of $0.60 until April 23, 2014.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During the year ended December 31, 2010 the Company incurred expenses of $202,864 for rent, office costs, and
administrative support services (nine months ended December 31, 2009 - $82,345) to a company controlled by a current
director, David DeWitt, and a former director, Marcel de Groot. The transactions have been recorded at their exchange
amount, which is the amount of consideration agreed upon by the related parties.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The fair
value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value due to their short-term maturity or capacity of prompt
liquidation.
CREDIT RISK
The Company’s credit risk is limited to cash and trade receivables held in the ordinary course of business. The Company
sells gold exclusively to large corporations with strong credit ratings and the balance of trade receivables owed the
Company in the ordinary course of business is not significant. Therefore, the Company is not exposed to significant credit
risk and overall, the Company’s credit risk has not changed significantly from the prior year.
CURRENCY RISK
The Company is exposed to the fluctuations of the Canadian to U.S. dollar as from time to time, it completes equity
financings denominated in the Canadian dollar and trades the Canadian dollar proceeds to the U.S. dollar. During the year
ended December 31, 2010, conversion of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar from equity financing resulted in a foreign
exchange gain of $1.4 million (nine months ended December 31, 2009 - $2.4 million). As of December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, the Company held an insignificant portion of its financial instruments in Canadian dollars and was not
exposed to significant currency risk.
OTHER RISKS
The Company is not subject to significant interest rate, liquidity, or other price risks and the Company’s exposure to these
risks has not changed significantly from the prior year.
RISKS TO SANDSTORM
The primary risk factors affecting the Company are set forth below. For additional discussion of risk factors, please refer to
the Company’s short-form prospectus dated October 13, 2010, which is available on www.sedar.com.
RISKS RELATING TO MINERAL PROJECTS
To the extent that they relate to the production of gold from, or the operation of, the Aurizona Mine, the Santa Elena Mine,
the Summit Mine, the Ming Mine, the Black Fox Mine, and the Bachelor Lake Mine (the “Mines”), the Company will be
subject to the risk factors applicable to the operators of such Mines.
NO CONTROL OVER MINING OPERATIONS
The Company has no contractual rights relating to the operation or development of the Mines. Except for any payments
which may be payable in accordance with applicable completion guarantees or cash flow guarantees, the Company will not
be entitled to any material compensation if these mining operations do not meet their forecasted gold production targets in
any specified period or if the Mines shut down or discontinue their operations on a temporary or permanent basis. The Mines
may not commence
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 13
commercial production within the time frames anticipated, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the gold production
from such properties will ultimately meet forecasts or targets. At any time, any of the operators of the Mines or their
successors may decide to suspend or discontinue operations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
The Mines are subject to various foreign laws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, development, production,
exports, taxes, labour standards, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, reclamation, historic and
cultural resources preservation, mine safety and occupation health, handling, storage and transportation of hazardous
substances and other matters. The costs of discovering, evaluating, planning, designing, developing, constructing, operating
and closing the Mines in compliance with such laws and regulations are significant. It is possible that the costs and delays
associated with compliance with such laws and regulations could become such that the owners or operators of the Mines
would not proceed with the development of or continue to operate the Mines. Moreover, it is possible that future regulatory
developments, such as increasingly strict environmental protection laws, regulations and enforcement policies thereunder,
and claims for damages to property and persons resulting from the Mines could result in substantial costs and liabilities in
the future.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
The Aurizona Mine is located in Brazil, the Santa Elena Mine is located in Mexico, the Summit Mine is located in the United
States of America, and each of the Ming Mine, the Black Fox Mine, and Bachelor Lake Mine is located in Canada and as
such the Mines are exposed to various levels of political, economic and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, terrorism, hostage taking, military repression, crime, political instability,
currency controls, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, labour unrest, the risks of war or
civil unrest, expropriation and nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits,
approvals and contracts, illegal mining, changes in taxation policies, restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation, and
changing political conditions, and governmental regulations. Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in
political attitude in Mexico, Brazil, the United States of America or Canada may adversely affect the operations or
profitability of the Mines in these countries. Operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with
respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income taxes,
expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of
local people, water use, mine safety and the rewarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to
employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws,
regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure, could result in loss, reduction or
expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners with carried or
other interests. The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an
adverse effect on the Mines.
INCOME TAXES
The Company has incorporated a subsidiary in Barbados, Sandstorm Gold (Barbados) Limited, which entered into Gold
Streams in connection with the Aurizona, Santa Elena, and Summit transactions. No assurance can be given that new
taxation rules will not be enacted or that existing rules will not be applied in a manner which could result in the Company’s
future profits being subject to taxation.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 14
COMMODITY PRICES
The price of the common shares, warrants, and the Company’s financial results may be significantly adversely affected by a
decline in the price of gold. The price of gold fluctuates widely, especially in recent years, and is affected by numerous
factors beyond the Company’s control, including but not limited to, the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and
financial institutions, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar
and foreign currencies, global and regional supply and demand, and the political and economic conditions of major gold-
producing countries throughout the world. In the event that the prevailing market price of gold is less than $500 per ounce
(subject to an inflationary adjustment beginning in 2013, not to exceed 2% per annum) in the case of the Brigus Gold
Stream, $500 per ounce in the case of the Bachelor Lake Gold Stream, $400 per ounce (subject to a 1% annual inflationary
adjustment beginning on February 9, 2014) in the case of the Aurizona Gold Stream, $400 per ounce (subject to an
Inflationary Adjustment) in the case of the Summit Gold Streams and $350 per ounce (subject to an Inflationary Adjustment)
in the case of the Santa Elena Gold Stream, the purchase price will be the then prevailing market price per ounce of gold
and the Company will not generate positive cash flow or earnings on those Gold Streams.
CHANGE IN FUNCTIONAL AND REPORTING CURRENCY
Effective April 1, 2009, the Company changed from a Canadian dollar functional and reporting currency to a U.S. dollar
functional and reporting currency. All subsidiaries of the Company measure transactions in a U.S. dollar functional currency.
As a result, all comparative amounts were restated to the U.S. dollar. Comparative assets and liabilities were translated
using the closing rate at the balance sheet date and comparative equity, income, and expenses were translated at the
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. All resulting exchange differences were recognized in other comprehensive
loss.
The Company has elected to report its Canadian federal taxes using a U.S. dollar functional currency.
CHANGES IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES
In January 2009, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued Handbook Sections 1582 – Business
Combinations, 1601 – Consolidated Financial Statements, and 1602 – Non-Controlling Interests. Section 1582 replaces
Section 1581 – Business Combinations and establishes standards for the accounting for business combinations that is
equivalent to the business combination accounting standard under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
Sections 1601 and 1602 replace Section 1600 – Consolidated Financial Statements. Section 1601 provides revised
guidance on the preparation of consolidated financial statements and Section 1602 addresses accounting for non-controlling
interests in consolidated financial statements subsequent to a business combination.
These standards are effective January 1, 2011. Early adoption of the Sections is permitted however all three Sections must
be adopted at the same time.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 15
In June 2009, the CICA amended Handbook Section 3855 to clarify the application of the effective interest method after a
debt instrument has been impaired and when an embedded prepayment option is separated from its host debt instrument at
initial recognition for accounting purposes. The amendments are effective January 1, 2011. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company has elected to early adopt the above changes in accounting policies effective January 1, 2010. The early
adoption of these changes had no material impact on the Company.
FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company is required to adopt IFRS on January 1, 2011 which will require the restatement for comparative purposes of
amounts reported by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2010 and as of January 1, 2010.
To prepare for the conversion to IFRS, the following plan was developed:
A)          Phase 1: Scope and Plan
The Company has ongoing training for appropriate personnel on IFRS standards and an assessment on the impact of the
IFRS conversion on the Company’s opening financial position has been completed. This assessment identified three major
differences between the Company’s current accounting policies under GAAP and those the Company is required to apply
under IFRS as they exist at March 3, 2011. These differences are discussed below. IFRS standards may change prior to
the Company’s adoption of IFRS and this may impact the assessment. The Company does not anticipate any significant
changes to its information technology, internal controls over financial reporting, business activities, nor disclosure controls
and procedures from the conversion to IFRS. The Company will review and update the IFRS conversion plan as required.
B)        Phase 2: Design and Build
Based on a detailed review of IFRS standards, the Company has made selections of accounting policies and procedures
where a choice was available, has quantified the impact on key line items and disclosures, and prepared draft financial
statements under IFRS. IFRS standards may change prior to the Company’s adoption of IFRS and this may impact the
selection of accounting policies and draft disclosures.
C)        Phase 3: Implement and Review
The Company will implement new accounting policies under IFRS and prepare and report consolidated financial statements
under IFRS.
The Company has achieved its milestones to date under its IFRS conversion plan. The Company will continue to monitor
and report on its conversion to IFRS according to its conversion plan.
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 16
Major Identified Differences:
A)          Share purchase warrants with an exercise price denominated in Canadian dollars
Under GAAP, warrants are accounted for at their carrying value within shareholders’ equity. Under IFRS, warrants that have
an exercise price denominated in a currency other than the Company’s functional currency meet the definition of a derivative
liability and are recorded as a financial liability and are marked-to-market each period. The warrants issued in the April 2008
private placement (the “April 2008 Warrants”) have an exercise price denominated in Canadian dollars, which was the
Company’s functional currency when these warrants were issued. Effective April 1, 2009, the Company changed its
functional currency from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar, and in accordance with IFRS, the April 2008 Warrants
ceased to meet the definition of an equity instrument and will be recorded at fair value as a derivative liability, with the
difference between the fair value and the carrying value, upon transition, being recognized in equity. Subsequent changes in
the fair value of the April 2008 Warrants will be recognized as gains or losses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
(Loss) until they were fully exercised by April 2010.
The Company will rely on the exemption for first-time adoption of IFRS under IFRS 1: First-time adoption of IFRS not to
recognize any financial liabilities resulting from its warrants issued prior to January 1, 2010 with an exercise price
denominated in Canadian dollar, which differs from its functional currency, which were all derecognized through exercises
prior to January 1, 2010.
B)        Recognition of previous financing costs as a future income tax asset
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized a future income tax asset for financing costs incurred
prior to 2010. Prior to 2010, the Company applied a full valuation allowance against these future income tax benefits. Under
GAAP, the impact of recognizing a future income tax asset related to financing costs is recognized in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income (Loss), however, under IFRS, the recognition of such future income tax benefit is offset against
financing costs in the Statement of Shareholders’ Equity. This difference will result in a reclassification of $0.9 million from
retained earnings (deficit) to share capital as of December 31, 2010 and an adjustment of $0.9 million from comprehensive
income (loss) to share capital for the year ended December 31, 2010.
C)        Impairment of mineral interests
Under GAAP, the Company tests its mineral interests for impairment by first testing for recoverability by comparing the
carrying value of each Gold Stream to the undiscounted future cash flows. Under IFRS, the Company must compare the
carrying amount to the higher of the fair value (less costs to sell) and the value in use. Fair value is computed using
discounted future cash flows. While the change in impairment testing will not have an impact on the Company’s opening
financial position at January 1, 2010 or at December 31, 2010, it is a significant change in accounting policy. This difference
could lead to volatility of earnings in future periods.

30.          Minimum mining width of 2 metres.
For the Ming Mine:
31.          Ming Mineral Reserves are fully included in the Mineral Resources.
32.          Ming Reserves and Resources are reported as of August 9, 2010.
33.          The mineral reserves have been reviewed and verified by George Darling, P.Eng., who is a qualified person under NI
43-101.
34.          The mineral resource estimates have been reviewed and verified by Dave Barbour, P.Geo., who is a qualified
person under NI 43-101.
35.          No inferred material is included in the reserve tabulation.
36.          An underground cut-off was set at $70 per tonne for all longhole mining methods.
37.          Cut-off reserves are based on 15% dilution, 90% mining recovery, copper recovery of 92.4%, and gold recovery of
66.4%.
38.          Cut-off grades of 1.0 per cent copper for the massive sulphides, 1.25 grams per tonne of gold for the 1806 zone,
and 1.25 per cent copper for the stringer sulphides.
39.          Mineral resources are estimated using long-term prices of $2.50 per pound of copper, $1,000 per ounce of gold, and
$15 per ounce of silver. Zinc does not contribute to the revenues.
40.          Numbers have been rounded,
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 21
For the Black Fox Mine:
41.          Black Fox Mineral Reserves are fully included in the Mineral Resources.
42.          Black Fox Reserves and Resources are reported as of October 31, 2010.
43.          The mineral reserves and resources have been reviewed and verified by Tim Maunula, P. Geo., who is a qualified
person under NI 43-101.
44.          Cut-off grade for the open-pit reserves and resources is 0.88 g/t Au.
45.          Cut-off grade for the underground reserves and resources is 2.54 g/t Au.
46.          Metal prices used for initial cut-off calculations are $1,150 per ounce for 88% of the gold sold and $500 per ounce of
gold sold through the Black Fox Gold Stream.
47.          The estimated underground reserves include 10% unplanned dilution at 0 g/t from the backfill and 15% planned
dilution at 1 g/t from the walls for a total dilution of 25%. The estimated open pit reserves include 30% dilution at 0 g/t and a
95% mining recovery factor for both. The higher average gold grades for the open pit and underground in the Indicated
Resources compared to the Probable Reserves are the result of no dilution being applied to Indicated Resources.
48.          The mineral resources were estimated using the ordinary kriging method.
49.          The mineral reserves were estimated from the life of mine plan, which defined sustaining capital requirements and
mine operating costs, to demonstrate that these reserves can be economically extracted and processed. Mining losses and
dilution were determined based on sub-surface geotechnical conditions, the mining method and equipment capabilities for
each area of the mine.
50.          Contained metal in estimated reserves remains subject to metallurgical recovery losses.
For the Bachelor Lake Mine:
51.          Bachelor Lake Mineral Reserves are fully included in the Mineral Resources.
52.          Bachelor Lake Reserves and Resources are reported as of December, 2010.
53.          The mineral reserves and resources have been reviewed and verified by Pascal Hamelin, P. Eng., Ing, who is a
qualified person under NI 43-101.
54.          The underground mineral reserves have been calculated using a cut-off grade of 3.43 g/t, recovery of 90%, and
dilution of 10% in the stoping areas.
CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE REGARDING RESERVES AND RESOURCES
For further details regarding the Aurizona Mine, the Ming Mine, the Black Fox Mine, or the Bachelor Lake Mine, refer to the
NI 43-101 Technical Reports, available under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com. For further details regarding the
Santa Elena Project, refer to the Pre-Feasibility Study and the Technical Report for the Santa Elena Project, available under
the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated
economic viability.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Shareholders of Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (formerly Sandstorm Resources Ltd.)
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (formerly Sandstorm
Resources Ltd.), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2010, and the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audit is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.
Opinion
SANDSTORM GOLD LTD. | 24
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (formerly Sandstorm Resources Ltd.) as at December 31, 2010 and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
Other matter
The consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2009 and the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the nine months then ended were audited by another auditor
who issued an unmodified opinion on February 9, 2010.

[Formerly Sandstorm Resources Ltd.]
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS
1.     NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (“Sandstorm” or “the Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act of British
Columbia on March 23, 2007 under the name Sandstorm Resources Ltd. Effective February 17, 2011, the Company
changed its name to Sandstorm Gold Ltd. The Company is a resource based company that seeks to acquire gold streams
(“Gold Streams”) from companies that have advanced stage development projects or operating mines. In return for making
upfront payments to acquire a Gold Stream, Sandstorm receives the right to purchase, at a fixed price per ounce, a
percentage of a mine’s gold production for the life of the mine.
The head office, principal address and registered office of the Company are located at Suite 1050, 625 Howe Street,
Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 2T6.
2.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A)      BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”).
The Company changed its fiscal year-end date to be December 31, resulting in a nine-month transition year from April 1,
2009 to December 31, 2009. The Company’s reporting currency has been changed effective April 1, 2009 from the Canadian
dollar to the U.S. dollar.
B)        PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries Sandstorm
Gold (Barbados) Limited, Sandstorm Gold (Canada) Ltd, Sandstorm Gold (Canada) Holdings Ltd., and Sandstorm Gold (US)
Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
C)        USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes to the
financial statements. Significant areas where management’s judgment is applied are future income taxes and the
recognition, impairment, and depletion expense of mineral interests, and the allocation between depletable and non-
depletable mineral interests. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
D)        FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The reporting and the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar as this is the principal
currency of the economic environment in which they operate. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
functional currency rate at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated using the functional currency rate as at the reporting date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS
E)            FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. All
financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and designated as follows:
Cash is classified as “Held-for-Trading”. Receivables are classified as “Loans and Receivables”. Due to their short-term
nature and capacity for prompt liquidation, their fair value equals their carrying value. Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities are classified as “Other Financial Liabilities”. These financial liabilities are recorded at values that approximate their
amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All gains and losses as a result of changes in fair value of held-for-trading assets are included in net income in the year they
occur.
F)             MINERAL INTERESTS
Agreements for which settlements are called for in gold, the amount of which is based on production at the mines, are
recorded at cost. The cost of these assets is separately allocated to reserves, resources, and exploration potential. The
value allocated to reserves is classified as depletable and is depreciated on a unit-of-delivered basis over the estimated
recoverable proven and probable reserves at the mine corresponding to the specific agreement. The value associated with
resources and exploration potential is the value beyond proven and probable reserves at acquisition and is classified as non-
depletable until such time as it is transferred to the depletable category as a result of the conversion of resources or
exploration potential into reserves.
Evaluation of the carrying values of each mineral interest agreement are undertaken each year and when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable to determine if estimated undiscounted future net
cash flows are less than the carrying value. Estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are calculated using estimated
production, sales prices, and purchase costs. If it is determined that the future net cash flows from an operation are less
than the carrying value then a write-down is recorded with a charge to operations.
Exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
G)          INCOME TAXES
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The liability method is used for determining future income taxes. Under the liability method, the change in the net future
income tax asset or liability is included in income. The income tax effects of differences in accordance with Company
accounting practices, and the periods they

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS
are recognized for income tax purposes, as well as the benefit of losses available to be carried forward to future years, are
reflected as future income tax assets or liabilities. Future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
substantively enacted statutory income tax rates which are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded against any future tax
asset if it is not more likely than not to be realized.
H)           SHARE CAPITAL
The proceeds from the issue of units are allocated between common shares and common share purchase warrants on a pro-
rata basis based on relative fair values. The fair value of common shares is based on the market closing price on the date
the units are issued and the fair value of common share purchase warrants is determined using the quoted market price or if
the warrants are not traded, the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Equity instruments issued to agents as financing costs are measured at their fair value at the date of grant.
I)                  REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from the sale of precious metals is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk
passes to the buyer, collection is reasonably assured and the price is reasonably determinable. Revenue from the sale of
gold may be subject to adjustment upon final settlement of estimated metal prices, weights, and assays. Adjustments to
revenue from metal prices are recorded monthly and other adjustments are recorded on final settlement.
J)              EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using
the treasury method which assumes that outstanding share purchase options and warrants, with an average market price
that exceeds the average exercise prices of the options and warrants for the period, are exercised and the proceeds are
used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the common shares for the period.
K)           STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
All stock-based awards are measured and recognized at their fair value determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. For employees, the fair value of the options is measured at the date of the grant. For non-employees, the fair value
of the options is measured on the earlier of the date at which the counterparty performance is complete, the date the
performance commitment is reached, or the date at which the equity instruments are granted if they are fully vested and
non-forfeitable. For employees and non-employees, the fair value of options is accrued and charged to operations on a
graded basis over the vesting period with the offsetting credit to contributed surplus. If and when the stock options are
ultimately exercised, the applicable amounts of contributed surplus are transferred to share capital.

Forfeitures are estimated at grant date and revised for actual experiences in subsequent periods. No expense is recognized
for awards that do not ultimately vest.
L)             CHANGES IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
In January 2009, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued Handbook Sections 1582 – Business
Combinations, 1601 – Consolidated Financial Statements, and 1602 – Non-Controlling Interests. Section 1582 replaces
Section 1581 – Business Combinations and establishes standards for the accounting for business combinations that is
equivalent to the business combination accounting standard under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
Sections 1601 and 1602 replace Section 1600 – Consolidated Financial Statements. Section 1601 provides revised
guidance on the preparation of consolidated financial statements and Section 1602 addresses accounting for non-controlling
interests in consolidated financial statements subsequent to a business combination.
These standards are effective January 1, 2011. Early adoption of the Sections is permitted but all three Sections must be
adopted at the same time.
In June 2009, the CICA amended Handbook Section 3855 to clarify the application of the effective interest method after a
debt instrument has been impaired and when an embedded prepayment option is separated from its host debt instrument at
initial recognition for accounting purposes. The amendments are effective January 1, 2011. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company has elected to early adopt the above changes in accounting policies effective January 1, 2010. The early
adoption of these changes had no material impact on the Company.
3.   FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company is required to adopt IFRS on January 1, 2011 which will require the restatement for comparative purposes of
amounts reported by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2010 and as of January 1, 2010.
4.   CHANGE IN FUNCTIONAL AND REPORTING CURRENCY
Effective April 1, 2009, the Company changed from a Canadian dollar functional and reporting currency to a U.S. dollar
functional and reporting currency. All subsidiaries of the Company measure transactions in a U.S. dollar functional currency.
As a result, all comparative amounts were restated to the U.S. dollar. Comparative assets and liabilities were translated
using the closing rate at the balance sheet date and comparative equity, income, and expenses were translated at the
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. All resulting exchange differences were recognized in other comprehensive
loss.

5.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
The fair value hierarchy established by amended CICA Handbook Section 3862, Financial Instruments – Disclosures,
establishes three levels to classify the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or
inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilities.
Level 3 – Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to fair value measurement and
unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
As at December 31, 2010, cash was classified under Level 1.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objective of capital management is to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern and identify,
evaluate, and acquire Gold Streams. The capital of the Company consists of shareholders’ equity. The Company is meeting
its capital risk objectives by raising, from time to time, the required funds. The Company expects to continue to raise funds
to continue meeting its capital management objectives. The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital
requirements.
CREDIT RISK
The Company credit risk is limited to cash and trade receivables held in the ordinary course of business. The Company
sells gold exclusively to large corporations with strong credit ratings and the balance of trade receivables owed the
Company in the ordinary course of business is not significant. Therefore, the Company is not exposed to significant credit
risk and overall, the Company’s credit risk has not changed significantly from the prior year.
CURRENCY RISK
The Company is exposed to the fluctuations of the Canadian to U.S. dollar as from time to time, it completes equity
financings denominated in the Canadian dollar and trades the Canadian dollar proceeds to the U.S. dollar. During the year
ended December 31, 2010, conversion of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar from equity financing resulted in a foreign
exchange gain of $1.4 million (nine months ended December 31, 2009 - $2.4 million). As of December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, the Company held an insignificant portion of its financial instruments in Canadian dollars and was not
exposed to significant currency risk.

B)                 STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has an incentive stock option plan (the “Option Plan”) whereby the Company may grant stock options to
eligible employees, officers, directors and consultants at an exercise price, expiry date, and vesting conditions to be
determined by the board of directors. The maximum expiry date is five years from the grant date. All options are equity
settled. The Option Plan provides for the issuance of up to 10% of the Company’s issued common shares as at the date of
the grant.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company granted 6,980,000 (2009 — 5,320,000) options to employees with
a weighted average exercise price of C$0.68 (2009 — C$0.44) per option. The options vest over a weighted average period
of 1.5 years with a fair value of $1.5 million (2009 - $0.7 million with vesting over 2.0 years). The weighted-average grant-
date fair value per employee option of $0.22 (2009 - $0.11) was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model
