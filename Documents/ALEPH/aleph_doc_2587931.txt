Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a.
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and follow the same accounting policies applied and
disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, with the exception of accounting
policies described below. Accordingly, these condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, as they do not include all the information and
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in Canada for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of
these condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been included. Operating results for the three and six months periods ending
June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2013. For further
information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended
December 31, 2012.
Changes in Accounting Policies
The Company adopted the following new accounting standards along with any consequential amendments, effective January 1, 2013:
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The adoption of IFRS 10 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: The adoption of IFRS 11 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: The adoption of IFRS 12 will require additional disclosures at year end that did not
impact the Company’s interim consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: The adoption of IFRS 13 requires additional disclosures relating to the measurement of fair values that
the Company has now included in Note 6.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: The adoption of IAS 1 requires additional disclosures relating to the measurement of fair
values that did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendment: The adoption of IAS 19 amendment did not have a significant impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

Pan American Silver Corp.
Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine: The Company’s policy on capitalization of stripping costs was
already consistent with IFRIC 20, so the adoption of IFRIC 20 had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
b. Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is intended to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety and some of
the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, including added disclosure about investments in equity instruments measured
at fair value in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”), and guidance on financial liabilities and derecognition of financial instruments. In
December 2011, the IASB issued an amendment that adjusted the mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 from January 1, 2013 to January 1,
2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the final standard is expected to have on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 21 Levies (“IFRIC 21”) is an interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (“IAS 37”), on the
accounting for levies imposed by governments. In IAS 37, the criterion for recognizing a liability includes the requirement for an entity to have
a present obligation resulting from a past event. IFRIC 21 provides clarification on the past event that gives rise to the obligation to pay a levy
as the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods commencing
on or after January 1, 2014. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the final interpretation is expected to have on its consolidated
financial statements.

3.Acquisition and Divesture
a)
Acquisition of Minefinders Corporation Ltd.
On March 30, 2012, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Minefinders Corporation Ltd. (“Minefinders”)
for total consideration amounting to $1,264.3 million, comprising $1,088.1 million in common shares of Pan American, $165.4 million in cash,
and $10.7 million in replacement options. Minefinders was engaged in precious metals mining and had exploration properties in Mexico and
the United States. Minefinders’ primary mining property was its 100% owned Dolores gold and silver mine located in Chihuahua, Mexico.
The acquisition was aligned with management’s objectives of enhanced operating and development portfolio diversification and its mission to
be the largest low-cost primary silver mining company worldwide. The Company believes that the strategic benefits to shareholders resulting
from the acquisition include: (i) enhanced portfolio diversification of producing assets into a more stable mining jurisdiction, (ii) additional
near-term cash flow, (iii) improved organic growth opportunities, (iv) a meaningful reduction of average silver cash costs across the
Company’s production portfolio, (v) addition of significant silver and gold mineral reserves and resources with excellent potential to increase
even further through exploration; and (vi) increases in the Company’s exposure to the prices of silver and gold. The transaction was
accounted for as a business combination with Pan American as the acquirer.

Pan American Silver Corp.
Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
Under the terms of the arrangement, former Minefinders shareholders who elected the full proration option received $1.84 Canadian (“CAD”)
and 0.55 of a Pan American share in respect of each of their Minefinders shares. Former Minefinders shareholders who elected the Pan
American share option received 0.6235 Pan American shares and CAD$0.0001 for each of their Minefinders shares, and those who elected
the cash option received CAD$2.0306 and 0.5423 of a Pan American share in respect of each of their shares.
Pan American exchanged and replaced all outstanding options at an exchange ratio of 0.6325 and at a strike price equivalent to the original
strike prices divided by 0.6325. Pan American share value utilized for valuing the consideration of shares issued was the closing price on
March 30, 2012, the effective date of the transaction. Replacement options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Assumptions used were as follows:

The purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition. Fair values were determined using the income, cost and market price valuation methods as deemed appropriate. The
purchase price allocation was finalized during the quarter ended March 31, 2013, with the assistance of an independent third party, resulting
in adjustments to the preliminary allocations. These adjustments resulted in a $10.7 million increase in fair value allocated to mineral interests
as compared to the preliminary fair value. Retrospective application of the changes made to the allocation of the purchase consideration in
the 2013 first quarter decreased net earnings as of December 31, 2012 by $9.2 million, due to an increase in cost of sales, reduced by
depreciation and income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Goodwill has been recognized as a result of the requirement to record a deferred tax liability for the difference between the fair values of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. None of the goodwill is deductible for
tax purposes.
The following tables summarize the final purchase consideration, the preliminary purchase price allocation reported in the Company’s 2012
year-end financial statements and the final purchase price allocation, with the applicable recast adjustments made upon finalization during
the 2013 first quarter.

b) Dispositions of mineral property, plant and equipment
On January 30, 2013, a subsidiary of the Company (Plata Panamericana S.A. de C.V.) entered into a sale and option agreement with
Compañía Minera Cuzcatlan SA de C.V. (“Cuzcatlan”) to sell 55% of its interest in certain Mexican exploration properties to Cuzcatlan for
$4.0 million. The Company also granted Cuzcatlan the option to acquire the remaining 45% interest in the exploration properties for $6.0
million (of which $2.0 million was paid to a third party according to a prior unrelated agreement), within ten days of Cuzcatlan making a
production decision. The option was exercised during the second quarter of 2013. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, there
was a gain on sale of assets of $4.0 million and $8.0 million, respectively related to the disposition of the above interest in exploration
properties.
4.Termination of Agreement with Esperanza Resources Corp.
The Company entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) dated February 24, 2013 with Esperanza Resources Corp. (the “Purchaser”) to transfer
certain non-core gold assets (the “Assets”) of the Company comprised of the La Bolsa gold project in Sonora, Mexico, the Pico Machay gold
project in Huancavelica, Peru and the Calcatreu gold project in Rio Negro, Argentina.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2013, several factors resulted in the Company concluding that the conditions required to complete the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and Subscription Agreement, dated May 27, 2013, (the “Agreement”) had not been
met.
At June 30, 2013, the Company reversed the derivative liability related to the obligations under the LOI and Agreement to purchase 20.6
million common shares of Esperanza at CAD $1.70 per share or CAD$35.0 million (US$34.5 million) which resulted in a loss of $13.5 million
at March 31, 2013, and as a result of the reversal the Company recorded a gain of $13.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2013.
The Company also determined that it will retain the exploration assets, subject to further strategic assessment, and therefore at June 30,
2013, the non-current Assets were no longer classified as held for sale and $3.4 million of impairment charge recorded during the first quarter
of 2013 was reversed at June 30, 2013.

Subsequently, on July 12, 2013, Esperanza entered into a definitive agreement with another mining company to sell all of its issued and
common shares by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement.
5.Management of Capital
The Company’s objective when managing its capital is to maintain its ability to continue as a going concern while at the same time
maximizing growth of its business and providing returns to its shareholders. The Company’s capital structure consists of equity, comprised of
issued capital plus share option reserve plus investment revaluation reserve plus retained earnings with a balance of $2.5 billion as at June
30, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - $2.7 billion). The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on changes to its
economic environment and the risk characteristics of the Company’s assets. The Company’s capital requirements are effectively managed
based on the Company having a thorough reporting, planning and forecasting process to help identify the funds required to ensure the
Company is able to meet its operating and growth objectives.
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements and the Company’s overall strategy with respect to capital risk
management remains unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2012.

c)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
(i)Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities recognized in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement and, therefore, cannot be determined
with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the
degree to which the fair value is observable. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;
Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability; and

Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no observable market data).
At June 30, 2013, the levels in the fair value hierarchy into which the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured and recognized
on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized as follows:

There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.
At June 30, 2013, there were no financial assets or liabilities measured and recognized in the condensed interim consolidated income
statements at a fair value that would be categorized as a level 3 in the fair value hierarchy above (December 31, 2012 - $nil).
(ii)Valuation Techniques
Short-term investments
The Company’s short-term investments and other investments are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are
classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The fair value of
investment securities is calculated as the quoted market price of the investment and in the case of equity securities, the quoted market price
multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.
Receivables from provisional concentrate sales
The Company’s trade receivables arose from provisional concentrate sales and are valued using quoted market prices based on the forward
London Metal Exchange (“LME”) price for copper, zinc and lead and the London Bullion Market Association P.M. fix (“London P.M. fix”) for
gold and silver and as such are classified as level 2 of the fair market value hierarchy.
Derivative financial assets
The Company’s unrealized gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts are valued using observable market prices and as
such are classified as Level 2 of the fair market value hierarchy.
Share purchase warrants
The Company’s unrealized gains and losses on share purchase warrants are valued using observable inputs and as such are classified as
Level 2 of the fair market value hierarchy. The share purchase warrants are classified and accounted for as a financial liability at fair value
with changes in fair value included in net earnings. The fair value of the share purchase warrants is determined using the Black Scholes
pricing model which is further discussed in Note 19.
Convertible notes
The Company’s unrealized gains and losses on conversion feature of the convertible note are valued using observable inputs and as such
are classified as Level 2 of the fair market value hierarchy. The conversion feature on the convertible notes is considered an embedded
derivative and is classified as and accounted for as a financial liability at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings. The fair
value of the conversion feature of the convertible notes is determined using a model that includes the volatility and price of the Company’s
common shares and a credit spread structure with reference to the corresponding fair value of the debt component of the convertible notes.

d)
Financial Instruments and Related Risks
The Company has exposure to risks of varying degrees of significance which could affect its ability to achieve its strategic objectives for
growth and shareholder returns. The principal financial risks to which the Company is exposed are metal price risk, credit risk, foreign
exchange rate risk, and liquidity risk. The Company’s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the
Company’s risk management framework and reviews the Company’s policies on an ongoing basis.
(i)Metal Price Risk
Metal price risk is the risk that changes in metal prices will affect the Company’s income or the value of its related financial instruments. The
Company derives its revenue from the sale of silver, gold, lead, copper, and zinc. The Company’s sales are directly dependent on metal
prices that have shown extreme volatility and are beyond the Company’s control. The Company mitigates the price risk associated with its
base metal production by committing some of its forecasted base metal production from time to time under forward sales and option contracts.
The Board of Directors continually assess the Company’s strategy towards its base metal exposure, depending on market conditions. At June
30, 2013, the Company had 1,200 tonnes of lead and 6,000 tonnes of zinc under contract with a positive mark-to-market valuation of $0.09
million and $0.9 million respectively (2012 – $0.4 million and $nil, respectively).
In response to the sharp decline in silver and gold prices in the current quarter, the Company evaluated its alternatives to mitigate the
financial risk of further price declines.  The Company decided it was appropriate to protect a portion of its precious metal production
associated with its higher cost Peruvian and Argentine operations against the potential of further price erosion.
(ii)Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations and arises principally from the Company’s trade receivables. The carrying value of financial assets represents the maximum credit
exposure.
The Company has long-term concentrate contracts to sell the zinc, lead and copper concentrates produced by the Huaron, Morococha, San
Vicente and La Colorada mines.  Concentrate contracts are common business practice in the mining industry. The terms of the concentrate
contracts may require the Company to deliver concentrate that has a value greater than the payment received at the time of delivery, thereby
introducing the Company to credit risk of the buyers of our concentrates. Should any of these counterparties not honour supply arrangements,
or should any of them become insolvent, the Company may incur losses for products already shipped and be forced to sell its concentrates on
the spot market or it may not have a market for its concentrates and therefore its future operating results may be materially adversely
impacted. At June 30, 2013 the Company had receivable balances associated with buyers of its concentrates of $25.3 million (December 31,
2012 - $39.2 million).  The vast majority of the Company’s concentrate is sold to eight well known concentrate buyers.
Silver doré production from La Colorada, Alamo Dorado, Dolores and Manantial Espejo is refined under long term agreements with fixed
refining terms at three separate refineries worldwide.  The Company generally retains the risk and title to the precious metals throughout the
process of refining and therefore is exposed to the risk that the refineries will not be able to perform in accordance with the refining contract
and that the Company may not be able to fully recover precious metals in such circumstances.  At June 30, 2013 the Company had
approximately $44.3 million (December 31, 2012 - $48.8 million) of value contained in precious metal inventory at refineries.  The Company
maintains insurance coverage against the loss of precious metals at the Company’s mine sites, in-transit to refineries and whilst at the
refineries.
The Company maintains trading facilities with several banks and bullion dealers for the purposes of transacting the Company’s trading
activities. None of these facilities are subject to margin arrangements.  The Company’s trading activities can expose the Company to the
credit risk of its counterparties to the extent that our trading positions have a positive mark-to-market value.  However, the Company minimizes
this risk by ensuring there is no excessive concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty, by active credit management and
monitoring.

Pan American Silver Corp.
Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
Refined silver and gold is sold in the spot market to various bullion traders and banks.  Credit risk may arise from these activities if the
Company is not paid for metal at the time it is delivered, as required by spot sale contracts.
Management constantly monitors and assesses the credit risk resulting from its refining arrangements, concentrate sales and commodity
contracts with its refiners, trading counterparties and customers.  Furthermore, management carefully considers credit risk when allocating
prospective sales and refining business to counterparties.  In making allocation decisions, Management attempts to avoid unacceptable
concentration of credit risk to any single counterparty.
The Company invests its cash with the objective of maintaining safety of principal and providing adequate liquidity to meet all current
payment obligations. The credit risk, which the Company regularly assesses, is that the bank as an issuer of a financial instrument will
default.
(iii)Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
The Company reports its financial statements in United States dollars (“USD”); however, the Company operates in jurisdictions that utilize
other currencies. As a consequence, the financial results of the Company’s operations as reported in USD are subject to changes in the value
of the USD relative to local currencies. Since the Company’s sales are denominated in USD and a portion of the Company’s operating costs
and capital spending are in local currencies, the Company is negatively impacted by strengthening local currencies relative to the USD and
positively impacted by the inverse.
To mitigate this exposure, from time to time the Company has purchased Peruvian New soles (“PEN”), Mexican pesos (“MXN”) and CAD to
match anticipated spending. At June 30, 2013, the Company had contracts to purchase $6.0 million in Peruvian Nuevo soles with a negative
mark-to-market valuation of $0.4 million. The Company’s net earnings are affected by the revaluation of its monetary assets and monetary
liabilities at each balance sheet date. At June 30, 2013, the Company’s cash and short term investments include $166.7 million in CAD and
$39.8 million in MXN.
Additionally, on June 25, 2013, one of the Company’s subsidiaries received an unsecured bank loan for $100.0 million Argentine pesos
(equivalent to USD$18.6 million) in order to meet its short term obligations and to mitigate the exposure to foreign exchange risk. See Note 14
for further details.
(iv)Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due. The Company manages its
liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows. The Company has in place a rigorous planning and budgeting
process to help determine the funds required to support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis and its
expansion plans. The Company strives to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term business requirements, taking into account its
anticipated cash flows from operations, its holdings of cash and short-term investments, and its committed loan facilities.

9.Mineral Property, Plant and Equipment
Acquisition costs of investment and non-producing properties together with costs directly related to mine development expenditures are
capitalized. Exploration expenditures on investment and non-producing properties are charged to operations in the period they are incurred.
Capitalization of evaluation expenditures commences when there is a high degree of confidence in the project’s viability and hence it is very
likely that future economic benefits will flow to the Company. Evaluation expenditures, other than that acquired from the purchase of another
mining company, are carried forward as an asset provided that such costs are expected to be recovered in full through successful
development and exploration of the area of interest or alternatively, by its sale. Evaluation expenditures include delineation drilling,
metallurgical evaluations, and geotechnical evaluations, amongst others.

10.Impairment of Non-Current Assets and Goodwill
Non-current assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in assumptions indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. The Company performs an impairment test for goodwill at each financial year end and when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the related carrying value may not be recoverable. As at June 30, 2013, the Company determined there were several indicators
of potential impairment of its producing mineral properties which included the sharp decline in silver and gold metal prices during the quarter
ended June 30, 2013 and as well as other regulatory changes introduced in Mexico and Argentina.
Based on the Company’s assessment at June 30, 2013 of potential impairments with respect to its mineral properties, the Company has
concluded that there are no impairment charges required as at June 30, 2013, except those for the Dolores mine.
17
Pan American Silver Corp.
Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
At June 30, 2013 the Company tested the recoverability of its investment in the Dolores mine. The Company used for key assumptions current
information on operating and capital costs, a long term silver price of $25 per ounce (December 31, 2012 - $25 per ounce), a long term gold
price of $1,350 per ounce (December 31, 2012 - $1,400 per ounce), a range of possible outcomes related to the proposed Mexican royalty,
and a risk adjusted project specific discount rate of 6%. Additionally, and consistent with prior periods, the Company used analysts’
consensus pricing for the first four years of its economic modeling for impairment purposes and as such, these near metal prices have
deteriorated considerably since year end. At June 30, 2013, the Company determined that the carrying value related to the Dolores mine of
approximately $1,061 million, including goodwill and net of associated deferred tax liabilities was greater than its recoverable amount of
$872.5 million, calculated as the higher of (i) the value estimated to be obtained from operation of Dolores (value in use) or (ii) the proceeds
realizable from the sale of the project (fair value less cost to sell). The company considers use of its internal discounted cash flow economic
models as a proxy for the calculation of fair value less cost to sell, given a willing market participant would use such models in establishing a
value for the properties. Based on the above assessment at June 30, 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to the
Dolores mine of $187.5 million, net of tax ($188.6 million before tax) comprised of goodwill of $184.7 million and non-current assets of $2.8
million.
Due to the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to the various factors mentioned and especially long term metal prices as well as unforeseen
factors, any significant change in the key assumptions and inputs could result in additional impairment charges in future periods.
At June 30, 2013, the Company reclassified certain exploration assets from assets held for sale to exploration and evaluation property which
requires assessment of carrying amount based on fair value less selling costs. It was determined that the estimated recoverable value of the
non-current assets on a fair value less selling cost basis for the three months ended June 30, 2013 required an impairment recovery of $3.4
million and brought the six months ended June 30, 2013 impairment charge to approximately $14.9 million.
The total impairment charge for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 is $184.1 million and $202.3 million, net of tax of $1.1 million
(before tax - $185.2 million and $203.4 million, respectively).
Key assumptions and sensitivity
The metal prices used to calculate the recoverable amounts are based on analysts’ consensus prices and are summarized in the following
table including those applicable to the Company’s polymetallic mines.
Commodity Prices 2014-2016 average  Long term 
 
Silver Price - $/oz  $ 26.53
Zn Price - $/DMT  $ 2,308
 
 
Pb Price - $/DMT  $ 2,249
Au Price - $/oz
 $ 1,497
$ 25.00
  $ 1,750
  $ 1,850
  $ 1,350
The Company tested the sensitivity of all its operating mines’ recoverable amounts as of June 30, 2013 up to a 10% deterioration of long term
metal prices and up to a 10% increase in operating costs, individually, with the following results identifying those assets with a carrying value
that would be equal to or less than its recoverable amount.
For the Huaron mine, a decrease in the long term silver price of greater than 1% or an increase in operating costs of greater than 1%, would in
isolation, cause the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to or less than the carrying value of $67.0 million.  Additionally, a decrease in
the long term zinc price below $1,725 per tonne or in lead below $1,800 per tonne could cause the estimated recoverable amount to be equal
to or less than the carrying value.
For the Morococha mine, a decrease in the long term silver price of greater than 4% or an increase in operating costs of greater than 3%,
would in isolation, cause the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to or less than the carrying value of $130.5 million.  Additionally, a
decrease in the long term zinc price below $1,625 per tonne or in lead below $1,525 per tonne could cause the estimated recoverable amount
to be equal to or less than the carrying value.

a decrease in the long term gold price below $1,150 per ounce could cause the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to or less than the

Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
As part of the 2012 Minefinders acquisition the Company issued replacement unsecured convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal
amount of $36.2 million (the “Notes”). Until such time as the earlier of December 15, 2015 and the date the Notes are converted, each Note
shall bear interest at 4.5% payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The principal outstanding on the Notes is due
on December 15, 2015, if any Notes are still outstanding at that time. The Notes are convertible into a combination of cash and Pan American
shares.
The interest and principal amounts of the Notes are classified as debt liabilities and the conversion option is classified as a derivative liability.
The debt liability is measured at amortized cost. As a result, the carrying value of the debt liability is lower than the aggregate face value of the
Notes. The unwinding of the discount is accreted as interest expense over the terms of the notes using an effective interest rate. For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2013, $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively was capitalized to mineral property, plant and equipment
(June 30, 2012 – $0.8 million). The Company has the right to pay all or part of the liability associated with the Company’s outstanding
convertible notes in cash on the conversion date. Accordingly, the conversion feature on the convertible notes is considered an embedded
derivative and re-measured at fair value each reporting period. The fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible notes is determined
using a model that includes the volatility and price of the Company’s common shares and a credit spread structure with reference to the
corresponding fair value of the debt component of the convertible notes. Assumptions used in the fair value calculation of the embedded
derivative component at June 30, 2013 were expected stock price volatility of 51.6%, expected life of 2.5 years, and expected dividend yield
of 4.30%.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded a $2.2 million gain and $7.0 million gain on the revaluation of
the embedded derivative on the convertible notes (three and six months ended June 30, 2012 – $8.4 million gain).
The approximate current fair value of the notes, excluding the conversion feature at June 30, 2013 is $34.2 million (December 31, 2012 -
$34.4 million).

(1) As part of the 2009 Aquiline transaction the Company issued a replacement convertible debenture that allowed the holder to convert the
debenture into either 363,854 Pan American Shares or a Silver Stream contract related to certain production from the Navidad project.
Regarding the replacement convertible debenture, it was concluded that the deferred credit presentation was the most appropriate and best
representation of the economics underlying the contract as of the date the Company assumed the obligation as part of the Aquiline
acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition, the counterparty selected the silver stream alternative. The final contract for the alternative is being
discussed and pending the final resolution to this alternative, the Company continues to classify the fair value calculated at the acquisition of
this alternative, as a deferred credit.
19.Share Capital and Employee Compensation Plans
The Company has a comprehensive stock compensation plan for its employees, directors and officers (the “Compensation Plan”). The
Compensation Plan provides for the issuance of common shares and stock options, as incentives. The maximum number of shares which
may be issued pursuant to options granted or bonus shares issued under the Compensation Plan may be equal to, but will not exceed
6,461,470 shares. The exercise price of each option shall be the weighted average trading price of the Company’s stock for the five days prior
to the award date. The options can be granted for a maximum term of 10 years with vesting provisions determined by the Company’s Board of
Directors. Any modifications to the Compensation Plan require shareholders’ approval.

Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
The Board has developed long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) guidelines, which provides annual compensation to the senior managers of the
Company based on the long term performance of both the Company and the individuals that participate in the plan. The LTIP consists of
annual grants of restricted shares, restricted share units, and/or options to participants to buy shares of the Company, whereby at least 25% of
the total annual award is comprised of restricted share units.  For the remaining 75% of the award amount, participants may elect a mix of
restricted shares, restricted share units, and option grants.  Restricted share units vest in two tranches, one half (50%) on the first anniversary
of the grant date and the second half (50%) on the second anniversary date of the award.  For share awards, participants are issued Pan
American shares, with a two year “No Trading Legend,” and are therefore required to hold the shares for a minimum of two years.  There is no
gross-up on common share awards, making the common share component of all awards net of required withholding taxes.  For option
awards, no options vest immediately.  50% of options granted in a particular year vest on the one year anniversary of being granted, and the
other 50% on the second anniversary of being granted.  The options expire after seven years as set out under the LTIP guidelines.
As part of the Minefinders acquisition each Minefinders option holder was provided a replacement option that is exercisable to purchase Pan
American shares. The number of Pan American shares the replacement option holder was entitled to purchase equals 0.6235 multiplied by
the number of Minefinders shares subject to the Minefinders Option (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Pan American shares).
The exercise price per Pan American share equals the exercise price per Minefinders share otherwise purchasable pursuant to the current
Minefinders Option, divided by 0.6235 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).
On March 30, 2012, the Company issued 1,760,705 replacement option awards with a fair value of $10.7 million. Replacement option awards
were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used were a dividend yield of 0.3%, expected volatility of 40.75%,
risk free interest rate of 0.93% and expected life of 0.25 to 3.5 years.

included in net earnings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, there was a derivative gain of $1.0 million and $7.2 million,
respectively (2012 – $12.8 and $15.5 million respectively).

(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
Restricted Share Units (RSUs)
Under the Company’s RSU plan, selected employees are granted RSUs where each RSU has a value equivalent to one Pan American
common share. The RSUs are settled in cash and vest in two instalments, the first 50% vest on the first anniversary date of the grant and a
further 50% vest on the second anniversary date of the grant. Additional RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Pan American
common shares over the vesting period.
Compensation expense for RSUs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 was $0.1 million and $0.4 million respectively (2012 –
$nil) and is presented as a component of general and administrative expense.
Key Employee Long Term Contribution Plan
An additional element of the Company’s compensation structure is a retention program known as the Key Employee Long Term Contribution
Plan (the “Contribution Plan”).  The Contribution Plan was approved by the directors of the Company on June 2, 2008 in response to a heated
labour market situation in the mining sector, and is intended to reward certain key employees of the Company over a fixed time period for
remaining with the Company. On May 15, 2012, the directors of the Company approved the extension of the Key Employee Long Term
Contribution Plan (the “2012 Contribution Plan”), effective on June 1, 2012.
The 2012 Contribution Plan is a two year plan with a percentage of the retention bonus payable at the end of each year of the program.  The
2012 Contribution Plan design consists of three bonus levels that are commensurate with various levels of responsibility, and provides for a
specified annual payment for two years starting in June 2012.  Each year, the annual contribution award will be paid in the form of either cash
or shares of the Company.  The minimum aggregate value that will be paid in cash or issued in shares over the two year period of the plan is
$7.5 million. As of June 30, 2013, $3.7 million remains to be paid as described in Note 6. No shares will be issued from treasury pursuant to
the 2012 Contribution Plan without the prior approval of the plan by the shareholders of the Company and any applicable securities regulatory
authorities. The Company’s Contribution Plan is classified and accounted for as a financial liability and as such this liability is marked-to-
market with changes in value included in net earnings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, there was a $0.3 million and
$0.06 million, respectively of unrealized loss on the mark-to-market of the Contribution Plan (2012 –nil). The Company uses the Black
Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of the Canadian dollar denominated Contribution Plan. Assumptions used are as follows:
stock price - $12.25 CAD, exercise price - $17.91 CAD, expected life in years – 0.92, annualized volatility 51.34% and 36.50%, expected
dividend yield – 4.1% risk free interest rate - 1.3%, exchange rate (1CAD=USD) – 0.9513.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
On August 29, 2012, the Company received regulatory approval for a second normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 7,607,277 of its
common shares, during the one year period from September 4, 2012 to September 3, 2013.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 the Company purchased and cancelled 80,000 shares and 415,000 shares,
respectively (2012 – nil and 1,309,664 shares, respectively) for a total consideration of $1.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively (2012 – nil
and $23.5 million, respectively).
Dividends
On February 20, 2013, the Company declared a dividend of $0.125 per common share paid to holders of record of its common share as of the
close of business on March 4, 2013.
On May 13, 2013, the Company declared a dividend of $0.125 per common share paid to holders of record of its common share as of the
close of business on May 24, 2013.
On August 14, 2013, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid to holders of record of its common
shares as of the close of business on August 26, 2013. These dividends were not recognized in these condensed interim consolidated
financial statements during the period ended June 30, 2013.

22.Segmented Information
All of the Company’s operations are within the mining sector, conducted through operations in six countries. Major products are silver, gold,
zinc, lead and copper produced from mines located in Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Bolivia. Due to geographic and political diversity, the
Company’s mining operations are decentralized whereby Mine General Managers are responsible for achieving specified business results
within a framework of global policies and standards. Country corporate offices provide support infrastructure to the mines in addressing local
and country issues including financial, human resources, and exploration support. The Company has a separate budgeting process and
measures the results of operations and exploration activities independently. The Company’s head office provides support to the mining and
exploration activities with respect to financial, human resources and technical support.

Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
Income tax expense differs from the amounts that would result from applying the Canadian federal and provincial income tax rates to earnings
before income taxes. These differences result from the items shown on the following table, which result in effective tax rates that vary
considerably from the comparable periods. The main factors which have affected the effective tax rates for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2013 and the comparable period of 2012 were the unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s derivatives, foreign income tax
rate differentials, foreign taxes withheld, foreign exchange and non-recognition of certain deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company took
non-cash impairment charges on non-current assets held for sale and recorded a write down of goodwill related to Minera Minefinders Ltd. No
tax benefit has been recognized for these transactions. The Company expects that these and other factors will continue to cause volatility in
effective tax rates in the future.

25.Commitments and Contingencies
a.
General
The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal and tax proceedings covering matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved
unfavorably to the Company. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the
Company. In the opinion of management none of these matters are expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of the Company.
b.
Purchase Commitments
The Company had no purchase commitments other than those commitments described in Note 6.
c.
Environmental Matters
The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment.
These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so
as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all
material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but
cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Pan American Silver Corp.
Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
Estimated future reclamation costs are based the extent of work required and the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of
relevant authorities and the Company’s environmental policies. As of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, $42.3 million and $45.6 million,
respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to mineral properties. See also Note 15.
d.
Income Taxes
The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and accordingly it is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under the
various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the
local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and
continues to file, all required income tax returns and to pay the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many
countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax
filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules
to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved.
e.
Finance Leases
The present value of future minimum lease payments classified as finance leases at June 30, 2013 is $13.2 million (December 31, 2012 -
$36.4 million) and the schedule of timing of payments for this obligation is found in Note 16.
f.
Law changes in Argentina
Government regulation in Argentina related to the economy has increased substantially over the past year. In particular, the government has
intensified the use of price and foreign exchange controls in response to unfavourable domestic economic trends.
The Argentine government has also imposed restrictions on the importation of goods and services and increased administrative procedures
required to import equipment, materials and services required for operations at Manantial Espejo. In addition, in May 2012, the government
mandated that mining companies establish an internal function to be responsible for substituting Argentinian-produced goods and materials
for imported goods and materials. Under this mandate, the Company is required to submit its plans to import goods and materials for
government review 120 days in advance of the desired date of importation.
The government of Argentina has also tightened control over capital flows and foreign exchange, including informal restrictions on dividend,
interest, and service payments abroad and limitations on the ability of individuals and businesses to convert Argentine pesos into United
States dollars or other hard currencies. These measures, which are intended to curtail the outflow of hard currency and protect Argentina’s
international currency reserves, may adversely affect the Company’s ability to convert dividends paid by current operations or revenues
generated by future operations into hard currency and to distribute those revenues to offshore shareholders. Maintaining operating revenues
in Argentine pesos could expose the Company to the risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation.
In June 2013, the provincial government of Santa Cruz, Argentina passed amendments to its tax code that introduced a new mining property
tax with a rate of 1% to be charged on published reserves, which has the potential to affect the Manantial Espejo mine as well as other
companies operating in the province. The new law came into effect on July 5, 2013 but regulations for the application and calculation of this
tax have not been issued. The Company has in place certain contracts that could potentially affect or exempt the Company from having this
new tax applicable and as such is evaluating its options with its advisors. The Company and potentially other mining companies in the
province are also evaluating options that include challenging the legality and constitutionality of the tax.
g.
Law changes in Mexico
In December 2012, the Mexican government introduced changes to the Federal labour law which made certain amendments to the law
relating to the use of service companies and subcontractors and the obligations with respect to employee benefits. These amendments may
have an effect on the distribution of profits to workers and this could result in additional financial obligations to the Company. The Company is
evaluating these amendments, but currently believes that it continues to be in compliance with the federal labour law and that these
amendments will not result in any new material obligations for the Company. Based on this assessment, the Company has not accrued any
additional amounts for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. The Company will continue to monitor developments in Mexico and to assess the
potential impact of these amendments.

During the second quarter of 2013, the Mexican government introduced a bill that proposes a royalty of 5% on mine operating income before
certain deductions including amortization and depreciation. The senate has not yet approved the bill and the Company continues to monitor
its progress and evaluate its possible effects on our future cash flows and future earnings.
h.
Political changes in Bolivia
In early 2009, a new constitution was enacted in Bolivia that further entrenches the government’s ability to amend or enact certain laws,
including those that may affect mining. On May 1, 2011, Bolivian President Evo Morales announced the formation of a multi-disciplinary
committee to re-evaluate several pieces of legislation, including the mining law and this has caused some concerns amongst foreign
companies doing business in Bolivia due to the government’s policy objective of nationalizing parts of the resource sector. However, Mr.
Morales made no reference to reviewing or terminating agreements with private mining companies. Operations at San Vicente have
continued to run normally under Pan American’s administration and it is expected that normal operations will continue status quo. Pan
American will take every measure available to enforce its rights under its agreement with COMIBOL, but there is no guarantee that
governmental actions will not impact the San Vicente operation and its profitability. Risks of doing business in Bolivia include being subject to
new higher taxes and mining royalties (some of which have already been proposed or threatened), revision of contracts and threatened
expropriation of assets, all of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations or profitability.
i.
Other Legal Matters
The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business activities, many of them relating to ex-employees.  Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that
some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.  The Company establishes provisions for matters that are probable and
can be reasonably estimated, included within current liabilities, and amounts are not considered material.
In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in
such proceedings, the Company and its legal counsel evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well
as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought. In the opinion of management there are no claims expected to
have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.
j.
Title Risk
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the
Company’s title. Property title may be subject to, among other things, unregistered prior agreements or transfers and may be affected by
undetected defects.
k. Royalty Agreements and Participation Agreements
The Company has various royalty agreements on certain mineral properties entitling the counterparties to the agreements to receive
payments per terms as summarized below. Royalty liabilities incurred on acquisitions of properties are netted against mineral property while
royalties that become payable upon production are expensed at the time of sale of the production.
On September 22, 2011, Peru’s Parliament approved new laws that increase mining taxes to fund anti-poverty infrastructure projects in the
country, effective October 1, 2011. The new law changes the scheme for royalty payments, so that mining companies that have not signed
legal stability agreements with the government will have to pay royalties of 1% to 12% on operating profit; royalties under the previous rules
were 1% to 3% on net sales. In addition to these royalties, such companies will be subject to a “special tax” at a rate ranging from 2% to 8.4%
of operating profit. Companies that have concluded legal stability agreements (under the General Mining Law) will be required to pay a
“special contribution” of between 4% and 13.12% of operating profits. The Company’s calculations of the change in the royalty and the new
tax indicate that no material impact is expected on the results of the Company’s Peruvian operations.

Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
As at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012
(unaudited tabular amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars except number of options and warrants and per share amounts)
In the province of Chubut, Argentina which is the location of the Company’s Navidad property, there is a provincial royalty of 3% of the
“Operating Income”. Operating income is defined as revenue minus production costs (not including mining costs), treatment and transportation
charges. Additionally, the governor of the province of Chubut, Argentina, has submitted to the provincial legislature draft law which if passed
will introduce a 5% net smelter return royalty, in addition to the 3% provincial royalty discussed above. Refer below to the Navidad project
section below for further details.
As part of the 2009 Aquiline transaction the Company issued a replacement convertible debenture that allowed the holder to convert the
debenture into either 363,854 Pan American shares or a silver stream contract related to certain production from the Navidad project.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the counterparty to the replacement debenture has indicated its intention to elect the silver stream alternative.
The final contract for the alternative is being discussed and pending the final resolution to this alternative, the Company continues to classify
the fair value calculated at the acquisition of this alternative, as a deferred credit as disclosed in Note 18.
Huaron and Morococha mines
In June 2004, Peru’s Congress approved a bill that allows royalties to be charged on mining projects. These royalties are payable on
Peruvian mine production at the following progressive rates: (i) 1.0% for companies with sales up to $60 million; (ii) 2.0% for companies with
sales between $60 million and $120 million; and (iii) 3.0% for companies with sales greater than $120 million. This royalty is a net smelter
returns royalty, the cost of which is deductible for income tax purposes.
Manantial Espejo mine
Production from the Manantial Espejo property is subject to royalties to be paid to Barrick Gold Corp. according to the following: (i) $0.60 per
metric tonne of ore mined from the property and fed to process at a mill or leaching facility to a maximum of 1 million tonnes; and (ii) one-half
of one percent (0.5%) of net smelter returns derived from the production of minerals from the property. In addition, the Company has
negotiated a royalty equal to 3.0% of operating cash flow payable to the Province of Santa Cruz.
San Vicente mine
Pursuant to an option agreement entered into with COMIBOL, a Bolivian state mining company, with respect to the development of the San
Vicente property, the Company is obligated to pay COMIBOL a participation fee of 37.5% (the “Participation Fee”) of the operations cash flow.
Once full commercial production of San Vicente began, the Participation was reduced by 75% until the Company recovers its investment in
the property. Thereafter, the Participation Fee will revert back to its original percentage. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 the
royalties to COMIBOL amounted to approximately $0.4 million and $5.0 million (2012 - $7.4 million and $8.7 million, respectively).
A royalty is also payable to EMUSA, a former partner of the Company on the project. The royalty is a 2% net smelter royalty payable only after
the Company has recovered its capital investment in the project and only when the average price of silver in a given financial quarter is $9.00
per ounce or greater. Recovery of capital investment was not achieved as of June 30, 2013. In December 2007, the Bolivian government
introduced a new mining royalty that affects the San Vicente project. In December 2007, the Bolivian government introduced a new mining
royalty that affects the San Vicente project. The royalty is applied to gross metal value of sales (before smelting and refining deductions) and
the royalty percentage is a sliding scale depending on metal prices. At current metal prices, the royalty is 6% for silver metal value and 5% for
zinc and copper metal value of sales. The royalty is income tax deductible.

Dolores mine
Production from the Dolores mine is subject to underlying net smelter return royalties comprised of 2% on gold and silver production and
1.25% on gold production. These royalties are payable to Royal Gold Inc. and were effective in full as of May 1, 2009, on the commencement
of commercial production at the Dolores mine. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the royalties to Royal Gold amounted to
approximately $1.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively (2012 – $0.9 million).
Navidad project
In late June 2012, the governor of the province of Chubut submitted to the provincial legislature a draft law which, if passed, would regulate all
future oil and gas and mining activities in the province. The draft legislation incorporated the expected re-zoning of the province, allowing for
the development of Navidad as an open pit mine. However, the draft legislation also introduced a series of new regulations that would have
greatly increased provincial royalties and imposed the province’s direct participation in all mining projects, including Navidad.
In October 2012, the proposed bill was withdrawn for further study; however, as a result of uncertainty over the zoning, regulatory and tax laws
which will ultimately apply, the Company has been forced to temporarily suspend project development activities at Navidad. As a
consequence of these events, Pan American recognized an impairment charge of $100 million against the carrying value of the project for the
year ended December 31, 2012.
The Company remains committed to the development of Navidad and to contributing to the positive economic and social development of the
province of Chubut upon the adoption of a favorable legislative framework.
26.Subsequent Events
In response to the sharp decline in silver and gold prices in the current quarter, the Company evaluated its alternatives to mitigate the
financial risk of further price declines.  The Company decided it was appropriate to protect a portion of its precious metal production
associated with its higher cost Peruvian and Argentine operations against the potential of further price erosion. As such, subsequent to June
30, 2013, the Company adopted a program to enter into forward contracts of up to 1 year for up to 25% of its silver and gold production.
