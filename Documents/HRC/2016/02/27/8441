<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/12. 
It briefly outlines the activities of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, from 1 March 2010 to 1 March 2011 and contains a 
thematic analysis on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>2. With regard to the activities carried out from 1 March to 31 August 2010, the 
Special Rapporteur makes reference to her latest report to the General Assembly 
(A/65/288). Her activities from 1 September 2010 to 1 March 2011 are briefly outlined 
below. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Argentina and Uruguay from 6 to 12 September 
2010 and from 13 to 17 September 2010, respectively, at the invitation of the Governments. 
The reports of these visits are presented as addenda to the present report.  
</p>
<p>4. On 4 and 5 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur convened a consultation with anti-
trafficking experts from nine regional organizations in Dakar. Further, on 22 and 23 
November 2010, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert consultation on the right to an 
effective remedy for trafficked persons, in Bratislava, in preparation of the present report. 
The summary reports of these consultations are provided as addenda to the present report. 
</p>
<p>5. On 19 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur delivered a keynote speech at the fifth 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, held in Vienna. 
</p>
<p>6. On 25 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur presented her annual report to the 
General Assembly, which focused on the prevention of trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>7. On 2 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur addressed the press conference 
organized by anti trafficking action (ASTRA) in Belgrade, on the occasion of the tenth 
anniversary of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime (&#8220;Palermo Protocol&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>8. On 3 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur delivered a keynote speech at the 
interparliamentary conference, entitled &#8220;Parliaments united against human trafficking&#8221;, 
held by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Paris. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic analysis: the right to an effective remedy for 
trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>9. In the exercise of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur received a number of reports 
that trafficked persons are frequently left without remedies or the support necessary to 
access them, which often gives rise to risks of further human rights violations and re-
trafficking. The Special Rapporteur found that despite the fundamental guarantee of the 
right to an effective remedy under international law, there remains a large gap in practice 
between legal provisions and their implementation in relation to trafficked persons. </p>


<p>10. Recognizing this gap, the Special Rapporteur considers that conceptual clarification 
of this right and analysis of good practices and main challenges may benefit States in 
ensuring the effective implementation of the right at the national level. It is further her hope 
that the report will provide guidance to practitioners working in this field, including 
lawyers, human rights defenders, academics, and international and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur expresses gratitude to experts and stakeholders who 
provided valuable inputs to the development of the present report. In particular, she wishes 
to thank those who participated in the expert consultation held in Bratislava on 22 and 23 
November 2010, and in the online discussion forum at the United Nations Global Initiative 
to Fight Human Trafficking website (UN.GIFT.HUB) from 2 to 21 February 2011. The 
summary note of the online discussion is included in the present report as annex II. 
</p>
<p>12. In this chapter, the Special Rapporteur sets out the legal framework of the right to an 
effective remedy for trafficked persons under international law and discusses when and 
how the obligation of States to provide remedies arises. She then analyses essential 
components of this right in the context of trafficked persons and discusses fundamental 
principles to be taken into account in the case of trafficked children. In chapter IV of the 
report, the Special Rapporteur offers conclusions and recommendations for States&#8217; 
consideration. Annex I of the report contains the draft basic principles on the right to an 
effective remedy for trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal framework of the right to an effective remedy for trafficked 
persons 
</b></p>
<p>13. It is a well-established doctrine of international law that a State has an obligation to 
redress wrongs where an act or omission is attributable to it and constitutes a breach of an 
international obligation of the State.1 While this doctrine of State responsibility has 
traditionally applied between States, it also extends to wrongs committed against 
individuals.2   
</p>
<p>14. The first requirement of State responsibility is that the relevant act or omission is 
attributable to the State. The conduct of any State organs and agents acting under the 
direction, instigation or control of those organs is clearly attributed to the State.3 In general, 
the conduct of private persons is not as such attributable to the State.4 The second 
requirement is that the relevant act or omission attributed to a State constitutes a breach of 
an international obligation of that State. 
</p>
<p>15. On face value, State responsibility may seem difficult to establish in cases of 
trafficking, as trafficking is often committed by private individuals, criminal groups and 
networks acting without instructions from, the direction of or control by a State. However, 
the fact that the relevant act or omission was conducted by private persons does not 
necessarily absolve the State of its responsibility, as State responsibility may arise &#8220;if it 
</p>

</p>
<p>acts, annex, arts. 2 and 31.

commentary, part one, chap. II, para. 2).

<p>failed to take necessary measures to prevent the effects of the conduct of private parties&#8221;.5 
Importantly, whether or not such failure is attributed to a State would depend on the 
existence of relevant international obligations of that State to take such measures. In the 
context of human rights and trafficking in persons, obligations to prevent and punish acts of 
private persons clearly exist, as seen in the obligations under the Palermo Protocol to 
&#8220;prevent and combat&#8221; trafficking in persons, and under international human rights law to 
prevent human rights violations by non-State actors. The standard applied in determining a 
breach of these obligations is that of &#8220;due diligence&#8221;, so that States may be responsible for 
providing remedies where they fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights 
or to investigate and punish acts of such violations.6 An example of the application of these 
principles at the regional level is the case of <i>Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia7</i> in which the 
European Court of Human Rights ordered Cyprus and Russia respectively to pay 
compensation to the family of the victim of trafficking for the failure to provide for an 
appropriate legal and administrative framework to combat trafficking and to properly 
investigate how and where the victim was recruited, pursuant to article 4 of the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>16. In addition to the doctrine of State responsibility, States may have obligations under 
specific treaties to provide remedies. As trafficking involves multiple violations of human 
rights, international human rights law is of direct relevance. It is well-grounded in 
international human rights law that a State has a duty to provide a remedy to victims of 
human rights violations committed within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction. The 
right to a remedy is a human rights norm widely recognized in major international and 
regional human rights instruments.8 While international instruments specifically applicable 
to the crime of trafficking, namely the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and the Palermo Protocol, do not expressly guarantee the right to a 
remedy to trafficked persons, they do require States to establish procedures to provide 
access to compensation, and to provide for measures that may form part of the right to an 
effective remedy, as discussed in sections C and D below. Despite this lack of holistic 
reference to the right of trafficked persons to a remedy under the Palermo Protocol, the 
international community clearly recognizes that trafficked persons, as victims of human 
rights violations, have the right to adequate and appropriate remedies, which goes beyond 
the right to the possibility of obtaining compensation.9

<p>17. Once State responsibility to provide trafficked persons with remedies is established, 
the next question is the content of such remedies. In this regard, the formulation of the right 
to a remedy under various treaties and soft international law makes clear that it 
encompasses not only a substantive right to reparations, but also a set of procedural rights 
necessary to facilitate access to reparations. 
</p>
<p>18. In substance, victims of human rights violations must be provided with adequate 
reparations for the harms suffered. While most human rights treaties do not explicitly spell 
out the content of reparations, the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights 
Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (&#8220;Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on Remedy and Reparation&#8221;) elaborate various forms of reparations, including 
restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. 
Clearly, the form of reparations that should be provided to the victim would depend on the 
nature and circumstances of the violation. While not all forms of reparation are necessary in 
all cases, adequate reparation may only be achieved in particular cases by the combination 
of different forms of reparation. 
</p>
<p>19. At the procedural level, victims of human rights violations must be guaranteed 
access to a competent and independent authority in order to successfully obtain reparations. 
Such an authority must have the power to investigate and decide whether a human rights 
violation has taken place, and if so, to enforce reparations.10 If the victims are to be 
provided with meaningful access to such an authority, they must be guaranteed of a set of 
ancillary rights. First, the victims should be provided with relevant information concerning 
the right that has been violated, and on the existence of, and modalities for gaining access 
to, reparation mechanisms. Secondly, they should be provided with legal, medical, 
psychological, social, administrative and any other assistance that they may require in order 
to exercise the right to an effective remedy in a meaningful manner.11 
</p>
<p><b> C. Substantive components 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Restitution  
</b></p>
<p>20. As restitution is aimed at restoring the situation that existed prior to the violation, 
measures of restitution in the context of trafficked persons may include, for example: the 
release of the trafficked person from detention (whether such detention is imposed by 
traffickers, the State or any other entity);12 return of property such as identity and travel 
documents and other personal belongings; recognition of legal identity and citizenship; safe 
and voluntary repatriation to the country of origin; and assistance and support necessary to 
facilitate social integration. 
</p>
<p>21. Measures of restitution warrant a cautious approach in the context of trafficking in 
persons, as simply returning the trafficked person to the pre-existing situation may place 
him or her at the risk of further human rights violations and being re-trafficked. From this 
perspective, restitution implies States&#8217; obligations to undertake broader measures to address 
root causes of trafficking and to provide necessary reintegration support to trafficked 
persons, so as to address any risk of re-trafficking. The repatriation in 2005 of about 1,000 
Pakistani children who were trafficked to the United Arab Emirates as camel jockeys, 
provides an illustration. In this case, the factors which caused the children to be trafficked 
</p>
<p>  
 10 See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 20 (1992), para. 14.   
 11 See Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedy and Reparation, arts. 11 and 12. 
 12 Anne T. Gallagher, <i>The International Law of Human Trafficking</i> (New York, Cambridge University 
</p>
<p>Press, 2010), p. 366.  </p>


<p>in the first place, such as poverty, the lack of economic opportunities and the absence of a 
comprehensive child protection system, still persisted at the time of repatriation. Therefore, 
repatriation and reintegration of the children inevitably entailed tackling the root causes of 
trafficking and strengthening the child protection system, including providing basic 
education and health services in a sustainable manner. 
</p>
<p>22. Measures to address the root causes of trafficking, such as gender discrimination and 
inequality, also play a crucial role in ensuring effective restitution of trafficked women and 
girls. Where trafficked women and girls have been subjected to sexual and gender-based 
violence, they may face discrimination, social stigma, communal and family ostracism 
upon return to their families and communities, thereby resulting in their re-victimization. In 
these cases, &#8220;restitution of identity, family life and citizenship for them may require 
measures that target their wider communities &#8211; including attempts to subvert cultural 
understandings around the value of women&#8217;s purity and sexuality&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p>23. Further, returning a trafficked person to his or her country of origin may not be an 
appropriate form of remedy where he or she has lost legal, cultural or social ties with the 
country of origin and it is no longer in his or her best interest to return to it. For instance, it 
is conceivable that a child who is trafficked to another country and perpetuated in this 
situation over decades may lose his or her social and cultural identity in the country of 
origin. In this case, it would be difficult to justify that &#8220;restitution&#8221; in a traditional sense 
alone would be an appropriate, victim-centred remedy. Where these factors exist, restitution 
may involve reintegration of the trafficked person into the host community or resettlement 
in a third country. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Recovery (rehabilitation)</b>14<b>  
</b></p>
<p>24. Recovery is a crucial form of reparation for trafficked persons, which includes 
medical and psychological care, as well as legal and social services. By definition, 
trafficking often involves physical and sexual violence, physical and emotional coercion, 
threats and intimidation, which has severe physical and psychological consequences on the 
victims. The Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking are thus explicit in acknowledging that the right to fair and adequate remedies 
includes &#8220;the means for as full a rehabilitation as possible&#8221;.15 
</p>
<p>25. Article 6, paragraph 3, of the Palermo Protocol requires States to &#8220;consider 
implementing measures to provide for the physical, psychological and social recovery&#8221; of 
trafficked persons and sets out some such measures, including: &#8220;(a) Appropriate housing; 
(b) Counselling and information, in particular as regards their legal rights, in a language 
that the victims of trafficking in persons can understand; (c) Medical, psychological and 
material assistance; and (d) Employment, educational and training opportunities&#8221;. While 
according to the legislative guide for the implementation of the Palermo Protocol (&#8220;the 
Legislative Guide&#8221;), this provision was not rendered mandatory due to the varying level of 
socio-economic development or availability of resources in different States,16 it should be 
read in conjunction with the purposes of the Palermo Protocol, which include &#8220;to protect 
</p>
<p>  
 13 Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/14/22), para. 50. 
 14 In the present report, the word &#8220;recovery&#8221; is used in the context of trafficked persons in order to avoid 
</p>
<p>re-victimizing trafficked persons by labelling them as individuals requiring &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221;.

</i></p>

(New York, 2004), part two, para. 62. </p>


<p>and assist the victims of such trafficking, with full respect for their human rights&#8221; (art. 2) to 
imply obligations of States parties to implement these measures to the maximum of their 
available resources.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. While many States have made positive progress in establishing and providing 
services to support recovery of trafficked persons, a number of challenges remain in 
ensuring that these services are provided in a manner that is non-discriminatory and 
enhances the human rights of trafficked persons. In some States, recovery services are only 
available to certain categories of trafficked persons at the exclusion of others, such as men 
and children who are internally trafficked. It appears that the distribution of services often 
seems to be skewed towards foreign adult women trafficked for sexual exploitation. 
Furthermore, many States make access to recovery services conditional upon the capacity 
or willingness of trafficked persons to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, which is 
contrary to &#8220;the fundamental tenet of the human rights approach to trafficking&#8221;.17 
</p>
<p>27. A related concern is the absence in many States of a &#8220;reflection and recovery 
period&#8221;, during which trafficked persons may escape the influence of traffickers, recover 
psychological stability to consider their options, and make an informed decision as to 
whether to cooperate with law enforcement authorities without the risk of being removed 
from the country. This period is not only an integral element of recovery, but also the 
fundamental first step in seeking other forms of reparations, such as compensation. The 
security and well-being of trafficked persons, which may be facilitated by the reflection and 
recovery period, is an essential prerequisite for trafficked persons in seeking compensation. 
Given the high degree of trauma experienced by trafficked persons, empirical evidence 
suggests that a minimum period of 90 days is required in order to ensure that the cognitive 
functioning of trafficked persons improves to a level at which they are able to make 
informed and thoughtful decisions about their safety and well-being, and provide more 
reliable information about trafficking-related events.18 This issue of a &#8220;reflection and 
recovery period&#8221; will be explored further in section D, subsection 3. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>28. Compensation should be provided for economic assessable damage to the extent that 
such damage cannot be made good by restitution. It may be provided as payment for a wide 
range of injury, loss or damage caused by the offender, including, for example: costs of 
medical, physical, psychological or psychiatric treatment required by the victim; lost 
income and due wages; legal fees and other similar costs; and payment for non-material 
damages, resulting from moral, physical or psychological injury, emotional distress, pain 
and suffering.19  
</p>
<p>29. Reparation in the form of compensation appears to be most widely recognized 
among States in the context of trafficking in persons. The Palermo Protocol specifically 
requires States Parties to ensure that victims of trafficking have &#8220;the possibility of obtaining 
compensation for damage suffered&#8221; (art. 6, para. 6). Notably, however, the provision under 
the Palermo Protocol falls short of requiring States Parties to ensure that trafficked persons 
actually receive compensation. The obligation of States under the Palermo Protocol is 
discharged if States establish: (a) provisions allowing victims to sue offenders or others for

<p>civil damages; (b) provisions allowing criminal courts to award criminal damages to be 
paid by offenders to victims or to impose orders for compensation or restitution against 
persons convicted of offences; or (c) provisions establishing dedicated funds or schemes 
whereby victims can claim compensation from the State for injuries or damages.20 The 
requirement under the Palermo Protocol to merely provide for the possibility to seek 
compensation effectively creates a gap between the right to an effective remedy in law and 
its implementation. A number of obstacles exist in practice for trafficked persons to obtain 
compensation through either of these avenues, rendering such possibility simply illusory. 
</p>
<p>30. The ensuing subsections discuss different methods through which trafficked persons 
may seek compensation and associated challenges, while also highlighting some positive 
developments.   
</p>
<p><i> (a) Legal proceedings (criminal, civil or labour)  
</i></p>
<p>31. Compensation through criminal proceedings may be awarded to victims as part of 
the penalties imposed upon finding the accused persons guilty of the offence as charged. 
While some successful cases have been reported, experience shows that the awarding of 
compensation for trafficked persons through criminal proceedings is the exception rather 
than the rule. In some countries, courts may not even consider compensation for trafficked 
persons, as it is not common practice for victims of any crime to be awarded compensation 
through criminal proceedings.21 The possibility of compensation through criminal 
proceedings also hinges upon identification, arrest, trial and conviction of traffickers, which 
remains difficult in trafficking cases. 
</p>
<p>32. Trafficked persons may also pursue civil claims on the basis of loss caused by the 
crime of trafficking pursuant to relevant national law. Although there are recent cases 
which resulted in a substantive amount of compensation for trafficked persons,22 it is still 
extremely difficult for them to receive compensation through civil proceedings. Some of 
the difficulties associated with civil proceedings include the tendency to be time-
consuming, expensive and complicated. Other obstacles include complications in 
calculating the basis of damages and the relative novelty of non-material damages such as 
pain and suffering in some States.23 
</p>
<p>33. Trafficked persons may also have options of claiming compensation based on labour 
law violations, such as discrimination, breach of national minimum wage, and unreasonable 
overtime. While there are some promising practices,24 the possibility for trafficked persons 
to obtain compensation through labour proceedings may be restricted by a number of 
eligibility criteria in practice. In some countries, labour proceedings are not available for 
trafficked persons engaging in sexual services, as the provision of sexual services itself is 
illegal and thus not a recognized form of employment to which labour protection applies.25

<p>Trafficked persons with irregular immigration status may be also excluded from the use of 
labour proceedings to seek compensation. 
</p>
<p>34. While different factors affect the efficacy of criminal, civil and labour proceedings, 
common obstacles for trafficked persons to seek compensation through legal proceedings 
include: failure to identify trafficked persons and accord them regular residence status; lack 
of adequate support in recovery of trafficked persons; lack of information and knowledge 
on the part of trafficked persons; lack of free legal aid available; lack of capacities, 
knowledge and experience on the part of the judiciary and lawyers in seeking compensation 
for trafficked persons; and inadequate witness protection programmes to guarantee the 
safety and security of trafficked persons and their family members. Further, trafficked 
women who are also victims of sexual and gender-based violence may also face additional 
obstacles in pursuing legal proceedings, as participation in such proceedings may expose 
them to re-victimization in the form of psychological harm, stigma and communal and 
family ostracism. 
</p>
<p>35. An additional obstacle for trafficked persons to receive compensation is that even 
when compensation orders are made against traffickers, it is extremely difficult to enforce 
such orders and actually receive compensation. One of the main contributing factors is that 
identified traffickers often do not have adequate assets to satisfy an award of compensation. 
In some cases, traffickers may genuinely not have any assets, as they may be &#8220;lower level&#8221; 
offenders such as intermediaries or recruiters. In other cases, law enforcement authorities 
may lack the expertise, training and resources to conduct financial investigations to freeze 
and confiscate such assets.26 Traffickers may thus swiftly transfer their assets to another 
country or take other steps to conceal them before compensation orders are executed. Even 
where assets are successfully confiscated, such assets may be automatically transferred into 
State coffers or otherwise not used to compensate trafficked persons.27  
</p>
<p><i> (b) State-funded compensation funds  
</i></p>
<p>36. Trafficked persons may also seek compensation through a State-administered 
scheme, which has been perceived as more favourable than legal proceedings, given that its 
processes are relatively streamlined, less bureaucratic and quicker; and compensation may 
be made without having to apprehend and convict a trafficker.  
</p>
<p>37. In some States, trafficked persons have been able to obtain compensation through 
general compensation schemes for victims of crime.28 In many other States, however, 
access to State-funded compensation schemes may be restricted by certain eligibility 
criteria, such as nationality, residence status, or types of crimes that the victim suffered.  
</p>
<p>38. An increasing number of States have introduced compensation schemes specifically 
for trafficked persons, or have announced that they are contemplating the establishment of 
one. The Special Rapporteur recognizes, however, that where a general compensation 
scheme for victims of crime including trafficked persons exists, the creation of a separate 
compensation scheme dedicated only to trafficked persons may result in further diversion 
of resources and hierarchical categorization of rights holders. From this perspective, it may 
be considered a more concrete strategy to seek to enable trafficked persons to obtain 
compensation within the existing scheme and, where it is inadequate, to strengthen it to 
allow all victims of human rights violations to claim compensation.

 28 Ibid, p. 15.   </p>


<p><i> (c) Non-judicial methods  
</i></p>
<p>39. In the light of the limitations associated with legal proceedings, it is noteworthy that 
a number of cases in which trafficked persons have successfully obtained compensation 
resulted from out-of-court settlements negotiated by various governmental and non-
governmental bodies.29 In some States, trade unions have played a crucial role in settling 
claims for unpaid or underpaid wages, or work-related injuries following negotiations with 
employers. These non-judicial methods may play an instrumental role in seeking 
compensation particularly for certain groups of trafficked persons, such as trafficked 
women and girls, who may face a variety of procedural challenges in judicial proceedings, 
such as psychological harms, stigma and fears of reprisals. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition 
</b></p>
<p>40. Satisfaction is a non-financial form of reparation designed to compensate moral 
damage or damage to the dignity or reputation of the victim. It includes measures such as 
the verification of the facts and full and public disclosure of the truth, an official declaration 
or a judicial decision restoring the dignity, the reputation and the rights of the victim and of 
persons close to the victim, and judicial and administrative sanctions against perpetrators.30 
These measures translate into the obligations of States to conduct a prompt, effective, 
independent and impartial investigation into human rights violations.31 Guarantees of non-
repetition are geared towards the prevention of human rights violations and include 
measures such as strengthening the independence of the judiciary, providing human rights 
education to all sectors of society and training for law enforcement officials, and promoting 
the observance of codes of conduct and ethical norms by public servants.32  
</p>
<p>41. It is beyond the scope of the present report to discuss in detail these aspects of the 
right to an effective remedy, which raise broader issues such as the efficacy of the judicial 
system and the obligations of States to prevent trafficking in persons. However, the Special 
Rapporteur emphasizes that they are essential elements of the right to an effective remedy, 
without which the ultimate objective of enabling trafficked persons to recover from the 
harms and rebuild their lives with the full enjoyment of human rights, may not be realized. 
In particular, guarantees of non-repetition, which include measures to prevent trafficking, 
constitute an important form of remedy in view of the risks of re-trafficking that trafficked 
persons may be exposed to. To this end, the Palermo Protocol imposes an obligation on 
States to undertake various measures aimed at prevention of trafficking, ranging from 
tackling the root causes to providing or strengthening training of law enforcement officers, 
immigration and other relevant officials in the prevention of trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Procedural components 
</b></p>
<p>42. Some of the obstacles in seeking compensation as identified above clearly show that 
procedural rights of access to remedies are critical pre-conditions in realizing the 
substantive right to reparations for trafficked persons.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b> 1. Access to information  
</b></p>
<p>43. First and foremost, information relating to trafficked persons&#8217; rights and 
mechanisms available to seek remedies is critical in ensuring their access to remedies. 
Trafficked persons can only seek remedies if they are aware of their rights and how to 
access such remedies. The importance of providing information is stressed in the Palermo 
Protocol, which requires States Parties to establish measures that provide trafficked persons 
with &#8220;information on relevant court and administrative proceedings&#8221;.33 Experience 
indicates, however, that there is very little evidence of State practices in informing 
trafficked persons about their right to remedies, and the provision of information to 
trafficked persons in a manner that is appropriate in terms of language, content, form and 
timing remains a challenge. 
</p>
<p>44. In terms of the language to be used, it is crucial that information about trafficked 
persons&#8217; rights and the procedures for obtaining remedies is clearly explained in a language 
that the trafficked person understands.34 In this regard, interpreters have a crucial role to 
play, as many trafficked persons may not understand the language spoken in the country in 
which they wish to seek remedies. While the Palermo Protocol does not expressly require 
States to provide for interpretation or translation assistance, it is one of the essential 
requirements to effectively guarantee the right of trafficked persons to seek remedies, and 
the availability of such assistance should not be limited to judicial proceedings. 
Furthermore, the language used to explain the rights and procedures to seek remedies must 
be easily understood by trafficked persons of all educational and socio-economic 
backgrounds. In a number of States, law enforcement authorities such as police and 
prosecutors are obliged by law to inform victims of crime of their rights, including the right 
to claim compensation.35 While the Special Rapporteur recognizes this legal requirement as 
a good practice, it has been reported that it is not well implemented in practice or the 
information often does not effectively reach the victims due to the complexity of the 
language used by the law enforcement authorities.36 
</p>
<p>45. Equally important is the content and form of information to be provided to trafficked 
persons. Trafficked persons should be provided with full and accurate information about 
their legal rights, how and where to obtain necessary assistance, different legal options and 
procedural steps involved in seeking remedies, and consequences of exercising such legal 
options. Information may be provided in writing such as in leaflets so that trafficked 
persons may reflect on the information at any time, and/or through hotlines and the Internet 
to increase accessibility to appropriate information.37 If the trafficked person wishes to 
pursue judicial proceedings, the provision of information may also take the form of 
familiarizing him or her with trial processes through observation of another court 
proceeding, if possible.38 
</p>
<p>46. Furthermore, it is crucial that actors who are likely to come into first contact with 
trafficked persons, such as the police and health professionals, provide relevant information 
to trafficked persons as early as possible. Given that psychological recovery of trafficked

<p>persons may take some time, it may be also beneficial to provide information on a regular 
basis, both orally and in writing in a language they understand. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to legal assistance  
</b></p>
<p>47. As judicial and administrative proceedings are often complex in many jurisdictions, 
legal assistance is essential to enable trafficked persons to claim compensation, especially 
where they are not familiar with the legal system of the country concerned. While not 
specifically referring to &#8220;legal&#8221; assistance, article 6, paragraph 2 (b), of the Palermo 
Protocol mandates States to provide &#8220;assistance to enable their views and concerns to be 
presented and considered at appropriate stages of criminal proceedings against offenders, in 
a manner not prejudicial to the rights of the defence&#8221;. More specifically, paragraph 9 of the 
Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking 
provides that &#8220;legal and other assistance shall be provided to trafficked persons for the 
duration of any criminal, civil or other actions against suspected traffickers&#8221;. Furthermore, 
trafficked persons should be provided with legal assistance free of charge. Trafficked 
persons who have just escaped from their traffickers often have no financial means to 
afford legal assistance, given their financial dependence on their traffickers who use debt 
bondage as a control tool. 
</p>
<p>48. While some States provide for free legal assistance to victims of crime, including 
trafficked persons,39 many States reportedly do not have a system in place to provide for 
such assistance. Even where the law expressly provides that trafficked persons should be 
provided with legal assistance, the system may not exist or be effectively implemented in 
practice, so that legal assistance may only be available from non-governmental or 
international organizations in reality.40 Further, some States impose eligibility criteria for 
legal aid, which may be difficult for trafficked persons to fulfil, such as being nationals of 
the country or long-term residents with legal status and a domicile. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Regularization of residence status  
</b></p>
<p>49. The ability of trafficked persons to claim remedies hinges upon possibilities to 
remain in countries where remedies are sought, as it would be difficult for them to obtain 
remedies if they were at risk of expulsion or had already been expelled from the countries. 
In many instances, however, trafficked persons are misidentified as irregular migrants and 
detained in immigration detention centres, or immediately deported without being given 
any opportunities to seek compensation. 
</p>
<p>50. Article 7 of the Palermo Protocol requires each State to consider adopting measures 
that permit trafficked persons &#8220;to remain in its territory, temporarily or permanently, in 
appropriate cases&#8221; and to &#8220;give appropriate consideration to humanitarian and 
compassionate factors&#8221; in doing so. At a very minimum, this should entail the provision of 
a reflection and recovery period to allow trafficked persons to regain physical and 
psychological stability and to reflect on available options. While an increasing number of 
States, particularly those in Europe, provide for a reflection and recovery period of varying 
duration, the majority of States still do not yet establish a reflection and recovery period as 
a legal right of trafficked persons. Even where it is established by law, trafficked persons 
often do not benefit from such a period, due to a number of obstacles such as the 
misidentification of trafficked persons, which results in immediate detention and 
deportation, and the uncertainty regarding the procedures to be followed in granting the 
</p>
<p>  
 39 Council of Europe, <i>Non-criminal Remedies</i>, p. 19. 
 40 OSCE/ODIHR, <i>Compensation</i>, p. 82. </p>


<p>reflection and recovery period.41 Further, a study on the application of the right to residence 
found that a reflection and recovery period is often confused with temporary residence 
status.42 This confusion is highly problematic, as temporary residence status is often tied to 
the willingness of trafficked persons to cooperate with law enforcement and testify against 
traffickers, which defeats the very purpose of a reflection and recovery period. 
</p>
<p>51. Following a reflection and recovery period, trafficked persons should be provided 
with temporary or permanent residence status on certain grounds. Firstly, trafficked persons 
should be entitled to remain in the country where remedies are being sought for the duration 
of any criminal, civil or administrative proceedings.43 In this regard, article 7 of the Palermo 
Protocol should be read in conjunction with the mandatory requirements under article 6, 
paragraphs 2(b) and 6. As it would be almost impossible for trafficked persons to seek 
compensation through legal proceedings if they are unable to lawfully remain in the 
country, article 7 should be interpreted to encourage States to provide trafficked persons 
with temporary residence status for the purpose of seeking remedies. Secondly, trafficked 
persons should be granted temporary or permanent residence status on social or 
humanitarian grounds. Such grounds may include, for instance, the inability to guarantee a 
safe and secure return, the fears of reprisals and retaliation by traffickers, the risk of being 
re-trafficked, or the return is otherwise not in the best interests of the trafficked person. 
Another factor that should be taken into account is the obligation of States not to return 
trafficked persons to States where they have a well-founded fear of persecution. Some 
victims or potential victims of trafficking may fall within the definition of a refugee 
contained in article 1(A)(2) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
may therefore be entitled to international refugee protection.44 In these circumstances, 
temporary or permanent residence status may in itself become a substantial form of remedy. 
</p>
<p>52. In many States, the grant of residence permits is exclusively tied to the willingness 
of trafficked persons to cooperate with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute 
traffickers. It has been observed that trafficked persons are rarely seen as the holders of 
rights, but as &#8220;instruments&#8221; in investigations or prosecution.45 In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
view, the conditionality of residence permits on cooperation with law enforcement 
authorities may not only compromise trafficked persons&#8217; rights to full recovery, but may 
also be counterproductive from law enforcement perspectives. The requirement to 
cooperate with law enforcement authorities is of concern, particularly in the absence of a 
reflection and recovery period in many States, as such cooperation may result in re-
traumatization of trafficked persons by forcing them to recount highly traumatic events 
when their psychological well-being has not yet been recovered. Further, this concern is 
heightened in view of the lack of definition as to what &#8220;cooperation&#8221; is expected from 
trafficked persons and the reports that it may, in some cases, entail direct contact with 
traffickers, which could be highly traumatizing for trafficked persons.46 It is doubtful 
whether information obtained without respecting the right of trafficked persons to full

provide accurate and reliable information once they regain their psychological stability. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Special consideration for trafficked children 
</b></p>
<p>53. While the elements of the right to an effective remedy equally apply to trafficked 
children, responses vis-&#224;-vis trafficked children warrant special consideration, having 
regard to &#8220;the particular physical, psychological and psychosocial harm suffered by 
trafficked children and their increased vulnerability to exploitation&#8221;, 47 as well as their lack 
of full legal standing. Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Palermo Protocol also recognizes that in 
providing protection and assistance to trafficked persons, &#8220;the age, gender and special 
needs of victims of trafficking in persons, in particular the special needs of children&#8221; should 
be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>54. At a minimum, the realization of the right to an effective remedy for trafficked 
children should be guided by the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. In particular, the principle that the best interests of the child shall be a primary 
consideration in all actions concerning children should be placed at the centre of all efforts 
to provide remedies for trafficked children. This principle entails respect for children&#8217;s 
rights and freedoms accorded to them under international human rights law, as well as for 
the children&#8217;s views on their best interests with due weight given in accordance with the 
age and maturity of the children concerned. 
</p>
<p>55. The best interests of the child need to be carefully considered before deciding the 
course of action for trafficked children, particularly where it involves criminal proceedings. 
In many cases, the child&#8217;s participation in criminal proceedings may not be in his or her 
best interest where, for example, he or she is interviewed repeatedly, required to provide 
testimony in court in the presence of the traffickers, subjected to hostile questioning by the 
traffickers or their legal representative, or effective witness protection is not in place to 
guarantee the privacy and security of the child and his or her family members. Thus, in 
determining whether a trafficked child should be involved in criminal proceedings, the 
benefits of such involvement should be carefully weighed against any negative 
consequences in order to ensure that it is indeed in the best interests of the particular child. 
</p>
<p>56. From States&#8217; perspectives, these concerns translate into the obligation to implement 
child-sensitive court procedures which effectively protect the rights and interests of 
children. In particular, the Legislative Guide to the Palermo Protocol unequivocally stresses 
the importance of avoiding direct contact between the child victim and the suspected 
offender, and according child witnesses special protection measures to ensure their safety.48 
Thus, States should, for instance, allow procedural measures to obtain the child&#8217;s testimony 
without the presence of the trafficker, such as allowing video-recording of testimony, 
examination via videoconference, or written statements in lieu of in-court testimony. Child-
sensitive court procedures may also require adequate training of relevant law enforcement 
officials, such as police officers, lawyers, prosecutors and judges, in the rights of trafficked 
children. In this regard, it has been noted that there are benefits in forming a multi-
stakeholder group to allow law enforcement officials to work together with social workers 
and other service providers responsible for the care of exploited children, including 
</p>
<p>  
 47 Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, guideline 8, 
</p>
<p>p. 10. 
 48 UNODC, <i>Legislative Guides </i>(note 16 above), part two, para. 65 (b).  </p>


<p>trafficked children, to ensure the provision of appropriate care and support, as well as the 
prosecution of the perpetrators.49 
</p>
<p>57. Consideration of the best interests of the child also extends to the question of what 
form of reparation would be most appropriate for the child. For example, while the right to 
compensation should be equally available to trafficked children and adult trafficked 
persons, many children do not have bank accounts and the capacity to manage money. 
Where the child&#8217;s parents were complicit in the crime of trafficking, it may not be in the 
best interests of the child to transfer the compensation payment to the parents on trust for 
the child. From this perspective, there is a need to frame remedies for trafficked children 
more broadly and creatively. The best interests of the child formula suggests that reparative 
measures for trafficked children should be geared towards building a comprehensive child 
protection system which guarantees children&#8217;s rights, such as the right to education, the 
right to health and the right to physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration 
in the case of child victims of exploitation. In this regard, the repatriation and reintegration 
programme for the Pakistani child camel jockeys mentioned in paragraph 21 above is a 
unique example of linking the entitlement to a monthly cash grant to the school attendance 
rate of 80 per cent by the children. 
</p>
<p>58. Another general principle of the Convention on the Rights of the Child that is 
specifically relevant in this context is that States are required to respect the rights of 
children to express their views freely in all matters affecting them and to provide them with 
the opportunity to be heard in any relevant judicial and administrative proceedings. In order 
to enable the child to enjoy such participation, it is crucial to guarantee that the child has 
effective access to information on all matters affecting his or her interests, such as his or her 
situation, entitlements, services available and the family reunification and/or repatriation 
processes.50 A study of children&#8217;s experiences of reparations programmes reveals that in 
many cases, children &#8220;lack access to adequate information presented in a child-friendly 
format, often because they are not explicitly considered&#8230;&#8221;.51 While the study did not 
particularly focus on trafficked children, it clearly points to the lacuna in the provision of 
relevant information to children who are entitled to seek reparations for the harms suffered. 
</p>
<p>59. The need to ensure active participation of children also implies that the child should 
be provided with legal representation without costs to the child, as well as with 
interpretation into the native language of the child, as necessary. In a number of States, 
children are entitled by law to access to legal assistance. It is not clear, however, to what 
extent this right has been implemented in practice, as many States do not keep track of the 
number of trafficked children receiving legal assistance.52 It has also been reported by 
practitioners that trafficked children have limited access to lawyers who are specifically 
trained in children&#8217;s rights and the issues of child trafficking, which is compounded by the 
lack of legal and interpretative assistance provided to trafficked persons in general.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> All States of origin, transit or destination have an international legal obligation 
to provide remedies for trafficked persons where an act or omission attributable to 
them breaches an international obligation. In the context of trafficking, which 
involves in most cases the conduct of private persons, it is important to recall that 
States are under an obligation to provide remedies for trafficked persons where they 
fail to exercise due diligence to prevent and combat trafficking in persons or to protect 
the human rights of trafficked persons. The right to an effective remedy is also a 
fundamental human right in itself and States have a duty to respect, protect and fulfil 
this right. While discussions on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons 
at the international level often focus on the right to compensation, it is stressed that 
other components, such as recovery, restitution, satisfaction and guarantees of non-
repetition, are equally important aspects of a remedy. Viewed from this perspective, 
an effective remedy necessarily calls for individually tailored measures, based on a 
careful assessment of the best interests of that particular trafficked person. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The importance of implementing this right in a holistic manner has received 
peripheral attention by States, which instead tend to focus on criminal justice 
responses. Trafficked persons are often seen as &#8220;instruments&#8221; of criminal 
investigation, rather than as holders of rights. In many States, trafficked persons do 
not receive remedies in a holistic manner as a matter of right, but are only provided 
with ad hoc measures which are effectively by-products of criminal investigation, such 
as temporary residence permits contingent upon cooperation with law enforcement 
authorities and assistance in recovery which is in turn tied to temporary residence 
permits. Trafficked persons are rarely known to have received compensation, as they 
are often not provided with the information, legal and other assistance and residence 
status necessary to access it.  At worst, many trafficked persons are wrongly identified 
as irregular migrants, detained and deported before they have an opportunity to even 
consider seeking remedies. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> In the light of these challenges, the Special Rapporteur submits the draft basic 
principles on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons in annex I to the 
present document. These basic principles are a work in progress, as the Special 
Rapporteur intends to continue refining them on the basis of inputs she may receive. 
The Special Rapporteur hopes that the basic principles serve as a useful guidance for 
States and practitioners on the content and scope of the right to an effective remedy 
for trafficked persons and also as indicators of the minimum obligations of States in 
the realization of this right. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> In the efforts to enhance the implementation of the right to an effective remedy 
for trafficked persons, the Special Rapporteur also makes the following 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Accurate identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> States should ensure that relevant authorities and officials, such as police, 
border guards, and immigration officials, are adequately trained in the identification 
of trafficked persons to allow rapid and accurate identification of trafficked persons. 
Proper identification of trafficked persons is the first step in ensuring that trafficked 
persons have the opportunity to seek remedies as victims of human rights violations. </b></p>


<p><b>  Recovery 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>States should provide trafficked persons with assistance in realizing their full 
recovery on a non-conditional basis, duly taking into account the individual 
circumstances and needs of each trafficked person. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>States should provide trafficked persons with a reflection and recovery period 
of at least 90 days once they are identified as trafficked persons in order to ensure 
their full physical and psychological recovery and to make an informed decision about 
their course of action. This period should be provided separately and independently of 
temporary residence permits and trafficked persons should be given medical, 
psychological, legal, social and other assistance they may require for their recovery 
during this period on an unconditional basis. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> As a strategy to enhance the right of trafficked persons to successfully seek 
compensation, States should ensure that trafficked persons are equipped with the 
means, assistance and status necessary to exercise this right, namely, access to 
information, free legal assistance and other assistance necessary to ensure their full 
recovery, and regular residence status. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> Particular attention should be paid in legal proceedings involving trafficked 
persons to procedural guarantees such as the right to privacy, safety and witness 
protection. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> Increased efforts should be made to train key stakeholders, in particular 
prosecutors and judges, on laws and issues pertaining to trafficking in persons. 
Training, education and sensitization aimed at other actors, and society at large, could 
also make a crucial contribution to the effective implementation of the right to an 
effective remedy for trafficked persons, including through the promotion of a victims&#8217; 
rights culture and measures to counter stigma. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> States should establish legislative provisions for the confiscation of assets and 
proceeds of trafficking offences, and for the use of such assets and proceeds to 
compensate trafficked persons. States should also adequately train law enforcement 
officials in identifying, tracing, freezing and confiscating assets connected to the crime 
of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Where State-funded compensation schemes for victims of crime exist, States 
should abolish eligibility criteria which have the effect of preventing trafficked 
persons from seeking compensation, such as nationality and long-term residence 
requirements. Where no compensation scheme exists, States should consider 
establishing one that provides compensation to trafficked persons and using 
confiscated assets and tax deductible voluntary donations to finance such a scheme. 
Compensation through such scheme should be available to all groups of trafficked 
persons on a non-discriminatory basis.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  Provision of information 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> States should establish and effectively implement obligations on the part of 
relevant authorities and officials who come into contact with trafficked persons to 
provide them with information on the right to a remedy, mechanisms and procedures 
available to exercise this right, and how and where to obtain necessary assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> States should develop guidelines on the appropriate form, content and language 
of the information to be provided to trafficked persons and ensure that they properly 
apply the guidelines. In such guidelines, States should ensure that information is easily </b></p>


<p><b>accessible in a variety of forms and available in a language that trafficked persons 
understand, not only from a linguistic perspective but also cultural and socio-
economic perspectives.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Provision of free legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>States should provide legal assistance to trafficked persons on a free-of-charge 
basis as an essential pre-condition for all trafficked persons to exercise their right to 
an effective remedy. States should ensure that lawyers providing such assistance have 
received adequate training in the rights of trafficked persons including children, and 
in effective communications with victims of human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Regularization of residence status 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>States should provide trafficked persons with temporary residence permits 
during the duration of any legal proceedings on an unconditional basis. The 
conditionality of temporary residence permits on cooperation with law enforcement 
authorities is the antithesis of the human rights-based approach to combating 
trafficking in persons and should be abolished. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>States should also provide trafficked persons with temporary or permanent 
residence permits on social and humanitarian grounds, where a safe return to the 
country of origin is not guaranteed or a return would not otherwise be in the best 
interests of the trafficked person for reasons related to his or her personal 
circumstances, such as the loss of citizenship or cultural and social identity in the 
country of origin. States should also independently consider trafficked persons&#8217; claims 
for asylum, giving due consideration to any risks of reprisals and retaliation by 
traffickers which could constitute persecution within the meaning of the 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Special consideration for trafficked children: 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>States should ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary 
consideration in all decisions or actions that affect trafficked children, whether 
undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, 
administrative authorities or legislative bodies. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>States should develop child-sensitive court procedures which effectively protect 
the rights and interests of children in order to enable them to exercise their right to an 
effective remedy in a meaningful manner. To this end, States should implement 
specific protective measures, such as a witness protection programme to preclude 
direct contact between the accused and the child, alternatives to direct testimony, and 
a multi-disciplinary team equipped with social workers to support the child 
throughout the court proceedings.</b>     
</p>
<p>79. <b>States should ensure that trafficked children are equipped with information on 
all matters affecting their interests, including their situation, legal options, 
entitlements and services available to them, and processes of family reunification or 
repatriation. States should encourage trafficked children to express their views and 
give them due consideration in accordance with their age and maturity.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>States should ensure that trafficked children are provided with legal, 
interpretative and other assistance necessary in order for them to seek remedies. 
States should ensure that professionals providing such assistance are adequately 
trained in children&#8217;s rights and the issues of child trafficking.</b> </p>


<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Draft basic principles on the right to an effective remedy for 
trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Rights and obligations 
</b></p>
<p>1. Trafficked persons as victims of human rights violations have the right to an 
effective remedy for harms committed against them. 
</p>
<p>2. All States, including countries of origin, transit and destination,<b> </b>are obliged to 
provide or facilitate access to remedies that are fair, adequate and appropriate to all 
trafficked persons within their respective territory and subject to their respective 
jurisdiction, including non-citizens, for harms committed against them. 
</p>
<p>3. The right to an effective remedy encompasses both a substantive right to reparations 
and procedural rights necessary to access reparations.   
</p>
<p>4. In substance, trafficked persons should be provided with adequate reparations for the 
harms suffered, which may include restitution, compensation, recovery, satisfaction, and 
guarantees of non-repetition.   
</p>
<p>5. Trafficked persons should also be provided with access to a competent and 
independent authority in order to successfully obtain reparations. This necessitates, at a 
minimum, the provision of: 
</p>
<p> (a) Information concerning their rights, the reparations available and the 
existence of and modalities for accessing reparation mechanisms;   
</p>
<p> (b) Legal, medical, psychological, social, administrative and other assistance 
necessary in seeking remedies;  
</p>
<p> (c) A reflection and recovery period, followed by residence status while 
trafficked persons seek remedies.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Realizing the right to a remedy 
</b></p>
<p>6. States shall: <b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Ensure that adequate procedures are in place to enable quick and accurate 
identification of trafficked persons and provide adequate training to law enforcement and 
other agencies that might come in contact with trafficked persons; 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensure that trafficked persons are not subjected to discriminatory treatment in 
law or in practice on any ground, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, including their age, 
their status as victims of trafficking, their occupation or types of exploitation to which they 
have been subjected; 
</p>
<p> (c) Give due consideration to individual circumstances of trafficked persons to 
ensure that remedies are centered on the empowerment of trafficked persons and full 
respect for their human rights. At a minimum, States should &#8220;do no harm&#8221; and ensure that 
remedial proceedings are not detrimental or prejudicial to the rights of trafficked persons 
and their psychological and physical safety. </p>


<p><i> (a) Restitution 
</i></p>
<p>7. States shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Place the best interests of trafficked persons at the centre in providing 
measures of restitution; 
</p>
<p> (b) Provide trafficked persons with temporary or permanent residence status as a 
form of remedy where a safe return to the country of origin cannot be guaranteed, may 
place them at risk of persecution or further human rights violations, or is otherwise not in 
their best interests; 
</p>
<p> (c) Effectively address the root causes of trafficking in order to ensure that 
trafficked persons are not returned to the pre-existing situation which places them at risk of 
being re-trafficked or further human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Recovery  
</i></p>
<p>8. States shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Provide a non-conditional reflection and recovery period, during which 
trafficked persons are provided with measures necessary for the physical, psychological and 
social recovery, including, but are not limited to: appropriate housing, counselling and 
information about their situations and legal rights; medical, psychological and material 
assistance; and employment, educational and training opportunities;   
</p>
<p> (b) Ensure that trafficked persons&#8217; access to assistance and other benefits are 
under no circumstances dependent upon their cooperation in legal proceedings. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Compensation 
</i></p>
<p>9. States shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensure that laws, mechanisms and procedures are in place to enable 
trafficked persons, if they desire, to: 
</p>
<p>(i) Obtain<b> </b>civil damages for trafficking-related offences,<b> </b>including breaches of 
labour laws;  
</p>
<p>(ii) Secure awards or orders from criminal courts for compensation from persons 
convicted of trafficking-related offences; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Gain access to compensation from the State for injuries and damages. 
</p>
<p> (b) Address the common obstacles for trafficked persons to obtain compensation 
for their material and non-material damage. To this end, they should ensure that: 
</p>
<p>(i) All trafficked persons<b> </b>have a legally enforceable right to obtain 
compensation, irrespective of their immigration status and of whether their 
perpetrators have been convicted; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Trafficked persons are fully informed of their legal rights, including their 
rights to have access to remedies through judicial, labour and administrative 
proceedings, promptly and in a language and form they understand; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Trafficked persons seeking to access remedies are provided with necessary 
assistance to this end, including social assistance, free and qualified legal aid 
and representation, and, where necessary, qualified interpreters, regardless of 
their immigration status; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Trafficked persons are allowed to lawfully remain in the country in which the 
remedy is being sought for the duration of any criminal, civil, labour or </p>


<p>administrative proceedings<b>,</b> without prejudice to any claim they may have to 
the right to remain on a more permanent basis as a remedy in itself; 
</p>
<p>(v) Laws and procedures are in place to support the seizure of the proceeds of 
trafficking and confiscation of traffickers&#8217; assets, and explicitly indicate that 
such proceeds and assets are intended in the first instance to compensate 
trafficked persons and in the second instance for general provision of 
remedies to trafficked persons; 
</p>
<p>(vi) Effective measures are in place for the enforcement of reparation judgements 
including foreign judgements. 
</p>
<p>10. In cases of trafficked women and girls who have been subjected to sexual and 
gender-based violence, States should take into account potential risks of psychological 
harm, stigma and communal and family ostracism that judicial proceedings may impose on 
them and provide measures to afford adequate protection to those women and girls affected, 
while creating opportunities to seek compensation through non-judicial avenues. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Trafficked children  
</b></p>
<p>11. States shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in 
providing trafficked children with remedies, taking into account the individual 
circumstances of the child, including his or her age, upbringing, ethnic, cultural and 
linguistic background and protection needs; 
</p>
<p> (b) Respect the child&#8217;s right to express his or her views freely in all matters 
affecting the child. To this end, States should provide trafficked children with effective 
access to information on all matters affecting their interests, such as their situation, 
entitlements, services available and the family reunification and/or repatriation process; 
</p>
<p> (c) Take measures to ensure adequate and appropriate training, in particular legal 
and psychological training, for persons working with trafficked children on specific rights 
and obligations in cases involving children. </p>


<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary note of the online discussion on the draft basic 
principles on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked 
persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 2 to 21 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Ms. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, launched an online discussion forum 
at the UN.GIFT.HUB website (http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/) to solicit inputs from 
experts and stakeholders on the &#8220;draft basic principles on the right to an effective remedy&#8221;. 
These principles are intended to serve as a useful guidance for States and practitioners on 
the content and scope of the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons and also as 
indicators of the minimum obligations of States in the realization of this right. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Summary of the discussion  
</b></p>
<p>2. The main topics discussed were: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Content of the right to an effective remedy  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Integration of gender perspectives in ensuring remedies for trafficked persons  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identification of trafficked persons  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Notion of restitution  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regular residence status  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Rehabilitation, recovery and reintegration  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Remedies for trafficked children 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Compensation funds for trafficked persons  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation between States and civil society organizations  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Content and format of the draft basic principles  
</p>
<p><i>  Content of the right to an effective remedy  
</i></p>
<p>3. Drawing on various international, regional and national instruments, one participant 
took the view that &#8220;the principles that should underlie all protection policy and remedies to 
protect the rights of trafficking victims&#8221; include &#8220;the right to: safety and protection; 
individual identity; privacy and confidentiality; dignity; information; services; justice; 
normality; participation; decision making; and, freedom of movement&#8221;.  He cited &#8220;the 
Cambodian Policy and Minimum Standards for the Protection of the Rights of Victim of 
Human Trafficking&#8221; as a good example of upholding these rights through the various stages 
of the protection response, namely: victim identification; crisis intervention; referral; 
reception; case planning; assessment; recovery; reintegration; follow-up; and, case closure. 
</p>
<p>4. There was general consensus among the participants that the appropriate form of 
remedy may differ from individual to individual, as trafficked persons have &#8220;individual 
needs and require individually tailored responses&#8221;.  A &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach is not 
applicable, as &#8220;individuals will be affected in very different ways and their recovery and 
reintegration will differ depending on their experiences, background, resilience, support 
network and environment. Some may just need access to universal/generic services while 
others will require specialist support&#8221;.  </p>


<p>5. Asked whether &#8220;rehabilitation / recovery&#8221; should form part of the right to an 
effective remedy, there was general consensus that rehabilitation / recovery is one of the 
essential components.  One participant commented that &#8220;for some victims in particular, the 
provision of medical, psychological and social services is critical to their recovery&#8221;.  A 
number of participants expressed views that a remedy is more than just money. Thus, while 
monetary compensation may be an important remedy, it is by no means the only 
appropriate response. 
</p>
<p><i>  Integration of gender perspectives in ensuring remedies for trafficked persons  
</i></p>
<p>6. One participant elaborated on how gender discrimination leads to extreme financial 
deprivation of women and girls, which in turn leaves them vulnerable to be exploited and 
abused.  Women and girls often experience gender-based social exclusion and 
discrimination, which reduce their chance of obtaining education and prospects of adequate 
income generation.  Further, &#8220;young girls and women who have received little, if any, 
education have no comprehension of their rights&#8221;.  In her view, &#8220;all these dynamics play 
into the hands of traffickers who are able to easily deceive and control.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>7. One participant discussed barriers to access to justice for women and girls, which 
include &#8220;cost of litigation to seek remedies, proximity and complexity of the justice system 
and high potential to face stigma&#8221;.  &#8220;Social expectations from women and family pressure&#8221; 
were also cited as an obstacle to women pursuing justice.  The same participant stressed 
that remedies that will not compromise on protection for women should be provided, and 
&#8220;opportunities to secure monetary compensation should also be strengthened in view of oft 
financial dependency of victim on trafficker(s)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. Another participant commented that in addition to gender, consideration of other 
factors such as cultural diversity, urban-rural divide, difference among generations, cultural 
and linguistic minorities, requires particular attention. 
</p>
<p><i>  Identification of trafficked persons  
</i></p>
<p>9. In reference to the provision in the draft basic principle which provides that &#8220;the 
identification and formal recognition of trafficked persons as such, is an essential pre-
requisite for the realization of the right to a remedy&#8221; (principle 5), one participant noted the 
difficulty in ensuring that the international definition of &#8220;trafficked person&#8221; is applied 
consistently to allow such identification and recognition.  For example, she noted an 
example in New Zealand where an internal victim of trafficking is not recognized as a 
trafficked person.  Further, she noted that trafficked persons are often misidentified, as it is 
often easier and less resource intensive for law enforcement authorities to treat them as 
irregular migrants and detain or deport them, rather than to recognize them as trafficked 
persons.  
</p>
<p><i>  Notion of restitution  
</i></p>
<p>10. The participants recognised that the term &#8220;restitution&#8221; gives rise to interpretative 
difficulties in the context of trafficking.  As one participant noted, &#8220;restitution typically 
refers to the return of something to its rightful owner, payment of compensation, and 
restoration&#8221;.  Thus, if &#8220;restitution&#8221; is taken to mean &#8220;efforts aimed at the return of 
something (or someone) to its (their) previous condition&#8221;, then &#8220;restoration to such a point 
as preceding their last experience of human trafficking, will only render them vulnerable to 
further exploitation&#8221;.  The participants agreed that simply sending a person who has 
survived trafficking back to his/her original state would not be a form of effective remedy. 
One participant described it as being &#8220;tantamount to placing them back to an 
&#8216;imprisonment&#8217; of a different kind&#8221;. </p>


<p>11. In this context, the same participant noted wide dimensions of one&#8217;s well-being, 
quoting Amartya Sen who described well-being as &#8220;the freedom of individuals to live a life 
that allows them to fulfil their capacities, to have sufficient available resources to be able to 
enjoy a healthy life, to have access to knowledge and the freedom to interact socially and 
contribute expression and thought&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>Regular residence status </i> 
</p>
<p>12. The participants agreed that trafficked persons should be provided with regular 
residence on a short- or long-term basis, as it is difficult to access remedies if they are at 
risk of deportation.  The participants also seemed to agree that permanent residence in the 
destination region / country should be a remedy in itself, not dependent on legal 
proceedings.  Where trafficked persons are at risk of being re-trafficked or do not wish to 
return to the country of origin, &#8220;having the option of staying would be a significant step in 
their healing&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><i>  Rehabilitation, recovery and reintegration  
</i></p>
<p>13. One participant commented that effective remedies with regard to 
rehabilitation/recovery and reintegration should primarily focus on building upon the 
strengths already present within the person; what he/she needs in order to rebuild his/her 
life to a point where he/she is able to re-enter and begin once more to actively participate in 
their community of choice.  It is a process where the best interests of the survivor should be 
placed at the centre, and thus &#8220;any options explored with regard to rehabilitation and 
recovery will take into account the person&#8217;s wishes, hopes and aspirations, and will also be 
fully aware of, and respect, differences of gender and cultural understandings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. To ensure rehabilitation/recovery, one participant took the view that as an absolute 
minimum, States should, without delay, provide access to: &#8220;secure shelter; food and 
clothing; access to supportive personnel who will assist and guide the person (ideally a 
locally based NGO); information and legal representation which takes into account the 
person&#8217;s first language and cultural background; and access to health services, and 
monetary support&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. In this connection, the same participant stressed the important role of &#8220;an 
appropriate reflection delay period&#8221; in ensuring recovery.  She stated that &#8220;the length of this 
period should take into account the person&#8217;s individual needs, such as access to health 
services/counselling, legal and professional advice, so as to ensure adequate time to fully 
support a return to health and wholeness&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>16. In response to the question as to what the guiding principles should be in providing 
services to assist recovery of trafficked persons, one participant questioned whether there is 
a need for new guidelines or it is more appropriate to make better use of existing 
instruments and guidelines.  In this connection, the participant made a reference to the 
UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Children from Trafficking and the ILO child-
friendly standards and guidelines on the recovery and integration of trafficked children. 
</p>
<p>17. Another participant suggested the following guiding principles in providing services 
to assist recovery of trafficked persons: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Placing people at the heart- Adopting a &#8216;people centred&#8217; approach which consistently 
places the wellbeing and best interests of the person first. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Respecting the sovereignty of the individual - Ensuring that all available 
rehabilitation/recovery services are both self directed and empowering. Whilst 
acknowledging some guidance may be initially necessary, nonetheless survivors of 
trafficking need to have some control over decisions made and be able to implement 
choices with regards to their rehabilitation. </p>


<p>&#8226; Celebrating the uniqueness of each person. An acknowledgment that each person&#8217;s 
road to recovery is unique, whilst there may be similarities in trafficking, each 
person&#8217;s experiences, set of circumstances arising from being a victim, and now a 
survivor, is distinctive. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Respecting and treasuring each person&#8217;s distinctiveness. Recognising and valuing a 
person&#8217;s identity beyond being labelled as &#8216;victim&#8217;, including their cultural 
background, beliefs and current worldview, as a fundamental right. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A focus on optimal health and wellbeing. Adopting a healing process that is 
deliberately holistic in approach and takes seriously the whole needs of a person, and 
not simply his/her physical requirements. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Building community. Part of the journey towards recovery will necessitate a process 
of rebuilding life after being victimised. Survivors of trafficking need, above all, to 
have hope and real opportunities to re-engage in a community, to rebuild, in some 
cases, family relationships, whilst for others it may mean opportunities for education, 
employment and safe shelter that is not necessarily back in their home country, 
although for some, this well may be the case.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>  Remedies for trafficked children 
</i></p>
<p>18. One participant discussed the remedy of &#8220;reintegration assistance&#8221; for children, 
which &#8220;typically includes some or all of the following remedies: preventing stigmatisation; 
education; training and employment; legal support; medial/health care; social services, 
psychological services&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. Drawing on the provision of reintegration and decision pertaining to placement of 
the child, the same participant quoted the following principles of Reimer et al (2007) which 
could guide the provision of remedies for trafficked persons:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do no harm&#8217; and &#8216;the best interests of the child&#8217; as the primary principles (2007:40); 
and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Additional seven principles: 1) Protection is paramount; 2)A child remains a 
family&#8217;s responsibility; 3) Family is best for a child; 4) Individual case management 
that respects the rights and wishes of the child and allows for flexible use of 
resources; 5) In order to facilitate eventual reintegration to society, alternative care 
facilities should &#8216;normalise&#8217; the life of children in care as much as possible; 6) 
Specialise and complement: do what you do well but don&#8217;t try to do it all; 7) 
Expectations for success should be moderated by local realities&#8217; (2007:43-46).  
</p>
<p>20. Another participant echoed the view that the primary principles should be &#8220;do no 
harm&#8221; and &#8220;the best interests of the child&#8221;, which require &#8220;individual responses that are 
culturally appropriate, working with family and community, not just the child, building 
children's resilience not just focussing on the harm caused&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>  Compensation funds for trafficked persons  
</i></p>
<p>21. One participant noted that a Trafficked Person Compensation Fund, financed by 
proceeds of the crime of trafficking, should be established.  On the other hand, another 
participant questioned whether it may be appropriate to argue for a fund specifically 
dedicated to trafficked persons.  In his view, &#8220;[i]n States that do not yet have such funds for 
any who have been harmed by crime, to isolate for special attention those who have been 
trafficked may backfire politically unless there is a very strong moral case for special 
treatment&#8221;.  Commenting specifically on the third point of Principle 6 of the draft basic 
principles, the participant suggested that for the time being, the following phrase should be 
deleted: &#8220;through a dedicated fund or, where appropriate, through effective and non-</p>


<p>discriminatory access to funds established to compensate persons for harms suffered under 
international human rights law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><i>  Cooperation between States and civil society organizations  
</i></p>
<p>22. Some participants commented on the important role of civil society organizations in 
providing assistance to trafficked persons in seeking redress.  Further, they highlighted the 
need for close cooperation between States and civil society organizations.   
</p>
<p><i>  Content and format of the draft basic principles  
</i></p>
<p>23. One participant recommended that the draft basic principles include:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A preamble that restates the recognition of trafficking in persons as a crime and that 
victims are entitled to a remedy under international law;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; References to other international conventions and guidelines which are relevant to 
the right to an effective remedy of trafficked persons;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A brief summary of the components of an effective remedy; and
