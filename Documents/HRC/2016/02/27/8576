<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur undertook an official visit to Senegal between 21 and 30 
October 2009, during which she held meetings with stakeholders in Dakar, Saint-Louis and 
Mbour. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Senegal for its hospitality and 
help in organizing meetings with relevant government officials and for its cooperation 
during and after the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In Dakar, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Young People, the 
Ministry of the Family, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Tourism and the 
Ministry of the Interior. She spoke with representatives of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Promotion of Peace, the Child Protection Support 
Unit and the Senegalese Human Rights Committee. In Saint-Louis, the Special Rapporteur 
met with the Governor, the Prosecutor General, senior officers attached to the Urban 
Security Unit at the central police station, senior gendarmerie officers and the directors of 
the Technical Monitoring Committee.1 She also met with directors of the Technical 
Monitoring Committee (TMC) in Mbour. 
</p><p>3. In all three regions, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of national and 
international non-governmental organizations and associations working in the child 
protection field. She also visited care facilities for children at risk.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the specialized agencies &#8212; namely, the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) &#8212; represented on the 
United Nations country team and which also participated in the joint working meetings 
organized by the Resident Coordinator of the country team. She would also like to thank 
the West Africa Regional Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights in Dakar for its assistance and invaluable advice.  
</p>
<p>5. The objective of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was to review the current situation 
with regard to the problems of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
and to evaluate the State&#8217;s response in terms of providing protection for child victims of 
trafficking and sexual exploitation and children at particular risk because of their more 
vulnerable situation (street children, children not registered at birth, children without a 
family, migrant children, child workers and children living in poor families or in rural 
areas). During her visit, the Special Rapporteur solicited the views of all stakeholders on 
the status of children&#8217;s rights in Senegal and on the measures adopted and action taken to 
consolidate and strengthen their rights, with a view to making appropriate 
recommendations. At the end of her visit, the Special Rapporteur shared her preliminary 
observations with the relevant State authorities and with the press.  
</p>
<p><b> II. National context  
</b></p>
<p>6. Senegal has a population of 11.9 million, over a quarter of which is concentrated in 
the Dakar region. Children under 14 years of age account for 42 per cent of inhabitants. In 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Established within the framework of the Programme to Combat Trafficking and the Worst Forms of 
</p>
<p>Child Labour, see below.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-17961 
</p>
<p>2009, Senegal occupied 166th place (out of 180) in the Human Development Index.2 
Almost 23 per cent of children are orphans, and 39.8 per cent of children aged under 5 have 
not been registered at birth.3  
</p>
<p>7. With regard to education, a report issued by the Senegalese Ministry of Justice 
which analyses the problem of trafficking in human beings, particularly women and 
children, and sets out a national plan of action for combating it,4 indicates that parents have 
a tendency to remove their children from school and send them out in search of 
employment at an early age. These children &#8212; young people growing up outside traditional 
systems of social interaction who are given the heavy burden of providing for their needs or 
those of their family &#8212; are exposed to the risk of exclusion and, as a consequence, liable to 
fall victim to sale, trafficking and exploitation. The existence of an informal education 
system &#8212; principally the Koranic schools or <i>daaras</i> &#8212; alongside the formal system is 
another point of note. Regulations governing the teaching given in the <i>daaras</i> are currently 
being drafted.  
</p>
<p>8. The Ministry of Justice report on trafficking reveals that certain sociocultural 
practices such as <i>confiage</i>, early placement in employment and the <i>talib&#233;</i> phenomenon are 
very widespread.5 <i>Confiage</i> denotes a practice commonplace in Senegal and other West 
African countries whereby parenting responsibilities are delegated to persons other than the 
child&#8217;s biological parents. In Senegal, the practice is referred to as <i>yaar doom</i>, meaning 
&#8220;child-rearing&#8221;.6 In practice, <i>yaar doom</i> entails parents sending children to stay with family 
members or to Koranic schools that are sometimes a long way from their town or village of 
origin. Under this system, children follow an educational programme while at the same 
time, in many cases, contributing to the informal economy. In most cases, parents lack the 
financial resources to contribute to the costs of the institutions and it is not uncommon for 
children to be exploited sexually and economically.7 For example, children are often forced 
to beg to provide for their own needs and those of their teacher. The Ministry of Justice 
report emphasizes that the traditional practices of child migration and placing children with 
members of the extended family are not wrong per se &#8211; quite the opposite in fact, as they 
provide a stepping stone to a better future for thousands of young girls and boys. However, 
the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to &#8220;distinguish between children placed outside 
the family in the context of these traditional practices and child victims of trafficking and 
exploitation&#8221;.8

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Situation analysis  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Incidence of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>9. According to a report published by Save the Children Sweden in 2003, around 
500,000 minors in Senegal are affected by practices that constitute the worst forms of child 
labour, as defined in International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 182.  
</p><p>10. All stakeholders interviewed attested to the existence of domestic and international 
child trafficking for the purposes of sexual and/or economic exploitation. However, the 
Special Rapporteur notes differences in the perceived meaning of the concepts of &#8220;sale&#8221; and 
&#8220;trafficking&#8221; of children, which are often confused and even used interchangeably. 
Stakeholders referred to cases of illegal international adoption, child trafficking in sports 
and trafficking in young girls for domestic labour purposes, as well as a few cases in which 
children were rented out for varying purposes. The stakeholders interviewed also informed 
the Special Rapporteur that all forms of commercial sexual exploitation of children 
appeared to be on the increase.  
</p>
<p>11. There are no official statistics for the number of child victims of sale or sexual 
exploitation. The Prosecutor General in Saint-Louis reported that only one case of child 
prostitution, involving a girl aged 14, had been brought before the juvenile courts. The girl 
in question had been placed in the care of the community educative action services. 
However, the authorities were unable to provide any official statistics concerning the 
number of legal proceedings initiated in Senegal relating to the sale and sexual exploitation 
of children and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>12. There are also no official statistics for sex tourism. According to the African 
network of ECPAT International, Senegal is among the countries most affected by sex 
tourism. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur also heard allegations that early marriage was a continuing 
practice.  
</p>
<p>14. In the Saint-Louis region, according to the Governor, the main problems are begging 
by <i>talib&#233;</i> children, followed by the economic exploitation of children in the fishing industry 
under the cover of &#8220;apprenticeships&#8221; or &#8220;training&#8221;. However, the Governor indicated that 
there was no trafficking in the Saint-Louis region.  
</p>
<p>15. The situation of children who beg on the streets is worrying. According to a joint 
report by the World Bank, ILO and UNICEF in November 2007, there were around 7,600 
child beggars in the Dakar region. Their average age was around 11, although the youngest 
was only 2 years old and around half were under 10. Almost all these child beggars were 
boys; very few girls are affected. According to the report, the vast majority of child beggars 
(90 per cent) are <i>talib&#233;</i> children.9  
16. The report states that the incidence of child beggars is essentially the result of 
migratory flows from regions more severely affected by poverty, drought and food 
insecurity. Around half of the child beggars are from outside Senegal, mostly from the 
neighbouring countries of Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali and the Gambia. <i>Talib&#233;</i> children 
are often originally from Guinea-Bissau (30 per cent), while non-<i>talib&#233;</i> children are more 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 The term &#8220;talib&#233;&#8221; is used in the report in question to describe any child who claimed to have spent the 
</p>
<p>night immediately preceding the survey in a Koranic institution (<i>daara</i>) and to be receiving religious 
instruction there.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-17961 
</p>
<p>likely to be from Mali (30 per cent). Although no national survey has been conducted, 
estimates indicate that there are around 50,000 child beggars in Senegal.10  
</p>
<p>17. The lack of information on the true scale of the problems of sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography is attributable to a number of factors, including the lack 
of a harmonized, centralized information system, insufficient knowledge of children&#8217;s 
rights and child protection law, the lack of easy access to police and the justice system and 
the lack of any centralized system for monitoring and evaluating children&#8217;s situation and 
the impact of any action taken to improve it. The Special Rapporteur would also like to 
draw attention to a number of other factors, including differences in the perceived meaning 
of the concepts of sale, trafficking, migration, economic exploitation and apprenticeship, 
the inadequacy of recourse and warning mechanisms, and the persistence of cultural 
resistance (failure to report offences for fear of reprisals and stigmatization) and of certain 
practices such as amicable settlements between the family of the child victim and the 
perpetrator, particularly in rural areas.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional instruments 
</b></p>
<p>18. Senegal is a party to the following international human rights instruments: the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, and its Optional Protocol, and the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>19. More specifically, Senegal is a party to the two optional protocols to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child &#8211; the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict. Senegal has also ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 
in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol), International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Convention No. 182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action 
for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour and International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Convention No. 138 concerning Minimum Age for Admission to 
Employment. 
</p>
<p>20. Senegal is not a party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, or to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (or its Optional Protocol), or to the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
Senegal has also not ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and 
Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption of 29 May 1993. 
</p>
<p>21. At the regional level, Senegal is a party to the African Charter on the Rights and 
Welfare of the Child and to the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights relating to the rights of women. 
</p>
<p>22. Senegal has also assumed commitments at the global level at the three world 
congresses against the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents held in Stockholm 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>(1996),11 Yokohama (2001),12 and more recently Rio de Janeiro (2008),13 and at the regional 
level at the Second Arab-African Forum against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse of Children 
held in Rabat in 2004.14 
</p>
<p>23. However, Senegal has yet to submit to the Committee on the Rights of the Child its 
initial report on the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which 
is due in 2005. The Senegalese authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that the initial 
report was in the drafting stages.  
</p>
<p>24. Senegal is also a signatory of the Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking 
in Human Beings launched by member States of the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) in 2001 and re-adopted at the Euro-African Ministerial Conference on 
Migration and Development that took place in Tripoli in 2006. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. Article 20 of the Constitution of Senegal establishes that &#8220;Young persons shall be 
protected by the State and by the public authorities against exploitation, drugs, narcotics, 
neglect and delinquency.&#8221; Article 21 stipulates that &#8220;The State and the public authorities 
shall establish the prerequisites and the public institutions that shall guarantee the education 
of children.&#8221; Act No. 99-05 of 1999 amends several provisions of the Criminal Code 
relating to the protection of children.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sale of children  
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur notes that Senegalese law neither defines nor prohibits the 
sale of children. The Ministry of Justice informed the Special Rapporteur that the concept 
of &#8220;sale of children&#8221; was a new one, but that the problem existed in the subregion. On this 
point, representatives of the Ministry highlighted that reforms of the Criminal Code that 
would prohibit the sale of children were under way. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur recalls that &#8220;sale of children&#8221; is a concept distinct from 
&#8220;trafficking in children&#8221; and should therefore be specifically defined and prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>  Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>28. Article 327 bis of the Criminal Code establishes a special procedure for cases 
involving minors exposed to prostitution, and for bringing them before the juvenile court. 
The court shall apply the protection measures established in the Code of Criminal 
Procedure.  
</p>
<p>29. Pursuant to article 12 of Act No. 2005-02 concerning measures to combat trafficking 
in human beings and related practices and establishing protection for victims, unless

<p><b>8</b> GE.10-17961 
</p>
<p>otherwise stipulated elsewhere, no proceedings may be brought or convictions handed 
down against victims of the offences covered therein. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prohibition of begging 
</b></p>
<p>30. Article 3 of Act No. 2005-02 prohibits begging and stipulates that any person who 
organizes the begging activities of others with a view to profiting therefrom or who recruits, 
coerces or misleads another person with a view to forcing them into begging or exerting 
pressure on them to beg, shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 2 to 5 years and a fine 
of between 500,000 and 2 million CFA francs. No suspension of sentence is permitted 
when the offence is committed against a minor. 
</p>
<p>31. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that the aforementioned article is 
inconsistent with the provisions of article 245 of the Criminal Code, which stipulates that 
begging is tolerated &#8220;on the days, in the places and in the circumstances confirmed by 
religious traditions&#8221;. It would be desirable to align the two texts, therefore, to ensure that 
the prohibition on child begging is applied consistently. The Special Rapporteur recalls 
article 21 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which 
recommends that States should &#8220;eliminate harmful social and cultural practices affecting 
the welfare, dignity, normal growth and development of the child&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>32. Article 320 bis of the Criminal Code stipulates that &#8220;any gesture, touch, caress, 
pornographic manipulation or use of images or sounds by any form of technical procedure 
for sexual purposes involving a child of either sex under 16 years of age shall constitute an 
act of paedophilia carrying a penalty of between 5 and 10 years&#8217; imprisonment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. Act No. 2008-11 of 25 January 2008 on cybercrime defines a minor as any person 
under the age of 18 within the meaning of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
&#8220;Child pornography&#8221; is defined as &#8220;any visual representation of any nature or form of a 
minor engaging in sexually explicit activity or any realistic image depicting a minor 
engaging in sexually explicit activity&#8221;. Article 431-34 of the Act establishes that any person 
who produces, records, offers, makes available, distributes or transmits images or visual 
representations of a child pornographic nature by means of a computer system shall be 
liable to imprisonment for a term of between 5 and 10 years and/or a fine of between 5 
million and 15 million CFA francs.  
</p>
<p><b>  Trafficking in children 
</b></p>
<p>34. Act No. 2005-02, adopted in 2005, incorporates the definition of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, contained in the Palermo Protocol, but does not 
give a specific definition of trafficking in children, as contained in article 3 of the Protocol. 
The maximum sentence is handed down when the offence is committed against a minor. 
</p>
<p><b>  Adoption 
</b></p>
<p>35. With regard to adoption, the Special Rapporteur observes that the current legal 
framework does not provide guarantees for adopted children. In this connection, she recalls 
the 2006 recommendation by the Committee on the Rights of the Child that Senegal should: 
&#8220;(a) regulate domestic adoption e.g. within the extended family and community, in 
accordance with the Convention with a view to strengthening protection of the rights of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-17961 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>adopted child; and (b) complete the process of ratification of the 1993 Hague Convention 
on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption&#8221;.15 
</p>
<p><b>  Early marriage 
</b></p>
<p>36. Article 300 of the Criminal Code prohibits marriages involving minors &#8220;under 13 
years of age&#8221;, and establishes that any person who commits or attempts to commit the 
sexual act with such minors shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of between 2 and 5 
years. In addition, article 111 of the Family Code sets a minimum marriageable age of 16 
for girls and 18 for boys. 
</p>
<p><b>  Other issues 
</b></p>
<p>37. Ministerial Decree No. 3749 defining and prohibiting the worst forms of child 
labour prohibits child begging, forced child labour and child servitude, including 
prostitution, as well as the involvement of children in pornographic acts, paedophilia, the 
production, transportation, sale and consumption of drugs and other illegal activities.  
</p>
<p>38. Criminal law is currently being reformed to harmonize offence definitions, increase 
penalties and establish a support and reparation fund for minors under the age of 18 who 
have been the victims of abuse, violence or exploitation. A children&#8217;s code is still in the 
drafting stages.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to learn that trafficking cases are heard in camera, 
as stipulated by law, to protect the identity and privacy of victims and witnesses.16 
Furthermore, &#8220;trial courts may also exempt victims and witnesses from the requirement to 
attend the hearing in person&#8221;.17 The Act also establishes that any minor who is a victim of 
trafficking must be assisted during the investigation and trial either by a counsel of their 
choosing or by a court-appointed counsel (art. 16 of Act No. 2005-02). 
</p><p>40. In March 2010, Senegal adopted a law declaring that slavery and the slave trade 
shall be considered crimes against humanity, becoming the first African nation to adopt 
legislation of this kind.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>41. The main ministry dealing with child-related issues is the Ministry of the Family, 
Food Security, Female Entrepreneurship, Microfinance and Early Childhood (Ministry of 
the Family). The Department for the Protection of Children&#8217;s Rights is responsible, inter 
alia, for ensuring consistency between domestic legislation and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The 
Department produces bimonthly, biannual and annual progress reports on the status of 
children.  
</p>
<p>42. The objectives of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Institutional Relations include 
ensuring access to essential socio-economic services for vulnerable groups. The Ministry 
organizes training for teenagers from poor families, care for <i>talib&#233;</i> and orphaned children 
and financial support to help teenagers who have completed their training find employment.  
</p>
<p>43. The Department of Correctional Education and Social Protection attached to the 
Ministry of Justice is mandated to provide legal protection of an educational and social 
</p>

</p>
<p>nature. The Department is tasked with organizing prevention initiatives for children in 
conflict with the law or otherwise at risk and for overseeing their training and 
rehabilitation.18 The community educative action services form part of this Department, 
which runs three types of centre: protection centres, social rehabilitation centres and multi-
purpose centres.  
</p>
<p>44. Juvenile courts have also been established for children in conflict with the law. 
According to the Ministry of Justice, as far as possible the juvenile courts avoid removing 
children from their family environment. There is also a detention centre for juveniles in 
conflict with the law which provides schooling and support for minors, but the Special 
Rapporteur did not visit this centre. According to information received, the juvenile courts 
lack financial and human resources. In addition, cooperation with the Children&#8217;s Unit is still 
insufficient.  
</p>
<p>45. The National Agency for Early Childhood and Preschool Reception Centres, 
attached to the General Secretariat of the Office of the President of the Republic, was 
created in 2004.19 The preschool reception centres, known as <i>cases des tout-petits</i>, provide 
day-care facilities for children up to the age of 6.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur also met with a representative of the Child Protection 
Support Unit, a body also attached to the Office of the President. The mandate of the Unit, 
which was created in March 2007, includes contributing to the formulation and 
implementation of national child protection policy, ensuring coherent service provision, 
fostering advocacy and social mobilization, developing a national system for collecting and 
disseminating data on vulnerable children, establishing a monitoring and evaluation system, 
and, lastly, mobilizing financial resources. With support from UNICEF, the Unit has also 
carried out research into child begging.  
</p>
<p>47. The Children&#8217;s Unit is a police unit specializing in child protection. However, its 
territorial jurisdiction is limited to the city of Dakar. Every police station in Senegal is 
required to inform the Unit of any incidents involving children, but this is rarely done. 
Based on information received, it would seem desirable to create units of this kind at the 
regional level, prioritizing the areas in which the incidence of child exploitation tends to be 
highest. There is also a Vice Squad that is supposed to prevent the sexual exploitation of 
children for tourism purposes. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the Partnership for the 
Withdrawal and Reinsertion of Street Children, a non-profit-making association subject to 
private law which is supported by international partners. The Partnership&#8217;s mission is to 
prevent child begging and children dropping out of their families and communities, to 
promote and raise awareness of children&#8217;s rights, to mobilize society and to generate 
resources. 
</p>
<p>49. The projects planned by the Partnership for the Withdrawal and Reinsertion of Street 
Children were not yet operational at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The 
Partnership aims to put its plans into action by entering into agreements with NGOs and 
decentralized State agencies at the local level.  
</p>
<p>50. The Senegalese Human Rights Committee, established by Act No. 97 of 2004, is an 
independent advisory body mandated to observe and evaluate the human rights situation, 
including the status of children&#8217;s rights, to promote respect for these rights and to foster 
related dialogue and cooperation. The Committee has 29 members, including eight NGO

<p>representatives, and is required to report on its activities annually. Lack of financial 
resources precludes the production of ad hoc reports on specific issues. The Committee 
forms part of the Committee responsible for consultations on the future children&#8217;s code.  
</p>
<p>51. According to the Senegalese Human Rights Committee, children very rarely contact 
it directly to report violations. They are more likely to turn to NGOs, and it then falls to the 
NGOs to report the violations to the Committee. The Committee works with the 
Department of Correctional Education and Social Protection and serves as a point of liaison 
between courts and NGOs when assisting the children placed in the various care centres 
under its jurisdiction.  
</p><p>52. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Promotion of 
Peace20 is attached to the Office of the President of the Republic. Despite being the 
recipient of all complaints of human rights violations, it is permitted neither to participate in 
the judicial process nor to challenge court decisions. Instead, its role is to monitor the 
implementation of international human rights treaties, in conjunction with the relevant 
departments, to coordinate preparation of the periodic reports that must be submitted to the 
international treaty bodies and to support the work of the Senegalese Human Rights 
Committee. It also advises the President of the Republic on how to deal with complaints 
filed and oversees implementation and follow-up of Presidential decisions.21 
</p>
<p>53. The High Commissioner&#8217;s representative informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
Office had received no complaints of violations of the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>54. The future children&#8217;s code will introduce an additional recourse mechanism in the 
form of a children&#8217;s ombudsman. The Special Rapporteur urges the Senegalese 
Government to keep her up-to-date on developments in this area.  
</p>
<p>55. Almost all stakeholders interviewed expressed frustration at the overlap and 
duplication in service delivery attributable to lack of coordination between the different 
bodies. Confusion reigns with regard to the delimitation and scope of the activities and 
responsibilities of each.  
</p>
<p>56. To rectify this situation, it has been decided that, with input from several specialized 
agencies and international organizations, the Child Protection Support Unit should make an 
inventory of all organizations working with child protection and seek to clarify the role and 
responsibilities of each in order to improve coordination and increase accountability.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Steps taken to address the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Strategies 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Programme to Combat Trafficking and the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
launched in 2000 was implemented by Decree No. 0756 and is coordinated by the Ministry 
of the Family. The Programme&#8217;s objective is to enhance Government capacity for designing 
and implementing local initiatives for combating trafficking and the worst forms of child 
labour (including begging, the forced labour of young girls, child abuse and sexual 
exploitation) and to ensure follow-up for these initiatives. Technical Monitoring 
Committees (TMCs) composed of local stakeholders drawn from the public and private 
sectors have been established to oversee the Programme&#8217;s implementation at the local level. 
The second phase of the project, which began in 2008, entails the creation of a support fund 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 Created by Decree No. 2004-657. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 Art. 12 of Decree No. 5691 of 6 July 2004. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-17961 
</p>
<p>to finance action proposed by vulnerable communities and associations, including 
children&#8217;s and young people&#8217;s associations. The fund is not yet in place and no evaluation 
of the implementation of the first phase of the action plan has been performed.  
</p>
<p>58. Within the framework of the Programme to Combat Trafficking and the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour, departmental action plans to address child abuse and sexual 
exploitation have been developed and implemented in Mbour and Saint-Louis. The 
objective of these action plans is to ascertain the nature, characteristics and scale of the 
problems, determine their causes and effects, formulate policies and intervention strategies, 
define the roles of the actors involved, and establish a framework for prevention, protection 
and reintegration. 
</p>
<p>59. The beneficiaries of these action plans are girls aged between 6 and 16 who are at 
risk of falling victim to sexual exploitation, teenage girls aged between 14 and 18 who are 
in conflict with the law, children living in intolerable situations, such as victims of abuse 
and physical violence, and street children aged between 10 and 16 who have lost all contact 
with their families. The TMCs work to strengthen local capacity for raising public 
awareness of children&#8217;s rights and act as children&#8217;s advocates in dealings with the 
marabouts.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur particularly commends the consultation work carried out by 
the Mbour TMC and the approach to children&#8217;s rights its members have chosen to adopt. 
The TMC, which is chaired by the Prefect of Mbour, has been operational since 2002 and 
meets every month to consider cases of child victims of trafficking, the worst forms of child 
labour, abuse and sexual exploitation. Where necessary, the TMC refers cases to the health 
services or to partner NGOs based in other countries which are able to provide assistance 
for child victims. In special cases, the monitoring and early warning system allows for 
children to be removed from their environment and placed in a reception centre or health 
facility, as appropriate. Where required, a member NGO will help find a lawyer for children 
in conflict with the law. However, according to TMC members the Committee does not 
have a network of lawyers which it can regularly call on for assistance. 
</p>
<p>61. The challenges the TMCs face include difficulties in accessing care because of the 
distance and costs involved, the lack of free legal aid, transportation and logistical problems 
(vehicles, computer equipment), and inadequate follow-up and evaluation of the care 
provided, resulting in a lack of data about children who have been reintegrated. Local 
actors mentioned the shortage of funding and a lack of human resources trained to provide 
effective care for child victims of abuse and sexual exploitation. In this connection a 
number of interviewees said that they would welcome the creation of a dedicated fund for 
the care of child victims. 
</p>
<p>62. Senegal is also in the process of drafting a National Action Plan for Combating 
Trafficking in Human Beings, especially Women and Children, which will be coordinated 
by the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>63. Working in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
Ministry of the Family has launched a project called Education for Family Life in the 
<i>Daaras</i> under which language teaching and vocational training will be provided to <i>talib&#233;</i> 
children, as well as assistance in developing income-generating activities that will help 
them escape poverty. 
</p>
<p>64. A national child protection strategy is also being drafted. The Special Rapporteur 
recalls that in 2006 the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Senegal 
should develop a comprehensive national plan of action based on children&#8217;s rights and a 
participatory approach. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-17961 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>65. In March 2003 Senegal adopted a tourism charter introducing a local strategy for the 
promotion of &#8220;responsible tourism beneficial to the people of Senegal and to the domestic 
economy&#8221;. The Vice Squad systematically monitors beaches, hotels, bars, nightclubs, 
massage parlours and other tourist places. However, the Ministry of Tourism has no official 
statistics on the number of children who are exploited for sex tourism. 
</p>
<p>66. The central police station in Saint-Louis informed the Special Rapporteur that its 
officers carried out checks in hotels, bars, parks, cybercafes and <i>daaras</i> as part of its efforts 
to detect cases of child abuse and sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Provision of care for child victims of sexual exploitation and abuse 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur visited several care centres for vulnerable children in Dakar, 
Saint-Louis and Mbour. She spoke with the staff of these centres as well as with some of 
the children. She also met members of the TMCs established in Saint-Louis and Mbour 
under the Programme to Combat Trafficking and the Worst Forms of Child Labour. She 
encountered a lack of formal, harmonized procedures for assisting and supporting at-risk 
children, and a lack of social services at the community level. On this point, the Prosecutor 
General in Saint-Louis complained of the lack of trained child counsellors, proper care 
centres, and psychologists able to deal with child victims of abuse and sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p>68. The GINDDI Centre, which was established in 2003, provides shelter, information 
and counselling for children in difficult situations and is directly attached to the Ministry of 
the Family. The Centre&#8217;s mission is to take children off the streets and reintegrate them in 
the community; to provide psychological support and social assistance for boy and girl 
victims of trafficking from Senegal and other countries in the subregion and for child 
victims of sexual abuse and harmful sociocultural practices; and to implement strategies to 
raise public awareness of children&#8217;s rights and the various mechanisms and instruments 
protecting their rights.  
</p>
<p>69. The Centre operates a free helpline (80 000 8888) which is fully funded by the State, 
through which the public can file complaints and report violations. The helpline operates 24 
hours a day seven days a week. In 2009 it received a total of 8,140 calls. The Centre would 
like to align its helpline number with the international childline number of 116, and is in 
discussions with the national operator Sonatel to this end. 
</p>
<p>70. Children receive care and assistance on a residential, semi-residential or non-
residential basis and are supported by a social economics teacher, a part-time psychologist 
and special educational social workers. On average, children remain at the Centre for no 
more than three months. Whilst there, they receive instruction in civilian life, schooling and 
vocational training and take part in sporting activities. The Centre frequently takes part in 
exchanges with other care centres.  
</p>
<p>71. The Centre reported that in 2009 it provided support to the following number of 
children on a residential or non-residential basis: 
</p>
<p>Street children and <i>talib&#233;</i> children 896 
Children from other countries in the subregion 115 
Girl victims of rape and harmful cultural practices 43 
Girls receiving vocational training 105 
</p>
<p><b>Total 1 054 
</b></p>
<p>72. Boys account for the majority of children in the Centre&#8217;s care. The Centre provided 
the following data on the number of boys receiving assistance between January and 
September 2009: </p>

</p>
<p>73. Often children are taken off the street by police officers attached to the Children&#8217;s 
Unit and it is these officers who refer them to the Centre. However, this is done on an 
informal basis as there is no official procedure. 
</p>
<p>74. The duties of the Centre&#8217;s staff include communicating with members of the child&#8217;s 
family and educating them in children&#8217;s rights. Children are returned to their family only if 
deemed appropriate by the Centre&#8217;s team. Every child has a &#8220;mentor&#8221; who monitors their 
progress. The Centre also oversees the return and reintegration of child victims of 
trafficking who are citizens of Guinea-Bissau, working in partnership with the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM).  
</p><p>75. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the rights-based approach advocated by 
the Centre&#8217;s representative, which rested on an undertaking to construct a life plan designed 
to prevent relapses, in consultation with the child and their family.  
</p>
<p>76. However, certain obstacles have still to be overcome. A database holding 
information on all children cared for by the Centre is vital if the Centre is to be able to 
guarantee that all children can be traced, that the effectiveness of the care it provides can be 
evaluated and that the child&#8217;s subsequent progress can be monitored. In addition, liaison 
between the Centre and organizations working in the field needs to be made more 
systematic and professional, for example through the conclusion of specific mandates or 
agreements. Formal and more systematic mechanisms for ensuring children&#8217;s access to 
health services and legal aid are also needed if comprehensive protection for every child is 
to be guaranteed. The representative of the Centre also highlighted the need to reinvigorate 
the monitoring and early warning committees working in the field that are responsible for 
referring children to the Centre. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Centre is looking into the 
possibility of introducing a mechanism for reporting violations of children&#8217;s rights to the 
Centre that would be accessible to children and would guarantee that complaints were 
treated confidentially and those reporting them would be protected. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Thiaroye Multi-Purpose Centre opened in 
</p><p>1965. The Centre caters for girls with behavioural problems, girls who have suffered sexual 
abuse or are in conflict with the law, and girls placed in the Centre&#8217;s care at their parents&#8217; 
request. In some cases, girls are placed in the Centre as a result of a court order. The girls&#8217; 
ages range from 11 to 25. The Special Rapporteur learnt that girls living nearby also took 
part in some of the activities organized at the Centre. 
</p>
<p>79. The Centre employs four teachers who are funded by the Ministry of Education and 
teach the standard State curriculum. A further three teachers are funded by the Centre itself. 
The Centre also offers courses in dressmaking, hairdressing and catering. It is able to 
provide residential care for 15 girls.  
</p>
<p>80. The Centre is receiving a growing number of child victims of prostitution and sexual 
exploitation. However, caring for these children is proving difficult. Access to support 
services and legal aid is also problematic. For this reason, the Centre&#8217;s representative said 
that the creation of a local primary care centre in Dakar, for example, at which victims 
could receive psychological support before being referred to the Centre would be a good 
idea. Follow-up of girls who have left the Centre indicates that they struggle to find 
employment. The Department of Correctional Education and Social Protection is 
attempting to find a solution to this problem. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-17961 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Pikine Protection Centre, which provides 
semi-residential care for children either as a preventive measure or, in the case of juvenile 
delinquents or minors whose moral well-being is at risk, by court order. Because the Centre 
was being renovated at the time, the Special Rapporteur was not able to properly assess the 
quality of the services it provides. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity to visit the Mbour Nursery and 
meet its directors. The Nursery caters for a range of children rescued from various 
circumstances, including newborns, <i>talib&#233;</i> children, street children, victims of violence and 
refugee children. In this case also, interviewees commented that access to health services 
was difficult. 
</p>
<p>83. In Saint-Louis, the Special Rapporteur met the Head of the Urban Security Unit at 
the central police station. He explained that when a minor is suspected of being involved in 
prostitution, police officers first approach the minor&#8217;s parents. If the parents cannot handle 
the situation, the police refer the case to the Prosecutor General and the community 
educative action teams. The Head of the Urban Security Unit said that the main difficulties 
his officers encountered in their work with children were: (1) communication difficulties, as 
children are often afraid to tell police officers what has happened to them, even when the 
officers are not uniformed, and there is no secure reception facility for children; (2) the lack 
of residential care facilities, for example, reception centres for child victims of sexual 
exploitation and abuse, and the lack of coordination and information that means officers in 
Saint-Louis do not know about certain facilities, such as the GINDDI Centre in Dakar; (3) 
difficulties in collecting evidence in cases of sexual exploitation and violence; and (4) the 
State&#8217;s tardiness in adopting new scientific methods for collecting and processing evidence. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur also visited two NGO-run facilities in Saint-Louis that cater 
for children in difficult situations, almost all of them <i>talib&#233;</i> children. At these centres, 
children receive care, literacy training and shelter.  
</p>
<p>85. Despite the good intentions of their directors, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
neither of these centres has an integrated programme offering comprehensive protection 
that encompasses medical, legal and psychological assistance, and that there is no system of 
child follow-up and evaluation.  
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur visited a <i>daara</i> that was home to a large number of boys of 
varying ages. The living and sleeping conditions she found there were appalling: cramped, 
dilapidated buildings and a total lack of hygiene. At the time of her visit, a young <i>talib&#233;</i> was 
teaching the Koran. The Special Rapporteur spoke with the marabout who ran the <i>daara</i>. 
He informed her that he never sent the boys begging (they supposedly went of their own 
accord), that he was responsible for the Koranic education of the boys, who, according to 
him, had been placed there by their parents, and that he would improve their living 
conditions if only he had more resources. The Special Rapporteur stresses the urgent need 
to regulate the teaching and accommodation provided for children in Koranic schools. 
</p>
<p><b>  Awareness-raising/prevention 
</b></p>
<p>87. Police officers, gendarmes, judges and public prosecutors all receive training in the 
rights of the child. However, it is regrettable that only the officers of the Children&#8217;s Unit 
have received specialized training in child protection and trafficking in human beings.   
</p>
<p>88. The GINDDI Centre organized a day-long awareness-raising workshop to promote 
the cause of children, focusing in particular on the rape and abuse of young girls. The target 
audience was families and people working with children. 
</p>
<p>89. The Senegalese Government is escalating its efforts to increase the rate of birth 
registration. The National Agency for Early Childhood and Preschool Reception Centres, in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-17961 
</p>
<p>conjunction with local authorities, works with mothers to ensure that their children are 
registered in the civil registry. In 2007 and 2008, 2,732 children were registered. The 
Agency also runs campaigns to sensitize mothers to the importance of registering the birth 
of their children, targeting those areas in which birth registration rates are particularly low, 
and has made admission to a preschool reception centre conditional upon the presentation 
of a birth certificate. 
</p>
<p>90. As part of its efforts to combat sex tourism, the Ministry of Tourism has launched 
campaigns to raise awareness of child sexual exploitation and HIV/AIDS for the staff of 
certain hotel chains. 
</p>
<p><b>  Participation of children 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Children&#8217;s Parliament in Dakar is currently being reconstituted and reorganized. 
The Saint-Louis and Mbour sections of the Parliament are operational and the Mbour 
section is represented on the Mbour Technical Monitoring Committee. 
</p>
<p>92. However, members of the Children&#8217;s Parliament would benefit from greater 
knowledge of their rights and the advocacy mechanisms available for children. Liaison 
between departmental sections and local representatives remains limited, and children are 
rarely consulted on the formulation and follow-up of action plans, programmes and 
strategies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up and evaluation  
</b></p>
<p>93. All stakeholders interviewed agreed that follow-up on child victims of sexual 
exploitation and the evaluation of programmes and policies for combating and preventing 
the problem could be better. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur commends the steps taken by UNICEF to construct a 
database of street children in three Senegalese departments that will be used to compile 
information on the profile, number and situation of these children. 
</p>
<p>95. The lack of a complaints mechanism accessible to children is one of the main 
obstacles to effective follow-up of child victims of sale, trafficking and/or sexual 
exploitation. The establishment of a Children&#8217;s Ombudsman is under consideration. The 
Special Rapporteur is ready to provide assistance and advice throughout this process. 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur also notes the absence of rules and standards regulating 
living conditions and services in care centres, shelters and protection centres for children in 
difficult circumstances. 
</p>
<p>97. The lack of a harmonized, centralized system for collecting and processing data on 
child victims of sexual abuse and violence and at-risk children limits the Government&#8217;s 
ability to ascertain the scale, forms and causes of these problems and, by extension, its 
ability to combat them more effectively.    
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s decision to introduce a fund for 
the victims of sexual violence as part of the Criminal Code reforms, and invites the 
Government to keep her informed of developments in this area.  
</p>
<p><b>  Civil society engagement 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur commends the engagement of members of civil society and 
their readiness to work together among themselves, and also with Government bodies, at 
the local and national levels. 
</p>
<p>100. However, the NGOs in the three cities visited were hampered by a lack of financial 
resources and adequately trained personnel. In particular, they highlighted a need for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-17961 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>greater capacity for preventing child trafficking, sale, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation 
and a better understanding of the specificities of each problem and the links between them 
in order to improve detection and the provision of care and follow-up for the children 
concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>  Private sector/media 
</b></p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur commends the media&#8217;s active involvement in the field, in 
particular its efforts to raise awareness of children&#8217;s rights and keep the public updated on 
the State&#8217;s progress towards fulfilment of its child protection undertakings. The media 
regularly reports cases of children in difficult situations. However, its handling of these 
cases must always be underpinned by a professional ethic respectful of children&#8217;s rights.   
</p>
<p>102. Private sector engagement is also on the increase and codes of conduct have been 
adopted by certain hotel chains to support the fight against sex tourism. However, the 
Special Rapporteur perceives a need for greater social responsibility among enterprises, 
telecommunications companies, and banks, etc. and also in relation to Internet usage, 
including through support for child protection programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. International and regional cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>103. There are a number of technical and financial partners working in Senegal. 
However, partnership strategies tend to take a project-based approach rather than a long-
term perspective. The Special Rapporteur also notes overlaps and a lack of coordination in 
project design and implementation which lead to duplication of effort and a lack of clarity 
about the role and accountability of each stakeholder. 
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur believes that international partners could do more in Senegal 
to introduce the many methods of combating cybercrime, child pornography and sex 
tourism, for example, that have been implemented in other countries. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>While child abuse and exploitation for sexual purposes or begging are issues of 
great concern to the parties interviewed, the scale of these problems is not known. 
However, the Special Rapporteur notes a genuine political will to combat and prevent 
the exploitation of children and to safeguard the rights of children in general.    
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Legislative reforms, such as the adoption of laws on trafficking in human 
beings and cybercrime, have increased protection for children&#8217;s rights. The adoption 
and implementation of the Programme to Combat Trafficking and the Worst Forms 
of Child Labour at the departmental level have brought national and local 
stakeholders together and raised their awareness of the issues. Through the Technical 
Monitoring Committees, local stakeholders are working together to eliminate such 
practices and ensure care for child victims.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Certain challenges remain, including the lack of a comprehensive, harmonized 
child protection strategy, the fact that legislation is only partially applied, the 
persistence of certain traditional social practices, the lack of regulation in Koranic 
schools, the lack of an  information, follow-up and evaluation system, and the need to 
strengthen stakeholder capacity to adopt a children&#8217;s rights-based approach. There is 
also a need to establish a framework conducive to cooperation and coordination </b></p>

<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>On the basis of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
following recommendations to the Government, emphasizing that she is ready to 
provide assistance and advice in their implementation at any time. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>With regard to national strategies, she recommends that the State party should:

<p>&#8226; <b>Conclude the drafting of a national strategy for the protection of children&#8217;s 
rights, working with all stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that this strategy entails the implementation of protection systems that 
will guarantee the best interests of the child and encompass: (i) prevention; (ii) 
detection, childcare and medical, psychological, social and legal support; and 
(iii) the promotion of the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop the mechanisms and methodologies needed to coordinate strategy 
implementation and follow-up at the central and local levels 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Allocate the budget and human resources necessary to implement this strategy

international standards established in the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women

article 245 of the Criminal Code on the prohibition of begging in order to 
ensure that the prohibition is respected and applied
