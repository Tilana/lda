<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 18/12 of the Human Rights 
Council. It provides an analysis of the human rights legal framework applicable to children 
deprived of their liberty. On the basis of the work of relevant human rights mechanisms, it 
further reviews the implementation by States of their legal obligations and concludes that, 
while international human rights law provides a comprehensive legal framework regulating 
the rights of children in the administration of justice, in particular when deprived of their 
liberty, a number of implementation gaps remain.  
</p>
<p> Among the gaps, the report identifies in particular the lack of adequate conditions of 
detention; the imposition of certain penalties prohibited in international human rights law; 
the lack of monitoring and complaint mechanisms; and the inadequacy of training of 
personnel dealing with children deprived of their liberty. The report concludes that States 
should comply with their human rights obligations to protect children from ill-treatment 
and to respect the dignity and needs of children deprived of their liberty. States should also 
observe their obligation to ensure that children are not subjected to death penalty, life 
imprisonment without parole, or corporal punishment. Furthermore, the report concludes 
that States should establish or strengthen monitoring, complaint and other safeguard 
procedures in accordance with international norms and standards. Finally, it highlights that 
States must ensure that professionals working with children are competent and well-trained, 
in line with international standards on the qualification, selection, recruitment, training and 
remuneration of such personnel.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 18/12, entitled &#8220;Human rights in the 
administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice&#8221;, requested the High Commissioner 
to submit an analytical report to the Council at its twenty-first session on the protection of 
human rights of juveniles deprived of their liberty, mindful of all applicable human rights 
standards and taking into account the work of all relevant human rights mechanisms of the 
United Nations.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides an analysis of the human rights legal framework 
applicable to the issue of children1 deprived of their liberty. The report also addresses 
challenges related to the implementation of human rights norms in relation to children 
deprived of their liberty, in particular issues related to conditions of detention. It further 
highlights the main principles underlying the juvenile justice system, in particular issues 
related to the exercise of juvenile criminal jurisdiction <i>ratione personae,</i> the application of 
certain penalties and the use of alternative measures.2 
</p>
<p><b> II. Applicable human rights legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>3. Human rights standards relevant to the protection of human rights of children 
deprived of their liberty are set out in a series of legally binding international human rights 
instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child; the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights; the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture; the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>4. A number of other standard-setting instruments regulate issues related to deprivation 
of liberty of persons, including children, in particular: the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners;3 the Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime 
and Abuse of Power;4 the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any 
Form of Detention or Imprisonment;5 the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners;6 
the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo 
Rules);7 the Basic Principles on the Use of Restorative Justice Programmes in Criminal 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The various relevant international instruments, rules and guidelines refer to persons not considered as 
</p>
<p>adults using either the term &#8220;child(ren)&#8221; or  the term &#8220;juvenile(s)&#8221;. For reasons of clarity, the term 
</p>
<p>used throughout this report will be &#8220;children&#8221; unless a specific provision of an instrument, rule or 
guideline using the term &#8220;juvenile&#8221; is being quoted. 
</p>
<p> 2 The present report has taken into account relevant standards developed in the context of the human 
rights as well as in the criminal justice sectors. It has taken into account relevant public information 
from treaty bodies, special procedures, and relevant United Nations agencies, in particular the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and UNICEF, as well as civil society organizations.

<p>Matters;8 and the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and Non-custodial 
Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules).9  
</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, specific guidelines and rules regulating the detention of children have 
also been  adopted, including the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules);10 the United Nations Guidelines for 
the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines);11 the United Nations 
Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (the Havana Rules);12  the 
Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System (the Vienna 
Guidelines);13 and the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and 
Witnesses of Crime.14 
</p>
<p><i>  Age limits 
</i></p>
<p>6. Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as every 
human being below the age of 18 unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is 
attained earlier. Rule 11(a) of the Havana Rules provides that a juvenile is every person 
under the age of 18 without any limitation.15 According to the Beijing Rules, in the context 
of the administration of justice, a juvenile is a person who may be dealt with for an offence 
in a manner which is different from an adult.16  
</p>
<p>7. In general comment No. 10, the Committee on the Rights of the Child states that the 
special rules of juvenile justice should apply for all children who, at the time of the 
commission of the offence, have not yet reached the age of 18.17 The Human Rights 
Committee, in general comment No. 21, has also stated with regard to deprivation of liberty 
that all persons under the age of 18 should be treated as children, at least in matters relating 
to criminal justice.18  
</p>
<p>8. Article 40, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that 
State parties must seek to promote a minimum age of criminal responsibility below which 
children shall be presumed not to have the capacity to infringe the penal law. Neither the 
Convention nor other standard-setting instruments prescribe a specific minimum age of 
criminal responsibility. Rule 4 of the Beijing Rules specifies that if the concept of the age 
of criminal responsibility is accepted within a State, the beginning of that age should not be 
fixed at too low a level. Furthermore, article 41 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child provides that States may always set a higher standard. Rule 3.3 of the Beijing Rules 
further recommends making efforts to extend juvenile justice rules to young adult 
offenders. 
</p>
<p><i>  Juvenile justice system 
</i></p>
<p>9. Article 40, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as rule 
11.1 of the Beijing Rules, require States to establish measures for dealing with children

<p>without resorting to formal judicial proceedings, whenever appropriate and desirable, while 
ensuring that human rights and legal safeguards are fully respected. When diversion 
measures are not possible, the Convention provides that States parties should seek to 
promote the establishment of laws, procedures, authorities and institutions specifically 
applicable to children accused of an infringement of criminal law. The Beijing Rules 
confirm the necessity of specific national legislation as well as institutions and bodies 
entrusted with the functions of the administration of juvenile justice and specify that the 
whole system should be designed to meet the varying needs of children in conflict with the 
law, while protecting their human rights.19  
</p>
<p><i>  Fair trial guarantees 
</i></p>
<p>10. While all the procedural guarantees provided in article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political rights are equally applicable to children, the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child also provides a list of fundamental procedural safeguards to ensure 
fair treatment and trial of children accused of committing a crime. For instance, in line with 
article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Right, article 40, paragraph 
2)(a), of the Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the retroactive application of 
criminal law. Moreover, the Convention provides that children accused of a criminal act are 
entitled, at all stages of proceedings, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty;20 to 
obtain prompt and direct information of the charges and to have legal or other appropriate 
assistance in the preparation and presentation of their defence;21 to have the matter 
determined without delay by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial 
body in a fair hearing according to law; to obtain legal assistance; to enjoy the presence of 
parents or legal guardians in the proceedings unless their presence is considered adverse to 
the best interest of the child;22 and the right not be compelled to give testimony or to 
confess guilt.23  
</p>
<p>11. The Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that children be provided with 
the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting them, 
either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent 
with the procedural rules of national law.24 Moreover, children may examine or have 
examined adverse witnesses and obtain the participation and examination of witnesses on 
their behalf.25 If the child does not understand or speak the language, he or she has the right 
to get free assistance of an interpreter.26 
</p>
<p>12. Children are accorded the right to have the decision by which they were found guilty 
or any measures imposed in consequence thereof reviewed. The appeal shall be carried out 
by a higher competent, independent and impartial judicial body according to law.27 The 
Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that the privacy of the child is respected at 
all stages of the proceedings.28 
</p>
<p>13. According to the Beijing Rules, when judicial proceedings are required, children 
must be dealt with by the competent authority in accordance with the principles of a fair 
</p>

<p>trial.29 Such proceedings shall be conducive to the best interests of the child and be 
conducted in an atmosphere of understanding, which shall allow the children to participate 
therein and to express themselves freely.30 Furthermore, the Beijing Rules establish that the 
competent authority shall have the power to discontinue the proceedings at any time.31 
</p>
<p><i>  Alternative measures 
</i></p>
<p>14. According to the Havana and the Beijing Rules, all efforts should be made to apply 
alternative measures to detention of children.32 Article 40, paragraph 4, of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child provides a non-exhaustive enumeration of dispositions that shall 
be made available to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate with their 
well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence, such as 
counselling, probation, foster care, education and vocational training programmes and other 
alternatives to institutional care.33  
</p>
<p>15. In addition, the Tokyo Rules provide a set of basic principles for the use of non-
custodial measures and minimum safeguards for persons subject to alternatives to 
imprisonment. In particular, rule 3 of the Tokyo Rules provides legal safeguards when 
applying non-custodial measures.  
</p>
<p><i>  Prohibited penalties 
</i></p>
<p>16. Several international instruments prohibit the imposition of the death penalty.34 
Furthermore, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole should not be imposed for 
offences committed by children.35 In addition, the Beijing Rules provide that children shall 
not be subjected to corporal punishment.36 In various decisions, the Human Rights 
Committee established that corporal punishment constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment or punishment contrary to article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.37 
</p>
<p><i>  Deprivation of liberty 
</i></p>
<p>17. The right to liberty and security of the person, including children, is embodied in 
article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Paragraph 1 of article 9 
prohibits unlawful or arbitrary arrest or detention and requires deprivation of liberty to be in 
conformity with the law.38

the Rights of the Child; principle 2, Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any 
Form of Detention or Imprisonment. </p>


<p>18. The Convention on the Rights of the Child does not contain a definition of the term 
deprivation of liberty. In its general comment No. 8 on the right to liberty and security of 
persons, the Human Rights Committee concluded that the term covers all deprivation of 
liberty, whether in criminal cases or in other cases such as, for example, mental illness, 
vagrancy, drug addiction, educational purposes, immigration control, among others.39 The 
Havana Rules provide that deprivation of liberty means any form of detention or 
imprisonment or the placement of a person in a public or private custodial setting which 
that person is not permitted to leave at will by order of any judicial, administrative or other 
authority.40 The Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment contains an almost identical definition of 
deprivation of liberty.41  
</p>
<p>19. The Convention on the Rights of the Child lays down a clear obligation to reduce 
the use of deprivation of liberty for children to the minimum possible. It requires that arrest, 
detention or imprisonment of a child should only be used as a measure of last resort and it 
should be applied for the shortest appropriate period of time.42 The Havana Rules confirm 
this obligation and add that deprivation of liberty should be limited to exceptional 
circumstances.43  
</p>
<p>20. Rule 17 of the Beijing Rules provides that restrictions on the personal liberty of 
children shall be imposed only after careful consideration and shall be limited to the 
possible minimum; that deprivation of liberty of children should not be imposed except for 
serious offences and unless there is no other appropriate response; that the reaction shall 
always be in proportion not only to the circumstances and the gravity of the offence, but 
also to the circumstances and the needs of the child as well as of society; and that the well-
being of the child shall be a guiding factor in the consideration of his or her case.  
</p>
<p><i>  Procedural safeguards 
</i></p>
<p>21. Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child defines the standards and 
procedural safeguards applicable to cases where children are deprived of their liberty. In 
line with article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights,44 the Convention prohibits unlawful and arbitrary arrest, detention and 
imprisonment of a child. Furthermore, it establishes that every child deprived of his or her 
liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance when 
deprived of liberty, as well as the right to challenge the legality of deprivation of liberty 
before a court or other competent, independent and impartial authority, and to a prompt 
decision on any such action.45 In cases where a child is detained, her or his parents or 
guardian shall be immediately notified.46 Moreover, the Havana Rules and the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provide additional guidelines on the

<p>treatment of children under arrest or awaiting trial.47 In general, accused persons must be 
treated in a manner that takes into account their status as non-convicted persons.48 
</p>
<p><i>  Conditions of detention 
</i></p>
<p>22. International norms and standards lay down a set of rules and standards regulating 
the conditions of detention and treatment of children. It should be noted that all persons, 
adults as well as children, deprived of their liberty are entitled to be treated with humanity 
and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.49 Article 37 (c) of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child further provides that children have to be treated in a manner 
which takes into account their special needs. 
</p>
<p>23. In its general comment No. 21 on article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the Human Rights Committee points out that the respect for the 
dignity of persons deprived of their liberty must be guaranteed under the same conditions as 
for that of free persons. Persons deprived of their liberty shall enjoy all the rights set forth 
in the Covenant, subject to the restrictions that are unavoidable in a closed environment.50 
The Havana Rules provides that children deprived of their liberty shall not for any reason 
related to their status be denied the civil, economic, political, social or cultural rights which 
they are entitled under national or international law, and which are compatible with the 
deprivation of liberty.51  
</p>
<p>24. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights52 and the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child53 require that children be separated from adults.54 Moreover, accused 
and convicted persons55 as well as boys and girls should be separated.56 The only permitted 
exception is laid down in article 37 (c) of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in cases 
where it is in the best interest of the child speaks not to proceed to such separation. 
However, according to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, this exception should be 
interpreted narrowly.57  
</p>
<p>25. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the 
right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and 
housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.58 Likewise, the

<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child guarantees the right of every child to a standard of 
living adequate for the child&#8217;s physical mental, spiritual, moral and social development.59 
The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Havana Rules provide 
more detailed standards on the physical environment and accommodation in relation to 
children deprived of their liberty. Standards include, inter alia, guidelines on personal 
hygiene, clothing and bedding, food, clean drinking water and accommodation.60  
</p>
<p>26. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child provide that children deprived of their liberty have 
the right to receive education and vocational training, and the opportunity to perform 
labour.61 Various international instruments provide further details on the standards in that 
regard.62 The Beijing Rules provide that the objective of training and treatment of children 
placed in institutions is to provide care, protection, education and vocational skills, with a 
view to assisting them to assume socially constructive and productive roles in society.63  
</p>
<p>27. Closely linked to education and training of children deprived of their liberty is their 
right to rest and leisure and to have access to recreational activities.64 Every child should 
have the right to a suitable amount of time for daily free exercise, in the open air whenever 
weather permits, during which time appropriate recreational and physical training should 
normally be provided. This right includes the provision of adequate space, installations and 
equipment.65 A child should also have additional time for daily leisure activities, part of 
which should be devoted, if the child wishes, to arts and crafts skill development.66 
Furthermore, due regard must be given to a child&#8217;s religious and cultural rights.67 
</p>
<p>28. Another key aspect is access to adequate health care and medical services. The 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health.68 The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides for the corresponding right of 
the child and adds the right to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of 
health.69 The Havana Rules, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners 
and the Bangkok rules lay down a set of detailed standards for health care services for 
persons deprived of their liberty, including children.70

<p>29. Contact with the outside world and the wider community has to be allowed and 
made possible, which constitutes an integral part of the right to a fair and humane treatment 
and is essential to the preparation of children for their return to society.71 Article 9, 
paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child contains the right to maintain 
personal relations and remain in contact with parents in case a child is separated from one 
or both parents.72 
</p>
<p><i>  Protection safeguards 
</i></p>
<p>30. In order to prevent violations of the rights of children deprived of their liberty, States 
are required to establish certain safeguards. Upon admission to a detention facility, children 
have to be registered and records have to be kept.73 Request and complaint mechanisms,74 
as well as regular and independent systems of inspection have to be in place.75 The 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides that States shall maintain, designate or 
establish one or several independent national preventive mechanisms for the prevention of 
torture.76 The Havana Rules further require that qualified inspectors who do not belong to 
the administration of the facility should enjoy full guarantees of independence and should 
be able to conduct inspections on a regular basis as well as have the possibility to undertake 
unannounced inspections. Unrestricted access to all persons working in the facility, all 
children deprived of their liberty and all records of such facilities should be granted.77 
Moreover, supervisory bodies should include medical officers as well as women 
members.78  
</p>
<p><i>  Disciplinary measures 
</i></p>
<p>31. The Convention on the Rights of the Child places the general duty on States to take 
all measures to protect children from all forms of physical and mental violence, injury or 
abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, 
while in the care of parents, legal guardians or any other person who has the care of the 
child.79 The protection of children from harm also includes the right to have their privacy 
respected when deprived of their liberty.80

<p>32. The Havana Rules set forth a strict standard for permissible disciplinary measures 
and procedures for children deprived of their liberty.81 These measures should maintain the 
interest of safety and an ordered community life and should be consistent with the 
upholding of the inherent dignity of the child and the fundamental objective of institutional 
care, namely, instilling a sense of justice, self-respect and respect for the basic rights of 
every person. The Havana Rules ban any measure constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment, including corporal punishment, placement in a dark cell, closed or solitary 
confinement or any other punishment that may compromise the physical or mental health of 
the child concerned.82 Moreover, the Havana Rules prohibit the reduction of diet and the 
restriction or denial of contact with family members for any purpose or labour imposed as a 
disciplinary sanction. As a general rule, children should not be sanctioned more than once 
for the same disciplinary infraction and collective sanctions should be prohibited.83 
Instruments of restraint, such as handcuffs, chains, irons and strait-jackets, shall never be 
applied as punishment.84  
</p>
<p><i>  Treatment of girls deprived of their liberty  
</i></p>
<p>33. Girls placed in detention institutions deserve special attention as to their needs and 
problems.85 In decision-making, their gender-based vulnerability must be taken into 
account.86 Furthermore, prison authorities must put in place measures to meet the protection 
needs of girls deprived of their liberty. They must have equal access to education and 
vocational training that are available to boys,87 have access to age- and gender-specific 
programmes and services, such as counselling for sexual abuse or violence, receive 
education on women&#8217;s health care and have regular access to gynaecologists. In particular 
pregnant girls deprived of their liberty must receive support and medical care.88  
</p>
<p><i>  Juvenile justice personnel 
</i></p>
<p>34. Special consideration also needs to be paid to ensuring that adequate personnel are 
recruited in detention facilities.89 Article 10 of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires that education and 
information regarding the prohibition against torture is included in training of law 
enforcement personnel. Additionally, the Havana Rules provide a set of rules on selection, 
recruitment, qualification, training and remuneration of personnel involved with children in 
conflict with the law.90

<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child, have highlighted the persistence of a number of 
problems in practice in many parts of the world. 
</p>
<p><i>  Age limits 
</i></p>
<p>36. In a number of States, the age of criminal responsibility is still between 7 and 10,91 
or no minimum age of criminal responsibility is established at all.92 In recent years, other 
States have lowered, or started initiatives to lower, the age of criminal responsibility for 
children.93 Occasionally, the age of criminal responsibility is determined according to 
apparent physical maturity, rather than actual age. 94 
</p><p>37. In some States, children below the minimum age of criminal responsibility 
sometimes face the risk of prosecution, arrest, deprivation of liberty, or of administrative 
penalties being imposed.95  
</p>
<p><i>  Juvenile justice system 
</i></p>
<p>38. The objective of any juvenile justice system should be to promote the well-being of 
the child and to ensure that measures adopted with respect to children in conflict with the 
law are proportional to the circumstances of both the offenders and the offence.96 The 
juvenile justice system is based on a restorative justice approach focusing on the 
reintegration of children into society.97 The Riyadh Guidelines stress the importance of 
prevention of juvenile delinquency in society.98 
</p><p>39. In a number of countries, however, a comprehensive juvenile justice system is either 
not in place, has not been developed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, or the system in place lacks effectiveness.99 Some 
States have failed to comply with the obligation to establish juvenile courts while in other 
countries, there is a lack of judges with the adequate specialization in juvenile justice.100  
40. In some States, children in conflict with the law are often tried by the ordinary 
criminal justice system and treated as adults. They are, therefore, unable to benefit from the 
special measures of protection to which they are entitled.101

<p><i>  Fair trial guarantees 
</i></p>
<p>41. The right of children to fair trial, including the right of the child to be heard, is often 
inadequately protected.102 In particular, children are dealt with in the absence of their 
parents or guardians and rarely provided with legal assistance, including while in court,   
resulting, inter alia, in coerced confessions and unlawful investigative practices.103  
Moreover, parents are not always informed of the detention of their children, and children 
are not permitted to contact their families.104  
</p>
<p><i>  Prohibited penalties 
</i></p>
<p>42. Sentencing of children remains severe and disproportionate in a number of States.105 
The death penalty is not explicitly prohibited in national law or is imposed on children or 
persons who were under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the offence.106 
Furthermore, corporal punishment, including sentences such as whipping, amputation, 
flogging, caning, stoning and other forms of punishment, is still a sentencing option in 
some States.107  Children are sometimes sentenced to life imprisonment or are detained for 
long periods of time.108 It should be noted that, while international standards only prohibit 
the application of life imprisonment for children if it does not foresee the possibility of 
parole, the application of such penalty does in any case fail to meet the overall objective of 
reintegration and re-socialization that characterizes the juvenile justice system.  
</p>
<p><i>  Deprivation of liberty 
</i></p>
<p>43. Deprivation of liberty is often not used as a measure of last resort.109 Detention is 
regularly used against children in conflict with the law, as reflected by the high number of

<p>children and adolescents deprived of their liberty in detention centres, penal or correctional-
educational institutions or remanded in custody.110 
</p><p>44. In a number of States, children are detained for minor offences.111 Status offences, 
such as running away from home, are regarded as abnormal behavior, are criminalized, and 
can lead to the detention of children charged with such offenses.112 In some cases, girls who 
are victims of violence and abuse are made responsible for the criminal acts committed 
against them.113 In other cases, children in need of care and attention are put in detention 
instead of social care.114 
45. The frequent and systematic use of pretrial detention for children is also of serious 
concern.115 Children are often held in pretrial detention for long periods.116 At times, their 
pretrial detention exceeds the length of the maximum prison term that they could receive if 
found guilty. Furthermore, children are sometimes kept for weeks in police custody.117   
</p>
<p><i>  Conditions of detention 
</i></p>
<p>46. Conditions of detention for children in conflict with the law, including in police 
stations while under arrest and in detention centres, are often poor and inadequate,118 in 
some cases amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.119 In many States, children 
are not always held separately from adults or from convicted persons, exposing them to an 
increased risk of abuse.120 In some cases, girls may be detained in mixed-sex prisons, where

<p>they are exposed to violence from adolescent male detainees or from male prison guards.121 
Furthermore, overcrowding is frequently a serious problem.122  
</p><p>47. Children deprived of their liberty not only face unsatisfactory material conditions 
and lack of adequate facilities, but also have limited access to fresh air, are not provided 
with adequate food and are faced with poor sanitary conditions.123 Moreover, detention 
centres are sometimes centralized in the main cities, making children&#8217;s regular contact with 
their families and communities difficult.124 
48. Children deprived of their liberty lack access to adequate education and vocational 
training in a number of countries.125 Moreover, children are not provided with sufficient 
recreational and learning activities or opportunities to engage in any kind of physical or 
cultural activity.126 Facilities for physical and psychological recovery, assistance and social 
reintegration of children in conflict with the law before and after release are absent or 
insufficient.127 In some cases, education is limited to male adolescent detainees and 
facilities and programmes for physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration 
of girls are not adequately provided.128  
49. The fact that during their detention children are faced with high levels of violence, 
including sexual violence, and that protection from such violence is not always adequate, is 
of particular concern.129 Children under police arrest and in pretrial detention are subjected 
to different forms of abuse, torture and ill-treatment, in particular with the aim of forcibly

<p>extracting confessions.130 Furthermore, reports of children suffering abuse, ill-treatment or 
torture as a form of punishment or disciplinary measure are not uncommon.131  
</p><p>50. In a variety of States, corporal punishment, including caning or flogging, is 
considered as a form of lawful disciplinary measure, or is not explicitly prohibited under 
domestic law, and continues to be practised in a number of States.132 Physical restraint, such 
as handcuffing and shacking, is practised in juvenile rehabilitation centres allegedly for 
security reasons or as a form of punishment.133 At times, self-inflicted injuries or even 
suicide in detention have been recorded.134 Furthermore, children&#8217;s privacy is not always 
sufficiently respected.135  
</p>
<p><i>  Protection safeguards 
</i></p>
<p>51. Another key challenge is the lack of appropriate and independent mechanisms to 
monitor conditions of children deprived of their liberty, including the effective application 
of pretrial detention.136 Adequate control of detention centres is often not provided and 
there is no systematic inspection to investigate and evaluate actual conditions as well as 
violations to existing regulations.137 Moreover, mechanisms may not be available to 
children deprived of liberty and children placed in institutions, through which they can file 
a complaint regarding their treatment.138 Additionally, alleged cases of torture or ill-
treatment are not always investigated adequately. Often, children do not file formal 
complaints for fear of reprisals.139 
</p>
<p><i>  Juvenile justice personnel 
</i></p>
<p>52. A further important issue relates to training of personnel working with children 
deprived of their liberty. Complaints often concern the inadequacy and insufficiency of 
training of lawyers, judges, police, prison staff and other professionals, such as social

<p>workers, involved in the juvenile justice system.140 Judges and other professionals working 
with children in conflict with the law lack the necessary skills to effectively deal with these 
children.141 In particular, law enforcement personnel are often not specialized in child-
related investigations and in interrogation of children in conflict with the law.  Therefore, 
States&#8217; obligation to ensure the necessary expertise in juvenile justice, including awareness 
regarding the rights of the child, sensitivity towards the needs of children, and eventually 
the protection of children in contact with the law, is often not met.142

<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>International human rights law provides a comprehensive legal framework 
regulating the rights of children in the administration of justice, in particular when 
</b></p>
<p><b>deprived of their liberty. In particular, States have legal obligations related to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate protection of the human rights of children deprived of their liberty, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has attained almost 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal ratification, as well as other internationally recognized standards. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Despite the existence of this normative framework, human rights mechanisms 
have identified a number of implementation gaps with respect to States</b>&#8217;<b> international 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal obligations. This report has identified some of the main problems, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lack of adequate conditions of detention; the imposition of prohibited penalties; 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lack of monitoring and complaint mechanisms; and the inadequacy of training of 
</b></p>
<p><b>personnel dealing with children deprived of their liberty. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Conditions of detention facilities and treatment of children in such facilities 
often fall short of international standards. The rights to be treated with dignity, to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>free from torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as a number of economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, are frequently violated. States should comply with their human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations to protect children from ill-treatment and to respect the dignity and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs of children deprived of their liberty. Moreover, they should ensure to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>maximum possible extent the development of the child. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Even though the imposition of the death penalty, life imprisonment without 
parole, as well as corporal punishment are prohibited under international law and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>contrary to the aims of juvenile justice, they are still used as penalties against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children. States should observe their obligation to ensure that children are not 
</b></p>
<p><b>subjected to such penalties. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>International norms and standards require the establishment of appropriate 
independent monitoring and complaint mechanisms as well as of other safeguards in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to prevent violations of the rights of children deprived of their liberty. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, systematic, independent internal and external oversight, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>complaint mechanisms are lacking in a number of states.  States should establish or 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Competent and well-trained professionals working with children are a 
necessary requirement for the effective functioning of a juvenile justice system which 
</b></p>
<p><b>is sensitive towards, and takes into account, the specific needs of children. Clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards exist for the qualification, selection, recruitment, training and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remuneration of personnel. States should ensure the full implementation of these

<p><b>obligations.
