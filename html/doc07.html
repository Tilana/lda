three paged document in Arabic, from Dr Ahmed El Mufti, Rapporteur of the Advisory Council for Human
Rights, Ministry of Justice, Sudan concerning the communication. The attached document is said to be the
decision of the Constitutional Division of the High Court.
16. The [African] Commission considered the communication at its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali,
Rwanda and requested the Complainant to submit written observations on the outcome of the
administrative appeal filed against the decision of the Minister of Education, and generally, on the
administrative appeal processes in the Republic of Sudan.
17. On 21st January 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission wrote to the parties informing them
of the decision of the [African] Commission. It specifically requested the government of Sudan to furnish it
with the translation of the decision of the Constitutional Division of the High Court in English or French.
18. On 23rd February 2000, following an email from Dr Curtis Doebbler of the Complainant Firm requesting
the Secretariat to furnish him on the progress of all communications filed, the Secretariat forwarded to him
through email the letter of 21st January 2000. It also requested him to indicate a fax number to enable it
send observations received from the government of Sudan for his response.
19. On 1st March 2000, the Secretariat received an email from Dr Curtis Doebbler indicating a fax number

him and observing that there were at least three e-mail addresses given by him to the Secretariat for

Session, the [African] Commission will hear evidence on exhaustion of local remedies and will then decide
on admissibility.
29. At the 29th Ordinary session held in Tripoli, the Rapporteur introduced the communications and
reviewed the facts and the status of the case. The [African] Commission thereafter heard the parties to the
case. Following detailed discussions, the [African] Commission noted that the Complainant had submitted a
detailed brief on the case. It was therefore recommended that consideration of this communication be
deferred to the 30th Session pending submission of detailed replies by the Respondent State.

submissions of the Complainant.

Law
Admissibility
35. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides: "The communications stipulated in Article 55 received by
the Commission relating to human and peoples' rights, must meet the following conditions in order to be
investigated:
2

(5) Be subsequent to exhausting all local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that
the procedure for such recourse is abnormally prolonged;"
36. Concerning the question of exhausting local avenues of recourse, the Complainant informed the
[African] Commission that no effective recourse was available and that, even if used, the Constitutional
Court is not qualified due to the state of emergency and the political limitations, which makes it impossible
to legitimately complain to the court.
37. He maintains that the grounds for a local remedy that could apply are rendered ineffective by the fact
that the legal system in Sudan is neither free nor independent since the Sudanese courts have been
controlled by the executive since 1998 and that, given this situation, the executive could not rule on
proceedings brought against the Sudanese government which are based on international humanitarian law,
or even apply this law when it is clearly relevant.
38. The Complainant alleges that, in practice, the procedures in place, which allow for compensation for
human rights violations committed by the Government of Sudan, are often inaccessible to those individuals
whose rights have been violated, due to the fact that current administrative and legal solutions are serious
obstacles to their use. Consequently, complainants who ask that their rights be protected before Sudanese
courts, come up against obstacles which make these avenues of redress ineffective.
39. The Sudanese government alleges that the complainants did not use the remedies available to them in
the local courts before applying to the [African] Commission. It insists that neither the lawyer lodging the
complaint, nor the complainants, filed an appeal against the decision; this is proved from the registers of
the administrative courts.
40. The government maintains that the Complainants, despite their insistence in previous correspondence,
did not transmit to them the reference number of the appeal that had been filed which proves that no
appeal was filed, contrary to the assertions of the Complainants who therefore did not exhaust all the local
remedies as provided in Article 56 of the African Charter.
41. It argues that the right of the Complainants to file an appeal against a decision of the court, is provided
for in Article 20(1) of the Administrative and Constitutional Code of Justice of 1996 as amended in 2000,
and documentation on decisions handed down in similar cases was submitted.
42. Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that "a communication be introduced subsequent to
exhaustion of local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that the procedure for
such recourse is abnormally prolonged". The complaint before the [African] Commission was received by
the Secretariat on 14th[[/sup]] October 1998 and the decision to close the universities was taken on 26th September 1998, an interval of one
month between closure of the universities and receipt of the complaint.

43. The [African] Commission is of the view that an interval of one month is a short time within which the
Complainant could have accessed and exhausted all local remedies. Furthermore, the Complainant gives
no indication of instituting proceedings before the domestic courts.

Holding

For these reasons, and in accordance with Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the [African]
Commission declares this communication inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of local remedies.

Done at the 31st Ordinary session held in Pretoria, South Africa from 2nd May to 16th May 2002.
