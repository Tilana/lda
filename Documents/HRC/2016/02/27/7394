<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 27/20, 
</p>
<p>in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>to prepare a report on the technical assistance provided by his Office to support inclusive 
</p>
<p>and participatory development and poverty reduction at the national level, for submission 
</p>
<p>its twenty-eighth session. The present report will serve as a basis for a thematic panel 
</p>
<p>discussion to be held at the twenty-eighth session of the Council under item 10 of its 
</p>
<p>agenda.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 27/20, the Council reaffirmed that each country must take primary 
</p>
<p>responsibility for its own development, and emphasized the role of national policies and 
</p>
<p>strategies in the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged States to ensure that such policies and strategies are devised and carried out in a 
</p>
<p>non-discriminatory, participatory, transparent and accountable manner, in order to promote 
</p>
<p>the empowerment of the poorest and most disadvantaged and the realization of their rights. 
</p>
<p>It emphasized the need for States to engage with and promote free, informed and 
</p>
<p>meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, especially in decision-making that 
</p>
<p>directly affects their lives. The Council also encouraged States&#8217; action to ensure 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability by providing accessible and adequate information. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report covers a period of five years (2009&#8211;2014), as a reasonable time 
</p>
<p>frame within which incipient results can be provided. It illustrates the type of work carried 
</p>
<p>out under the technical cooperation programme of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in response to requests and expressions of 
</p>
<p>interest from Member States. It presents initiatives that have shown good potential in 
</p>
<p>promoting inclusive and participatory policies and strategies for development and poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction, in line with the priority areas identified by the Human Rights Council in 
</p>
<p>resolution 27/20. The report also includes a number of joint initiatives carried out by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in cooperation with other United Nations entities.  
</p>
<p>4. The report highlights methodologies, good practices and lessons learned gathered by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in the field and at headquarters. Reference is also made to the OHCHR report on 
</p>
<p>technical assistance and capacity-building options for integrating human rights into national 
</p>
<p>policies (A/HRC/27/41), which provides an overview of technical assistance and capacity-
</p>
<p>building options for integrating human rights into national policies and includes some 
</p>
<p>examples with regard to strengthening participation and social inclusion, which are 
</p>
<p>developed further in the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights-based framework for technical cooperation, 
development and poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p>5. Lack of economic resources is seldom the only or even the most decisive cause of 
</p>
<p>poverty, marginalization and social exclusion. From a human rights perspective, poverty is 
</p>
<p>understood as the denial of a person&#8217;s capacity to realize and enjoy a range of key rights, 
</p>
<p>such as the rights to food, health, education, security, access to justice and political 
</p>
<p>participation. International human rights law also calls for more than mere equality of 
</p>
<p>opportunity without regard to the underlying structures that perpetuate inequality, social 
</p>
<p>exclusion and poverty. What is required under the international human rights framework in 
</p>
<p>order to achieve de facto equality for all is the dismantling of barriers to social, economic 
</p>
<p>and political freedoms, and the establishment of special measures to end discrimination. </p>


<p>OHCHR work to support inclusive development and poverty reduction follows a human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach, which fully recognizes the multidimensional nature of poverty.  
</p>
<p>6. Discrimination is generally deeply embedded in societal structures and makes 
</p>
<p>certain groups of people more vulnerable to poverty and exclusion. For instance, women 
</p>
<p>are more likely to find themselves in situations of poverty as a result of gender-based 
</p>
<p>discrimination. Such discrimination, which persists in all regions of the world, is at the root 
</p>
<p>of women&#8217;s disproportionate burden of domestic and care work, women getting low-paid, 
</p>
<p>precarious jobs, the lack of adequate attention paid to women&#8217;s specific health needs, and 
</p>
<p>widespread violence against women, among other rights violations. Those violations reflect 
</p>
<p>the multidimensional nature of poverty.  
</p>
<p>7. Under international human rights law, all individuals have the right to access 
</p>
<p>information freely and to participate in decisions that affect them. In order to assume that 
</p>
<p>active role, they need to be able to exercise their civil and political rights in an effective and 
</p>
<p>meaningful way. Experience has shown that the active participation of all sectors of society 
</p>
<p>in national efforts aimed at development and poverty reduction significantly enhances the 
</p>
<p>likelihood of sustainable results being attained. For such approaches to achieve their full 
</p>
<p>potential, they should be used at all stages of the development process, from 
</p>
<p>conceptualization through implementation, monitoring and evaluation. To be effective, 
</p>
<p>development and poverty reduction strategies also need to empower people, especially the 
</p>
<p>most marginalized and vulnerable, to claim their rights, and develop the capacity of duty-
</p>
<p>bearers to meet their obligations. That includes building strong judicial, political and 
</p>
<p>administrative mechanisms for accountability and service delivery. 
</p>
<p>8. Promoting the participation of rights-holders, especially women and individuals 
</p>
<p>from discriminated groups, in decision-making processes is one of the expected 
</p>
<p>accomplishments set out in the OHCHR Management Plan 2014&#8211;2017, which guides the 
</p>
<p>work of OHCHR at the country, regional and global levels. The OHCHR technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation programme is intended to help States to identify and address gaps in 
</p>
<p>knowledge, capacity and accountability that obstruct the protection of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>Throughout its work, OHCHR supports States in meeting their international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, including implementing the recommendations of the United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms &#8212; the treaty bodies, special procedures and the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review. To that end, OHCHR works directly with governments, at their request, and 
</p>
<p>actively cooperates with all relevant national stakeholders, including ministries, 
</p>
<p>parliaments, the judiciary, transitional justice mechanisms, security institutions, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions and civil society, as well as statistical and information systems. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR also supports mechanisms for the protection of vulnerable groups, including 
</p>
<p>equality bodies, and cooperates with development actors, civil society and community-
</p>
<p>based organizations to enable them to assume their roles as informed and effective 
</p>
<p>participants at all stages of national development processes. OHCHR-led projects and 
</p>
<p>initiatives in the context of national development and poverty reduction include human 
</p>
<p>rights assessments, providing technical advice on institution-building, strengthening 
</p>
<p>legislation and policies, promoting effective and meaningful participation, training and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building, as well as sharing good practices among States. 
</p>
<p>9. At the country level, OHCHR supports States to ensure that their national 
</p>
<p>development and poverty reduction strategies are in line with their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, and fully incorporate the basic principles of non-discrimination, participation 
</p>
<p>and accountability and the rule of law. In many cases, United Nations country teams or 
</p>
<p>individual United Nations entities can play an effective role to support the integration of 
</p>
<p>human rights into national development policies. In that regard, OHCHR is active in 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming human rights within United Nations development policies, operational 
</p>
<p>activities and assistance frameworks, including through strengthening the United Nations </p>


<p>leadership on human rights at the country level and promoting the application of a coherent 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach to programming. OHCHR also works with regional and 
</p>
<p>subregional organizations to strengthen regional arrangements for human rights promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection, including through the exchange of good practices and experiences of human 
</p>
<p>rights-based, participatory and inclusive strategies for development and poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>10. The Office receives strategic policy guidance for its technical cooperation work 
</p>
<p>from the Board of Trustees that oversees the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical 
</p>
<p>Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and the Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
</p>
<p>Technical Assistance for the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review &#8212; two key 
</p>
<p>financial sources of the technical assistance provided by OHCHR. As part of its advisory 
</p>
<p>role, the Board has identified several key elements for effective technical cooperation, as 
</p>
<p>indicated in the report of the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights (A/HRC/26/51, 
</p>
<p>para. 27). Many of those elements are reflected in the practices highlighted in the present 
</p>
<p>report. 
</p>
<p><b> III. National experiences of support for inclusive and 
participatory development and poverty eradication 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation, plans and policies for inclusive poverty reduction and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Colombia: human rights support for inclusive development and poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p>11. In November 2011, the Government of Colombia established a new administrative 
</p>
<p>Department for Social Prosperity (DSP) as the central authority responsible for developing 
</p>
<p>and implementing policies aimed at overcoming poverty and promoting the social inclusion 
</p>
<p>of people in vulnerable situations. At the request of the Department, OHCHR has been 
</p>
<p>supporting its work by conducting systematic monitoring, evaluation and advocacy to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the integration of human rights standards into the implementation of public 
</p>
<p>policies. OHCHR has paid particular attention to two key social protection programmes: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#225;s Familias en Acci&#243;n&#8221;, which provides direct monetary transfers to families, 
</p>
<p>conditional upon children&#8217;s enrolment in school and regular medical check-ups, and &#8220;Red 
</p>
<p>Unidos&#8221;, which helps families living in extreme poverty through individualized support and 
</p>
<p>follow-up. 
</p>
<p>12. In February 2014, the OHCHR office in Colombia presented DSP with its first 
</p>
<p>report on the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living, with strategic 
</p>
<p>recommendations on how to improve the impact of the DSP programmes. That included 
</p>
<p>strengthening the rights of women covered by the &#8220;M&#225;s Familias en Acci&#243;n&#8221; programme; 
</p>
<p>removing barriers to health care for children and barriers to education for children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities; addressing obstacles in the application of International Labour Organization 
</p>
<p>(ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
</p>
<p>Independent Countries; improving coordination among government entities; addressing the 
</p>
<p>situation of people living in extreme poverty; and strengthening access to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>DSP established a working group with officials from the regions concerned to implement 
</p>
<p>OHCHR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>13. Since the submission of its report to DSP, OHCHR has continued to work towards 
</p>
<p>the empowerment of vulnerable communities in the most marginalized parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>That has included, inter alia, informing communities about the DSP programmes, assisting </p>


<p>them in evaluating the implementation of the recommendations, and supporting them in 
</p>
<p>claiming their rights before the Department. 
</p>
<p><b>  Europe: promoting the independence of persons with disabilities and family-type care 
</b></p>
<p><b>for children  
</b></p>
<p>14. In 2014, the OHCHR Regional Office for Europe continued engaging with the 
</p>
<p>European Union and its Member States through the European Expert Group on the 
</p>
<p>Transition from Institutional to Community-based Care. That coalition of international 
</p>
<p>organizations and European civil society organizations is dedicated to upholding the human 
</p>
<p>rights of vulnerable persons who are in care institutions, or are at risk of being placed in 
</p>
<p>institutional care. In that context, OHCHR is working with other United Nations entities, 
</p>
<p>especially the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, to contribute to important policy changes at 
</p>
<p>the European Union level, such as adjustments in European Union structural and 
</p>
<p>investment funds regulations. That has increased the level of compliance of European 
</p>
<p>Union member States with international human rights standards, including the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>15. With the financial and political support of the European Commission, national 
</p>
<p>consultations on community-based care have been organized in Bulgaria, Croatia, the 
</p>
<p>Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia 
</p>
<p>and Slovenia, involving a broad range of stakeholders, such as relevant ministries, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, European Union officials and national civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>representing rights-holders. In all of those countries, institutionalization is the predominant 
</p>
<p>form of care, and wide-ranging reforms will be required to bring national practice into line 
</p>
<p>with States&#8217; obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. For the reforms to be effective, the full 
</p>
<p>involvement of rights-holders and civil society will be required at all stages of the process. 
</p>
<p>Capacity-building of all actors &#8212; government officials, who often have limited expertise in 
</p>
<p>that technical area, but also civil society representatives, who need to be empowered &#8212; is 
</p>
<p>essential for the success of the reform process. In that regard, the national consultations 
</p>
<p>initiated by OHCHR have been useful in ensuring the engagement of all relevant actors. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya: integration of human rights and gender into the national development agenda  
</b></p>
<p>16. Kenya Vision 2030 is the main national development framework and is aimed at 
</p>
<p>transforming Kenya into a newly industrialized middle-income country that provides a high 
</p>
<p>quality of life for all its citizens by 2030. It also sets out to create a cohesive, equitable and 
</p>
<p>just society based on democratic principles and grounded in the country&#8217;s rich and diverse 
</p>
<p>cultures. Kenya Vision 2030 is to be implemented through successive five-year medium-
</p>
<p>term plans, which define sector-specific priorities, key policy actions and reform 
</p>
<p>programmes for government agents at different levels. 
</p>
<p>17. In 2012, the Government of Kenya invited the United Nations to provide inputs for 
</p>
<p>the preparation of the second medium-term plan. The United Nations participated in several 
</p>
<p>of the sector-specific working groups set up to support the development of the plan. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, through the Human Rights Adviser to the United Nations country team, took the 
</p>
<p>lead in providing human rights guidance on the process, notably with regard to governance, 
</p>
<p>the rule of law, security, the situation of vulnerable groups, gender and youth. 
</p>
<p>18. An important element of the preparation of the second medium-term plan consisted 
</p>
<p>of developing the capacity of key stakeholders to engage effectively in the planning 
</p>
<p>process. OHCHR supported that effort by training government representatives and United 
</p>
<p>Nations staff members on human rights-based approaches. In addition, it trained focal 
</p>
<p>points from the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights who were designated to 
</p>
<p>each sector-specific working group. With OHCHR assistance, a set of human rights-based </p>


<p>indicators was developed to enable effective monitoring and ensure accountability in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the plan. That work resulted in the adoption of a national indicators 
</p>
<p>handbook in November 2014.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kyrgyzstan: building capacity for the promotion and protection of the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>19. In Kyrgyzstan, the OHCHR Regional Office for Central Asia provided technical 
</p>
<p>assistance in the preparation of the Housing Code that was adopted in May 2013. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>organized three parliamentary discussions on the draft code, which were attended by civil 
</p>
<p>society and representatives of housing associations. The discussions were instrumental in 
</p>
<p>raising awareness among relevant Parliamentary committees about the importance of 
</p>
<p>human rights considerations for the drafting of housing legislation. The discussions enabled 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians to hear independent views, thereby promoting transparency and 
</p>
<p>accountability in the legislative process. 
</p>
<p>20. Throughout the legislative process, OHCHR provided human rights advice and 
</p>
<p>technical assistance to the drafters. The final text reflects many important aspects of the 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing, as set out in relevant international norms and standards. It 
</p>
<p>defines the roles and responsibilities of the national and local self-government bodies in 
</p>
<p>relation to the right to housing and obliges the Government to create a national housing 
</p>
<p>fund to address resource constraints.  
</p>
<p>21. The OHCHR Regional Office also played a key role in mobilizing joint advocacy by 
</p>
<p>the donor community on the need for a human rights-based approach to urban planning in 
</p>
<p>the context of development-based evictions, including in the south of Kyrgyzstan. Those 
</p>
<p>efforts were successful in gaining the support of the Mayor of Osh, who publicly committed 
</p>
<p>to taking human rights into account when implementing the Master Plan in Osh. In July 
</p>
<p>2014, on the basis of OHCHR advocacy, the President of Kyrgyzstan signed a law that 
</p>
<p>obliged local authorities to post adopted master plans of all cities, towns and villages on 
</p>
<p>their websites, and to display them in their offices for public reference. 
</p>
<p>22. The Regional Office also provided technical assistance to the Government in 
</p>
<p>drafting the National Strategy on Sustainable Development 2013&#8211;2017. The Strategy goes 
</p>
<p>some way towards embracing the principle of participatory development and emphasizes 
</p>
<p>the importance of upholding the rights of all minorities in the development process. 
</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Moldova: strengthening the national framework for social inclusion  
</b></p>
<p><b>and anti-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>23. Through the Human Rights Adviser to the United Nations country team, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>support to the Government of the Republic of Moldova on anti-discrimination legislation 
</p>
<p>began in 2008 and has contributed to the development of critical laws, translating the 
</p>
<p>international prohibition against discrimination into domestic legislation. OHCHR thus 
</p>
<p>provided advice for the development of the Law on Ensuring Equality and to the 
</p>
<p>subsequent establishment of the Council on the Prevention and Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination and Ensuring Equality (&#8220;Equality Council&#8221;). In May 2013, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>advocacy led the Republic of Moldova to accept the competence of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination to review individual complaints and petitions. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR also provided advice on the development of the Law on Roma Community 
</p>
<p>Mediators, which was adopted on 22 March 2013 in order to promote the social inclusion 
</p>
<p>of the Roma, in line with the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR also assisted in the development of the Law on the Social Inclusion of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities, adopted in March 2012, which requires equal legal capacity and 
</p>
<p>reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities. </p>


<p>24. OHCHR has provided extensive support to the Equality Council, including in the 
</p>
<p>development of its strategic plan and operational structure. In that context, OHCHR held 
</p>
<p>training courses on national and international anti-discrimination standards and on the 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion and belief legislation in place in the Republic of Moldova. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>also organized further training for judges, prosecutors, lawyers and members of the 
</p>
<p>Equality Council on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising campaign was well received and an increasing number of cases relating 
</p>
<p>to gender equality, discrimination and hate speech are now being adjudicated by Moldovan 
</p>
<p>courts. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paraguay: capacity development for inclusive and rights-based poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p>25. In 2013/2014, at the Government&#8217;s request, OHCHR, through its Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Adviser, supported the work of the Secretariat for Social Action to integrate human rights 
</p>
<p>into its policymaking and implementation. The eradication of poverty is a government 
</p>
<p>priority and the Secretariat is the main implementing agency for the relevant policies, 
</p>
<p>working directly with communities in rural areas and among indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR technical support has allowed the Secretariat for Social Action to revise its 
</p>
<p>institutional framework, so as to integrate human rights into its policies, methodologies and 
</p>
<p>communication materials, including its website. OHCHR also contributed by running an 
</p>
<p>intensive training programme and assisting in the development of a special protocol on 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and their participation in decision-making, following 
</p>
<p>consultations facilitated by OHCHR with indigenous peoples. It will be the first protocol of 
</p>
<p>its kind in the region directly addressing key issues relating to consultation and 
</p>
<p>participation.  
</p>
<p>27. The project has benefited from continuous political support from the highest levels, 
</p>
<p>and has been successful in gradually integrating a stronger human rights perspective into 
</p>
<p>the way the Secretariat carries out its functions. Work is now under way to introduce a 
</p>
<p>human rights indicators framework, based on detailed disaggregated data, for the 
</p>
<p>monitoring of poverty reduction programmes. In 2015, community leaders and families will 
</p>
<p>also be trained in how to take a more active and informed role in decision-making and 
</p>
<p>policymaking that affect their lives. Further support is also in the pipeline to mainstream 
</p>
<p>gender into the work programme in close cooperation with the United Nations Entity for 
</p>
<p>Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). 
</p>
<p><b>  State of Palestine: an inclusive and rights-based framework for development 
</b></p>
<p>28. In 2011, the Ministry of Justice of the Palestinian National Authority requested 
</p>
<p>OHCHR assistance in developing a rights-based framework for the national development 
</p>
<p>agenda. Broad-based national consultations, aimed at identifying rights-based targets for 
</p>
<p>prioritization in the national development plan that was being drafted in parallel, were 
</p>
<p>launched at a large public conference in Ramallah on 10 December 2012. In follow-up to 
</p>
<p>the conference, a team of Palestinian consultants, with OHCHR support, analysed 
</p>
<p>development gaps and needs from a human rights perspective, including through broad-
</p>
<p>based consultations and validation workshops, which provided input from a range of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including government officials and representatives of the Palestinian human 
</p>
<p>rights institution, civil society, community-based organizations, labour and employers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>unions, academia and affected groups, as well as United Nations entities and the diplomatic 
</p>
<p>community. The result was a comprehensive guidance document setting out ways to 
</p>
<p>incorporate human rights more effectively into the Palestinian National Development Plan 
</p>
<p>2014&#8211;2016 and other future development and recovery frameworks. 
</p>
<p>29. The guidance document was finalized by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Planning and Administrative Development and OHCHR in January 2014, and launched at a </p>


<p>formal signing ceremony, confirming the Government&#8217;s commitment to the process. The 
</p>
<p>majority of recommendations set out in the guidance document were integrated into the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian National Development Plan in February 2014, providing a strong human rights-
</p>
<p>based framework for the four sectors covered by the Plan: social development, economic 
</p>
<p>development, infrastructure and governance. 
</p>
<p>30. The accession of the State of Palestine to seven of the core international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties in April 2014 has provided an opportunity for OHCHR to build on the work 
</p>
<p>described above with the Palestinian authorities, as well as the Palestinian Independent 
</p>
<p>Commission for Human Rights and civil society, so that the political commitments 
</p>
<p>contained in the Palestinian National Development Plan are implemented in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the legal obligations contained in the treaties. Broad-based consultations are planned 
</p>
<p>as part of the Government&#8217;s reporting exercise. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sierra Leone: responding to the Ebola virus disease outbreak 
</b></p>
<p>31. In May 2014, Sierra Leone experienced the start of its first outbreak of the Ebola 
</p>
<p>virus disease. In addition to the death and human suffering caused by the epidemic, the 
</p>
<p>knock-on effects will be devastating for the development of Sierra Leone in the coming 
</p>
<p>years and may erode the gains made since the end of the war. The consequences are not 
</p>
<p>limited to the health sector, as large parts of the country&#8217;s economy are being severely 
</p>
<p>disrupted by the epidemic. Schools have also been closed following the declaration of a 
</p>
<p>state of emergency, which seeks to control the spread of the disease by limiting public 
</p>
<p>gatherings and freedom of movement. Likewise, courts are reportedly not processing 
</p>
<p>criminal cases. That has led to a steady increase in the prison population, which besides 
</p>
<p>increasing health risks among prisoners, fuels the potential for disturbances inside detention 
</p>
<p>facilities. 
</p>
<p>32. Recognizing the Government&#8217;s role in bringing Ebola virus disease under control 
</p>
<p>and providing emergency humanitarian assistance, the United Nations in Sierra Leone has 
</p>
<p>significantly strengthened its response in support of the Government&#8217;s ongoing efforts. 
</p>
<p>Since his arrival in April 2014, the Human Rights Adviser to the United Nations country 
</p>
<p>team1 has provided substantive guidance to alert policymakers and the humanitarian sector 
</p>
<p>to the serious human rights implications and concerns related to the outbreak, especially 
</p>
<p>regarding vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.  
</p>
<p>33. As the combined efforts of the Government and the international community gather 
</p>
<p>pace, it is essential that a human rights approach be continuously applied to guide the work 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations and the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone, to inform 
</p>
<p>advocacy by relevant stakeholders and to serve as an early warning system for the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and the Government. The Human Rights Adviser is also working to promote 
</p>
<p>increased participation and inclusiveness in the response to the outbreak. It will be crucial 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the impending recovery and reconstruction effort is conducted in a 
</p>
<p>transparent and accountable manner, in accordance with a human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p><b>  West Africa: in</b>tegration of women&#8217;s rights and empowerment in national policies<b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. Over the past several years, the OHCHR Regional Office for West Africa has 
</p>
<p>continued to promote the integration of women&#8217;s rights into the development and 
</p>
<p>implementation of national policies and strategies in the region. In Burkina Faso, the 
</p>
<p>Gambia and Senegal, national action plans have been adopted for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The Human Rights Adviser was deployed under the United Nations Development Group human 
</p>
<p>rights mainstreaming mechanism. </p>


<p>Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, and 1820 (2008) 
</p>
<p>on sexual violence in conflicts. OHCHR provided financial and technical support for the 
</p>
<p>development, validation and publication of the action plans, and contributed to building the 
</p>
<p>capacity of stakeholders to ensure implementation. In the Gambia, OHCHR supported the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the national action plan by providing technical and financial assistance, 
</p>
<p>including training of trainers workshops on human rights and gender-based violence for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials.  
</p>
<p>35. Progress has also been made regarding the harmonization of national laws with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards. In Senegal, OHCHR provided advice on the 
</p>
<p>development of a law allowing women to pass on their nationality to their children or 
</p>
<p>spouse. The Office also worked with civil society to raise public awareness of the law after 
</p>
<p>its adoption in 2013. In 2013, OHCHR assisted the Government to prepare its report under 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. During 
</p>
<p>the elections held in 2012 and 2014, the Regional Office supported civil society in 
</p>
<p>monitoring the implementation of the 2010 parity law on the participation of women in 
</p>
<p>national politics. In 2014, OHCHR supported the process of preparing a manual on gender 
</p>
<p>and human rights for parliamentarians, and undertook capacity-building for women 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p><b>  Yemen: inclusive and participatory management of land disputes 
</b></p>
<p>36. Since May 2013, OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme 
</p>
<p>(UNDP) in Yemen have been engaged in a joint project on transitional justice in support of 
</p>
<p>the Commission to Consider and Address Land Issues (the Land Commission) and the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Forcibly Dismissed Employees for Southern Yemen (the Dismissals 
</p>
<p>Commission). Both commissions were established in 2013 as confidence-building measures 
</p>
<p>to address the root causes of grievances held by people in southern Yemen following the 
</p>
<p>1994 war. A special Compensation Fund has also been established for cases of land 
</p>
<p>confiscation and alleged summary dismissal of civil security and military personnel. 
</p>
<p>37. So far, the Land Commission has received more than 100,000 individual claims 
</p>
<p>concerning illegal confiscations, of which 30,000 had been resolved at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>The Dismissals Commission has received over 100,000 applications, of which 20,000 had 
</p>
<p>been processed by December 2014. The commissions and the compensation fund suffer 
</p>
<p>from chronic financial and staff shortages, and weak political support.  
</p>
<p>38. The joint OHCHR-UNDP project has promoted transparency and accountability, 
</p>
<p>including through a strategy to allow civil society to monitor the work of the commissions 
</p>
<p>and the implementation of their recommendations. OHCHR and UNDP organized study 
</p>
<p>visits for the staff of the commissions to Germany and Peru in order to expose them to 
</p>
<p>experiences and good practices used to resolve similar cases and apply high standards of 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability. The project supported the establishment of interactive web 
</p>
<p>portals for both commissions, enabling individuals to monitor progress in the processing of 
</p>
<p>their cases. Throughout the project, there has also been regular cooperation with local 
</p>
<p>media to encourage press coverage, interviews with decision-makers and investigative 
</p>
<p>journalism. The decisions of the two commissions have yet to be implemented. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>and UNDP will continue their advocacy with international and local partners to keep the 
</p>
<p>issue at the centre of the Government&#8217;s political and development agenda. </p>


<p><b> B. Empowerment for free, informed and meaningful participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>in public decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Cambodia: building local capacities in regard to land and housing rights 
</b></p>
<p>39. The OHCHR office in Cambodia has continued its work to build greater human 
</p>
<p>rights awareness among indigenous communities, particularly regarding the freedoms of 
</p>
<p>expression and peaceful assembly, as well as land and housing rights. OHCHR monitored 
</p>
<p>ongoing and unresolved disputes between indigenous communities, authorities and 
</p>
<p>businesses, and engaged in the facilitation of dialogue, court monitoring and the provision 
</p>
<p>of legal and procedural advice. In 2013 and 2014, OHCHR also provided support to 
</p>
<p>11 indigenous communities to complete their registration as legal entities and submit their 
</p>
<p>applications for collective land titles. As a result, those communities are now in a stronger 
</p>
<p>position to defend and claim their rights to land and livelihood.  
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR Cambodia also produced publications on land and housing rights, as well 
</p>
<p>as a picture book for indigenous peoples on business and human rights, prepared in 
</p>
<p>cooperation with an indigenous peoples&#8217; network organization. The aim is to gradually 
</p>
<p>strengthen the role of indigenous communities in national protection systems and, through 
</p>
<p>increased knowledge and understanding, to allow them to meaningfully participate in 
</p>
<p>decisions that affect them. To that end, since 2013 OHCHR has been providing training for 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations and communities on monitoring economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, and on implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>Information on business and human rights was also shared with the Government&#8217;s Anti-
</p>
<p>Corruption Unit, donors, businesses and professional associations. 
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR continued to monitor legislative developments that could affect indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; land and housing rights. That included support for the consultation process for a 
</p>
<p>bill on environmental impact assessments, led by the Ministry of the Environment. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>facilitated participation in the consultation process by indigenous leaders and other 
</p>
<p>representatives of communities affected by development projects and involved in land 
</p>
<p>disputes. The Office also provided advice on the harmonization of the draft bill with 
</p>
<p>international standards. 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR has also been engaged in promoting and protecting the exercise of freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression and peaceful assembly. In 2013, it organized five training sessions on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Law on Peaceful Demonstrations and international standards on 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and assembly. The training outlined the respective responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>organizers of demonstrations and authorities, and gave guidance to participants on how to 
</p>
<p>conduct demonstrations in accordance with the law. In addition, OHCHR trained staff of 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations on how to monitor the right to peaceful assembly. In 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior, OHCHR also produced a laminated card 
</p>
<p>outlining the respective roles and responsibilities of organizers of demonstrations and local 
</p>
<p>authorities. The card is being disseminated among government officials, civil society and 
</p>
<p>the general public. In addition, OHCHR produced a series of radio broadcasts in which 
</p>
<p>local organizations participated and discussed issues relating to freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>  Colombia: promoting the right of indigenous peoples to prior, free and informed 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation 
</b></p>
<p>43. In the context of increasing demands from communities of African descent and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples for their rights to prior consultation and free and informed consent to be 
</p>
<p>recognized, OHCHR developed a project to hold broad-based consultations with the 
</p>
<p>communities concerned in the course of 2012. OHCHR invited indigenous, Afro-</p>


<p>Colombian, Palenquero, Raizal and Roma peoples to be part of the process. It included a 
</p>
<p>series of 82 regional dialogues organized and facilitated by OHCHR across the country. 
</p>
<p>About 3,000 delegates from the regions of the Caribbean, Pacific, Orinoco, Amazonia and 
</p>
<p>inter-Andean valleys participated in the process, which was instrumental in mobilizing 
</p>
<p>national consensus on the importance of prior, free and informed consultation.  
</p>
<p>44. The observations and findings that came out of the process were compiled and 
</p>
<p>documented by OHCHR in a report entitled &#8220;Voices and key opinions from the ethnic 
</p>
<p>peoples of Colombia on the right to consultation and to free, prior and informed consent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR subsequently engaged with the Ministry of the Interior to encourage the adoption 
</p>
<p>of protocols that ensure the right to participation, consultation and free and informed 
</p>
<p>consent through culturally sensitive procedures. 
</p>
<p>45. As an important part of that process, some ethnic groups, including the indigenous 
</p>
<p>Wayuu and Arhuaco peoples and the communities of African descent of La Toma, were 
</p>
<p>provided with advice to increase their capacity to claim their rights and participate in 
</p>
<p>decision-making. OHCHR also held training sessions on the right to prior consultation for 
</p>
<p>staff of the Ministry of the Interior, as well as municipal and regional authorities. Training 
</p>
<p>on indigenous people&#8217;s rights was also provided to civil servants, civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives and students. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guatemala: strengthening capacity to guarantee the fulfilment of agricultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers</b>&#8217;<b> labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>46. In Guatemala, the OHCHR country office provided technical assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Labour in the preparation of a handbook that could be used to verify the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of agricultural workers&#8217; labour rights. It also promoted and supported the 
</p>
<p>creation of a working group on agricultural workers&#8217; human rights, composed of peasant 
</p>
<p>workers, grass-roots organizations and labour unions. A participatory methodology 
</p>
<p>proposed by OHCHR was adopted by the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour to 
</p>
<p>launch the process of drafting the handbook. In 2012, four regional workshops were 
</p>
<p>organized with the participation of 90 labour inspectors, who shared their experience and 
</p>
<p>discussed the main challenges to respecting agricultural workers&#8217; labour rights in the 
</p>
<p>country. OHCHR, in coordination with the ILO, provided inputs on the international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards and supported the process of designing and drafting the handbook, which 
</p>
<p>was also informed by issues raised by the working group. In 2014, the working group 
</p>
<p>produced a report on the situation of agricultural workers in Guatemala and urged the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Labour to discuss some of the key human rights challenges identified in the 
</p>
<p>report.  
</p>
<p>47. In 2014, the Minister of Labour was finalizing the approval process for the 
</p>
<p>publication of the handbook as part of a general operations protocol for the General 
</p>
<p>Inspectorate. The handbook reflects many important aspects of labour rights, such as the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of child labour and forced labour, and of discrimination against women. The 
</p>
<p>handbook will be a practical tool for labour inspectors to address the critical human rights 
</p>
<p>situation that agricultural workers are facing in some regions of Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mexico: increasing participation through action plans  
</b></p>
<p>48. Since 2006, the OHCHR office in Mexico has been supporting the design of human 
</p>
<p>rights plans, notably in partnership with the Directorate-General for Human Rights Public 
</p>
<p>Policy of the Ministry of the Interior (Secretar&#237;a de Gobernaci&#243;n) at the federal level, and 
</p>
<p>line ministries or human rights offices at state level. Since 2006, some 15 such plans have 
</p>
<p>been developed. OHCHR assistance in supporting State efforts to secure the participation of 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations and marginalized groups has been especially appreciated. 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s rights organizations were actively involved in the development of those plans, all </p>


<p>of which integrate a strong gender framework. One of the main objectives of OHCHR 
</p>
<p>support to the federal plan was to strengthen cooperation between the authorities and civil 
</p>
<p>society. Building on that collaborative effort, the Office has contributed to the elaboration 
</p>
<p>of one national human rights assessment, three national human rights plans and several 
</p>
<p>local human rights programmes. 
</p>
<p>49. The National Human Rights Programme 2014&#8211;2018, which was presented by the 
</p>
<p>Federal Government on 25 June 2014, is the first programme of its kind in the country to 
</p>
<p>explicitly adopt the OHCHR human rights indicators methodology, as well as the inter-
</p>
<p>American system indicators on economic, social and cultural rights, to measure the full 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights. The next step will be to help start the development of human 
</p>
<p>rights programmes at the level of the states. 
</p>
<p><b>  Nepal: addressing the equality imperative  
</b></p>
<p>50. In September 2012, the Government of Nepal and the United Nations country team 
</p>
<p>signed the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the period 
</p>
<p>2013&#8211;2017. The strategic framework for the United Nations work in Nepal in those five 
</p>
<p>years was prepared following human rights-based approach methodologies and has been 
</p>
<p>acclaimed as a good example of an UNDAF.  
</p>
<p>51. Prior to the preparation of the UNDAF, the country team, with the support of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, prepared a common country analysis with a particular focus on the different types 
</p>
<p>of vulnerability that people in Nepal face, as well as the root causes of the vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p>The aim was ultimately to help narrow down the potential policy and institutional issues 
</p>
<p>that could form the core of the development efforts undertaken by the United Nations in 
</p>
<p>Nepal. The country team used the analysis to understand the situation of vulnerable groups 
</p>
<p>in the country, examine the structural causes of the vulnerabilities and gain a better 
</p>
<p>understanding of which groups are particularly susceptible to future shocks that could 
</p>
<p>substantially reverse the development gains achieved over recent years.  
</p>
<p>52. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the issue, the country analysis looked at 
</p>
<p>specific groups of people, whose vulnerability was described on the basis of the experience 
</p>
<p>and expertise of United Nations development actors. As a result, the following 19 groups 
</p>
<p>were incorporated in the UNDAF design: women subject to sexual abuse and exploitation; 
</p>
<p>women in the mid and far west; women of reproductive age; adolescent girls; endangered 
</p>
<p>and highly marginalized indigenous people; other disadvantaged women and girls; Dalits; 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities; children without basic education; undernourished children; 
</p>
<p>underemployed and unemployed youth; migrant workers and their families; rural landless 
</p>
<p>and land-poor; bonded and forced labourers; urban slum dwellers and squatters; conflict-
</p>
<p>affected people; the illiterate; people from the lowest performing districts; and people from 
</p>
<p>areas especially vulnerable to climate change. For each group, a detailed profile was 
</p>
<p>prepared and reviewed with a wide range of stakeholders. The emphasis of the profiles was 
</p>
<p>an analysis of the underlying causes of each group&#8217;s vulnerability. An aggregate analysis 
</p>
<p>was developed aimed at identifying, thematizing and categorizing the groups&#8217; 
</p>
<p>characteristics and, perhaps most importantly, finding commonalities in the underlying 
</p>
<p>causes of their vulnerabilities.  
</p>
<p>53. While social inclusion is the main thread linking all the efforts undertaken by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations under UNDAF, specific programmes are designed and implemented that 
</p>
<p>ensure the employment of targeted approaches to reach and have an impact on the lives of 
</p>
<p>the 19 vulnerable groups that have been identified, and to promote their participation in 
</p>
<p>decision-making processes. The United Nations actively contributed to the State&#8217;s efforts to 
</p>
<p>ensure that its policies are implemented in an inclusive manner, with due regard to gender 
</p>
<p>considerations as well as the particular interests of marginalized regions and communities. </p>


<p><b>  Uganda: multi-stakeholder dialogue on rights-based approaches to maternal and child 
</b></p>
<p><b>mortality 
</b></p>
<p>54. High mortality rates among women and young children remain a major challenge in 
</p>
<p>Uganda. The country also has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the world.  
</p>
<p>55. Since 2013, the OHCHR office in Uganda, together with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Ministry of Health, has been supporting a multi-
</p>
<p>stakeholder dialogue aimed at promoting a human rights-based, participatory and inclusive 
</p>
<p>approach in the national effort to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality. The 
</p>
<p>initiative began with a regional workshop, held in Malawi in November 2013, which 
</p>
<p>convened representatives of governments, national human rights institutions, civil society 
</p>
<p>and United Nations entities from Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and the United Republic of 
</p>
<p>Tanzania to explore ways to apply rights-based approaches to maternal and child mortality 
</p>
<p>in their respective national contexts. 
</p>
<p>56. In follow-up to the workshop, OHCHR commissioned an assessment of the health 
</p>
<p>and human rights situations of women and children in Uganda, and presented it in 
</p>
<p>November 2014 to a national-level multi-stakeholder group organized in Kampala jointly 
</p>
<p>with UNFPA, the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health. In addition to 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Finance and the Office of the First Lady, and district-level officials, the group also included 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians, representatives of private health-care providers, civil society, the Uganda 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission and the United Nations. The group considered the main 
</p>
<p>findings of the OHCHR assessment and identified action points to support maternal and 
</p>
<p>child health, including: advocacy for law reform and implementation of legislation (Penal 
</p>
<p>Law, Marriage and Divorce Act and Death Registration Act); advocacy for greater 
</p>
<p>participation in the State budget process; generation of more and better quality 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data; and inclusion of human rights training in the curricula for health 
</p>
<p>workers. The Government of Uganda committed itself to integrating human rights into 
</p>
<p>upcoming planning activities, including the preparation of the National Development Plan.  
</p>
<p>57. The process has been helpful in bringing a wide range of stakeholders together and 
</p>
<p>has served to raise awareness among civil society and government authorities concerning 
</p>
<p>more fully embracing an inclusive and participatory approach to planning and decision-
</p>
<p>making. It is expected that the methodologies tested and developed under the project may 
</p>
<p>become part of the standard national planning process and be replicated in other sectors. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Republic of Tanzania: combating the exclusion of and violence against people 
</b></p>
<p><b>with albinism 
</b></p>
<p>58. In the United Republic of Tanzania, people with albinism have long faced 
</p>
<p>discrimination, exclusion and outright rejection by their families and society at large. Many 
</p>
<p>also suffer from physical violence, as they are hunted down, mutilated and their amputated 
</p>
<p>body parts used in witchcraft rituals. That extreme social exclusion has a devastating 
</p>
<p>impact on children with albinism, who often find themselves unable to attend school 
</p>
<p>because of discrimination, bullying and violence.  
</p>
<p>59. The authorities have taken measures to combat those crimes, and special centres 
</p>
<p>have been set up under the auspices of civil society to provide safe havens for children with 
</p>
<p>albinism. While welcoming those steps, OHCHR has continued to voice concern about the 
</p>
<p>risk of isolation and institutionalization of those children, and emphasized the urgent need 
</p>
<p>to reinforce the justice system in response to those crimes. People with albinism are often 
</p>
<p>unable to access justice for the crimes committed against them and unwilling to testify for 
</p>
<p>fear of reprisal and further victimization. </p>


<p>60. The Human Rights Adviser to the United Nations country team1 has helped raise 
</p>
<p>awareness of the situation and promote a common understanding among the Government, 
</p>
<p>the National Human Rights Institute, civil society and the United Nations on the need for a 
</p>
<p>concerted and human rights-based approach to address the issue. A strong United Nations 
</p>
<p>strategy for the protection and promotion of the rights of persons with albinism is being 
</p>
<p>developed, with a concrete action plan and monitoring framework, to complement the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s efforts. 
</p>
<p>61. Violence against people with albinism is not specific to the United Republic of 
</p>
<p>Tanzania. Since 2000, OHCHR has received information about more than 200 ritual attacks 
</p>
<p>in 15 African States. It is believed that many attacks remain undocumented and unreported, 
</p>
<p>owing to the stigma and secretiveness involved.

<p><b>  Zambia: promoting social inclusion of the Abatwa indigenous community 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Abatwa indigenous community in Zambia has long been subjected to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, social exclusion and poverty. In an effort to raise awareness about that 
</p>
<p>situation, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the United Nations country team 
</p>
<p>initiated a project with the Office of the Vice-President of Zambia to produce a film 
</p>
<p>documenting the situation of the Abatwa community. The Human Rights Adviser to the 
</p>
<p>country team1 provided guidance in order to ensure that the film would focus on the many 
</p>
<p>challenges facing the Abatwa community in terms of marginalization and discrimination, 
</p>
<p>and on the urgent need to ensure their participation in key decision-making. The 
</p>
<p>documentary looks at the situation of the Abatwa from a human rights perspective and has 
</p>
<p>become an important awareness-raising tool illustrating the deprivation and exclusion to 
</p>
<p>which the Abatwa have been subjected. It has also helped identify priority areas for United 
</p>
<p>Nations support to the Government to better address the situation of that vulnerable 
</p>
<p>community.

<p><b>  Ecuador: atlas of socioeconomic inequalities 
</b></p>
<p>63. Between 2011 and 2013, at the request of the Government of Ecuador, OHCHR and 
</p>
<p>the National Secretariat for Planning and Development (SENPLADES) engaged in close 
</p>
<p>collaboration to strengthen the integration of human rights into the national development 
</p>
<p>programme. The work resulted in the adoption of guidelines for the development of sectoral 
</p>
<p>public policy and guidelines for the integration of a human rights-based approach into the 
</p>
<p>national development plan and the development of an atlas of socioeconomic inequalities. 
</p>
<p>64. The atlas of socioeconomic inequalities, launched in 2013, was the result of close 
</p>
<p>cooperation between SENPLADES, OHCHR and other United Nations entities, the Centro 
</p>
<p>de Planificaci&#243;n y Estudio Social (Centre for Planning and Social Studies) and the 
</p>
<p>Universidad Andina Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var<i>.</i> The atlas is an innovative database that maps gaps in 
</p>
<p>the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, and provides disaggregated data on a 
</p>
<p>wide range of determinants, including ethnicity, sex, gender, age and region. The 
</p>
<p>information contained in the atlas has made it possible to develop new social indicators that 
</p>
<p>are better suited to measure poverty from a multidimensional perspective. The atlas served 
</p>
<p>as a baseline for the National Strategy for Poverty Eradication and also provides data for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the National Development Plan for the period 2014&#8211;2017. The 
</p>
<p>intention is to use the atlas in the years to come as a guide in the formulation and 
</p>
<p>implementation of targeted policies aimed at addressing persistent inequalities in Ecuador. </p>


<p><b>  Haiti: building capacity to monitor economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>65. Since 2009, the Human Rights Section of the United Nations Stabilization Mission 
</p>
<p>in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has been carrying out an innovative programme to develop the 
</p>
<p>capacity of civil society in several disadvantaged regions to monitor and advocate for 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights. The main objectives of the public policy monitoring 
</p>
<p>project were to encourage dialogue between the authorities and civil society on public 
</p>
<p>policy priorities from a human rights-based approach, and to strengthen the capacity of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations to participate in decision-making and in the development and 
</p>
<p>monitoring of public policies and budgets. 
</p>
<p>66. The project has enhanced civil society&#8217;s exposure to public decision-making and 
</p>
<p>contributed to more open and regular information-sharing between it and the local and 
</p>
<p>national authorities. The overall response of the Government has been positive, with the 
</p>
<p>active participation of ministers and parliamentarians. The findings and recommendations 
</p>
<p>emanating from the project were taken into account in the national budget process for 
</p>
<p>2012&#8211;2013.  
</p>
<p>67. In some cases, the project has been hampered by weak capacities and a lack of 
</p>
<p>coordination and cooperation among State agencies. Access to public documents and 
</p>
<p>information also proved challenging at times, especially outside the capital. The Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Section of MINUSTAH is evaluating the project and working with the Government, 
</p>
<p>civil society and the United Nations system to explore ways to extend it to other parts of the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Tunisia: strengthening civil society capacities to monitor the implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>68. Since 2012, the OHCHR office in Tunisia, in partnership with Amnesty 
</p>
<p>International, has organized a series of training sessions outside the capital to build the 
</p>
<p>capacity of civil society actors working in disadvantaged regions to better assess the 
</p>
<p>implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. That has included training on 
</p>
<p>advocacy, campaign methodology and human rights-based budget analysis. In 2013, around 
</p>
<p>300 human rights defenders and representatives of civil society from across the country 
</p>
<p>took part in those activities. Four regional civil society coalitions have been set up in the 
</p>
<p>regions of the north-west, the centre, the south-east and the Gafsa Mining Basin. They have 
</p>
<p>launched a national campaign for the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and have conducted 
</p>
<p>human rights assessments of the local budgets, with the participation of local mayors.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Lessons learned, challenges and the way forward 
</b></p>
<p>69. The examples presented in the present report highlight common traits and 
</p>
<p>methodologies that have proved helpful in supporting programmes for human rights-based, 
</p>
<p>inclusive and participatory development and poverty reduction. Most of the key 
</p>
<p>determinants for success that have been identified are related to national ownership &#8212; the 
</p>
<p>projects have been planned and implemented at the request of national actors and in a way 
</p>
<p>that ensures accountability, transparency and the meaningful participation of all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. In that regard, experience has shown that it is crucial for all relevant State and 
</p>
<p>non-State stakeholders to participate in all stages of those initiatives, starting from the 
</p>
<p>initial conceptualization, through implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Such 
</p>
<p>participation is all the more important when it comes to planning and decision-making that 
</p>
<p>involve multiple sectors and require the expertise of a variety of ministries and institutions, 
</p>
<p>such as in the implementation of multisectoral development and poverty-reduction </p>


<p>strategies. In that regard, a human rights-based approach can help to ensure policy 
</p>
<p>coherence, including by highlighting the interrelatedness and interdependence of civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>70. Women are particularly at risk of social exclusion as they are often exposed to 
</p>
<p>multiple forms of discrimination based on gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. 
</p>
<p>Special measures are needed in order for women to be ensured equal rights to fully 
</p>
<p>participate in public life in general and in decision-making that affects them specifically. 
</p>
<p>71. In order to strengthen monitoring, accountability and transparency, there is often a 
</p>
<p>need to build capacities for the collection and analysis of detailed and disaggregated 
</p>
<p>information, and to develop human rights indicators. Such data are crucial to identify gaps 
</p>
<p>and disparities that are based on key social determinants, including gender, ethnicity, 
</p>
<p>economic status and geographic location. Free access to current data can allow the public to 
</p>
<p>monitor progress in the implementation of human rights through development and poverty-
</p>
<p>reduction programmes. Experiences in developing indicator frameworks that are 
</p>
<p>specifically tailored to local circumstances show particular promise in that regard.  
</p>
<p>72. Promoting the integration of human rights in national budget processes has become 
</p>
<p>an increasingly important area of work for OHCHR. The promotion and protection of all 
</p>
<p>human rights require budgetary resources and, in the case of economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, Member States are obliged to provide &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;progressively realize&#8221; those rights. Government budgets are fundamental tools for policy 
</p>
<p>implementation and an effective way to ascertain whether national development priorities 
</p>
<p>are being implemented. Budget monitoring, analysis and advocacy, from a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective, have the potential to provide concrete evidence of governments&#8217; efforts to 
</p>
<p>respect, protect and fulfil all human rights for all without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>73. The experience of OHCHR also shows that, while participatory and inclusive 
</p>
<p>processes are essential for sustainable and effective development, they are also inherently 
</p>
<p>complex and demanding for all parties concerned. Any initiative aimed at engaging a wide 
</p>
<p>range of stakeholders with varying claims and interests must therefore factor in sufficient 
</p>
<p>time and resources to build the awareness and capacities of rights-holders and duty-bearers 
</p>
<p>to fully assume their respective roles in an informed and responsive manner. Such 
</p>
<p>processes also require resilience, preparedness to commit and willingness to engage in 
</p>
<p>positive and effective communication with a diverse range of counterparts. The work of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR on reducing institutional care of persons with disabilities has generated useful 
</p>
<p>examples of how national law and practice can be reformed through open and inclusive 
</p>
<p>processes. Perhaps most importantly, meaningful participation and inclusion obviously 
</p>
<p>need to go beyond mere information sharing or consultations, and require the empowerment 
</p>
<p>of people to take an active part in decision-making, so as to ensure that poorly conceived 
</p>
<p>participation exercises are not used to legitimize predetermined outcomes. In that regard, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR has in many instances taken a facilitating role and managed to bring rights-holders 
</p>
<p>and duty-bearers together to discuss and address often complex human rights issues. Those 
</p>
<p>experiences show that empowerment and confidence-building need to go hand in hand in 
</p>
<p>order to address discrimination and cultural barriers that prevent effective participation by 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups, such as indigenous communities and vulnerable minorities.
