<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights and the activities of 
her Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Human Rights Council in its resolution 10/33 invited the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its thirteenth session on the 
development of the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
on the activities carried out by her Office (OHCHR) in the country.  
 The High Commissioner acknowledges the tentative efforts of the Government to 
align its policy and practice with the international human rights obligations it has 
voluntarily assumed. However, she is concerned that improvement in the human rights 
situation in the country, critical to achieving a well-functioning democracy, has been 
limited and that the human rights situation in the country remains extremely problematic.  
</p>
<p> Through interaction with various parts of the United Nations human rights system, 
including the High Commissioner, the Human Rights Council and its special procedures, as 
well as the treaty bodies, numerous recommendations have been made to the Government 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, yet very limited progress has been made in their 
implementation. Consequently, the Congolese people remain insecure in enjoying even 
their most fundamental human rights.  
</p>
<p> As an emerging &#8220;recommendation fatigue&#8221; can be observed, the approach of this 
report is not to make new recommendations to the Congolese authorities, but rather to 
recall conclusions and recommendations made in particular by the High Commissioner and 
seven thematic special procedures in their previous reports to the Council, as well as by 
other special procedures and treaty bodies.1 The report assesses the Government&#8217;s response

<p>to these recommendations during the period from March to November 2009 to identify 
setbacks and to determine the causes for the insufficient implementation of the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p> The Congolese Government must take a series of coherent, systematic and human 
rights-focused measures, with the assistance of relevant local, national and international 
stakeholders, to implement the recommendations that have been already made, in order to 
respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of its citizens. The High Commissioner will 
continue to support the Government and other partners in the country in their efforts 
towards promotion and protection of human rights in the country. It will do so mainly 
through the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office.2

<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10563 
</p>
<p><b> I. Main human rights developments 
</b></p>
<p>1. During the reporting period, the Congolese people have suffered from widespread 
human rights violations linked to armed conflicts, mainly in the eastern provinces, in 
addition to structural and politically motivated human rights violations committed 
throughout the country. Human rights activists and journalists continue to be the target of 
intimidation and threats throughout the country. Rape and sexual violence also remain a 
matter of serious concern. 
</p>
<p>2. In recent months, numerous human rights violations, including arbitrary executions; 
rapes; arbitrary arrests and detentions; torture; cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of 
civilians; forced labour; pillaging and illegal exploitation of natural resources, were 
committed by the Congolese National Armed Forces (FARDC) and the Congolese National 
Police (PNC). Of particular concern are the violations perpetrated by the FARDC within 
the scope of the Kimia II operation. For example, during an investigation mission in 
Nyabiondo, Masisi territory, in North Kivu Province, the United Nations Joint Human 
Rights Office (UNJHRO) was able to confirm that, between May and September 2009, the 
FARDC participating in the Kimia II operation killed at least 62 people, and that 8 others 
disappeared from several villages around Nyabiondo. Credible witness testimony indicates 
that the death toll could be much higher. Aside from these killings, cases of rape, 
widespread forced labour, extortion and arbitrary arrests by the FARDC were documented. 
Following the preliminary findings of this investigation, on 1 November 2009 the United 
Nations suspended its logistical and operational support to the Congolese army unit 
allegedly implicated in the killings.  
</p>
<p>3. Armed groups, such as the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) and 
the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA), operating in the eastern regions of the country, have 
perpetrated serious human rights violations against the local population during recent 
months, including mass killings, widespread rape, forced recruitment into armed groups, 
and looting. Ongoing violations, including executions of civilians,3 abductions of villagers 
and sexual violence, continue to be perpetrated by the LRA against the civilian population 
in the districts of Haut Uele and Bas Uele, Orientale Province.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Measures and response to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Arbitrary and/or illegal arrests and detentions 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Government should strictly limit the number of security forces and services 
with powers of arrest, detention and investigation, and ensure that the police force is the 
primary law enforcement agency. Furthermore, all arrested persons should be formally 
registered and brought before a judge; they should also be able to exercise their right to 
have the assistance of a lawyer of their choosing, to be examined by a doctor, and to contact 
their families or other persons of their choosing. In addition, UNJHRO should have 
unfettered access to all prisons and detention centres in accordance with the mandate of the 
United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) 
and with the presidential directive dated 5 July 2005. Finally, the State should thoroughly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 At least 1,250 victims were reportedly killed by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army from September 2008 to 
</p>
<p>September 2009. </p>


<p>GE.10-10563 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>investigate all alleged cases of arbitrary detention, prosecute the perpetrators and award full 
compensation to the victims.4 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. According to information received, the Government has not taken significant action 
to implement the above recommendations. At the time of writing, several branches of the 
executive power, security forces and judicial authorities persist in the arbitrary and illegal 
arrest and detention of individuals throughout the country. Individuals are also arrested for 
reasons that reach beyond criminal law. Human rights officers routinely find people 
detained for civil matters such as non-payment of debts and property disputes. UNJHRO 
has also observed a trend of PNC arrests of family members or close associates of alleged 
criminals when the perpetrator cannot be located, without any charges or evidence that the 
arrestee was involved. Agents of the State intelligence service (<i>Agence nationale de 
renseignement &#8211; ANR</i>), also frequently arrest people accused of common law offences that 
are in no way linked to State security matters. Lastly, members of security forces, including 
the ANR, have also been implicated in politically motivated human rights violations 
directed at political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.5 
6. After arrest, detainees are commonly denied the guarantees they are entitled to under 
Congolese law. In particular, detainees are generally not properly registered, and 
consequently record keeping is often incomplete or out of date. Detainees are commonly 
denied the right to appear before a judge within the 48-hour period required by the 
Constitution and this practice has led to the proliferation of<i> h&#233;berg&#233;s</i>, that is inmates who 
are detained without officially being charged. Additionally, very few cases are transferred 
to the offices of the Public or Military Prosecutor, and many detainees are released after 
paying fines that are not officially recorded.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>7. UNJHRO has taken tentative steps against arbitrary and/or illegal arrests and 
detentions to prompt the Government to provide the protection that detainees are entitled to 
under Congolese law and international human rights law. During the period under review, it 
visited numerous holding cells and prisons throughout the country, in several cases with 
national prosecutors, in order to verify the legality of detentions, and obtained the release of 
scores of people who had been illegally detained. After requests made by UNJHRO to 
judicial and police authorities that all detainees be notified of their rights and the charges 
pending against them, the Prosecutor General required all detaining officials to inform 
detainees of the charges against them. In practice, however, this requirement is seldom 
followed. Also, during the reporting period, UNJHRO organized several workshops and 
sensitization activities for the Congolese security forces to increase their respect for human 
rights. It should be recalled that UNJHRO and other human rights actors still do not have 
access to a number of detention facilities, such as the Tshatshi military camp, the 
headquarters of the military intelligence in Kinshasa and most ANR detention facilities 
throughout the country, despite instructions given to the relevant authorities by the 
President in July 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>8. Arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions are often part of a money-making 
scheme. These cases frequently do not reach the judiciary, but regularly lead to a bartered,

</p>
<p>monetary arrangement with the arresting officer who forces the victim or his family to pay 
a bribe to buy back his liberty from the police. Because of fear of retribution or re-arrest, 
only rarely do individuals subsequently lodge a complaint after they have been released. 
Apart from these cases, illegal detentions are also politically motivated. Both of these 
problems are exacerbated by the dysfunctional state of the criminal justice delivery system.6 
</p>
<p><b> B. Conditions in the penitentiary system, torture and ill-treatment in 
detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>9. Immediate steps should be taken to reduce overcrowding, to address appalling 
detention conditions and to improve security in all prisons. Additionally, legislation should 
be enacted to implement the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Effective measures should be taken to prevent any 
acts of torture or ill-treatment from occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Prompt, impartial and exhaustive investigations into alleged acts of torture and ill-treatment 
should be carried out, and the perpetrators convicted of such acts should be appropriately 
sentenced and ordered to compensate their victims. Moreover, the State should take 
effective measures to ensure that all persons reporting torture or ill-treatment are protected 
from threats or intimidation.7 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the period under review, the Government has made little progress towards 
developing a policy to make prisons more self-sufficient. The new Strategic Plan on Prison 
Reform being developed by the Ministry of Justice with the support of the MONUC Rule 
of Law Division is under discussion. The majority of prisons are characterized by 
crumbling facilities, starvation and sickness. These conditions amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment for the detainees, and fail to comply with basic international standards 
for the humane and dignified treatment of prisoners.8 Abysmal prison conditions lead to an 
extremely high death rate for those in detention. Forty-four persons reportedly died in 
detention at the <i>Centre p&#233;nitentiaire et de r&#233;-&#233;ducation de Kinshasa </i>(Penitentiary and Re-
education Centre of Kinshasa &#8211; CPRK), between January and August 2009, mainly due to a 
lack of food and medicine. 
</p>
<p>11. Overpopulation, resulting mainly from the abuse of pretrial detention, continues to 
be a major problem affecting prisons throughout the country. Convicts and pretrial 
detainees, as well as minors and adults, are often detained in the same areas. However, the 
authorities have taken some steps to reduce overpopulation. For instance, to alleviate 
overcrowding in the CPRK, the authorities released inmates who had served at least one 
quarter of their sentence and had been well-behaved. However, there are concerns that 
perpetrators of rape, sexual violence and other human rights violations also benefited from 
this decision. Given the protest registered against the releases granted to perpetrators of 
sexual violence, the Minister of Justice announced, in October 2009, that a bill is being 
prepared, the purpose of which is to exclude the perpetrators of sexual abuse from receiving 
a conditional release.

 Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>


<p>GE.10-10563 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>12. Due to lack of security, crumbling infrastructure, corruption and the slowness of 
judicial proceedings, pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners, including high-profile 
offenders, regularly escape. Between March and November 2009, 135 detainees escaped 
from the prison of Mahagi, Ituri District, Orientale Province. The frequency of escapes 
from Congolese prisons seriously undermines efforts to fight impunity. In some instances, 
actions were taken against officials accused of having facilitated escapes: the director of 
Mahagi prison was arrested on 3 July 2009, and the second in command of the Gwoknyeri 
police station (27 km from Mahagi) was arrested on 10 June 2009.  
13. The Parliament has not yet adopted a law criminalizing torture, and detainees in 
custody are still frequently subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment by the PNC, ANR and FARDC. Ill-treatment occurs at different stages 
of the detention process &#8212; upon arrest, during interrogation and in pretrial detention &#8212; and 
often results in the death of or serious injury to the detainee. On 16 June 2009, for instance, 
a detainee died in a prison cell in the <i>groupement</i> of Bena Mpiana, Ngandajika territory, 
Kasa&#239; Oriental Province, after he was arrested and beaten by PNC officers because he was 
&#8220;illegally&#8221; wearing &#8220;policeman&#8221; shoes. Only a few investigations into alleged acts of 
torture and ill-treatment and trials for such acts have been carried out during the period 
under review. No effective measures have been taken by the Government to ensure that all 
persons reporting torture or ill-treatment are protected from threats or intimidation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>14. During the period under review, UNJHRO continued to make frequent visits to 
prisons throughout the country, including joint visits with the Minister of Human Rights in 
some provinces, and documented crumbling cells, lack of food and medical care, 
corruption, and unqualified prison staff. In the case of food insecurity, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) intervenes when 30 per cent of those detained in a 
facility are suffering from malnutrition. As such it is providing sufficient food to overcome 
the malnutrition problem in eight locations. This has reduced the problem of deaths from 
malnutrition in detention. However, there is concern that ICRC assistance has lulled the 
Government, which had done very little, into doing even less. UNJHRO has continued to 
carry out its awareness-raising activities and to promote the adoption of a law criminalizing 
torture. In the context of the celebration of the International Day in Support of Victims of 
Torture on 26 June 2009, UNJRHO organized a number of activities. Furthermore, in 
partnership with <i>Avocats sans fronti&#232;res (ASF)</i>, UNJHRO facilitates the implementation of 
decisions by the United Nations Trust Fund for Victims of Torture. In October 2009, in 
cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and judicial authorities, UNJHRO organized a 
workshop on &#8220;the judiciary and the problem of torture and death in prison&#8221;. At this 
workshop, participants asked the <i>Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral de la R&#233;publique pr&#232;s la Cour supr&#234;me 
</i>(Prosecutor General of the Republic to the Supreme Court) to draft a directive for the 
prosecutors on the need &#8220;to effectively investigate cases of torture and death in custody&#8221;. 
This directive is currently being developed with the assistance of UNJHRO. UNJHRO has 
actively continued to advocate for making prisons more self-sufficient 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>15. Prison personnel are for the most part not systematically recruited, are not trained 
and are not being paid. Moreover, the Government does not provide adequate funding for 
prisons and detention facilities. There appears to be little desire within Government to 
address the prison situation and to begin the necessary reforms, because this would upset 
the network of corruption which has developed around the &#8220;privatization&#8221; of the 
penitentiary function. The creation of prison farms to guarantee a food supply and the 
provision of basic medicines to prevent disease outbreaks are necessary steps, but the 
&#8220;privatization&#8221; of the State function has impeded even these efforts. Regarding the </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10563 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention against Torture, the adoption of the necessary legislation 
has experienced delays, due mostly to the current legislative backlog. The lack of 
prosecutions by the authorities against perpetrators of torture is more evidence of the 
chronic impunity that still persists in the country. Years of governance that has been at best 
unresponsive and at worst threatening have created a cultural belief among Congolese 
victims of human rights violations by State officials that complaining is useless because it 
will be met with either inaction or retaliation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Sexual violence and impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>16. All provisions of Congolese law that discriminate against women should be 
abolished. Two important legislative steps should be a comprehensive reform of the Family 
Code and the adoption of a gender equality law implementing article 14 of the Constitution. 
With regard to sexual violence, State institutions should issue public and unequivocal 
denunciations of all forms of violence against women, including spousal abuse, marital rape 
and sexual harassment. These denunciations should not be tempered by invoking any 
custom, tradition or religious consideration to justify or excuse such violence. The 
Government should ensure that members of the State security forces know and comply with 
the law on sexual violence, and that the legal system brings the perpetrators to justice 
without delay or partiality. Furthermore, the Government should establish and promote an 
effective mechanism to receive complaints of sexual violence, including at custodial 
facilities, should investigate every complaint and provide victims with psychological and 
medical care. Finally, the State should pay damages to all victims of sexual violence 
committed by State agents and create a fund for this purpose in the national budget.9 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>17. The number of cases of sexual violence recorded by UNJHRO throughout the 
country remained alarmingly high during the period under review. These cases are not 
limited to areas of armed conflict but are happening throughout the country. Due to lack of 
security and lack of separation between inmates, female detainees are at particular risk of 
sexual violence. As an example, on the night of 20 to 21 June 2009, during an escape 
attempt at the Goma prison, 23 female inmates were raped by co-detainees. While most 
rapes are committed by members of armed groups and by the FARDC and the PNC, 
UNJHRO has documented a significant and growing number of civilian perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>18. Promising initiatives taken by the Government against sexual violence, such as the 
Laws on Sexual Violence which were adopted on 20 July 2006 and which introduced major 
improvements to the Congolese Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, have 
not produced the changes expected. If perpetrators of rape are tried and convicted, they 
rarely receive prison sentences as long as five years and the State has rarely paid damages, 
even though it has been regularly ordered to pay them. In June 2009, the <i>tribunal de grande 
instance</i> <i>de Mbuji Mayi</i> rendered decisions in 11 cases of rape, but only 1 prison sentence 
exceeded 5 years. The other sentences ranged from 3 to 24 months. Even when victims are 
awarded damages for abuses committed by State officials, the Government fails to pay the 
damages.  
</p>
<p>19. On 25 November 2009, the Government took a step forward by launching its 
National Strategy to Combat Gender-Based Violence, which will be implemented with the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
  See footnote 1. </p>


<p>GE.10-10563 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>support of the United Nations system in the country. The Government has developed a 
strategy aimed at preventing, remedying and mitigating the effects of sexual violence in 
conflict areas that incorporates the Comprehensive Strategy on Combating Sexual Violence 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ministry of Gender, Family and Children is 
also currently drafting legislation to reform the Family Code and to implement the gender 
equality provision of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>20. On 5 July 2009, the President declared a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy for human rights 
violators, particularly rapists, within the Congolese security forces. On 31 July 2009, for 
instance, the <i>Cour militaire du Kasa&#239; oriental</i>, upheld on appeal the sentence against an 
inspector at the military prosecutor&#8217;s office of Lodja, Sankuru District, Kasa&#239; Oriental 
Province, for the rape of a minor in December 2007. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison 
and to the payment of a fine of 100,000 Congolese francs. Despite some positive 
developments with regard to trials and convictions of low-ranking soldiers and police 
officers, impunity for sexual crimes remains chronic. The Congolese authorities have made 
very little progress in arresting and prosecuting FARDC elements who are suspects, in 
particular high-ranking commanders. During the Security Council visit to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in May 2009, a list of five high-ranking army officers accused of 
rape was handed over to high-level authorities, including the President. Despite such high-
level advocacy, little progress has been made six months down the line. While two of the 
five are being detained, no charges have been brought against any of them.  
</p>
<p>21. Members of non-integrated armed groups also continue to commit rape. On 3 June 
2009, five Ma&#239; Ma&#239; militia men who raped 135 women in July 2007 in Lieke Lesole, Opala 
territory, Oriental Province, were convicted by the military tribunal of Kisangani for crimes 
against humanity, including violent rape, and were sentenced to between 30 years and life 
in prison. The convicted militiamen were also found jointly liable with the State for US$ 
2,500 in damages for each victim of violence and US$ 10,000 in damages for each victim 
of rape. The Lieke Lesole judgement is a milestone for damages awarded to victims, but 
unfortunately no damages have yet been paid.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>22. UNJHRO continued its empowerment and capacity-building activities in the fight 
against sexual violence. Within the framework of the national plan on sexual violence, 
UNJHRO is responsible for coordinating this component in the fight against impunity. This 
programme aims at decreasing impunity for sexual violence by providing legal assistance to 
victims through legal aid clinics in several provinces. Complementing this programme, 
UNJHRO provides support in terms of mission allowances for military prosecutors in order 
to facilitate investigations; it transports justice personnel, victims and their legal advisers to 
Court; and it documents and intervenes to improve the situation. It has also held training 
sessions with State and non-State actors. In addition, it has closely monitored and reported 
on cases of sexual violence to ensure that those responsible, particularly those in the 
security forces, are prosecuted and has offered its support to the military prosecutor for the 
investigation needed to bring high-ranking army officers to justice. Recently it has 
developed a nationwide programme on access to justice for victims of sexual violence with 
the support of various donors. A pilot initiative to advocate for the rights of victims of 
sexual violence, including through an assessment of the existing mechanisms for remedies 
and reparations for such victims, is also being developed.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>23. Impunity for the perpetrators of crimes of sexual violence is chronic. High-ranking 
officials are rarely prosecuted, and, even when there are prosecutions, the justice sector is 
so severely under-resourced and understaffed that judicial proceedings are slow. Often </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10563 
</p>
<p>high-ranking officials &#8212; and in fact all those accused who have money &#8212; simply pay their 
way out. Furthermore, alleged perpetrators regularly &#8220;escape&#8221; from prison. Other factors 
hinder improvement in the plight of victims, such as the influence of local customs and the 
victim&#8217;s fear of rejection by their family and community. The gender-specific root causes 
of sexual violence, namely the subordinate social, economic and political position of 
women in Congolese society is not effectively addressed by the State. Victims also face 
enormous difficulties in accessing justice because of expensive judicial fees, amicable 
settlements, pressure and threats against them, and ignorance of the law among the police in 
rural areas. All of these impediments contribute to the climate of impunity for crimes 
against women.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Violation of economic and social rights and illegal exploitation of 
natural resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>24. In the domain of economic and social rights, comprehensive measures that 
adequately address the illicit exploitation of natural resources in the country should be 
taken. The Government should increase transparency in the collection of State resources, in 
particular by mapping revenues received from actors exploiting mineral-rich areas in 
compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and by allocating 
revenue in compliance with the duty of the State to maximize the use of its resources for the 
progressive realization of human rights. This latter obligation requires the Government to 
use revenue to guarantee free access to primary education for all children, to provide access 
to affordable basic health care, and to ensure that health centres and hospitals have adequate 
human, medical and financial resources. At its forty-third session in November 2009, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considered the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and recalled, inter alia, the need for the State party to promote good 
governance and to combat corruption as well as to take all appropriate measures to ensure 
that its natural resources are not subjected to illegal exploitation and mismanagement.10 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>25. Central and local authorities do not ensure the enjoyment of economic and social 
rights and the efforts made so far to improve the situation are insufficient. The lack of 
adequate collection and allocation of resources by the Government continues to cause 
structural human rights abuses and corruption across the country, as unpaid or underpaid 
officials extort money from the population in the course of their duties. Although the 
Government professes adherence to the EITI, transparency remains elusive in practice. 
Private companies and public institutions rarely disclose profits, and authorities have failed 
to hold State and non-State actors accountable for their role in the illegal exploitation of 
Congolese natural resources. The unregulated natural resource economy has been also the 
primary recruiter and exploiter of labour in the country. Employees of social services that 
are supposed to protect labour rights, such as labour inspectors, often sacrifice the rights of 
workers in order to collect money to survive. Also, massive firings have been executed by 
private companies in total disregard of the rules and procedures.  
</p>
<p>26. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an often cited example of the so-called 
&#8220;paradox of plenty&#8221;. While the country is extremely rich in natural resources (e.g. 80 per 
cent of worldwide resources of coltan, 10 per cent of worldwide resources of copper), the 
population suffers from extreme poverty (80 per cent of the Congolese population live on

<p>less than 20 US cents a day).11 In the provinces where the rich mineral resources are 
extracted, security problems and human rights violations linked to resource extraction have 
continued to be reported. Clashes between rebel groups and government forces to gain 
control over mining sites frequently occur. In August 2009, FDLR and Mai Mai Shikito 
attacked a mine under the protection of government forces in Omata, Walikale territory, 
North Kivu Province, resulting in looting and the death and injury of several civilians. 
Moreover, government security forces and irregular armed forces continue to commit acts 
of sexual violence and to subject artisanal miners and other civilians living in the area to 
forced labour, illegal taxation and extortion.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to the right to education, despite the fact that article 43 of the 
Constitution requires free public and compulsory primary education, parents are expected 
to contribute to teachers&#8217; salaries due to lack of sufficient government funding. Access to 
food and health care is also far from meeting minimal standards. The State health-care 
system is barely functional, and the Government is unable to react to treatable illnesses that 
plague the population. Due to the existence of user fees, the health-care system is not 
accessible to the poorest in society. As a result, maternal and infant mortality rates are 
among the highest in the world. In the east of the country, the widespread looting of health 
clinics and the arbitrary obstruction of humanitarian convoys intended to replenish medical 
supplies have aggravated the situation; moreover, a rapid increase in medical capacity is 
required as many Congolese medical workers have been forced to flee. High rates of 
malnutrition among women, children and internally displaced persons, have made them 
even more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Of particularly grave concern is the plight of 
displaced persons because of the magnitude of the problem. These people, having lost their 
homes, live in absolute poverty without access to sufficient food, drinking water, health 
care or education for their children. 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>28. UNJHRO is increasingly focusing on the link between the illegal exploitation of 
natural resources and the paucity of government revenue allocated to the realization of 
economic and social rights. It is advocating for the Government to increase its efforts to 
ensure the enjoyment of economic and social rights by its citizens. In addition, UNJHRO 
carries out investigative missions to increase its understanding of the challenges to 
regulation and policy relating to the exploitation of natural resources. It also monitors and 
assesses the progress made in relation to social and economic rights throughout the country. 
UNJHRO is undertaking efforts to increase stakeholder knowledge of article 2 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which could be used as a 
tool to combat the illegal exploitation of natural resources, with the goal of progressively 
realizing all human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>29. Many of the government ministries with responsibilities relating to supervision of 
and revenue collection from the natural resources sector are understaffed, underfunded, and 
lack the technical capacity to perform their functions. This in turn leads to corruption. The 
Government collects far less in taxes and fees than it should from the mining sector due to 
corrupt practices at every level. For those actors, impunity prevails because most of the 
abuses occur with the consent or under orders of superior officers. These officers interfere 
in the legal apparatus to block the investigation and prosecution of cases of illegal 
exploitation, corruption and other crimes relating to the natural resources sector.

</p>
<p><b> E. Situation of journalists, human rights defenders, victims and witnesses 
  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>30. State institutions should encourage public dialogue and scrutiny to sustain and 
advance the democratic process. The State should respect its international obligations 
related to freedom of expression and of the press and take all necessary measures to protect 
victims, witnesses, human rights defenders and members of the media who are increasingly 
being threatened with arrest or even death. During her visit in May 2009, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders recalled these recommendations and 
made some additional specific recommendations, such as the adoption of national and 
provincial laws on the protection of human rights defenders. The Government should also 
respect the regime of notification governing the right to peaceable assembly. Finally, the 
Government should grant legal personality to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that 
comply with the administrative requirements.12 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>31. There is still no law for the protection of human rights defenders, journalists, victims 
and witnesses. Moreover, the degree of importance accorded to the need to protect these 
individuals by the Congolese authorities remains insubstantial and non-institutionalized. 
Part of the problem is the lack of understanding by all authorities of the crucial role of 
human rights defenders in a democratic system. At the end of her visit to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in May 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders underlined that the absence of a legal framework contributes to the 
precarious situation of human rights defenders in the country. No measurable progress has 
been made since then. 
</p>
<p>32. During the reporting period, journalists and human rights defenders were singled out 
by national security forces, armed groups and public authorities and encountered unlawful 
restrictions on the exercise of their rights to freedom of opinion and expression. On 26 July 
2009, the Government temporarily shut down Radio France Internationale (RFI) 
broadcasts, on the grounds that the radio station was destabilizing the country by 
broadcasting &#8220;untrue and unverified&#8221; information. At the end of July 2009, the Minister of 
Communication labelled three international human rights NGOs, namely Human Rights 
Watch, Global Witness and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) as 
&#8220;humanitarian terrorists&#8221;, accusing them of being driven by a desire to destabilize the 
country, after they released critical reports on the human rights situation. On 22 August 
2009, a journalist at Star, a private local radio station owned by an opposition member of 
parliament, was stabbed to death in the area of Kasali, Kadutu Commune, Bukavu town, 
South Kivu Province. This was the third killing of a journalist in Bukavu since 2007 and it 
has had a chilling impact on other journalists, even if the three dead journalists appear to 
have been victims of common crimes. 
</p>
<p>33. An emblematic case demonstrating the limited space for democratic debate and the 
hostility from the Government towards free expression is the arrest of Golden Misabiko, the 
President of the NGO ASADHO/Katanga, on 24 July 2009 following the public release of a 
report on the illegal exploitation of uranium in the Shinkolobwe mine. On 21 September 
2009, the <i>tribunal de paix de Lubumbashi-Kamalondo</i> sentenced him to 12 months of 
imprisonment with 8 months suspended. He was found guilty of &#8220;inciting the population&#8221; 
under article 199 of the Criminal Code. No evidence was presented at the hearing to 
support the charge, yet Mr. Misabiko was still convicted. On 1 October 2009, the President

<p>of <i>Les amis de Nelson Mandela pour la d&#233;fense des droits humains (AMDH)</i>, who had been 
in detention for having denounced what he considered slave-like working conditions in a 
company in Bas-Congo Province, was provisionally released after close to two months in 
detention. These cases illustrate that the judiciary is being used as a tool to intimidate those 
whom the Government perceives as opponents. 
</p>
<p>34. Activists and journalists face arbitrary arrests, intimidation, ill-treatment and death 
threats on a daily basis. During the night of 27 to 28 July 2009, in the town of Kanshi, in 
Mbuji Mayi, a group of five armed individuals, wearing FARDC uniforms, reportedly 
broke into the premises of a local NGO, <i>Centre d&#8217;&#233;tude et de formation populaire pour les 
droits de l&#8217;homme </i>(CEFOP/DH), and ordered the guard to provide them with the address of 
the head of the organization. The guard refused to cooperate and was reportedly tortured. 
On 18 August 2009, three human rights activists were arrested at Mpemba, Katanga 
Province. They were allegedly subjected to ill-treatment by two ANR agents and one PNC 
officer. A similar pattern of repression exists for victims and witnesses.  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>35. As Congolese authorities have been slow to act to increase protection of human 
rights defenders, both responsive and proactive measures have been taken by other 
stakeholders. UNJHRO pays special attention to allegations of human rights violations 
against human rights activists, journalists, victims and witnesses as they are often the target 
of repression by public authorities for speaking out against government policy or the 
problematic realities in the country. Besides intervening in these cases, UNJHRO also takes 
measures to prevent them. Through a project funded by the European Commission, 
UNJHRO has established a national network of human rights NGOs specialized in the field 
of protection and provided capacity-building to them in nine provinces. Moreover, NGOs 
have organized themselves in provincial protection networks. In cooperation with 
UNJHRO, these networks have taken many protective measures for persons who are 
threatened by relocating them and providing them with medical, psychosocial, socio-
economic and legal assistance thanks to a protection trust funded with the support of 
Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>36. High-ranking government officials sustain a climate of intimidation and repress 
opposition views rather than encouraging public dialogue and scrutiny of governance. 
Police, military, judicial and especially political authorities have not always valued the 
nature and legitimacy of the work done by human rights defenders and journalists. They 
claim to lack the means to carry out their own protection functions. Moreover, victims and 
witnesses are often reluctant to testify because they fear acts of retaliation for speaking out 
or bringing a claim, as they have a right to do. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Administration of justice and impunity 
  Existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>37. The existing recommendations in the area of administration of justice and the fight 
against impunity call for strengthening the justice system and law enforcement. The 
Congolese parliament should bring existing legislation into conformity with international 
standards and give priority to the adoption of fundamental laws for the reform of the justice 
system. It should enact legislation establishing the constitutional court and a credible, 
independent national human rights commission. The legislative body should also pass the 
implementing legislation for the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In 
addition, Congolese State institutions should enable the judiciary to fulfil its constitutional </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10563 
</p>
<p>role in full independence, by improving working conditions of justice officials, and by 
strengthening the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. Finally, the Government should take 
the necessary steps to ensure that the military courts are used solely for the purpose of 
trying military personnel for military offences in accordance with the relevant provisions of 
international law.13  
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>38. At the time of writing this report, the parliament had not yet adopted the laws crucial 
to reforming the judicial system, notably legislation creating the <i>Cour constitutionnelle 
</i>(Constitutional Court), the <i>Cour de cassation</i> (Court of Cassation) and the <i>Conseil d&#8217;&#233;tat 
</i>(State Council). The independent national human rights commission has not been 
established, and, while the national implementation legislation for the Rome Statute has 
been considered on several occasions, it has not yet been passed. Such a law would be 
instrumental in rendering the Rome Statute effective in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and would contribute to setting coherent criminal justice norms in the area of war 
crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In addition, the Liaison Entity, that brings 
all relevant government entities together to address human rights violations, has been 
established but is not functional yet.  
</p>
<p>39. On 15 July 2009, as part of an anti-corruption drive, the President signed several 
orders dismissing 86 magistrates, retiring 2 magistrates and appointing 605 new 
magistrates. They were a disciplinary measure in accordance with article 2 of the Law on 
the Organization and Functioning of the Superior Council of the Judiciary (<i>Conseil 
sup&#233;rieur de la magistrature &#8211; </i>CSM). These orders violate the law on the functioning and 
organization of the CSM as they were issued without a hearing for the magistrates 
concerned in violation of the magistrates&#8217; statute and due process principles. In addition, 
while the &#8220;privatization&#8221; of the judicial function &#8212; where judiciary officials use their 
position to extort money instead of fulfilling their constitutional mandate &#8212; is endemic, as 
is the interference by political and military authorities in the administration of justice. The 
action of 15 July did not address these problems directly; instead, it created concerns of 
arbitrary action and generated accusations of patronage. For example, at least three 
magistrates who had either disciplinary measures or criminal sentences held against them 
were promoted, whereas a number of magistrates were dismissed on the same grounds. The 
ordinances have also thrown some tribunals into dysfunction as magistrates have been 
removed and, in some cases, not replaced after several months.  
</p>
<p>40. Due to lack of resources and staff, the judiciary is still unable to fulfil its 
constitutional role. For instance, in August 2009, the commanding authorities of the Kimia 
II operation handed over 10 members of the FARDC to the Superior Military Prosecutor of 
South Kivu, but the prosecutors in the province did not have sufficient staff to handle the 
cases. Also in Ituri, Orientale Province, the administration of justice has been slow because 
of the low number of magistrates. In Bandundu Province, the <i>tribunal militaire de garnison</i> 
(military tribunal) of Bandundu did not hold a hearing for approximately five months 
because the sole judge in Bandundu only returned from vacation in September 2009. One 
important response to these structural problems is the growing presence of mobile courts. 
However, these are very costly and draw badly needed resources from other parts of the 
judicial system. Another solution is to modify the legal competence to allow the <i>tribunaux 
de paix</i> to hear cases related to human rights violations in all territories.

 See footnote 1. </p>


<p>GE.10-10563 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  
</b>41. During the period under review, UNJHRO continued to support the justice system to 
increase the judicial response to human rights violations. It provided technical assistance to 
draft various laws, as well as to complete judicial reform through the establishment of high 
courts and the CSM. Several training courses for judicial personnel and members of civil 
society were also conducted by UNJHRO on, for example, the independence of the 
judiciary and on the ethics and professional conduct of a magistrate. UNJHRO also gave its 
technical support to the CSM for the development of a code of professional ethics for 
magistrates. In an attempt to reinforce the fight against impunity, UNJHRO is supporting 
the establishment of a working group on impunity led by the Minister of Justice during the 
justice reform process. This group will function as a technical unit of the Joint Committee 
for Justice Reform and will feed in ideas and facilitate needed changes. Throughout the 
country, UNJHRO also works daily with judicial officials. Support runs from sharing 
information to facilitating transport to allow for investigations needed, to building 
rehabilitation. As part of its efforts to assist in the fight against impunity, OHCHR also 
conducted a mapping exercise of the most serious violations of human rights and 
international law, committed within the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
between March 1993 and June 2003. The deployment phase took place between October 
2008 and May 2009. It will be the first and only comprehensive United Nations report 
documenting major human rights violations in the country covering this period, with the 
aim of contributing to a reversal of the trend of endless cycles of impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>42. The justice sector remains dysfunctional and many of the human rights violations 
identified in this report are left unresolved and festering because of an inadequate judicial 
response. Several major problems underlie the limited progress in the administration of 
justice. The administration of justice is severely harmed by inadequate funding: the portion 
of the budget allocated to the justice system has decreased to 0.24 per cent of the 2009 
national budget (compared to 0.6 per cent of the 2006 budget). The extremely low salaries 
and high job insecurity among magistrates make them vulnerable to pressure by political or 
military authorities and fosters corruption. Other issues that have to be addressed are the 
lack of access to justice for the majority of the population and the non-enforcement of court 
decisions. Inadequate offices and housing inhibit magistrates from working in the interior.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Fight against impunity with regard to the violations committed by 
Congolese security forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Congolese Government should firmly implement a zero tolerance policy for all 
human rights violations. This requires that judiciary authorities carry out thorough 
investigations and prosecute all members of the security forces accused of having 
committed serious human rights violations. Moreover, it requires that military commanders 
impose rigid rules of discipline. The Government should also establish a comprehensive 
vetting mechanism to take into account candidates&#8217; past actions in terms of respect for 
international humanitarian law and human rights when they apply for official positions, 
with particular attention being paid to key posts in the armed forces, national police and 
other security services. Furthermore, to respond to human rights violations perpetrated by 
the FARDC in the context of military operations in North and South Kivu and Oriental 
Province, the Government should take appropriate action to remove army officers or units </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10563 
</p>
<p>involved in serious human rights violations and to bring them to justice.14 The Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions visited the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in October 2009. After his visit, he made six recommendations for 
tackling impunity in the country, including on the reform of the penitentiary system and the 
removal of key members of the military who are alleged to have committed war crimes, 
crimes against humanity, or other serious offences. 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the Government and the current situation 
</b></p>
<p>44. Due to the nature of the successive political agreements, State security forces have 
integrated within their ranks major perpetrators of human rights violations, who in a 
number of cases have continued to prey on the civilian population and to commit human 
rights violations. In the eastern regions of the country in particular, a number of FARDC 
battalions &#8212; notably in the context of the Kimia II operations &#8212; have perpetrated attacks 
and committed human rights violations, accusing civilians of collaborating with rebel 
groups.  
</p>
<p>45. National authorities have taken some small steps to implement the Government&#8217;s 
zero tolerance policy against the FARDC elements implicated in human rights violations. 
Some soldiers were removed from active service and there have been convictions of rank 
and file soldiers for human rights related crimes, but progress has been limited. In July 
2009, for example, the <i>cour militaire op&#233;rationnelle</i> (ad hoc military court) of North Kivu 
sitting in Rutshuru heard nine different cases. On 27 July 2009, the court sentenced a 
Colonel Kipanga in absentia to life imprisonment and a Major Lusungu to 10 years&#8217; 
imprisonment, on account of crimes against humanity. Colonel Kipanga escaped from 
detention and later rejoined the FARDC despite the conviction against him. The Court also 
ordered the two officers to pay, jointly with the Government, damages to the victims of 
rape. On 11 September 2009, the <i>tribunal militaire de garnison</i> of Bunia, Oriental 
Province, sentenced an FARDC soldier of the 132nd battalion to life imprisonment for rape 
and murder. He was also expelled from the FARDC.  
</p>
<p>46. Despite repeated requests by the Security Council, no tangible steps have been taken 
by the Government to start a vetting process which could examine current and future 
security forces on their respect for international humanitarian and human rights law and 
remove them from active service if appropriate. On the contrary, known perpetrators of 
human rights violations, including some who have been named in several United Nations 
public reports have been integrated into the FARDC, the police or intelligence services. 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b>47. During the reporting period, UNJHRO provided information to Congolese military 
justice officials, the Defence Ministry, and the hierarchy of the PNC and FARDC on the 
human rights violations perpetrated by members of the PNC and FARDC throughout the 
country. UNJHRO also provided logistical and substantive support for joint investigation 
missions to Congolese civilian and military justice officials throughout the country. To 
increase the number of prosecutions, MONUC decided to support joint investigation teams 
through quick impact projects (QUIPS). UNJHRO also plays an important role in the rapid 
response early warning cell within MONUC aimed at identifying and holding accountable 
commanders of military units who have consistently violated human rights since the 
commencement of the Kimia II operation in the eastern part of the country. Furthermore, 
several training seminars and workshops on human rights for the FARDC and members of 
other security forces were organized.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 See footnote 1. </p>


<p>GE.10-10563 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Congolese Government provides the State security forces with insufficient 
logistical and financial resources. FARDC violations have many structural causes. Security 
forces are not sufficiently or regularly paid and do not have adequate supplies. They are 
neither garrisoned, nor trained, nor do they have weapons storage facilities. In South Kivu 
Province, FARDC soldiers, participating in the Kimia II Operation, organized a series of 
protests in August 2009, demanding their unpaid salaries. On 27 August 2009, in Lubarika 
(66 km North of Uvira, South Kivu), soldiers of the 332nd battalion fired their weapons 
into the air demanding payment of their salaries. They looted homes and erected road 
blocks, beating up people who refused to pay or who did not have the means to pay. It is 
essential for the Government to address the root causes of this issue by paying the military 
on time. It must also provide logistical support to transport military equipment and provide 
enough food rations so that the FARDC ends its forced labour practices and ceases to loot 
villages. The army is very heterogeneous and overall ill-disciplined. It is now comprised of 
55 rebel and militia groups without any vetting or training. It has become a perpetrator of 
violations because it lacks the command and control structures and accountability 
mechanisms needed to prevent abuses from within its ranks.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b>49. <b>Several obstacles to implementation of the existing recommendations have been 
identified. They are intertwined with each other and hinder the improvement of the 
overall human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Poor 
governance, absence of the rule of law and lack of political will have created a 
troubling human rights record and continue to impede development and the 
elimination of poverty. All public sectors are under-resourced, and the Government 
fails to ensure basic economic and social rights, such as health care and education. A 
dysfunctional and understaffed justice system contributes to a climate of impunity for 
human rights violations and undermines the security of Congolese citizens. In 
addition, the insufficient allocation of funding to civil servants, the penitentiary 
system and State security forces feeds systemic corruption and fosters the 
&#8220;privatization&#8221; of State functions. These challenges should be effectively addressed. 
The Government must undertake a series of coherent, systematic and human rights-
focused measures with the assistance of all relevant local, national and international 
stakeholders to implement the recommendations that have already been made, in 
order to protect the human rights of its citizens.

<p><b> IV. Recommendations to the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo 
</b>50. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Government to fully implement the 
recommendations previously made by human rights mechanisms, including the seven 
thematic special procedures, as well as other special procedures and treaty bodies, as 
assessed in this report.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations to the Human Rights Council 
</b>51. <b>In light of the multiple human rights challenges in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo and the very limited progress made to implement previous 
recommendations made by different parts of the United Nations human rights system, </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10563

<p><b>the Human Rights Council should at its next session fix priorities to be monitored 
against fixed measurable benchmarks in regard to the recommendations relevant to 
the seven thematic areas (chapter II, sections A to G) outlined above in this report, in 
order to evaluate progress made by the Congolese Government. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Council should continue to be seized of the human rights situation in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and ensure that the situation is continuously 
monitored, including by calling on the Government to issue a standing invitation to 
the special procedures of the Council and to facilitate visits by relevant special 
rapporteurs. The High Commissioner also stands ready to continue reporting to the 
Council on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 
an annual basis.
