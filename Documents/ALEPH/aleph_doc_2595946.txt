Commenting on the results, Eduardo Hochschild, Chairman said:
"Our long term investment strategy has now started to deliver strong results with an impressive operational performance combined with more
positive precious metal prices which has in turn led to our re-entry into the FTSE 250. The Company has returned to profitability, materially
reduced its debt position and is investing primarily in brownfield growth. In this constructive environment, the Board has decided to pay a
dividend of 1.38 US cents per share, representing approximately 25% of net earnings, which we believe is an appropriate payout at this early
stage of the cycle."

About Hochschild Mining plc:
Hochschild Mining plc is a leading precious metals company listed on the London Stock Exchange (HOCM.L / HOC LN) with a primary focus
on the exploration, mining, processing and sale of silver and gold. Hochschild has over fifty years' experience in the mining of precious metal
epithermal vein deposits and currently operates four underground epithermal vein mines, three located in southern Peru and one in southern
Argentina. Hochschild also has numerous long-term projects throughout the Americas.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT
A year ago, as Inmaculada began its ramp-up process, we envisioned a more positive future for the Company with the prospect of a steady
state contribution from this new low cost flagship mine. Today we can report that the Company has delivered better than expected operational
results and Hochschild is now successfully delivering on the organic investment strategy that has been implemented over the last few years.
The combination of a strong production performance, an intense focus on cost control and an encouraging precious metal price environment
has been a powerful driver for the Company's return to profitability. We are confident that the foundations are in place to continue delivering
robust results and that this momentum can be maintained.
H1 operational performance
Hochschild's mines delivered a very good first half with both Inmaculada and Arcata performing above expectations. The Company, as a whole,
produced 118 thousand ounces of gold and 8.2 million ounces of silver which, when converted to the silver equivalent number of 17 million
ounces, confirms that the run rate is ahead of the original full year target of 32 million ounces. Inmaculada was the key driver with grade and
recoveries running ahead of plan and the plant consistently outperforming its design capacity. This led to production of 111 thousand gold
equivalent ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of around $600 per ounce which places the mine in the bottom decile of the industry cost curve. In
addition, Arcata enjoyed its finest half for over five years with production improving by 15% versus the same period of 2015. San Jose in
Argentina has continued to deliver remarkably consistent output in an improved domestic economic environment. With the Company's overall
cost position substantially lowered, all operations generated strong cashflow and we can look forward to a further boost at Pallancata when the
transition to feed from the new Pablo vein is completed.
Financial position
The Company's strategy of de-risking the balance sheet has continued in 2016 with a further $70 million of medium and short term debt repaid
to date following on from the $105 million executed in 2015. These ongoing measures have been facilitated by the Company's strong free
cashflow generation resulting from the operational performance mentioned above. The cash balance at the half year remained above $100
million despite the debt repayments whilst capital expenditure was in line across all operations. Our net debt position has now been reduced by
almost 40% in the last twelve months and we are confident that the maturity of our remaining long term debt is adequately profiled. The ratio of
net debt to annual adjusted EBITDA currently stands at approximately 1.0x. The precious metal hedge positions carried out to protect the
balance sheet and ensure ongoing debt repayment have amounted to a $3.1 million negative impact in the first half and there are currently no
plans to hedge 2017 production.
Growth
A key aspect of Hochschild's growth strategy going forward is our brownfield exploration programme with our team of in-house geologists firmly
believing in the potential for resource gains both in terms of quality and quantity at all our deposits.  The obvious example has been the
discovery and incorporation of the Pablo vein into the long term mine plan at Pallancata. In this regard, good developmental progress was
made in the first half and remaining work is on schedule whilst initial underground geological assessment of the Pablo structure indicates the
potential for further upside from surrounding veins. Furthermore, the overall improved financial position of the Company has facilitated a new
five year brownfield exploration programme in both Peru and Argentina. The Company also currently has over 3,000 tonnes per day of spare
plant capacity at our Selene, Arcata and Ares plants in Peru so there is an exciting opportunity to generate significant value for the Company
even before the longer term expansion options at Inmaculada, for example, are assessed.
H1 financial performance
The 63% half-on-half increase in total production led to revenue rising by 78% versus the first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 333% to
$170 million principally driven by the addition of substantially higher margin production from Inmaculada as well as an increased contribution
from our other operations.  As we have predicted, the strong cashflows from Inmaculada have offset the finance costs arising from our bond
issue in January 2014 to fund its construction and this has helped the Company to record a very healthy pre-exceptional earnings per share of
$0.05 which is a material improvement on the loss of $0.09 recorded in the first half of 2015.
Outlook
The Company's production target for the year has increased by over 6% to 34.0 million silver equivalent ounces following the good
performances at Inmaculada and Arcata in the first half. All-in sustaining cost expectations for the Company have also been revised following a
strong first half and are now expected to be between $11.0 and $11.5 per silver equivalent ounce which compares very favourably to our
original guidance of between $12.0 and $12.5.
The recent market environment for precious metals has been far more positive than any time in the last three years but the Company remains
fully prepared for any further volatility arising from macroeconomic or political events. We are confident that our strategy of ongoing cost
reduction, investment in our brownfield exploration programme and strict balance sheet management will continue to deliver shareholder value
throughout the remainder of the year and for the foreseeable future.
Ignacio Bustamante, Chief Executive Officer

OPERATING REVIEW
OPERATIONS
Note: silver/gold equivalent production figures assume an average gold/silver ratio of 74:1.
Production
In the first half of 2016, the Company delivered attributable production of 229.1 thousand gold equivalent ounces or 17.0 million silver
equivalent ounces, including 8.2 million ounces of silver and 118.1 thousand ounces of gold. The overall attributable production target for 2016
has been revised from 32.0 million silver equivalent ounces to 34.0 million ounces. This is expected to consist of approximately 16 million
ounces from Inmaculada, approximately 7 million attributable ounces from the 51% owned San Jose and the balance from the remaining two
Peruvian operations.

Costs
The Company's all-in sustaining cost from operations in H1 2016 was reduced by 27% to $10.9 per silver equivalent ounce mainly driven by the
impact of Inmaculada with a very competitive $8.2 per silver equivalent ounce.6 The reduction versus H1 2015 is due to better than expected
grades, higher silver recoveries and operational efficiency initiatives. Please see pages 8-10 of the Financial Review for further details on costs.
The all-in sustaining cost per silver equivalent ounce forecast for 2016 has been revised downwards to be between $11.0 and $11.5 with
Inmaculada costs expected to be between $8 and $9 per ounce.
Inmaculada (Peru)
The 100% owned Inmaculada underground operation is located in the Department of Ayacucho in southern Peru. It commenced commissioning
in June 2015.

Production
Inmaculada delivered a strong half with grades and silver recoveries better than expected in the original mine plan and, combined with higher
tonnage per day being processed through the plant, H1 2016 production was able to reach 111 thousand gold equivalent ounces (8.2 million
silver equivalent ounces).
Costs
The all-in sustaining costs were lower than forecast at $8.2 per silver equivalent ounce. This was driven by higher than expected production as
well as operational efficiencies versus the original plan. Overall all-in sustaining costs for 2016 are expected to be between $8 and $9 in 2016.
Arcata (Peru)
The 100% owned Arcata underground operation is located in the Department of Arequipa in southern Peru. It commenced production in 1964.

Production
At Arcata, production was a very solid 3.7 million silver equivalent ounces, a 15% improvement on the same period of 2015 (H1 2015: 3.3
million ounces). This was driven by better than expected mined tonnage resulting from the success of the Company's 2015 brownfield
exploration programme in addition to higher silver recoveries.
Costs
In H1 2016, all-in sustaining costs fell by 4% to $13.0 per silver equivalent ounce (H1 2015: $13.5 per ounce) - substantially below the forecast
of $14.5 per ounce (as well as the overall 2015 result of $14.3 per ounce) due to the increased tonnage mentioned above as well rising gold
grades and operational efficiencies.
Brownfield exploration
At Arcata, 2,135 metres were drilled in the first half to test North-South structures in the central area of the mine. The plan for the remainder of
the year is to drill in the Tunel 4 zone to extend existing structures and identify new ones. Some highlights are presented below:

Production
At Pallancata, as expected, tonnage through the plant in the first half was lower than the average 2015 rate with operations in a transitionary
period before the introduction of feed from the new Pablo vein. Production in H1 2016 was 1.3 million ounces of silver and 6,370 ounces of gold
bringing the silver equivalent total to 1.7 million ounces (H1 2015: 2.6 million).
Costs
All-in sustaining costs at Pallancata in the first half were at $15.9 per silver equivalent ounce (H1 2015: $15.5 per ounce) with the moderate
increase versus the same period of 2015 due to the aforementioned significant fall in tonnage affecting cost per tonne. This was partially offset
by increased grades and operational efficiencies. The all-in sustaining cost at the operation excluding capital expenditure on the Pablo
development was $13.5 per silver equivalent ounce. Costs are expected to fall substantially when the Pablo vein begins production.
Brownfield exploration
At Pallancata, a drilling campaign has begun to the north and south of the Pablo structure to test anomalies and add potential resources
(parallel to Pablo). So far, 698 metres have been drilled.
San Jose (Argentina)
The San Jose silver/gold mine is located in Argentina, in the province of Santa Cruz, 1,750 kilometres south-southwest of Buenos Aires. San
Jose commenced production in 2007 and is a joint venture with McEwen Mining Inc. Hochschild holds a controlling interest of 51% in the mine
and is the mine operator.

*The Company has a 51% interest in San Jose
Production
The San Jose operation delivered yet another solid half with production of 3.1 million ounces of silver and 43,490 ounces of gold resulting in
silver equivalent production of 6.4 million ounces, a 5% improvement on H1 2015 (6.1 million ounces) mostly due to better than planned grades
and higher than expected tonnage.
Costs
At San Jose, all-in sustaining costs were reduced by 24% versus H1 2015 to $11.7 per silver equivalent ounce mainly driven by the significant
fiscal changes in Argentina in the first half. These included the elimination of export taxes and the restoration of the Patagonian port rebate.
Brownfield exploration
At San Jose 1,240 metres has been drilled mainly in the Aguas Vivas area with the programme ongoing.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The reporting currency of Hochschild Mining plc is U.S. dollars. In discussions of financial performance the Group removes the effect of
exceptional items, unless otherwise indicated, and in the income statement results are shown both pre and post such exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those items, which due to their nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, need to be disclosed
separately on the face of the income statement to enable a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group and to facilitate
comparison with prior years.
Revenue
Gross revenue
Gross revenue from continuing operations rose by 74% to $353.3 million in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $202.5 million) primarily driven by the
substantial increase in production at Inmaculada.
Silver
Gross revenue from silver increased 32% in H1 2016 to $172.7 million (H1 2015: $131.3 million) as a result of a 30% increase in the total
amount of silver ounces sold to 10,085 koz  (H1 2015: 7,785 koz) driven by the increase from new production at Inmaculada as well as half-on-
half increases at Arcata and San Jose.
Gold
Gross revenue from gold increased by 154% in H1 2016 to $180.5 million (H1 2015: $71.2 million) as a result of a 152% rise in the total amount
of gold ounces sold in H1 2016 (146.1 koz). The increase in gold sales came from sales from the new Inmaculada operation as well as
increases at Arcata and San Jose.
Gross average realised sales prices
The following table provides figures for average realised prices (which are reported before the deduction of commercial discounts and include
the effects of the existing hedging agreements) and ounces sold for H1 2016 and H1 2015:

Commercial discounts refer to refinery treatment charges, refining fees and payable deductions for processing concentrates, and are deducted
from gross revenue on a per tonne basis (treatment charge), per ounce basis (refining fees) or as a percentage of gross revenue (payable
deductions). In H1 2016, the Group recorded commercial discounts of $14.1 million (H1 2015: $12.3 million). The increase is explained by an
increase in concentrate sold from Arcata. The ratio of commercial discounts to gross revenue in H1 2016 decreased to 4% (H1 2015: 6%).
Net revenue
Net revenue increased by 78% to $339.3 million (H1 2015: $190.3 million), comprising silver revenue of $163.1 million and gold revenue of
$176.0 million. In H1 2016, silver accounted for 48% and gold 52% of the Company's consolidated net revenue with the strong increase in the
gold percentage versus H1 2015 being due to a full contribution from the primarily gold producing Inmaculada mine.

Costs
Total pre-exceptional cost of sales increased to $238.7 million in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $174.5 million). The direct production cost was $139.0
million (H1 2015: $111.7 million) with the increase due to the addition of the new Inmaculada mine since H1 2015. Depreciation in H1 2016
was $88.5 million (H1 2015: $57.0 million) with the increase mainly due to the addition of Inmaculada depreciation. Other items, which in H1
2015 principally included the costs associated with stoppages in Argentina, decreased to $(0.08) million in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $4.9 million), as
there have been no stoppages at the mine. Change in inventories was $11.3 million in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $1.0 million) with the difference
explained by finished goods from December 2015 being sold in January 2016.

Cash costs are calculated based on pre-exceptional figures. Co-product cash cost per ounce is the cash cost allocated to the primary metal
(allocation based on proportion of revenue), divided by the ounces sold of the primary metal. By-product cash cost per ounce is the total cash
cost minus revenue and commercial discounts of the by-product divided by the ounces sold of the primary metal.

Administrative expenses before exceptional items increased to $22.2 million (H1 2015: $18.8 million) primarily due to increased personnel
expenses.
Exploration expenses
In H1 2016, pre-exceptional exploration expenses were broadly flat at $4.0 million (H1 2015: $4.1 million). In addition, the Group capitalises
part of its brownfield exploration, which mostly relates to costs incurred converting potential resource to the Inferred or Measured and Indicated
category. In H1 2016, the Company capitalised $0.3 million relating to brownfield exploration compared to $0.7 million in H1 2015, bringing the
total investment in exploration for H1 2016 to $4.3 million (H1 2015: $4.8 million).
Selling expenses
Selling expenses decreased by 39% versus H1 2015 to $7.1 million (H1 2015: $11.6 million) mainly due to the elimination of export duties at
San Jose. Selling expenses in H1 2016 consisted mainly of logistic costs for the sale of concentrate in addition to approximately 1.5 months of
final export duties on concentrate. Previously, export duties in Argentina were levied at 10% of revenue for concentrate and 5% of revenue for
dore.
Other income/expenses
Other income before exceptional items was $12.9 million (H1 2015: $2.6 million). The increase is mainly due to the impact of the Patagonian
port benefit ($8.4 million) reintroduced towards the end of 2015 and incremental revenue from logistic services provided to third parties. Other
expenses before exceptional items was $6.2 million (H1 2015: $4.6 million) with the rise due to costs associated with energy contract
renegotiation and costs to reorganise land concessions.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 333% over the period to $170.3 million (H1 2015: $39.3 million) driven by the substantial positive effects of the
new low-cost Inmaculada contribution.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, net finance costs and income tax plus non-cash
items (depreciation and amortisation) and exploration expenses other than personnel and other exploration related fixed expenses.

Finance income
Finance income before exceptional items of $0.5 million was similar to H1 2015 ($0.6 million) and mainly includes interest received on
deposits.
Finance costs
Finance costs before exceptional items increased from $14.6 million in H1 2015 to $17.4 million in H1 2016 principally due to the expensing of
interest on the Senior Notes that was previously capitalised during the construction of Inmaculada in line with the IFRS standards and costs
related to the Company's precious metal hedge agreements. These effects offset the fall in interest due to the repayment of debt since H1 2015.
Foreign exchange losses
The Group recognised a foreign exchange gain of $0.4 million (H1 2015: $1.2 million loss) as a result of exposures to currencies other than the
functional currency, specifically the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and Argentinean Peso.
Income tax
The Group's pre-exceptional income tax charge was $21.4 million (H1 2015: $1.8 million). The substantial increase in the charge is explained
by the Company's significant increase in profitability in the period for reasons explained above.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items in H1 2016 totalled $1.8 million profit after tax (H1 2015: $(6.1) million). Exceptional items principally included: a $2.7 million
gain on the reversal of the mining reserve tax in Argentina in addition to the reversal of the associated interest on the reserve tax ($1.0 million);
the effect of a donation to Universidad de Ingenieria y Tecnología financed with a gain on sale of Asociación Sumac Tarpuy of ($0.2 million)
net; and a property, plant and equipment write-off of $0.5 million. These items excluded the exceptional tax effect that amounted to a $1.1
million tax charge (H1 2015: $1.3 million tax credit).

Operating cash flow increased from $18.3 million in H1 2015 to $144.6 million in H1 2016, mainly due to the cash contribution from the
Inmaculada mine. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $(54.8) million in H1 2016 from $(119.2) million in H1 2015 mainly due to
the completion of the Inmaculada mine since H1 2015. Finally, cash generated from financing activities decreased to $(70.8) million from an
inflow of $70.2 million in H1 2015 primarily due to the repayment of $65 million of debt in H1 2016 versus the raising of $75 million of short term
debt in Peru in H1 2015. As a result, total cash inflow increased from a $(30.7) million outflow in H1 2015 to $19.0 million in H1 2016 ($49.7
million difference).

The Group's working capital position improved by $93.4 million to $(60.0) million in H1 2016 from $33.3 million in H1 2015. This was primarily
explained by: lower trade and other receivables ($(33.6) million) due to VAT recoveries of $20 million in H2 2015 and $12 million in H1
2016; lower net financial assets ($21.2 million) primarily due to the hedge liability position in H1 2016 versus an asset position in H1 2015; and
higher trade and other payables and provisions ($(18.9) million).

of: the equity rights issue ($95 million) in H2 2015; the prepayment of the Scotiabank medium term loan (($100) million); the repurchase of
Senior Notes (($55) million); the repayment of pre-shipment loans ($15m) in H1 2016; the cash generated mainly in Inmaculada and the other
units; and the final cash outflow required to complete the construction of Inmaculada.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO HOCHSCHILD MINING PLC
Introduction
We have been engaged by Hochschild Mining plc (the 'Company') to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly
financial report for the six months ended  30 June 2016 which comprises the Interim condensed consolidated income statement, the Interim
condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position, the Interim
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, the Interim condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to
21. We have read the other information contained in the half yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (UK
and Ireland) "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our work, for this
report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' Responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the
half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting", as adopted by the European Union.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report
based on our review.
Scope of Review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim
Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.
A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-
yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial
Conduct Authority.

Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statement
1      Corporate Information
Hochschild Mining plc (hereinafter the "Company" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") is a public limited company incorporated on
11 April 2006 under the Companies Act 1985 as a limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 05777693.
The Company's registered office is located at 23 Hanover Square, London W1S 1JB, United Kingdom. Its ordinary shares are traded on the
London Stock Exchange.
The Group's principal business is the mining, processing and sale of silver and gold. The Group has three operating mines (Arcata, Pallancata
and Inmaculada) located in Southern Peru, and one operating mine (San Jose) located in Argentina. The Group also has a portfolio of projects
located across Peru, Argentina, Mexico and Chile at various stages of development.
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements were approved for issue on behalf of the Board of Directors on 15 August 2016.
2      Significant Accounting Policies
(a)      Basis of preparation
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements set out the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015
and its financial performance and cash flows for the six months ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015.
They have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the European Union. Accordingly, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all
the information required for full annual financial statements and therefore, should be read in conjunction with the Group's 2015 annual
consolidated financial statements as published in the 2015 Annual Report.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in the Companies Act 2006.  The
financial information for the full year is based on the statutory accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2015.  A copy of the statutory
accounts for that year, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union has been delivered to the Registrar of
Companies. The auditor's report under section 495 of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to those accounts was unmodified and did not include
a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report and did not contain a statement
under s498(2) or s498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The impact of the seasonality or cyclicality of operations is not regarded as significant on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars ($) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest
thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.
(b)      Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those
followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, except for the
adoption of new standards and interpretations effective for the Group from 1 January 2016, which has not had a material impact on the annual
consolidated financial statements or the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted
any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
(c)      Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed set of financial
statements. For further detail refer to the detailed discussion of the assumptions outlined in the Going Concern section of the announcement.
3      Segment reporting
The following tables present revenue and profit/(loss) information for the Group's operating segments for the six months ended 30 June 2016
and 2015 and asset information as at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015 respectively:

The pre-exceptional tax charge for the period was US$21,424,000 (2015: US$1,777,000).
1.     In 2016 mainly due to the decrease on capitalisation of tax losses in Peru. In 2015, the charge primarily originated as result of a decrease
in the US dollar value of the Group's Peruvian Nuevo Sol and Argentine Peso-denominated tax bases, due to the devaluation of these
currencies relative to the US dollar in the period.
The tax related to items charged or credited to equity is as follows:

13   Financial instruments
Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or
indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

Valuation techniques:
Level 2: Commodity swap and zero cost collars contracts
Commodity swap and zero cost collars contracts: Contracts entered into to hedge against the risk of commodity price fluctuations. These
contracts are valued using a commonly accepted methodology which makes maximum use of market inputs such as quoted market prices and
discount rates.
Level 3: Embedded derivatives and equity shares of Pembrook Mining Corp.
Embedded derivatives: Sales of concentrate and certain gold and silver volumes are provisionally priced at the time the sale is recorded. The
price is then adjusted after an agreed period of time (usually linked to the length of time it takes for the smelter to refine and sell the concentrate
or for the refiner to process the dore into gold and silver), with the Group either paying or receiving the difference between the provisional price
and the final price. This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative in accordance with IAS 39 'Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement'. The gain or loss that arises on the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded in 'Revenue' (note 4). The
selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a
non-observable input to this valuation.
Equity shares: The investments in unlisted shares (Pembrook Mining Corp. and ECI Exploration and Mining Inc.) were recognised at cost less
any recognised impairment losses given that there is not an active market for these investments. The investments in ECI Exploration and
Mining Inc. and Pembrook Mining Corp. are fully impaired as at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015, based on available observable market
data of similar peers.

20   Commitments
a)        Mining rights purchase options
During the ordinary course of business, the Group enters into agreements to carry out exploration under concessions held by third parties. 
Generally, under the terms of these agreements, the Group has the option to acquire the concession or invest in the entity holding the
concession.  In order to exercise the option the Group must satisfy certain financial and other obligations over the agreement term.  The option
lapses in the event that the Group does not meet the financial requirements.  At any point in time, the Group may cancel the agreements without
penalty, except in certain specific circumstances.
The Group continually reviews its requirements under the agreements and determines on an annual basis whether to proceed with the financial
commitment. Based on management's current intention regarding these projects, the commitments at the balance sheet date are as follows:
As at
30 June 2016 US$000
